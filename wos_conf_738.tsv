The IGBT were subjected to thermal over-stress tests using a transistor test board until device latch-up. The collector-emitter current, transistor case temperature, transient and steady state gate voltages, and transient and steady state collector-emitter voltages were monitored in-situ during the test. Pre- and post-aging characterization tests were performed on the IGBT. The aged parts were observed to have shifts in capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements as a result or trapped charge in the gate oxide. The collector-emitter ON voltage V-CE(ON) showed a reduction with aging. The reduction in the V-CE(ON) was found to be correlated to die attach degradation, as observed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) analysis. The collector-emitter voltage, and transistor turn-off time were observed to be precursor parameters to latch-up. The monitoring of these precursor parameters will enable the development of a prognostic methodology for IGBT failure. The prognostic methodology will involve trending precursor data, and using physics of failure models for prediction of the remaining useful life of these devices.

S	Yao, B			AAC; AAC	Yao, B			Integrated direct/indirect adaptive robust control of SISO nonlinear systems in semi-strict feedback form	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2003 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-6	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual American Control Conference (ACC 2003)	JUN 04-06, 2003-2006	DENVER, CO	Amer Automat Control Council, IFAC			MOTION CONTROL; MANIPULATORS; PERFORMANCE	The paper focuses on the synthesis of adaptive robust controllers that achieve not only excellent output tracking performance but also accurate parameter estimations for secondary purposes such as machine health monitoring and prognostics. Such an objective is accomplished through an intelligent integration of the output tracking performance oriented direct adaptive robust control (DARC) design with the recently proposed accurate parameter estimation based indirect adaptive robust control (IARC) design. SISO nonlinear systems transformable to semi-strict feedback forms are considered. Theoretically, regardless of the specific estimation algorithm to be used, certain guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy are achieved even in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities-a desirable feature in applications. In addition, the theoretical performance of adaptive designs-asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties only-is preserved. The construction of physical parameter estimation law is based on the actual system dynamics and totally independent from the design of underline robust control law, which allows various estimation algorithms having better parameter convergence properties and practical modifications such as the on-line explicit monitoring of signal excitation levels to be used to significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting parameter estimates in implementation.

The proposed scheme consists of three main components including principal component analysis (PCA), hidden Markov model (HMM), and an adaptive stochastic fault prediction model. The principal signal features extracted by PCA are utilized by HMM to generate a component health/degradation index, which is the input to an adaptive prognostics component for on-line remaining useful life prediction. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown by simulation studies using experimental vibration data obtained from a bearing health monitoring testbed.

Accurate RUL estimation plays a critical role in Prognostics and Health Management(PHM). Data driven approaches for RUL estimation use sensor data and operational data to estimate RUL. Traditional regression based approaches and recent Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach use features created from sliding windows to build models. However, sequence information is not fully considered in these approaches. Sequence learning models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have flaws when modeling sequence information. HMMs are limited to discrete hidden states and are known to have issues when modeling long-term dependencies in the data. RNNs also have issues with long-term dependencies. In this work, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor sequence information and expose hidden patterns within sensor data with multiple operating conditions, fault and degradation models. Extensive experiments using three widely adopted Prognostics and Health Management data sets show that LSTM for RUL estimation significantly outperforms traditional approaches for RUL estimation as well as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

It's so easy to be damaged that it can cause mechanical fault. Thus, it is significant to study fault diagnosis technology on rolling bearing. In this paper, three deep neural network models (Deep Boltzmann Machines, Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Auto-Encoders) are employed to identify the fault condition of rolling bearing. Four preprocessing schemes including feature of time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain are discussed. One data set with seven fault patterns is collected to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, which is based on the health condition of a rotating mechanical system. The results proved that the accuracy achieved by Deep Boltzmann Machines, Deep Belief Networks and Stacked Auto-Encoders are highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.

J	Aenis, M; Knopf, E; Nordmann, R				Aenis, M; Knopf, E; Nordmann, R			Active magnetic bearings for the identification and fault diagnosis in turbomachinery	MECHATRONICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st IFAC Conference on Mechatronic Systems	SEP 18-20, 2000	DARMSTADT, GERMANY	IFAC		magnetic bearings; force measurement; dynamics; frequency responses; diagnosis		Active magnetic bearings, a typical mechatronic product, have been successfully applied in industrial turbomachinery. Their main advantages are the contactless working principle,the frictionless suspension, and that they represent an active system. Therefore, the active magnetic bearings are well suited to operate contactless as actuator and sensor elements in rotating machinery. The aim of the presented projects of the Special Research Program (SFB 241) supported by the German Research Council (DFG) is to use active magnetic bearings as an identification and diagnosis tool for turbomachines. The identification and diagnosis procedures are. based on frequency response functions. For this type of diagnosis using transfer functions, an accurate force measurement is crucial. The paper compares force measurement results and achievable accuracies of a radial magnetic bearing using different measurement techniques over a large operating range. Furthermore, a state-space model of the entire mechatronic system is developed to facilitate the diagnosis procedure. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Observers are filters based on physical models of machine-fault combinations and use measured machine signatures to identify and characterize the state of a machine. Observers are adaptively deployed as a machine wears and can be coupled with one another to handle interacting conditions and faults. The scheme is detailed using the fault of a cracked rotor shaft that interacts with gravity and imbalance. Observers for shaft cracking and imbalance are presented. The observers provide machine condition and fault strengths to life models used to determine remaining machine life. A life model based on the Forman crack growth law of linear elastic fracture mechanics is developed to determine the number of machine cycles remaining until catastrophic failure.

If the objective is fault detection, an inappropriate execution order might reveal most faults late, thus delaying the bug fixing activity and eventually the delivery of the software. Prioritizing the test cases so as to optimize the achievement of the testing goal has potentially a positive impact on the testing costs, especially when the test execution time is long. Test engineers often possess relevant knowledge about the relative priority of the test cases. However this knowledge can be hardly expressed in the form of a global ranking or scoring. In this paper, we propose a test case prioritization technique that takes advantage of user knowledge through a machine learning algorithm, Case-Based Ranking (CBR). CBR elicits just relative priority information from the user, in the form of pair wise test case comparisons. User input is integrated with multiple prioritization indexes, in an iterative process that successively refines the test case ordering. Preliminary results on a case study indicate that CBR overcomes previous approaches and, for moderate suite size, gets very close to the optimal solution.

Besides, degradation modeling only depending on historical capacity data will cause a large prediction error in the long term. Actually, some parameters can be monitored, such as the duration of equal discharging voltage difference, the interval of equal charging voltage difference at different experiment cycles, also exhibit a degradation trend. In order to make more accurate SOH and remaining useful life (RUL) estimations of an on-line operating battery, in this paper, the relevance vector machine (RVM) is applied to quantify the relationship between those monitoring parameters and capacity data. Based on the deduced model, the capacity could be extrapolated with the corresponding monitoring parameters. Moreover, feature vector selection (FVS) is used to remove redundant points in the input data. It improves the sparsity of relevance vectors (RVs) and decreases the memory-consuming. In the end, Battery degradation datasets from NASA demonstrated the approach has good RUL prediction accuracy, higher sparsity compared to RVM.

This paper proposed an improved unscented particle filter (IUPF) method for lithium-ion battery RUL prediction based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method uses the MCMC to solve the problem of sample impoverishment in UPF algorithm. Additionally, the IUPF method is proposed on the basis of UPF, so it can also suppress the particle degradation existing in the standard PF algorithm. In this work, the IUPF method is introduced firstly. Then, the capacity data of lithium-ion batteries are collected and the empirical capacity degradation model is established. The proposed method is used to estimate the RUL of lithium-ion battery. The RUL prediction results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The approach is especially suitable for situations in which abundant run-to-failure data for an engineered system are available. Data from multiple units of the same system are used to create a library of degradation patterns. When estimating the RUL of a test unit, the data from it will be matched to those patterns in the library and the actual life of those matched units will be used as the basis of estimation. This approach is used to tackle the data challenge problem defined by the 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition, in which, run-to-failure data of an unspecified engineered system are provided and the RUL of a set of test units will be estimated. Results show that the similarity-based approach is very effective in performing RUL estimation.

A Novel, Fast, Reliable Data Transmission Algorithm for Wireless Machine Health Monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Data compression; empirical mode decomposition; machine health monitoring; wireless communication	HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ECG SIGNAL COMPRESSION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Vibration-based machine health monitoring is a well-known technique that is commonly used in machine fault diagnosis applications. In conjunction with existing wireless technologies, even machines that are operated in a hazardous or moveable environment can be monitored wirelessly. However, to facilitate a reliable machine health assessment, various sensory data, particularly the vibration signals, must be acquired at a high sampling rate, generating large packets of data. These requirements are impractical in a wireless data transmission context due to the usual low transmission rate, and lengthy transmission time. One possible solution is to compress the captured numerous sensory data before wireless transmission commences. This paper presents a novel data compression algorithm that combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM). EMD is effective in decomposing and identifying any instantaneous changes in non-linear, and non-stationary signals that are caused by anomalous operation of machines. After the data have been decomposed and compressed by EMD, the DPCM is applied to further compress the data through the use of linear predictor and quantizer prior to wireless transmission. A pair of Bluetooth based wireless devices was tailor-made to host the EMD and DPCM for performing wireless communication. The effectiveness of the new algorithm has been verified using real machines, operating in a noisy environment. The results prove that the algorithm provides much faster wireless data transmission by significantly reducing the size of sensory data. Nevertheless, it maintains the integrity of sensory data with negligible reconstruction error at the receiving end of the wireless device.

The main idea of transfer learning is to utilize selective auxiliary data to assist target data classification, where a weight adjustment between them is involved in the TrAdaBoost algorithm for enhanced diagnostic capability. In addition, negative transfer is avoided through the similarity judgment, thus improving accuracy and relaxing computational load of the presented approach. Experimental comparison between transfer learning and traditional machine learning has verified the superiority of the proposed algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis.

Its role in cancer is controversial because autophagy can be either protective or destructive to tumor cells, depending on individual genetic signatures and treatment conditions. Hypoxia is common in solid tumors, correlating with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. We have detected autophagic cell death in hypoxic cancer cells occuring independently of apoptosis through a mechanism involving the hypoxia-inducible protein, Bcl-2/E1B-nineteen kilodalton interacting protein (BNIP3). Loss of BNIP3 was protective against hypoxia-induced autophagy and cell death. Unexpectedly, BNIP3 ablation also caused differential cell cycle progression in vitro and increased cellularity in vivo. Collectively, these results support the emerging theory that autophagy could be effectively targeted as an alternative cell death pathway in hypoxic and/or apoptosis-resistant tumors. Furthermore, our data suggest that BNIP3 may be a potential target molecule in this pathway.

First, the derived method calculates frequency spectrums of raw signals, and the fused frequency spectrums are calculated by the multi-sensor data fusion. Then, a deep learning based recognition model that can estimate the degradation condition of ball screw automatically is established with the fused dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using dataset collected from the degradation test of ball screw. The dataset contains massive samples involving 7 degradation stages under 9 working conditions by 3 accelerometers. The classification results indicate that the proposed DBN-based method is able to mine intrinsic characteristics from the fused frequency spectrums adaptively and obtain a superior recognition accuracy. Finally, two comparative studies are performed to show the advantage of the proposed DBN-based method in ball screw degradation condition recognition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data-Driven Prognostics Based on Health Indicator Construction: Application to PRONOSTIA's Data	2013 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 17-19, 2013	ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	European Control Assoc, IFAC, IEEE, CSS	ETH Zurich		OPPORTUNITIES; DIAGNOSTICS; CHALLENGES; SYSTEMS	Failure prognostics can help improving the availability and reliability of industrial systems while reducing their maintenance cost. The main purpose of failure prognostics is the anticipation of the time of a failure by estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In this case, the fault is not undergone and the estimated RUL can be used to take appropriate decisions depending on the future exploitation of the industrial system. This paper presents a data-driven prognostic method based on the utilization of signal processing techniques and regression models. The method is applied on accelerated degradations of bearings performed under the experimental platform called PRONOSTIA. The purpose of the proposed method is to generate a health indicator, which will be used to calculate the RUL. Two acceleration sensors are used on PRONOSTIA platform to monitor the degradation evolution of the tested bearings. The vibration signals related to the degraded bearings are then compared to a nominal vibration signal of a nondegraded bearing (nominal bearing). The comparison between the signals is done by calculating a correlation coefficient (which is considered as the health indicator). The values of the calculated correlation coefficient are then fitted to a regression model which is used to estimate the RUL.

The method is based on a theory that views damage as occurring in a hierarchical dynamical system where slowly evolving, hidden failure processes are causing nonstationarity in a fast, directly observable system. The damage variable tracking is based on statistics calculated using data-based local linear models constructed in the reconstructed phase space of the fast system. These statistics are designed to measure a local change in the fast systems flow caused by the slowtime failure processes. The method is applied to a mathematical model of an experimental electromechanical system consisting of a beam vibrating in a potential field crated by two electromagnets. Two failure modes are introduced through discharging batteries supplying power to these electromagnets. Open circuit terminal voltage of these batteries is a two-dimensional damage variable. Using computer simulations, it is demonstrated both analytically and experimentally that the proposed method can accurately track both damage variables using only a displacement measurements from the vibrating beam. The accurate estimates of remaining time to failure for each battery are given well ahead of actual breakdowns.

ANALYTICS; MODEL; RISK	This work presents the evolution of a solution for predictive maintenance to a Big Data environment. The proposed adaptation aims for predicting failures on wind turbines using a data-driven solution deployed in the cloud and which is composed by three main modules. (i) A predictive model generator which generates predictive models for each monitored wind turbine by means of Random Forest algorithm. (ii) A monitoring agent that makes predictions every 10 minutes about failures in wind turbines during the next hour. Finally, (iii) a dashboard where given predictions can be visualized. To implement the solution Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Mesos and HDFS have been used. Therefore, we have improved the previous work in terms of data process speed, scalability and automation. In addition, we have provided fault-tolerant functionality with a centralized access point from where the status of all the wind turbines of a company localized all over the world can be monitored, reducing O&M costs.

Traditional binary-state characterization (i.e., normal and failure) on system health condition may not provide accurate information for maintenance scheduling, and the multi-state classification for degradation process is a necessary step to realize cost-effective condition based maintenance. Support vector machine (SVM) is a useful technique for system condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, the SVM classification accuracy of deteriorating system is usually poor, because characteristics of different degradation states may not be very distinctive. This paper presented an improved support vector machine for system degradation classification and evaluation. The core of the proposed method can be summarized as: an improved voting scheme in one against-one SVM, and an optimization of classification process by utilizing inherent physical property of system state transition. A case study of cooling fan bearing accelerated life time test is conducted to obtain the experimental data, and a comparison before and after optimization shows that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy.

In order to ensure its safety and reliability, it is critical to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of EMAs. The data-driven RUL prediction can be implemented by utilizing Gaussian process regression (GPR) due to its uncertainty representation and nonlinear modeling capability. In order to enhance the stability and achieve high precision of EMA RUL prediction, a weighted bagging GPR (WB_GPR) algorithm is presented in this work, in which ensemble learning is utilized. To be specific, the degradation features for EMA RUL prediction are analyzed and the parameters which can represent the degradation process and health status of EMAs are selected. Then the data-driven framework which estimates the RUL of EMAs is implemented with the proposed WB_GPR algorithm. Finally the RUL prediction performance based on WB_GPR is validated by utilizing the sensor data sets. Furthermore, the RUL prediction comparison with GPR and bagging GPR is also conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that the WB_GPR is superior in the RUL prediction with lower error rate and standard deviation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is necessary to develop a reliable and accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction approach to provide timely maintenance or replacement of battery systems. A fusion RUL prediction approach based on Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is proposed in this paper. In the fusion prediction approach, DBN is responsible for extracting features from the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries, and RVM takes the extracted features as input to provide RUL prediction. The CALCE battery datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that, compared with standard DBN and RVM, the proposed method has higher accuracy, more stable and reliable performance for lithium-ion batteries RUL prediction.

Therefore, accurate, reliable and effective fault diagnosis must be performed. However, the current airborne fuel pump has several difficulties: fault samples shortage, high maintenance costs and low diagnostic efficiency. In this paper, after Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) of airborne fuel pump, an experimental platform of airborne fuel transfusion system is developed and then a fault diagnosis model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and probabilistic neural networks (PNN) is established. Meanwhile, the diagnosis model is verified by practical experiments, and the sensor layout of the experimental platform is optimized. Firstly, the vibration signals and pressure signals under normal state and six types of typical fuel pump faults are acquired on the experimental platform. Then EMD method is applied to decompose the original vibration signals into a finite Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a residual. Secondly, the energy of first four IMFs is extracted as vibration signals fault feature, combined with the mean outlet pressure to construct fault feature vectors. Then feature vectors are divided into training samples and testing samples. Training samples are used to train PNN fault diagnosis model and testing samples are used to verify the model. Finally, the experimental results show that only one pressure sensor and one y-axis vibration sensor are needed to achieve 100% fault diagnosis. Furthermore, compared with SVM and GA-BP, the PNN fault diagnosis model has fast convergence, high efficiency and a higher performance and recognition for the typical faults of airborne fuel pump.

One class of method in system condition monitoring is based on the condition data (i.e., data-driven methodology). However, not all the collected condition data can be utilized for the data-driven methodology. Hence, the selection of reasonable condition data is crucial for the application of the data-driven methodology. This is especially useful for the system which has the characteristics of degradation. In such system, the condition data that have the increasing or decreasing trend are desirable. This article proposes the quantitative selection of sensor data for system remaining useful life prediction. The main advantage of the proposed metric to select sensors is that the information theory is adopted. Hence, the selection of sensors can be determined by the proposed quantitative metric. Two case studies which include one simulation data set and one practical data set are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The detailed experiments prove the advantage of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Indeed, it seems an interesting solution to help taking actions that will extend their lifetime. PEMFC are promising solution for combined heat and power generation (MU,CHP). As power suppliers, they cannot afford running to failure. This work presents a prognostics application on a PEMFC following a mu,CHP profile. A critical issue with such a mission profile is to be able to model the variation of the power demand. So a key point of this work is the presentation of a model introducing the time dependency of the mission profile as well as the degradations of different inner components of the PEMFC. This model starts from a classical polarization expression transformed based on a detailed understanding of the degradation phenomena and the introduction of time-varying parameters. This model is able to follow accurately the behavior of the PEMFC during its functioning. It is then used to perform prognostics and predict the future behavior of the stack with a particle filter-based framework. The results are very encouraging as the behavior predictions are accurate, with a low uncertainty and an horizon as great as thirty days.

Four longitudinal experiments were conducted with a simplified but representative thermal-hydraulic process simulation. These experiments investigated the impact of four behaviour-shaping constraints that can influence operator adaptation: interface content, interface form, type of training, and pre-existing competencies. The findings obtained from the research program are summarized, and a number of implications for the design and operation of process-control systems are suggested.

Since early detection and measurement of an observable damage marker in composite is very difficult, the proposed framework is established based on identifying and then monitoring "indirect damage indicators". Dynamic Bayesian Network is utilized to integrate relevant damage models with any available monitoring data as well as other influential parameters. As the damage evolution process in composites is not fully explored, a technique consisting of extended Particle Filtering and Support Vector Regression is implemented to simultaneously estimate the damage model parameters as well as damage states in the presence of multiple measurements. The method is then applied to predict the time to failure of the component.

Power MOSFETs are widely used as essential components of electronic and electrical subsystems and its degradation has got more and more attention. This paper introduces a prognostic method which based on relevance vector machine and a degradation model to predict the RUL of power MOSFET. The proposed method uses relevance vector machine to find the relevance vectors. And then use relevance vectors to find the representative vectors. The degradation model is obtained by fitting the representative vectors. Then the RUL of power MOSFETs can be estimated by extrapolating the degradation model to a failure threshold. In the prediction process, we will update the degradation model when the difference of the predictive value and measured value exceeds the predefined value. The results show that the proposed method can provide better RUL estimation accuracy for power MOSFETs.

This paper addresses and proposes a systematic analysis for this issue based on the system sensitivity theory. The results from this study provide a guideline in choosing the optimal location to pick-up signals for residual generation in a closed-loop control system for FDI. The results have been verified by both computer simulation and a real-time implementation on a lab-scale electric machine system.

A novel optimization deep belief network (DBN) in this study has been proposed for a closed-loop single-ended primary-inductance converter (SEPIC) fault diagnosis. Firstly, the wavelet packet decomposition technique is used to extract the energy values from voltage signals of four circuit nodes, as the fault feature vectors. Then, a four-layer DBN architecture including input and output layers is developed. Meanwhile, neuron numbers of the two hidden layers are selected by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and training data. Finally, eleven fault modes such as power MOSFET, inductance, diode and capacitor open circuit faults (OCFs) and short circuit faults (SCFs) are isolated by PSO-DBN. Compared with other intelligent diagnostic method such as back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM), experiment results show that the proposed method has a higher classification accuracy rate which means its effectiveness and superiority.

Amongst these algorithms, Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MC-SVM) has gained popularity due to its relatively high classification accuracy, ability to classify multiple patterns and capability to handle noisy /incomplete data. However, its application is limited by the difficulty in determining the required kernel function and penalty parameters. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid differential evolution - particle swarm optimization (DE-PSO) algorithm to optimize the MC-SVM kernel function and penalty parameters. The differential algorithm (DE) obtains the search limit for the SVM parameters, while the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) determines the global optimum parameters for a given training data set. Since degrading machinery components display several degradation stages in their lifetime, the MC-SVM trained with optimum parameters are used to estimate the health states of a degrading machinery component, from which the remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted. This method improves the classification accuracy of MC-SVM in predicting the health states of a machinery component and consequently increases the accuracy of RUL predictions. The feasibility of the method is validated using bearing prognostic run-to-failure data obtained from NASA public data repository. A comparative study between MC-SVM with parameters obtained using simple grid search with n-fold cross validation and MC-SVM with DE-PSO based on prognostic performance metrics reveals that the proposed method has better performance, with all the cases considered falling within a 10 % error margin. The method also outperforms other soft computing methods proposed in literature.

Most traditional features are effective only when the gearbox is under stationary operating condition. Some features which are modified based on the traditional features are no longer sensitive to load changes and remain sensitive to fault propagation. However, it is only permit the load changing in a very small range. In engineering applications, some machines usually work in a non-stationary operating condition; both speed and load are varying over a wide range (e.g. wind turbine). So, in order to solve this dilemma, we propose using the energy ratio between residual signal and deterministic periodic signal which is separated by autoregressive model as the condition indicator for fault diagnosis and prognosis. The effectiveness of this feature is demonstrated and compared to other traditional features using two run-to-failure data sets of gearbox collected in laboratory.

In the centralized scheme, the information from several sources is combined to construct an input space. In the distributed schemes, the input space is constructed corresponding to each information source and the multi-class support vector machine is used for modeling each source. The distributed data fusion strategies are applied to combine these multi-class support vector machine models. It is taken into account that a SVM classifier realizes classification by finding the optimal classification hyperplane with maximal margin. The proposed methods are demonstrated with the fault diagnosis of a diesel engine. The experimental results show that most of the proposed approaches can largely improve the diagnostic accuracy. The robustness of diagnosis is also improved.

To ensure the system safety and reliability, many conventional model based fault diagnosis methods have been proposed. However, with the increase in the complexity and uncertainty of engineering system, it is not feasible to establish accurate mathematical models most of the time. Rotating machinery, due to the complexity in its mechanical structure and transmission mechanics, is within this category. Thus, data-driven method is required for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis scheme based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed. With the available data measurement signals from multiple sensors in the system, both spatial and temporal dependencies can be utilized to detect the fault and classify the corresponding fault types. A hardware experimental study on wind turbine drivetrain diagnostics simulator (WTDDS) is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

This paper uses Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build a model for non-stationary time series prediction. And it proves that the EMD-SVR method can solve the problem of few training samples in modeling the path of performance degradation. Then when the threshold is given, we can forecast the lifetime of engineering systems based on the performance degradation data.

RUL can differ for similar components operating under the same conditions. Working with such problem, one needs to contend with many uncertainty sources such as system, model and sensory noise. To do that, proposed models should include such uncertainties and represent the belief about the system's state in a probabilistic form. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed for predicting the RUL of critical components. The approach is divided into two main parts, online and offline. In the offline part, the approach builds k-nearest neighbours classifier (kNN) for different datasets according to their end of life (EOL) values. On the other hand, the online part is similar to the offline apart from the use of Bayesian online state estimator. Bayesian online state estimator is used to represent the uncertainty of the approach about the health status. The approach starts by extracting trends that represent the health evolution of the critical component and uses these trends to build offline models of the critical component. Then, the approach uses these models to predict the RUL from new online data and assigning uncertainty value to it. The approach can be applied to a system with variable operating conditions, however, the prediction horizon will span between the minimum and maximum RUL values available in the training dataset.

For deployment of a PHM system successfully, A key step is prognosis certification. This calls for a set of performance metrics that not only evaluate key aspects of predicting into the future but also integrate notions from practical aspects such as reliability, safety, mission criticality, logistics, economic viability, etc. In order to standardize the prognostics evaluation, this paper conducts the related research as follows: firstly, the detail requirement including user requirements and technical requirements is presented to indicate the objective of prognostics evaluation; secondly, the correlative metrics are listed after the functional classification of prognostics metrics; based on the study mentioned above, a general evaluation flow for prognostics performance is designed in succession; at last, the issue from assessing the prognostics performance is discussed to help standardize subsequent developments.

The advancements in battery technologies played a crucial part for this trend. However, no matter what the advancements are, all batteries have a fixed capacity and after some time drain out. In order to extend the flying time window, the prediction of the time that the battery will no longer be able to support a flying condition is crucial. This in fact can be cast as a standard Remaining Useful Life prognostic problem, similarly encountered in many fields. In this article, the problem of Remaining Useful Life estimation of a battery, under different flight conditions, is tackled using four machine learning techniques: a linear sparse model, a variant of support vector regression, a multilayer perceptron and an advanced tree based algorithm. The efficiency of the overall proposed machine learning techniques, in the field of batteries prognostics, is evaluated based on multiple experimental data from different flight conditions.

Because of this, condition monitoring is employed to assess the status of the system in real-time. However, the condition of the system is usually not considered explicitly when finding the optimal operation strategy. Instead, operational constraints on flow rates, pressures etc., based on worst-case scenarios, are imposed. This can lead to unnecessarily restrained operation and significant economic losses. To avoid sub-optimal operation, we propose to integrate diagnostics and prognostics with the optimal decision making process for operation to obtain an operational strategy which is optimal subject to the expected system degradation. This allows us to proactively steer the system degradation, rather than simply reacting to it. We use the operation of a subsea gas compressor subject to bearing degradation as a case example.

Prognostics can assist diagnosis by assessing the current health of a system and predicting its remaining life based on features that capture the gradual degradation in a system's operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Unlike fault diagnosis, prognosis is a relatively new area, but it has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be attuned to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven or model-based. Each has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A approach hybrid model can combine some or all model types (data-driven, and phenomenological); thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. This approach is especially relevant in railway systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms, but the complexity of the infrastructure and rolling stock is huge that there is no way to develop a complete model-based approach. Therefore, hybrid models are extremely useful for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of railway systems. The paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a hybrid model to get RUL values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of railway assets can be managed and optimised.

CBM is a maintenance strategy based on collecting information concerning the working condition of equipment, such as vibration intensity, temperature, pressure, etc., related to the system degradation or status in order to prevent its failure and to determine the optimal maintenance. Prognosis is an important part of CBM. Different methodologies can be used to perform prognosis and can be classified as: model-based or data-driven. Model-based methods use physical models of the process or statistical estimation methods based on state observers, to this approach belong Kalman filters, particle filters, etc. On the other hand, data-driven methods only makes use of the available monitoring data which to train a learning algorithm. In this paper a data-driven approach is presented to detect abnormal behaviours in industrial equipment. The suggested approach combines two multivariate analysis techniques: principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). With PCA the most important contributors to characterize the condition of the equipment are found. Next, PLS is used to predict the system state and detect abnormal behaviour. This behaviour can lead to perform maintenance tasks. Finally, an example of application to an asynchronous generator is presented.

S	Daigle, M; Saha, B; Goebel, K			IEEE	Daigle, Matthew; Saha, Bhaskar; Goebel, Kai			A Comparison of Filter-based Approaches for Model-based Prognostics	2012 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2012	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, Phmsoc, AESS				Model-based prognostics approaches use domain knowledge about a system and its failure modes through the use of physics-based models. Model-based prognosis is generally divided into two sequential problems: a joint state-parameter estimation problem, in which, using the model, the health of a system or component is determined based on the observations; and a prediction problem, in which, using the model, the state-parameter distribution is simulated forward in time to compute end of life and remaining useful life. The first problem is typically solved through the use of a state observer, or filter. The choice of filter depends on the assumptions that may be made about the system, and on the desired algorithm performance. In this paper, we review three separate filters for the solution to the first problem: the Daum filter, an exact nonlinear filter; the unscented Kalman filter, which approximates nonlinearities through the use of a deterministic sampling method known as the unscented transform; and the particle filter, which approximates the state distribution using a finite set of discrete, weighted samples, called particles. Using a centrifugal pump as a case study, we conduct a number of simulation-based experiments investigating the performance of the different algorithms as applied to prognostics.

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of learners that are both accurate and diverse. In the training stage, we use the Adaboost. R2 technique to train several weak learners (multi layer perceptron network-MLP) to increase the diversity of the individual models. In the prediction stage, we focus on the design of the fusion of the weak learner ensemble. In contrast with the traditional static weight a location method based on the over all data set, we propose a dynamic weight allocation method, based on the performance of an individual weak learner on the subset. The idea be hind this method was to use a test sample's neighbors to estimate the accuracy and bias of the individual weak learner when the learner is used to make the prediction. An improved hyperrectangle neighborhood defining method is proposed in this paper. Some experiments using MLP neural network as a weak learner on a NASA turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset were carried out. The preliminary empirical comparisons showed higher performance of the novel ensemble learning methodology for the R UL estimation of engineering systems.

Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in. There are however some challenges in keeping up with the ever-increasing pace of the development. For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system. Some of the concepts that are presented in this paper have yet to be implemented during 2018. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

However, strong noise severely influences the accurate detection of incipient faults. Thanks to the ability of enhancing weak input and suppressing the noise, the stochastic resonance (SR) has been applied to weak signal detection in some fields, and the improvement on its performance are still being concerned, especially in the mechanical engineering. For multi-frequency weak signals, this paper proposes an improved mechanism for the SR, called multi-segment cascaded stochastic resonance (MS-CSR). In this method, the input signal obtains segment enhancement by using some bistable SR models, and series connection of such a unit compose an improved cascaded SR (CSR) system, which can not only gradually enhance the weak signals of interest, but also pay more attention on the signal with relatively small amplitude at the initial. A modified measurement index, named alliance signal-to-noise ratio (ASNR) is defined to evaluate the detection performance of the proposed SR method, as well as the parameter selection for the MS CSR system. In this index, a weight factor is introduced to influence the assignment of noise energy in the SR, so that the relatively weak signal in the multi-frequency input signal can obtain a high priority to make the resonance phenomenon happen and avoid the misdiagnosis. A simulated signal and an experimental vibration signal collected from a faulty bearing are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed MS-CSR method. The results demonstrate that the MS-CSR is a useful tool for detecting weak signals with multiple characteristic frequencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, a fusion prognostics method combining exponential model and relevance vector machine (RVM) has been proposed and applied to the RUL prediction of bearings. This fusion prognostics method integrates the advantages of RVM and exponential model and so has better prediction performance than other exponential model-based methods. However, selecting the appropriate value of kernel parameter is very difficult for this fusion prognostics method because of the lack of an explicit prior knowledge. which reduces the prediction accuracy of the fusion prognostics method and affects its generalization performance. To solve this problem, an improved fusion prognostics method is proposed in this paper. In the improved fusion prognostics method, RVM regressions with different kernel parameter values are first applied to obtaining different sparse datasets. Then, using the exponential model of bearing degradation, the different degradation curves are got by fitting the obtained sparse datasets and the Frechet distance is employed to select the optimum degradation curve from those fitted curves. Finally, the RUL is predicted by extrapolating the selected degradation curve to reach the failure threshold. To verify the superiority of the proposed method compared with the original fusion prognostics method, a real bearing degradation data is used for the RUL prediction. The results show that the improved fusion prognostics method outperforms the original fusion prognostics method in the RUL prediction of bearings.

To complicate matters, Li-ion batteries can experience different degradation trajectories that depend on storage and cycling history of the application environment. Rates of degradation are controlled by factors such as temperature history, electrochemical operating window, and charge/discharge rate. We present a generalized battery life prognostic model framework for battery systems design and control. The model framework consists of trial functions that are statistically regressed to Li-ion cell life datasets wherein the cells have been aged under different levels of stress. Degradation mechanisms and rate laws dependent on temperature, storage, and cycling condition are regressed to the data, with multiple model hypotheses evaluated and the best model down-selected based on statistics. The resulting life prognostic model, implemented in state variable form, is extensible to arbitrary real-world scenarios.

Data mining presents an opportunity to increase significantly the rate at which the volume of data can be turned into useful information. This paper presents an architecture designed to gather data generated in industrial units on their maintenance activities, and to forecast future failures based on data analysis. Rapid Miner is used to apply different data mining prediction algorithms to maintenance data and compare their accuracy in the discovery of patterns and predictions. The tool is integrated with an online system which collects data using automatic agents and presents all the results to the maintenance teams. The purpose of the prediction algorithms is to forecast future values based on present records, in order to estimate the possibility of a machine breakdown and therefore to support maintenance teams in planning appropriate maintenance interventions.

However, almost all of the existing remaining useful life prediction methods were implemented under the premise that the deteriorating systems were not maintained over the whole life cycle. For the deteriorating systems experiencing maintenance activities during their life profiles, this paper presents a simulation-based remaining useful life prediction method taking the influence of maintenance activities into account. Specifically, the Wiener process with jumps is employed to model the degradation path of a deteriorating system, where the jump parts are used to characterize the influence of maintenance activities on the system degradation. The parameters in the degradation model are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method. To acquire the remaining useful life distributions of the deteriorating system, we design a simulation-based algorithm on the basis of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. Accordingly, the interested statistics associated with the remaining useful life can be obtained numerically. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the implementation of the newly proposed remaining useful life prediction method.

Robust Fault Tolerant Application for HVAC System Based on Combination of online SVM and ANN Black Box Model	2013 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 17-19, 2013	ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	European Control Assoc, IFAC, IEEE, CSS	ETH Zurich		SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DIAGNOSIS	Efficient heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the big challenges today around the world. The fault detection and isolation (FDI) play a significant role in the monitoring, repairing and maintaining of technical systems for the final destination of cost reduction. FDI makes it possible to reduce total cost effective of maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment. Reduction of energy wasting in the system by on time fault detection is another goal. Therefore, this work proposes a new fault detector based on a black box Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and online support vector machines (SVM) classifier which integrates a dimension reduction scheme to analyze the failure of air fan supply and dampers fault. The key advantage of this algorithm is to make robustness for SVM to recognize a faulty condition with unexpected sensors values. The ANN generates a high accurate model which is based reference for SVM classifier. Now by using this black box model we make possibility of robustness for SVM to increase detection probability. Finally, a series of faulty experimental data are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the robust classifier. Final results show that online SVM can detect accurately the air supply fan fault and damper fault of a HVAC system with minimum usage data. It is also outperforms offline SVM on such energy systems for classification.

For deteriorating systems or devices it can be estimated by establishing a good-fitting stochastic process model and solving corresponding first passage problem with the given failure level. In this paper, providing that the mean and variance function of the degradation process are given or obtained directly from observed data by statistical/empirical techniques, we propose a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose mean and variance are equal to the given mean and variance respectively. Based on this diffusion process, when a failure level is considered, the first passage failure distribution can be solved by a Volterra integral equation of second class. Furthermore, with the help of numerical methods, the residual useful life estimation is considered for a real case.

Detecting and isolating faults may be convenient for some applications where the fault does not have severe consequences on humans as well as on the environment. However, in some situations, detecting and diagnosing faults may not be sufficient. In these cases, it is more interesting to anticipate the time of the fault, what is the purpose of prognostics. This latter activity aims at estimating the remaining useful life of systems by using three main approaches: data-driven prognostics, model-based prognostics and hybrid prognostics. Data-driven prognostics concerns the transformation of the raw monitoring data to relevant models or trends which are then used to continuously assess the health state of the system and predict its remaining useful life. This approach is easy to implement, but suffers from precision. In addition, the method is applied in most cases on single physical components (bearings, gears, belts, etc.) and thus the interaction between the components of the whole system is not addressed. Model-based prognostics (also called physics of failure prognostics) deals with analytical modelling of the system including its degradation. This approach gives more precise results, but it is difficult to apply on complex systems for which the construction of the behaviour and degradation models is not a trivial task. Finally, the hybrid approach combines both model-based and data-driven approaches by keeping their advantages. This paper presents a framework allowing the development of hybrid prognostics. The framework relies on two main phases: an offline phase and an online phase. The first phase concerns the construction of the nominal and degradation models, and the definition of the faults and performance thresholds needed to calculate the remaining useful life of the system. The second phase deals with the utilisation of the models and thresholds obtained in the first phase to detect the fault initiation, assess the current health state of the system, predict its future health state and calculate its remaining useful life.

The parameter (s) in this kernel is crucial to robust performance of SVM. In this paper, we derive a formula to compute the optimal s under the principle of maximizing the class separability in the kernel space. The most attractive feature of the proposed method is that no optimization search algorithm is required in parameter selection; and thus our method is computational effective. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is fast and robust.

Enhancing the Ability of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition in Machine Fault Diagnosis	2010 PROGNOSTICS AND SYSTEM HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference	JAN 12-FEB 14, 2010	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA				TRANSFORM	Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive time-frequency analysis method that has been widely employing for machinery fault diagnosis. EMD is famous in revealing instantaneous change of frequency or time from non-linear sensory signal so that the occurrence of anomalous signal can be accurately detected. However, its shortcomings include mode mixing and end effects that often appear in its decomposed bands. These problems decrease the accuracy, particularly in vibration-based fault diagnosis. Recently, many researchers have proposed various improved methods, which include the famous Ensemble EMD (EEMD), to solve the problem of mode mixing. Its purpose is to introduce controlled amount of white noise to the original EMD. After adding known white noise into the raw signal, the signal in the band will have a uniformly distributed reference scale which forces the EEMD to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process for minimizing mode mixing effect. Even though EEMD becomes popular, the proper settings for the number of ensemble and the amplitude of white noise that should be added a re still not formally prescribed. This paper discusses the influence of parameters setting on the results of reducing mode mixing problem. Tests were done using both simulated and real machine signals. Their results provide a guideline on setting the parameters properly so that the ability of EEMD on machine fault diagnosis can be significantly enhanced.

For these reasons, Sustainable Manufacturing is one of the most important issue to address for reaching a Sustainable Development of our society. In this frame, maintenance process that must ensure availability, reliability and safety of equipment, has a key role for sustainable operations. However, how maintenance can integrate the sustainability goal and contribute to this objective is not clearly defmed: few studies addressing this topic are available in the current literature. These reasons have led the authors to conduct a Scoping Literature Review to investigate the role of maintenance for sustainable manufacturing, with particular focus on the 4th industrial revolution and the enabling technologies 4.0, with the aim of identifying future research directions in this field. The review was conducted following a protocol that minimizes subjectivity and allowing the critical evaluation of relevant studies. Two databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and a set of specific keywords were used to identify and select peer-reviewed papers that presented evidence on the relationship between maintenance and sustainability in the industrial field. The selected papers were assembled respect to specific thematic sections that allowed us to create research clusters in the field of interest. The analysis sheds light on the increasing interest in the last years on "maintenance & sustainability" and the big potentiality of enabling technologies 4.0 in this frame.

Thus, some strategies arc sought to avoid unscheduled stops, or catastrophic damages, in order to reduce maintenance costs and increase reliability. This paper describes a methodological framework to detect eleven rotating machinery faults by using feature ranking methods and support vector machine, based on information that comes from the measured vibration signal. Thirty features are calculated from the vibration signal in time domain, for each faulty condition. Feature ranking methods such as ReliefF, Chi square, and Information Gain are used to select the most informative features, and subsequently to reduce the size of the feature vector. The feature ranking methods are compared in order to obtain improved diagnosis results with a reduced feature set. Results show good fault identification accuracy with the first four features of ReliefF ranking method as input to support vector machine classifier.

The analysis of huge data sets produced by these sensors (Big Data) could allow quick and accurate decision making. For example, productivity improvements can be achieved by analysing device performance and degradation for real-time feedback on configuration and optimization. This work proposes a Cloud-based architecture for Internet of Things (IoT) applications to improve the deployment of smart industrial systems based on remote monitoring and control. By using specific technologies available as a service, we demonstrate the proposed architecture on an automated electric induction motor use case. This approach includes layers for sensor network data gathering, data transformation between standard protocols, message queuing, real-time data analysis, reporting for further analysis, and real-time control. Particularly, by using the proposed architecture, we remotely monitored, controlled and processed data produced by sensors and actuators coupled to the motor. Preliminary results indicate this foundation can support predictive methods and management of automated systems in the Industrie 4.0 context.

It aims to ensure the proper functioning of an equipment. It no longer has the sole objective to repair a system but also to anticipate and prevent its failures. Recently, new failure prediction techniques have emerged. They provide information on the real-time condition of equipment and its remaining useful life (RUL). Thus, new methods of decision-making based on the analysis of these recent developments can be considered. Indeed, this paper presents a heuristic method for solving the makespan and the cost of a resumable job shop problem while predicting and preventing failures. It is based on the elimination of duplication that may exist between the different operations at a given point in time, while selecting a single operation and shifting the others at the end of the execution thereof. The best selection of the operation to assign on the machine depends on the effectiveness of the decision rule used for scheduling.

One of the most important challenges in modern PHM is how to diagnose the fault of mechanical equipment accurately. Aiming to improve the fault diagnosis precision of the rotating machinery, a novel method of fault diagnosis combines mutual information models and second generation wavelet packet decomposition is presented in this paper. The traditional approaches to fault diagnosis always focus on the signals of a certain time. This method is different from traditional models because fault can be diagnosed more accurately by comparing the conditions of two different periods. Firstly, vibration signal of different times is extracted from the working bearings. Secondly, each frequency band's energy is calculated through the second generation decomposition and the energy of joint probability distribution of two different periods of time as well. Finally, the mutual information of two different periods of time is gained by using their joint probability distribution. A life test of a bearing is used to validate the proposed methodology and the results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is an effective tool to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis of bearings running status.

The prognostic approach is developed considering a library of reference degradation trajectories containing parameter observations taken from a set of similar equipments until their failures. The prediction of the RUL of the a filter is obtained by comparing its degradation trajectory to the reference trajectories and by properly aggregating the RULs of the training trajectories using a weighted sum which takes into account the similarity within test and training trajectories. In order to provide a measure of confidence in the RUL prediction in the form of a prediction interval, we place our work within the framework of belief function theory and we assign to each reference trajectory a belief proportional to its similarity to the test trajectory. A prediction interval is then obtained by properly combining these belief assignments using the Dempster's rule.

To the best of our knowledge, few papers have focused on the joint decision for critical component spare parts ordering and replacement with prognostic information. In this paper we present an integrated decision model for jointly determining the condition-based replacement and critical component spare parts ordering decisions for a functioning component subject to condition monitoring. To do this, the degradation path of the component is modelled using a Wiener process, and the parameters are updated through the combination of the Bayesian method and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm using real-time CM data. The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of the remaining useful life (RUL) are derived, which are then utilized to update the integrated decisions. The main advantage in our proposed decision-making model is that the prognostic information is fully utilized for joint decisions. An additional advantage lies in the updating mechanism of the RUL which enables the integrated decisions to be updated based on in-situ sensor data. The proposed integrated decision model is validated by a numerical example.

Based on the features which are the energies of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extracted from normal gearbox vibration signal, a CHMM is trained to model the normal condition. The logarithm of the probability of this CHMM is then used to detect any defects and assess their severity.

This paper focuses on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing in order to detect the failure ahead of time and estimate the fault location accurately when failure occurs. Wavelet energy entropy is introduced into the field of mechanical condition monitoring and SOM network is used in fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a bearing accelerated life test is performed on the accelerated bearing life tester(ABLT-1A). The results indicate that wavelet energy entropy has better performance and can forecast fault development earlier compared with kurtosis and RMS of the vibration signal, while SOM network, which has a advantage of visualization, can distinguish bearing fault type well.

In this paper, taking an aircraft fuel System as an example, with virtual instrument technology and computer simulation technology, an integrated approach of signal processing method and model-based method is introduced to build the virtual simulation software of aircraft fuel PHM system for overcoming the difficulty in obtaining the failures information from the real fuel system. During the process of constructing the aircraft fuel PHM system, the first step is to analyze the fuel system failure m odes and status parameters that can identify the failure modes. The main failure modes are determined as joints looseness, pipe broken, nozzle clogging, and fuel tank leakage. The status parameters are fuel pressure and fuel flow. Then, the status parameter model is constructed to imitate the behavior of sensor which detecting fuel system status. On this basis, utilizing the signal processing module provided by Labview software, the outputs from the virtual sensors, which collect the failure data, are processed to realize the simulation of failure detection and failure diagnosis. All the result shows that the virtual simulation software well accomplishes the task of the aircraft fuel system failure detection and diagnosis.

Since the vibration signals collected from pumps apparently show the existence of non-stationary signals and the interference of neighboring valves, the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is introduced as a preprocessing means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signals to obtain the fault characteristics of the valves. To classify multiple fault modes of valves, a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based multi-class classifier is constructed and used in the valve faults detection. The results in experiments prove that fault types and positions of faulty valves can be identified and diagnosed by the above method. Furthermore, compared with the results using an Artificial Neural Network (BP), more excellent diagnosis accuracy indicates the potential of the SVMs techniques in machinery fault detection.

The drawbacks of this approach are mostly related to the knowledge elicitation through laborious enumeration of the tree structure and ad hoc threshold selection for symptoms definition. These problems can be alleviated if a more profound knowledge of the process is brought into play. The main idea of the paper consists of modeling the nominal and faulty states of the plant by means of interval-like component models derived from first-principles laws, e.g. the conservation law. Such a model serves to simulate the entire system under different fault conditions, in order to obtain the representative patterns of measurable process quantities, i.e. training examples. To march these patterns by diagnostic rules, multistrategy machine learning is applied. As a result, binary decision trees that relate symptoms to faults are obtained, along with the thresholds defining the symptoms, This technique is applied to a laboratory test process operating in the steady state, and is shown to be suitable for handling incipient single faults. The proposed learning approach is compared with two related machine learning methods, It is found that it achieves similar classification accuracy with better transparency of the resulting diagnostic system.

To address the limitation on effectively dealing with the raw vibration signals by the traditional signal processing technology based on Fourier transform, wavelet packet decomposition was employed to extract the features of bearing faults such as outer ring flaking, inner ring flaking, roller flaking and normal condition. Compared with the previous literature on fault diagnosis using principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM), one-to-one and one-to-many algorithms were taken into account. Additionally, the effect of four kernel functions, such as liner kernel function, polynomial kernel function, radial basis function and hyperbolic tangent kernel function, on the performance of SVM classifier was investigated, and the optimal hype-parameters of SVM classifier model were determined by genetic algorithm optimization. PCA was employed for dimension reduction, so as to reduce the computational complexity. The principal components that reached more than 95 % cumulative contribution rate were extracted by PCA and were input into SVM and BP neural network classifiers for identification. Results show that the fault feature dimensionality of the rolling bearing is reduced from 8-dimensions to 5-dimensions, which can still characterize the bearing status effectively, and the computational complexity is reduced as well. Compared with the raw feature set, PCA has a higher fault diagnosis accuracy (more than 97 %), and a shorter diagnosis time relatively. To better verify the superiority of the proposed method, SVM classification results were compared with the results of BP neural network. It is concluded that SVM classifier achieved a better performance than BP neural network classifier in terms of the classification accuracy and time-cost.

Missing data imputation is used to avoid information loss (due to downsampling or discarding incomplete records). A recent deep -learning technique, variational autoencoders (VAEs), has been used for missing data imputation in image data, and was compared here to imputation by mean replacement and by principal component analysis (PCA) imputation. The techniques were compared using a synthetic, nonlinear dataset, and a simulated milling circuit dataset, which included process disturbances, measurement noise, and feedback control. Each dataset was corrupted with missing values in 20% of records (lightly corrupted) and in 90% of records (heavily corrupted). For both lightly and heavily corrupted datasets, the root mean squared error of prediction for VAE imputation was lower than the traditional methods. Possibilities for the extension of missing data imputation to inferential sensing are discussed. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The prediction of the expected RUL is very useful to decrease maintenance cost, operational downtime and safety hazards. This paper proposes a new strategy of health-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system that includes as an additional goal extending the system RUL via their estimation using reliability tools. In this approach, the RUL maximization is included in the objective function of the LPV-MPC controller. The RUL is included in the MPC model as an extra parameter varying equation that considers the control action as scheduling variable. The proposed control approach allows the controller to accommodate to the parameter changes. Through computing an estimation of the state variables during prediction, the MPC model can be modified to the estimated state evolution at each time instant. Moreover, for solving the optimization problem by using a series of Quadratic Programs (QP) in each time instant, a new iterative approach is exhibited, which improves the computational efficiency. A pasteurization plant control system is used as a case study to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Traditional RUL estimation models are built on sufficient prior knowledge of critical components degradation process which is not easily available in most situation. With the development of integrated circuit and sensor technique, data-driven approaches show good potential on RUL estimation. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor date sequence in bidirection. By visualized analysis of the hidden layers, the model can expose hidden patterns with sensor data of multiple working conditions, fault patterns and degradation model. With experiment using C-MAPSS dataset, BiLSTM approach for RUL estimation outperforms other traditional approaches for RUL estimation.

In this paper, a deep learning based approach is presented to translate traditional diagnostic methods based on one-dimensional time-series analysis into graphical images for fault type and severity identification, with rolling bearing as a representative example. Specifically, time sequences of vibration signals are first converted by Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to time-frequency images.

Compressor fouling may develop over a short time, but it is recoverable by washing and cleaning. Reliable prediction of the fouling as a function of time is helpful for planning compressor wash services. In this work, the fouling state is parametrized as the relative change of the ratio of the compressor mass flow and efficiency against ideal conditions. A regression-based prognostic model is developed to predict the fouling state as a function of time. In the next step, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed that considers the rate of humidity condensation at the inlet of the compressor for the prognostic model. The performance of the developed models is evaluated with recorded operating data from a GTE in a power plant. The study shows that enhancement of the prognostic model may be accomplished by taking into account the effects of humidity on the rate of fouling and results in an improvement in the prognostic accuracy.

A comparison of data-driven fault detection methods with application to aerospace electro-mechanical actuators	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control		Fault Detection; Machine Learning; Electro-Mechanical Actuators	ELECTRICAL MACHINES; MOTOR; DIAGNOSIS	In this paper, a model-free framework is proposed in order to equip electromechanical actuators, deployed in aerospace applications, with health-monitoring capabilities. A large experimental activity has been carried out to perform acquisitions with both healthy and faulty components, taking into consideration the standard regulations for environmental testing of avionics hardware. The injected faults followed a Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. Features, belonging to different domains, have been extracted from the measured signals. These indexes are based largely on the motor driving currents, in order to avoid the installation of new sensors. Finally, a Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm has been chosen to detect the system status: the choice has been dictated by a comparison with other known classification algorithms. Furthermore, the most promising features for a classification point of view are reported. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, most researchers paid their attention to the drift coefficient representing the degradation rate, while much fewer eyes focus on the diffusion coefficient. The under consideration of diffusion process may cause bias in degradation modeling and RUL estimation, when the concerned system has volatile degradation path. Therefore, this paper construct a new kind of age-dependent degradation model based on diffusion process with time-dependent drift and diffusion coefficient. Unlike most existing models, the degradation process' temporal variance is assumed to be proportional to the instantaneous expectation of the degradation process. By doing so, volatile degradation process can be modelled. The exact lifetime and RUL distributions under the concept of first hitting time (FHT) are derived, and normal random-effect are incorporated to depict the unit-to-unit variability within degradation process. The maximum likelihood estimation method based on historical degradation data is presented. Through a specific degradation model and its application to the data of accelerators, the presented degradation model has been illustrated and validated.

The application of condition monitoring techniques to entire petrochemical process plants, however, remains lacking. This Can he ascribed to the significant complexity involved in applying; existing techniques to such plants. In this work a novel energy-based fault detection scheme is applied to an autothermal reformer of a gas-to liquids process. The performance of the technique is evaluated, against a set of representative faults, and it is shown to provide adequate fault detection performance. The use of the energy based detection scheme shows promise in terms of reduced modelling efforts and increased computational efficiency.

Usually the resulting models are used for fault detection, reengineering, and analysis. But in practical applications, like monitoring, learned models can show high complexity and permissivity which makes it difficult to use these models and results tend to be ambiguous. Therefore, this paper defines so called Machine State Petri Nets (MSPN) with the aim of being generated out of recorded event traces and exploit additional information of the system to reduce the permissivity. An already existing learning algorithm has been extended by exploiting some facts common for most practical applications.

Corrosion Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Element Bearing under Constant and Variable Load and Speed Conditions	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IFAC Symposium on Control of Power and Energy Systems (CPES 2015)	DEC 09-11, 2015	New Delhi, INDIA			Fault analysis; features extraction; dimensionality reduction; dynamic recurrent neural network	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; INDUCTION MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VIBRATION	Rolling element bearing defects is one of the main reasons for breakdown in electrical machines. Robust fault analysis (FA) including the diagnosis of faults and predicting their level of fault severity is thus necessary to optimise maintenance, improve reliability and to avoid more catastrophic failure consequences. The proposed diagnostic methods in this paper use the innovative discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature extraction and an orthogonal fuzzy neighbourhood discriminative analysis (OFNDA) approach for feature reduction. The dynamic recurrent neural network predicts the conditions of components and classifies faults under different operating conditions.. The results obtained from the real time simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methodology in classifying the different faults faster and accurately.

To maximize the benefits from refurbishing, decision making is critical, where the optimized time and the right component for manufacturing are determined. However. there has not been any satisfactory refurbishing decision-making strategy developed. In this paper. a prognostics and health management based method is developed for refurbishment decision making First, components are selected for in-situ monitoring using failure modes. mechanisms and effects analysis. then the remaining useful life for the system is estimated by analyzing the in-situ monitoring data so that the optimized refurbishing time can be determined. Finally, near the end of the system life, certain degraded components are selected via diagnosis, and refurbishment is carried out. The procedure of the method is evaluated by an analysis of the refurbishment of instruments in industrial process control. Using this method, the remaining useful life of electromechanical products can be optimally used, and the cost of refurbishment can be minimized.

Sparse coding (SC) is regarded as an efficient impulse feature extraction method, but it cannot extract the weak impulse features in vibration signals with heavy background noises. In this paper, a fusion sparse coding (FSC) method is proposed to extract impulse components effectively. Firstly, several sparse coding algorithms are executed in parallel independently as participating algorithms. Then, fusion scheme of different sparse coding algorithms is presented to improve the accuracy of sparse signal reconstruction. Lastly, the proposed method is used to process aircraft engine rotor vibration signals compared with other feature extraction approaches. Experiment result shows FSC method can extract impulse features accurately from heavy noisy vibration signal, and it provides great significance for machinery weak fault detection and diagnosis.

The division of two these stages are helpful for remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. With the help of health monitoring technique, the start point of the degradation stage can be detected successfully, which facilitates the prognostic activities. This paper reports the work on the detection of start point of the degradation stage in machines. An approach, which combines the wavelet packet technique and multivariate statistical process control method, for fault detection was developed. Motor bearings and fans data are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that it is feasible for fault detection.

In the first case considered, we have available a stochastic model of the creep growth process and we know the value of the failure threshold, i.e., the maximum creep strain level beyond which the blade cracks. On this basis, a Monte Carlo-based filtering technique, called particle filtering, is set-up to predict the distribution of the system RUL and online-update it when new observations are collected. In the second case considered, the only available information is the sequence of observations of the creep strain of the blade of interest and the value of the failure threshold. On this basis, a data-driven method, based on an ensemble of bootstrap models, has been developed to estimate the turbine blade RUL and the uncertainty of the estimate caused by the uncertainty in the data, the variability of the blades behaviour and the imprecision of the empirical model. The two approaches are evaluated in terms of the assumptions they require and the accuracy of the RUL predictions they provide. The ability of providing measures of confidence in the outcomes is also considered.

Increasing the Adoption of Prognostic Systems for Health Management in the Power Industry	2013 PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM)	Chemical Engineering Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Effective asset management benefits from accurate information about the current health and expected future health of each asset. This information can be supplied by diagnostic and prognostic systems respectively, utilizing data from condition monitoring systems and inspections to derive status and likely future behavior. However, new prognostic techniques can face difficulties when transitioning from research tool to industrial deployment. Within the power industry there are two main drivers to improve asset management. First, the safety of personnel and members of the public may be compromised by a failure in service, so maintenance aims to pre-empt such failures. Secondly, more accurate prediction of future degradation can feed into a more efficient maintenance program, reducing costs through appropriate delay of repair and replacement. These drivers prompt a cautious interest in prognostic tools, countered by some reticence within traditional utilities to adopt new and relatively unproven technologies. This paper identifies issues which may hinder the deployment of prognostic techniques within the power industry. It considers two examples of diagnostic systems (for rotating plant within nuclear stations, and for power transformers) which progressed past the research prototype stage to deployed demonstrator systems, and one example of a prognostic system (for HV circuit breakers) which has not yet made that transition. Drawing lessons from these experiences, the paper extracts key factors which link the deployed systems, but are missing from the third. The paper concludes that structural issues are the main differentiators, including automated access to data, clear and concise user interfaces, and working with the engineers who will ultimately use the system. Trust in the algorithm is also important, and the paper outlines the techniques selected for the case study applications, with discussion of selected results. Once engineers are able to integrate prognostics into their processes, it naturally contributes to asset management strategy.	[Catterson, Victoria M.; Costello, Jason J.

With the increasing number of wind turbines worldwide, the exposure to harsh environmental conditions and the use of remote areas like offshore, arctic or desert regions, it has become important to predict abnormal machine behaviour as early as possible. Therefore, automated fault detection is necessary. Fault detection will prevent extensive damage in case of a fault and create time to react to faults, for example, to prepare inspections and/or to purchase spare parts. To reduce the downtime of wind turbines, fault detection systems are already widely used but more research and development need to be done. The diagnostic approach of those systems is to use pre-set fixed alert thresholds but has several drawbacks and therefore makes fault isolation difficult. To overcome the drawbacks of the common systems, this paper introduces model based condition monitoring using residual generation to wind turbine drive trains. Residuals describe the difference between the measurements and the model output. The model output represents the non-faulty system behaviour. If the measurement deviates from the model output a fault is indicated. Residual generation is a known approach for other systems. A mathematical model of a system, such as a wind turbine drive train, depends on the actual and past machine operation as well as on the ambient conditions. By knowing these conditions and being able to describe them in an analytic way, a model can be derived using the well-known state-space representation.

They suffer however from insufficient durability for stationary and transport applications, and lifetime may be improved. A greater understanding of underlying wearing processes is needed in order to improve this technology. However, FCs are in essence multi-physics and multi-scales systems (from the cells to the whole power system), which makes a modeling step of behaviors and degradation very difficult, even impossible. Thereby, data-driven Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) principles (as defined in condition-based-maintenance scheme CBM) appear to be of great interest to face with the problems of health assessment and life prediction of FCs. According to all this, the aim of this paper is to present the current state of the art on PHM for FCs. Developments emphasize on PHM of the Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) stack. The paper is organized so that important aspects like "behavior and losses FCs", "observation techniques", and "advanced PHM techniques" are addressed. Also, a taxonomy of existing works on PHM of PEMFC is given accordingly to the processing layers of CBM. The whole enables PHM practitioners as well as FCs experts to get a better understanding of remaining challenging issues.

The failure of these switches can reduce the efficiency of the system or lead to system failure. By identifying failure precursor parameters in IGBTs and monitoring them, a prognostics methodology can be developed to predict and avert failures. In this study, IGBTs aged by thermal-electrical stresses were evaluated in comparison with new components to determine the electrical parameters that change with stressing. Three potential precursor parameter candidates, threshold voltage, transconductance, and collector-emitter (ON) voltage, were evaluated by comparing aged and new IGBTs under a temperature range of 25-200 degrees C. The trends in the three electrical parameters with temperature were correlated to device degradation. A methodology is presented for validating these precursor parameters for IGBT prognostics.

Main components of the system are a reliability-based system assessment tool, prognostic models of degradation and new sensoring techniques. The system assessment tool is based on the reliability method; its task is to find out weak points of a structure being first responsible for a possible failure. If prognostic models of degradation are combined with monitoring an improved accuracy of prognosis can be achieved. To get relevant monitoring data from a structure a new generation of sensors is being developed. These three parts of a structural monitoring system are presented in the contribution. The methods mentioned before are tested and demonstrated at a real scale pc-bridge, serving as an experimental structure. This structure provides typical structural situations and degradation processes in a realistic manner. The object is to examine under conditions close to real structures the combined use of reliability analysis in order to find weakpoints and to decide on the places where sensors should be applied on one side, and on the other side the practical operability and usefulness of new sensors and adaptive prognostic models for concrete degradation as presented above. The experimental bridge structure is presented and the first results of the probabilistic system analysis are sketched finally.

In a control room, it is difficult to recognize accidents such as fires, fuel oil leaks, and unusual sounds, at a moment's notice. Maintenance operators, therefore, have to patrol the plant yard to find them. To eliminate the need for patrols, the need for automatic monitoring systems to detect such accidents is increasing. A new intelligent monitoring system has been developed, using advanced image and sound analysis, which is linked to human senses, to realize the request. This system can detect oil and steam leaks from burners, unusual sounds from machines, and fire and smoke in the vicinity. This paper describes the system outline, features, and methods of image processing and sound analysis.

J	An, D; Choi, JH; Kim, NH				An, Dawn; Choi, Joo-Ho; Kim, Nam Ho			Prediction of remaining useful life under different conditions using accelerated life testing data	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Asia Pacific Conference of the Prognostics-and-Health-Management-Society (PHMAP)	JUL 12-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	Prognost & Hlth Management Soc		Accelerated life testing; Prognostics; Neural network; Particle filter	DATA-DRIVEN; TUTORIAL	Prognostics methods model the degradation of system performance and predict remaining useful life using degradation data measured during service. However, obtaining degradation data from in-service systems in practice is either difficult or expensive. Therefore, accelerated life testing (ALT) is instead frequently performed for validating designs using considerably heavy loads. This work discusses the methods and effectiveness of utilizing ALT degradation data for the prognostics of a system. Depending on the degradation model and loading conditions, four different ways of utilizing ALT data for prognostics are discussed. A similar transformation method used in ALT is adopted to convert accelerated loading conditions to field loading conditions. To demonstrate the proposed approach, synthetic data are generated for crack growth under accelerated loading conditions; these data are used for training a neural network model or identifying model parameters in a particle filter. The applied example shows that the use of ALT data increases the accuracy of prognostics in the early stages in all four cases and compensates for the problem posed by data insufficiency through the proposed method.

The proposed methodology consists of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, different time-domain health indicators (HIs) are extracted and the best indicator of degradation is selected by filter-based methods. Then, a degradation model is defined and its parameters are estimated using the selected HI. In the online phase, the k-means clustering is utilized to detect a change(s) in the system's health state and to trigger failure prognostics for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The degradation model parameters are updated as new data are available, and the RUL is predicted iteratively. The proposed methodology is implemented on point machine sliding chair degradation using in-field condition monitoring (CM) data. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used in machine degradation-level assessment and in online RUL predictions.

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an effective way to ensure the battery reliability. The loss of actual capacity of a battery is usually used to reflect the battery RUL. However, the capacity degradation is complex and non-linear. For the longer capacity prediction horizon, the accuracy of traditional methods becomes lower which would cause error in RUL prognosis. To address this problem, this paper proposed a deep belief networks (DBN) method for lithium-ion battery RUL prediction. The proposed method is trained with historical battery capacity data. With the powerful fitting ability of DBN, the proposed method can track capacity degradation and predict the RUL. Experiments are conducted based on commercial lithium-ion batteries.

However, we can easily simulate various faults in a laboratory, and the data from machines used in the laboratory (MUL) contain fault knowledge related to the data from MURC. Thus, it is possible to identify the health states of MURC by using related fault knowledge contained in the data from MUL. To achieve this purpose, a transfer learning method named convolutional adaptation network (CAN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method first uses domain-shared convolutional neural network to extract features from the collected data. Second, the distribution discrepancy between the learned features of the data from MUL and MURC is reduced by minimizing multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Finally, pseudo label learning is introduced to train domain-shared classifier by using unlabeled data from MURC. The proposed method is verified by a transfer learning case, in which the health states of locomotive bearings are identified by using the fault knowledge contained in the data from motor bearings used in a laboratory. The results show that CAN is able to effectively identify the health states of MURC with the help of the data from MUL.

The suffered failures will degrade the system performance with output torque ripple and harmonic currents. In this paper, a novel diagnosis method is proposed to detect and locate the insulated gate bipolar translator open-circuit fault. Discrete wavelet transform is used as a pre-treatment technique for three-phase output currents, the approximate coefficients are applied to obtain energy vectors. Euclidean distance between every two of the energy vectors are calculated for measuring the current similarity to diagnose fault. When IGBTs occur open-circuit fault, the values of Euclidean distance will be smaller than that under normal conditions, then faults can be detected. Faults can also be located according to extracted features. Simulation and experimental results show high efficiency and merits of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, existing health indicator construction methods are mainly based on manual feature extraction and feature fusion techniques. Such manual techniques are generally designed for specific tasks and need the help of experts' prior knowledge, resulting in labor-consuming and time-costing. So it is desirable to automatically construct health indicators. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a deep convolution feature learning based method to construct health indicators of bearings. The proposed method first learns features from the raw vibration signals through several convolution and pooling operations. Then the learned features are mapped to the health indicator through a nonlinear transformation. At last, the proposed method is validated by a bearing dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively construct the health indicator directly from the raw vibration signals, which is superior to that based on self organizing map. Additionally, because the proposed health indicator is constructed automatically, it significantly reduces the need of experts' prior knowledge and labor resources.

The consequences of a bearing fault range from production losses to critical safety issues. To mitigate these consequences condition based maintenance is gaining momentum. This is based on a variety of fault diagnosis techniques where fuzzy clustering plays an important role as it can be used in fault detection, classification, and prognosis. A variety of clustering algorithms have been proposed and applied in this context. However, when the extensive literature on this topic is investigated, it is not clear which clustering algorithm is the most suitable, if any. In an attempt to bridge this gap, this paper reports some preliminary results of a work aiming at comparing four representative fuzzy clustering algorithms: fuzzy c-means (FCM), the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) algorithm, fuzzy c-means with a focal point (FCMFP), and fuzzy neighborhood density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FN-DBSCAN). The paper reports only results from the real-world bearing vibration benchmark CWRU data set.

Maintenance Management objective is to reduce or even avoid the corrective maintenance by proper planning and implementation of maintenance tasks at the right time. The aim of this paper is to early plan maintenance interventions for a multi-components system based on stoppages characteristics, system RUL (Remaining Useful Life) and components criticalities. This maintenance plan is made through a dynamic maintenance decision approach (DMDA) to help the maintenance expert in taking decision. Since combining maintenance activities is cheaper than performing maintenance on components separately, maintenance actions groupings are performed in the proposed approach by the mean of odds algorithm. This will allow optimizing system availability, reducing maintenance costs and delaying as late as possible maintenance interventions. Components criticalities are used for prioritizing components in the grouping process. Moreover, DMDA take into account predictive information such as system/components RUL, given by an existing prognostic process. At the end, a numerical example of a HVAC system with five components (Heat exchanger, filter, dampers, valve and fan) demonstrates the use and the advantages of the proposed DMDA.

The approach is demonstrated using simulated data from the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), as a challenging benchmark problem. The TEP is a plant-wide industrial process that is commonly used to study and evaluate a variety of topics, including the design of process monitoring and control techniques. The proposed approach is called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a machine learning approach that is used to discover the hidden knowledge in historical data. The discovered knowledge in the form of extracted patterns is employed to construct a classification rule that is capable of characterizing the physical phenomena in the TEP, wherein one can detect and identify a fault and relate it to the causes that contribute to its occurrence. To evaluate our approach, the LAD is trained on a set of observations collected from different faults, and tested against an independent set of observations. The results in this paper show that the LAD approach achieves the highest accuracy compared to two common machine learning classification techniques; Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

Current practice in fault diagnosis is often challenged by the non-normality, multimodality, and nonlinearity of machinery health monitoring signals and their extracted features. A single classifier used in fault diagnosis fails when all these challenges exist. Thus, in this paper a hybrid ensemble learning method is developed to combine the capability of different classifiers to address the challenges. Diversity among classifiers is desired because diversified classifiers lead to uncorrelated classifications, which improve classification accuracy. In this paper two methods are used to increase the diversity. First, different algorithms compatible with rotating machinery data are included in the decision ensemble to get the diversity among algorithms. Second, multiple bootstrap samples are generated to increase the diversity among training data. Each algorithm is trained by multiple bootstrap samples to get multiple classifiers. At the end, classifiers are trained from different combinations of algorithms and bootstrap samples. A final classification result is obtained from the majority voting of the classifiers. The method was evaluated by the classification of simulated data and through the fault diagnosis of experimental data of bearings. Results show the method works when the challenges exist and the performance of the method is better than that of individual classifiers.

For this reason, predictive maintenance Lee must be properly integrated in the production scheduling in order to take into account the wear and tear of the equipment to prevent it from die failure risk. In this context, we investigate the problem of a single multifunctional machine subjected to predictive maintenance based on Prognostic Health Management (PHM). We propose a new interpretation of PHM outputs to define the machine degradation corresponding to the processing of every task. We design a genetic algorithm that we called IPro-GA with the objective of minimizing the total interventions cost. Computational results show the efficiency of our scheme with an average deviation of about 0.1% over a lower bound. (C) 2016, IFAC (International of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

One class of method in system condition monitoring is based on the condition data (i.e., data-driven methodology). However, not all the collected condition data can be utilized for the data-driven methodology. Hence, the selection of reasonable condition data is crucial for the application of the data-driven methodology. This is especially useful for the system which has the characteristics of degradation. In such system, the condition data that have the increasing or decreasing trend are desirable. This article provides a combination of entropy and improved permutation entropy to select the condition data based on quantitative description of sensor data monotonic trend. A case study of the aircraft engine is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the quantitative description of sensor data monotonic trend. The detailed experiments prove the advantage of the proposed approach.

These data-driven techniques include neural networks, group method of data handling, neuro-fuzzy networks, and random forests as an ensemble-based system. These prognostic techniques make use of the past and current data to predict the upcoming values of the capacity to estimate the remaining useful life of the battery. This work presents a comparative study of these data-driven prognostic techniques on constant load experimental data collected from Li-ion batteries. Experimental results show that these data-driven prognostic techniques can effectively estimate the remaining useful life of the Li-ion batteries. However, the random forests and neuro-fuzzy techniques outperform other competitors in terms of the RUL prediction error and root mean square error (RMSE), respectively.

The performance of such systems immensely relies upon the quality of features extracted and the classifier model learned. Traditionally features were handcrafted, where engineers would manually design them with statistical parameters and signal transforms based energy distribution analysis. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown new ways of obtaining useful feature representation that provide state of the art results in image and speech processing applications. This paper first presents a brief survey of traditional handcrafted features and later presents a short analysis of handcrafted features v/s features learned by deep neural networks (DNN), for doing fault diagnosis. The DNN based features in this paper were generated in 3 phases: 1) extracted handcrafted features using traditional techniques 2) initialized the weights of DNN by learning de-noising sparse auto-encoders with the handcrafted features in unsupervised fashion and 3) applied two generic fine tuning heuristics that tailor DNN's weights to give good classification performance. The experimentation and analysis were performed on 5 datasets: one each on Air compressor monitoring, Drill bit monitoring and Steel plate monitoring, and two on bearing fault monitoring data. The results clearly show the prospects of DNN obtaining good feature representations and good classification performance. Further, it also finds that Fast Fourier Transform based features with DNN are more suited for Support Vector Machine as classifier than Random Forest.

In this paper, we build a mathematic model based on sensor data to describe the production dynamics Furthermore, a systematic methodology is further de eloped to perform real-time diagnosis and prognosis on permanent production loss and conduct analysis on system robustness to disruption events, which can enhance overall system efficiency by increasing System responsiveness.

At the same time, the estimation of state of charge (SOC), cycle life and other performance for lithium-ion batteries become research focus in the related fields, in order to ensure that the operation of lithium-ion battery-powered devices and systems were safe, reliable and economic. Efficient and accurate state of charge estimation for the Lithium-ion batteries can help to optimize the charging/discharging and operation strategy, prevent the occurrence due to losing power unexpectedly from happening, and decrease the cost of the consequent accidents. Open circuit voltage is often used to estimate SOC of the battery, unfortunately, it is not easy to measure usually, and the hysteresis effect is a big challenge. In this paper, we built a Thevenin equivalent circuit model and identified the relationship of SOC compare to battery terminal voltage and charging/discharging current, and then estimated the SOC with relevance vector machine. The experimental results proved the feasibility of the methodology, which can provide potential application for SOC prediction.(1)	[Chen, Bing; Fan, Bin] Naval Univ Engn, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ma, Haodong; Fang, Hongzheng; Fan, Huanzhen; Luo, Kai] Beijing Aerosp Measure & Control Corp AMC Ltd, Beijing Key Lab High Speed Transport Intelligent, Beijing, Peoples R China; Natl Univ Def Technol, Sci & Technol Integrated Logist Support Lab, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China	Chen, B (reprint author), Naval Univ Engn, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.	chenbing0710@126.com; mahaodong@126.com; hongzhengf@163.com; fhuanzhen@126.com; sam4321@163.com; fanbin85510@163.com			National Defense Basic Scientific Research program of China [A0420110301]; National Defense Foundation of China [9140A17050612HT0601]	This work was supported by the National Defense Basic Scientific Research program of China (Grant No. A0420110301), the National Defense Foundation of China (Grant No. 9140A17050612HT0601).

A degenerated equivalent circuit model and hybrid prediction for state-of-health (SOH) of PEM fuel cell	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Annual International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 22-25, 2014	Spokane, WA	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE		Fuel cell; state-of-health (SOH) prediction; EIS spectra; equivalent circuit model; voltage prediction	PERFORMANCE; PROGNOSTICS; DURABILITY	The 2014 IEEE PHM data challenge problem deals with the state-of-health (SOH) of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) given two degradation data sets: (i) a reference data set (FC1) operated under constant current is fully given until 991 h and (ii) a test data set (FC2) operated under rippled current is partially given until 550h. The proposed research aims at predicting the SOH (or EIS spectra) of PEM fuel cell after 550h for FC2. First, a full scale equivalent circuit model (ECM) with 10 parameters is developed to describe the electrochemical physics of PEMFC more realistically. The model reduction is suggested because of limited data. Since some parameters remain nearly unchanged due to irrelevance to degradation, it is reasonable to use the degenerated 4-parameter ECM while fixing the other parameters at their means. Despite the model reduction, the degradation pattern is clearly observed through the degenerated 4-parameter ECM. Then the coefficients of the four parameters are estimated by building linear regression models between the parameters and voltage. Since the voltage change after 550h is not provided for FC2, the voltage degradation model is developed by modeling both reversible and irreversible degradation processes. This research also proposes a hybrid prognostic approach to the SOH (or EIS spectra) prediction. The voltage degradation model and the degenerated 4-parameter ECM are first developed based on the observation of the physical phenomenon. They are then trained for the purpose of the SOH prediction with the training EIS data sets (FC1 and FC2). It is demonstrated that this hybrid SOH prediction offers highly accurate prediction of the SOH (or EIS spectra) at t = 666, 830, and 1016h. Moreover, possible error sources are also discussed to further improve the prediction accuracy in future.

The capability to detect fast, accurately and easily the existence and severity of bearing fault during operation is very important as an unexpected failure of machine can lead to significant economic losses. This paper mainly introduces an actual case study of bearing condition monitoring in industry. As an effective tool in inspection the bearing condition, shock pulse method (SPM) is utilized to monitor the bearings of test rig which includes an electric motor and a wind turbine. Through analysing the frequency spectrum derived from the SPM instrument, the faulty bearing is located accurately. The case study validates that SPM is quite effective for monitoring the bearings condition in industrial applications.

In this paper, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) and Particle Filter (PF) are used to analyse equipment state and predict its trend. RVM regression is used to extract the trend information of historical measurement data (trajectories). Then RVM based PF method is proposed to figure out the particle sampling distribution using RVM regression, also a new weight calculation method of particle is introduced based on the likelihood sum of whole trajectories. The proposed RVM based PF method can handle the situation that state-transition function of equipment state is unavailable, and it can provide satisfied prognostics of equipment state.

Actuators are costly components for which health monitoring provides valuable information. Here, the control input law and its variations are assumed to deteriorate actuator until a degradation threshold leading the component to crash. With an observable degradation level according to a stochastic Gamma process, the actuator residual useful lifetime RUL prognosis is used to online reconfigure a Linear Quadratic Regulator control law. The main aim is to find a satisfactory trade-off between conflicting requirements i.e. system performances and actuator reliability.

There is therefore a growing need to build accurate diagnosis tools which can give the operating state of the fuel cell during their use. When supervised machine learning approaches are used to build such diagnosis tools, they generally require a large amount of labeled data. Collection and annotation of data can be either difficult to perform or time consuming. In this paper, authors are interested in the monitoring of fuel cells in an unsupervised framework, meaning that no labels are required to learn the diagnosis model. The aim is to build a monitoring tool able to easily visualize the State Of Health of full cells from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measures, showing thus its evolution from fault free case ("normal" behaviour) to defective classes such as drying or flooding. The proposed approach is based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM) which have shown their performance to solve fault detection and prediction in many industrial systems. By automatically visualizing the data into a two-dimensional space, the interpretation of the results have become easy and instinctive. The approach also allows the clustering of the data into different groups of classes, thus enabling the classification of new observations. Experimental results carried out on real data sets have shown the efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to standard supervised and unsupervised classification approaches.

Efficiently and smartly combining multi-source information and relevant models from the interested object, more accurate and reliable diagnostic and prognostic results regarding the object can be achieved, which are especially significant for the condition-based maintenance and prognostics and health management applications. Ensemble learning, as a typical machine learning and decision fusion method, has long been applied in the pattern recognition field and demonstrated promising performance. However, scarce applications of ensemble learning have been found for remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. RUL prediction based on ensemble learning by merging multi-piece information and dynamically updating is proposed in this paper. Specifically, multiple base learners are trained to work as one RUL estimator and weighted averaging with dynamically updated weights upon the latest condition monitoring information is employed to aggregate these RULs to form the final RUL. Rolling element bearing degradation experimental data is used to verify and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Identifying different wear levels, especially for early wear is a challenge in gear fault diagnosis. In this paper, a machine learning methodology for performing diagnosis is presented. It is developed based on hidden Markov model (HMM). A HMM is defined as a doubly stochastic process. The underlying stochastic process is a discrete time finite-state homogeneous Markov chain. The state sequence is not observable and so is called hidden. HMM's construction process and the condition monitoring process are same. So, the HMM can be used to model the mechanical fault progress process. There are some authors applying HMM in machine fault diagnosis. However, HMM with different observation styles applying in machine fault diagnosis will produce different results. With enough history data, this paper aims to using these different HMMs to classify the different levels of gear wears automatically and analysis the performance of these models. These observation styles are discrete integer observation which is the quantized fault features extracted from the vibration signals, continuous observation which is the feature with no quantizing extracted from the vibration signals and observation which is the preprocessed vibration signals. The gear wear experiments were conducted and the vibration signals were captured from the gears under different loads and motor speeds. HMM with three different styles observation is applied to identify the gear wears and the applied results are analyzed. The results show that the features with no quantizing as the observations of the HMM for diagnosis perfected best. But, at the case of no history data, HMM which the observations are the preprocessed vibration signals is used to do the incipient fault detection. The result shows the validity of the method.

When used with condition-based maintenance, EP promises to significantly increase the effective mean-time-between system failures (MTBF) by predicting and avoiding system failures (maintenance planned based on condition). Increased MTBF numbers translate into enhanced availability and better operational reliability. This is essential for building highly dependable computing systems. This paper briefly reviews the steps required for achieving successful prognostics. The lessons learned from adopting EP to the previous and current generations of enterprise computing systems have influenced the next generation computer system designs, equipping future systems with more advanced capabilities for electronic prognostics. Sun Microsystems' new continuous system telemetry harness (CSTH) coupled with advanced pattern recognition substantially increases component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing (through improved root cause analysis) costly sources of "no trouble found" events. These "no trouble found" events.. have become a significant warranty-cost issue for COTS and a sparing-logistics issue for mil spec electronic systems.

The MPSVM is designed by mapping the outputs of standard support vector machines into a calibrated posterior probability using a learned sigmoid function, and then combining these learned probability support vector machines. The Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is used to combine these learned MPSVMs. Two schemes of combination are composed. One of the schemes takes into account the prior information. Our proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of a diesel engine. The experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis can be improved significantly.

The negative-selection algorithm proposed which is inspired by the negative-selection mechanism of the immune system is able to detect any change. In this paper, the algorithm is improved to make it suitable for the fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. Moreover, based on the improved algorithm a new approach of fault diagnosis of rotary machinery is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated by the on-line fault diagnosis of rotary machinery successfully. In addition, the approach of the novel fault diagnosis can also be applied to other fields.

In order to identify meaningful features in measured sensor data, we transform the continuous time series into a set of contiguous discretized state vectors using a multivariate discretization approach. We then search for important patterns that are only found in defective systems. We discuss how to measure the severity degree of each defect pattern and assess the criticality of a defective state. We consider a defective state to be more severe if various defect patterns are observed in the state. Similarly, if a particular defect pattern describes multiple defect states, the pattern is treated as significant. The proposed procedure is utilized to detect defective car door trims that generate small but irritating noises. We analyzed the datasets obtained from a typical acoustic sensor array and acoustic emission sensors. The defective door trims were efficiently identified including the severity degrees of the identified patterns.

Individual perceptions of noise levels have been generally quantified by means of subjective evaluation such as a jury test. This article proposes a classification approach to acoustic noise signals using a wavelet spectrum analysis. We derive energy spectrums of noise signals using a discrete wavelet transform at pre-specified window length. The energy spectrums are a linear form and represented by a Hurst parameter as an informative summary of long-range dependent signal data. The Hurst parameter controls the self-similarity scaling as well as the degree of long-range dependence. We estimate the Hurst parameter through the least squares regression of sample energy against a resolution level in the wavelet spectral domain. In the context of multi-class classification problem, the classification of noise signals is performed by a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) for parameter estimates of linear energy profiles containing the Hurst parameter. In an application example of air-conditioner noise signals, empirical results show that the proposed method offers the higher level of accuracy in acoustic noise sound classification.

A typical workflow is to extract features or construct health indicators by sensor fusion of the equipment and then perform anomaly detection and RUL prediction according to the health indicators. In this paper, we present a data-fusion based methodology for constructing two composite health indicators through integrating multiple run-to-failure sensor data towards to the anomaly detection and the RUL prediction, respectively. A novel optimization methodology termed as the Genetic Algorithm is proposed for constructing the composite health indicators, which are capable of presenting a better reflection of the health condition of systems. This optimization methodology makes the fusion of multiple sensor data no longer limited in linear fusion For this algorithm, the property of a health indicator is the fitness and the different fusion methods to produce health indicators are individuals of a population. Our methodology was verified by applying to a degradation dataset of an aircraft gas turbine engine that was generated by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS). The result shows that the extracted feature have better performance than using original data in the anomaly detection and the RUL prediction.

Maintenance scheduling decides, in a tactical way, when theses maintenance activities will be carried out according to the appearance of opportunities. Numerous works on opportunistic maintenance have been proposed in order to take profit of stochastic, structural and economic dependence. In the real context, the duration of an opportunity is not known accurately. Very few papers take into account the stochastic nature of opportunities duration. In this paper, we present an opportunistic maintenance scheduling methodology considering the stochastic nature of opportunities duration in a predictive maintenance strategy. The prognostic information is used to select opportunities coming before the failure. The proposed maintenance scheduling methodology is based on an optimal stopping problem algorithm known as Bruss algorithm. The originality of this paper is to consider the stochastic nature of opportunities duration using a Monte-Carlo simulation. A numerical study is finally presented to illustrate the use and the strengths of the proposed strategy. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

However, in real-world application, the network trained by a vibration signal dataset will be applied to target signal datasets with different distributions, which can be triggered easily by rotating speed oscillation and load variation. Hence, based on transfer learning, some vibration signal-based methods which are robust to working conditions have been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless, most of them need target datasets in network training, and the network should be trained whenever it meets a new vibration signal dataset. So we construct a three-stage deep fault diagnosis network utilizing adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN), which is highly efficient for free of target datasets in training and does not need repeated training in its application. In the first stage, the vibration signal samples are processed into more regular and discriminative frequency spectra. In the second stage, a fourlayer AdaBN based deep neural network (DNN) is pre-trained by stacked autoencoders (SAE) and then finely tuned only using the source dataset. In the final step, the trained network is modified to diagnose samples from the target dataset. Extensive experiments on a gearbox and a bearing dataset, and comparisons with some other fault diagnosis methods verify its effectiveness.

Since most energy systems and machines show a degradation in energy performance when a failure is starting to develop, monitoring this parameter can result in early behavioral anomalies identification and consequently in the implementation of more timely countermeasures. As the presence of energy consumption monitoring systems is becoming increasingly more widespread, the use of energy consumption monitoring as a way to detect failures is quite interesting because it can enable the introduction of early detection methods for a broad spectrum of failures without the need of specific instrumentation. Furthermore, the promotion of energy performance is also useful as a quality indicator of the process itself. Thus, this paper describes a methodology to monitor the energy consumption performance of a compressed air generation system in an industrial plant to detect anomalies using artificial neural networks. The use of ANNs allows an accurate characterization of the system in a healthy state. Then, by comparing the model prediction and the actual energy consumption, residuals are calculated and plotted in a control chart. The setting of limits and frequency of control enables the management to decide the sensitivity of the control system itself.

To this end, approaches such as prognostics and health management (PHM) are being developed by researchers to support making predictive maintenance decisions by relaying on quantitative indicators such as remaining useful life (RUL); that is basically the projected time to failure of a given system. In general, an industrial system is composed of many components which failure may lead to the failure of the system; so that identification of such components which are referred to as critical components, constitute therefore an important stake. The process of identifying such components is based on many methods encountered in the literature among which experience feedback is drawing more and more attention of researchers because of, among other reasons, the fact that companies dispose nowadays of huge amount of functioning data of their systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology based on experience feedback to identify critical components of a given industrial system. The proposed methodology will be applied to a real world case in broadcast industry to show its feasibility. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid the influence caused by variable speed and noise, a novel fault diagnosis framework based on infrared thermography (IRT) is proposed in this paper. First, the IRT technique is introduced to acquire thermal images. Second, Bag-of-visual-word (BoVW) is used to extract visual features from the thermal images. In the end, the extracted visual features are taken into Softmax regression classifier to recognize the fault types of rotating machinery. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the experimental data. Results show that the performance of proposed method is superior to the vibration based method in identifying ten health conditions of rotating machinery under variable speed condition.

Traditional parity space-based FD is usually difficult to achieve acceptable tradeoff between missed alarm rate (MAR) and false alarm rate (FAR) without the exact stochastic properties of unknown input. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel method of parity space-based FD by MEMPM. Firstly, the integrated design of parity space vector, threshold, MAR and FAR is formulated as a problem of binary classification, i.e., the fault-free case and faulty case. By using the method of MEMPM, a bank of parity space vectors corresponding to different faulty scenarios and a threshold are then obtained, while an optimal trade-off between MAR and FAR is achieved in the worst-case setting. To show the effectiveness of proposed method, a satellite attitude control system subject to roll momentum wheel fault and pitch gyroscope fault is considered.

While, this method can't meet the requirement of real-time anomaly detection for UAV autonomous and safe flight. In order to achieve real-time monitoring of UAV flight status, and improve the reliability and safety of UAVs. In this paper, an on-line and non-invasive embedded anomaly detection system (EADS) is designed to solve the problem of UAV on-board anomaly detection in complex environment. During the flight, whether the sensors and hardware components are abnormal or not is continuously detected via flight data. The proposed embedded anomaly detection system is divided into two parts, (1) hardware platform for heterogeneous calculation is based on Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC with dual-core Cortex A9 processors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA); (2) on-line anomaly detection is based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm, including flight data preprocessing and analysis. The flight data from Flight Gear is utilized for the demonstration of EADS, and the experiment results show that the proposed system is effective for UAV real-time anomaly detection.

Condition monitoring of rotating machinery under varying operating conditions based on Cyclo-Non-Stationary Indicators and a multi-order probabilistic approach for Instantaneous Angular Speed tracking	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control, Continental Automot, Occitanie Reg, Toulouse Metropole, CNES, Univ Toulouse III, Paul Sabatier, Inria, CNRS, OPTITRACK, MDPI, ISAE Supaero, iCODE, EECI, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Moveo		Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Instantaneous Angular Speed estimation; Cyclo-Non-Stationary Indicators; Rotating machinery; Varying operating conditions	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CYCLOSTATIONARITY	During the last decades, an emerging interest has been reported on modelling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary. Several tools, such as the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) and the Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (CMS) have been proposed, assuming constant or almost constant rotating speed. To overcome this limitation, generalizations of SCD and CMS have been proposed that display cyclic Order versus Frequency. On the other hand the estimation of the instantaneous angular speed of the rotating machine is a crucial issue that has to be tackled before any analysis or diagnosis of the machine operating under non stationary conditions. This operation is generally carried out thanks to a tachometer, or an angle encoder, but in some cases this information can be missing for different reasons. The goal of this paper is to combine a novel approach for the analysis of cyclo-non-stationary signals based on the generalization of the indicators of cyclostationarity in order to cover the speed varying conditions, introducing a new speed-dependent angle averaging operator, with a new speed estimation method, that extracts from a vibration signal the most probable instantaneous rotation frequency without focusing on one specific order based on the a priori knowledge of the kinematics of the machine. The effectiveness of the ensemble method is evaluated on an acceleration signal captured at the wind turbine gearbox operating under speed varying conditions.

In this paper, a new method based on deep belief network is proposed for aircraft key parts fault diagnosis. Firstly, a deep belief network is constructed with a series of pre-trained restricted Boltzmann machines for feature learning. Secondly, the highest level features learned from the DBN are fed into a softmax classifier for fault diagnosis. Finally, back propagation learning algorithm is adopted to fine-tune the deep model parameters to further improve the diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental rolling bearing signals. The results show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than other traditional methods.

Autonomous Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method based on Envelope Spectrum	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control		Autonomous bearing diagnosis; Envelope spectrum; Band-pass filter		Rolling element bearings are one of the fundamental components of a machine, and their failure is the most frequent cause of machine breakdown. Monitoring the bearing condition is vital to preventing unexpected shutdowns and improving their maintenance planning. Specifically, the bearing vibration can be measured and analyzed to diagnose bearing faults. Accurate fault diagnosis can be achieved by analyzing the envelope spectrum of a narrow band filtered vibration signal. The optimal narrow-band is centered at the resonance frequency of the bearing. However, how to determine the optimal narrow-band is a challenge. Several methods aim to identify the optimal narrow-band, but they are not always precise. The bearing fault vibration components are lost if the narrow-band is incorrectly chosen, thus leading to an incorrect fault diagnosis. For on-line systems, it is critical that bearing faults are diagnosed with a high degree of confidence. In this article, a method for analyzing multiple narrow bands is presented. Bearing faults are detected autonomously by a narrow-band envelope spectrum-based algorithm. This algorithm removes the need for manual spectrum analysis, allowing operators to focus on more important tasks. Bearing fault vibration data from an accelerated life-test is used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method accurately diagnoses the worn-out bearing for three characteristic defect types and shows when one fault propagates to a second one.

However, there are still many shortcomings restricting the large scale commercialization of PEMFCs, such as the short lifetime and high cost. Accurate prognostics of PEMFCs are very significant for its life and cost management. This paper presents an efficient semi-empirical model-based prognostics method estimating the health state and the remaining useful life of PEMFCs based on the adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) algorithm. AUKF algorithm can automatically adjust the system process covariance and observation covariance according to the estimation residuals, and it also solves the initial parameters setting problem of conventional UKF algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based prognostics method using the AUKF algorithm has better prognostics performance than using the UKF algorithm.

However, the IR image for fault identification requires the process of artificial feature extraction, which is influenced by personal experience. And the sensitivity of the infrared image signal to various faults in the mechanical equipment is still unclear. Therefore, a rotor platform fault diagnosis method based on infrared image and convolution neural network (CNN) classification algorithm is proposed in this paper, which can automatically select the image feature and identify the fault mode. Firstly, the theoretical basis for the fault diagnosis of rotating equipment using IR image is analyzed. Then, the network structure and parameters were optimized for the IR data. Finally, the proposed method is used to diagnose the rotor platform and compared with the traditional way of feature extraction combined with the SVM, which proved that the proposed method has a higher accuracy. The application of our research was on the detection of conditions such as rotor imbalance, shaft misalignment, bearing looseness, rubbing, and coupling of rubbing and misalignment.

In this work, a hybrid ensemble scheme, named Learn (++) NCS, is adopted for diagnosing bearing defects in induction motors. This diagnostic scheme includes a feature extraction module and a hybrid ensemble scheme. The former intends to extract discriminant features from the vibrational signals.

Most existing literatures with respect to the issue of prognostics only deal with one single degradation process or simply use the Copula functions to model the correlation structures for multi-component systems in a statistical sense. In this paper, we mainly focus on the systems with multiple dependent degradation processes from practical perspectives, and then establish a new kind of Wiener process based degradation model in which the dependencies can be directly described by a two-part diffusion coefficient matrix. Following this model, an online RUL prediction method is presented based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. In particular, once the new condition monitoring data are available, the unknown parameters in the model can be updated by utilizing an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Meanwhile, the reliability function as well as the distribution of the RUL at the current monitoring time can be derived by simulating the first passage time of the corresponding degradation processes, according to the predetermined failure thresholds. Finally, the usefulness of our proposed method is validated by a numerical example in regard to bivariate dependent degradation processes.

For this, a model is trained to fit the monitored data of the condition of the equipment. This can be quite difficult and complicated with large and nonmonotonic data. Peaks in nonmonotonic data are data values which are much larger than the others. For nonmonotonic degradation processes, it can be more efficient to predict the time and value of the peaks during the evolution of the condition of the equipment. In this paper, we propose a framework to predict the values of the future peaks. More specifically, data-driven models are trained to predict the next peak values, based on the information of the peaks in the historical data. The trained models are, then, used to predict the next peak values. A real case study regarding the leakage of the first seal of a reactor coolant pump in a nuclear power plant is considered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed prediction framework.

The development and integration of monitoring. diagnostic, and prognostic (collectively known as PHM) technologies can enhance maintenance and control strategies within manufacturing operations to improve asset availability, product quality, and overall productivity. As these teclmologies continue to evolve, it is critical for PHM technologies to be assessed to ensure the manufacturing community is aware of the true capabilities and potential of PHM technologies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has developed a use case that is representative of common manufacturing operations to support the assessment of PHM teclmologies. This use case will produce test scenarios, reference data sets and protocols, and verification and validation tools. The use case is described including its three constituent research areas: Manufacturing Process and Equipment Monitoring, Machine Tool Linear Axes Diagnostics and Prognostics, and health and Control Management of Robot Systems.

A goal of the DOE Light Water Reactor Sustainability program is the accurate estimation of the remaining useful life of nuclear power plant systems, structures, and components. Effective prognostic systems should seamlessly predict the remaining useful life from beginning of component life to end of component life, so-called Lifecycle Prognostics. When a component is first put into operation, the only information available may be past failure times of similar components or the expected distribution of failure times derived from reliability analyses of these data (Type I Prognostics). These data provide an estimated life for the average component operating under average usage conditions. As the component operates, it begins to consume its available life at a rate largely influenced by the system and environmental stresses. Information from these recorded stresses can be used to update the expected failure time distribution (Type II Prognostics). The incorporation of stressor information allows for the estimation of the remaining useful life for an average component operating under specific usage conditions. After continued operations, measurable levels of degradation may evolve, which allows for further improvement of the failure time distribution estimate by incorporating these health indicators (Type III Prognostics). This article presents a framework for using Bayesian methods to transition between prognostic model types and to update failure time distribution estimates as new information becomes available.

In this context, reliability analysis and efficient maintenance decision-making are strongly required. Reliability analysis needs collecting, modeling and analysis different types of measure especially for deteriorating systems. In presence of information data on system deterioration level or health indicator, the development of an accurate mathematical model describing the system behavior is indispensable. Stochastic processes are suitable tools to model the system behavior by taking into account its dynamic evolution and the possible influencing random phenomenon. The stochastic processes are largely used in reliability modeling and prognostics e.g. Markov chains, birth processes, counting processes, Gamma processes, and Wiener processes. In the case of gradually deteriorating systems, mainly Gamma and Wiener processes are considered to model the evolution of the deterioration in time respectively for monotonically deteriorating systems [1] and for non-monotone phenomenon [2]. A more general framework that encompasses these latter models is the diffusion process. In this framework the process is defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation which means that each infinitesimal increment of degradation is described by the sum of drift and a random perturbation. Sudden events and relatively large fluctuations that may appear in real data variation can also be represented by allowing the stochastic process to include "jumps factors". One important type of stochastic process that has the ability to describe the general behavior of data evolution as well as the particular large fluctuations is the jump-diffusion process. In this paper, based on a case study related to real collected data, the aim is to predict as precise as possible the failure time presented by the first crossing time of a given failure threshold by the deterioration level. In this purpose, a jump-diffusion process is used to model the data evolution and predict the future behavior of the system under consideration. The given dataset consists in several independent non-monotone trajectories considered as the deterioration trajectories of different items. The variance behavior is found to be similar for the different independent trajectories. According to the variance behavior a division of the time domain into three different states is proposed. The transition between these states is supposed to be controlled by an explanatory variable, called covariate, following a Markov chain. At each state, data evolution is considered to follow the jump-diffusion process with Log-Uniform Jump Amplitude (log-normal distributed increments with jumps). The data fitting and parameters estimations are detailed in the rest of this paper. Eventually, the resulting model is used in forecasting and risk prediction. Giving an estimation of the future evolution of system within a certain confidence interval, this model permits to schedule the maintenance actions.

In some mobile machines, machine behaviour is affected by various device parameters. Their effect can be examined by statistical analysis, but exploiting analysis results during machine operation requires a sophisticated distributed information system. This paper introduces an architecture for such a system suitable for geographically dispersed machine fleets. It covers aspects on data collection, storage, analysis and utilization. Once statistical analysis has been performed, its results are made available for applications that assess machine performance locally during operation. If there is room for improvement in parameter values, the operator of the machine is given suggestions to change them. A prototype implementation is presented. The results show that such an information system has a considerable potential of bringing competitive advantage to machine operators. Besides, added value is also expected to the manufacturer of the machine as performance-related knowledge is augmented. Thus, further service business development is also contributed.

Experience Based Approach for Li-ion Batteries RUL Prediction	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	15th IFAC Symposium on Information Control Problems in Manufacturing	MAY 11-13, 2015	Ottawa, CANADA			Five to ten keywords; preferably chosen from the IFAC keyword list	PROGNOSTICS	Prognostics and Health Management, is an engineering discipline gaining an increasing interest as it aims at, improving the safety and the reliability of reducing maintenance costs by providing an accurate estimation about the remaining useful life RUL and current health status of the equipment. In practice, this RUL estimation is a challenging task. The challenges come from the nature of data and the context in which the equipment was run. The behavior of a system run under different operating profiles is difficult to predict. In this paper, an experience based approach for RUL prediction is presented and tested an real Li-ion batteries data set, collected at different operational profiles. The degradation of the components is represented by health indicators obtained by learning a regression model. The regression model is trained using run-to-failure data and knowledge extracted from the latter. RUL is predicted by retrieving the most, similar instance. obtained results are interesting.

Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been used as an efficient tool for modeling the deterioration mechanisms as well as for estimating the RUL of monitored equipment. However, due to some assumptions not always justified in practice, the applications of HMM on real-life problems are still very limited. To tackle this issue and to relax some of these unrealistic assumptions, this paper proposes a multi-branch Hidden semi-Markov modeling (MB-HSMM) framework. The proposed deterioration model comprises several different branches, each one being itself an HSMM. The proposed model offers thus the capacity to 1) explicitly model the sojourn time in the different states and 2) take into account multiple co-existing and competing deterioration modes, even within a single component. A diagnosis and RUL prognosis methodology based on the MB-HSMM model is also proposed. Thanks to its multiple branches property, the MB-HSMM model makes it possible not only to assess the current health status of the component but also to detect the actual deterioration mechanism. Based on the diagnostic results, the component RUL can then be calculated. The performance of the proposed model and prognosis method is evaluated through a numerical study. A Fatigue Crack Growth (FCG) model based on the Paris-Erdogan law is used to simulate deterioration data of a bearing under different operation conditions. The results show that the proposed MB-HSMM gives a very promising performance in deterioration mode detection as well as in the RUL estimation, especially in the case where these deterioration modes exhibit very different dynamics.

Ltd		Fault diagnosis; Bearing; Synchrosque-ezed wavelet transforms; Support vector machine		Bearing fault diagnosis is significant for the safe operation of machine devices. And the vibration signals can reflect the conditions of bearings, but they are non-stationary. In this study, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method is proposed by Synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms (SWT) and support vector machine (SVM). First of all, the vibration signal is decomposed into some intrinsic mode type functions (IMTFs) using SWT, and then the SWT energy entropy is computed, which shows the energy entropy varies with the fault types. Thus, the energy distribution of each IMTF is exacted as feature vectors. SVM is then used to classify the conditions of bearings. The experimental results show that this algorithm can achieve the accuracy of 100%. Besides, the effect of fault conditions on the Synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms is studied, and the results show that this method does not depend on fault severity.

To ensure Li-ion batteries in these devices operate reliably, it is important to be able to assess the capacity of Li-ion battery and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) throughout the whole life-time. This paper presents an integrated method for the capacity estimation and RUL prediction of Li-ion battery used in implantable medical devices. A state projection scheme from the author's previous study is used for the capacity estimation. Then, based on the capacity estimates, the Gauss-Hermite particle filter technique is used to project the capacity fade to the end-of-service (EOS) value (or the failure limit) for the RUL prediction. Results of 10 years' continuous cycling test on Li-ion prismatic cells in the lab suggest that the proposed method achieves good accuracy in the capacity estimation and captures the uncertainty in the RUL prediction.

This paper addresses the problem of estimating RUL from observed degradation data. A Wiener-process-based model for online lifetime prediction is developed to achieve this aim. In this paper a Wiener process with non-linear drift and measurement error is used to characterize the degradation process and for online RUL prediction, we exploit an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) based approach for lifetime and parameter jointly estimation. We treat the parameters of the Wiener process as the state of UKF so it can be updated once new data come.

However, the advent of FEVs in mass production presents new challenges to automotive manufacturers due to the immaturity of the new building blocks, which can reduce FEV's safety and reliability. In this context, research activity is currently devoted to the development of prognostics and health management systems (PHMSs) which aim at providing information on the failsafe state of the FEV subsystem and at the prediction of its Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The objective of the present paper is to develop a method to assess the reliability and availability of a FEV subsystem which is monitored by a prognostics and health management system. The method proposed for the assessment is based on Monte Carlo Simulation.

Prognostic Health Management (PHM) of Electrical Systems using Conditioned-based Data for Anomaly and Prognostic Reasoning	2013 PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM)	Chemical Engineering Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Electrical systems, such as those consisting of electrical power driving motors and actuators, are varied and include industrial, aerospace, and automotive applications. These power systems are critical and must provide stable operating voltages for various modules found throughout the host system, including electromechanical actuators (Goodman et al., 2007), CPU-based control systems, and widely varying loads. Operating temperatures can vary as well, with vibration and mechanical shock conditions adding further stress and degradation of components in the power system. A key advantage of electronic prognostics is the monitoring of health of a power system in these critical systems. With prognostics, impending failure can be detected and mitigated. In addition, the prognostics and health management (PHM) system can help optimize the support logistics and reduce costs. In this paper, an overview of signature-based PHM technology to detect anomalies and prognostic reasoning is presented: A signature is extracted from condition-based data and is called a fault-to-failure progression (FFP) signature. Thereafter, a representative PHM system that extracts and processes dynamic degradation signatures for a critical DC regulated power system is described. The hardware and software integration involved with the addition of advanced PHM functionality to a host system is discussed, along with resulting output display and data that can be used to provide dynamic state-of-health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimates.

Many machine learning algorithms and statistical methods can not only realize the RUL prediction but also provide the probability density function (PDF) as the prognostic uncertainty representation, involving particle filter (PF), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), etc. This paper presents a fusion RUL prediction approach with PF algorithm and data-driven autoregression (AR) algorithm for lithium-ion battery. Moreover, a framework to quantitatively analyze and evaluate the PDF distribution of the lithium-ion battery RUL prediction is presented. The probability confidence interval estimation, PDF histogram and distribution hypothesis test are included in quantifying the uncertainty. These quantitative analysis results can be meaningful for lithium-ion battery health management and maintenance. The experimental results with the battery data of NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository show that the proposed framework can achieve the quantification of PDF to introduce the reference for the corresponding maintenance and management. The proposed work also shows potential prospective for industrial application.

The uncertainty must be considered carefully to achieve more effective engineering applications. Uncertainties have been classified as aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty is also called objective uncertainty, irreducible uncertainty, inherent uncertainty, and stochastic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is also referred to as subjective uncertainty, reducible uncertainty and state-of-knowledge uncertainty. A cognitive framework to aid in the understanding of uncertainties and techniques for mitigating and even taking positive advantage of them is presented. From the perspective of man-machine-environment system engineering, the framework is an attempt to clarify the wide range of uncertainties that affect prognostics system. The uncertainty sources are identified as three aspects (machine, environment, man). A general uncertainty management procedure is proposed. It mainly contains uncertainty identification, qualification, propagation and sensitivity analysis. For case illustration purpose, the popular data-driven prognostics methods are discussed in detail. Current and developing methods for dealing with uncertainties are projected onto the framework to understand their relative roles and interactions.

The knowledge of the degradation process is updated through the parameter of the process when new observations are available. The updating is performed through a general Bayesian filtering process within a state space model setting. The proposed adaptive model is history-dependent and can adjust itself to the sudden changes in degradation signals. The numerical case study shows that the variance of the RUL distribution obtained from the adaptive model is less than that of the conventional inverse Gaussian model and the predictive accuracy is improved by using the adaptive model in terms of TMSE. To validate our adaptive model further, we conduct a model prediction accuracy test. Our test result enables us to conclude that our model is stable, robust and beneficial for the application in prognostics and health management of systems.

The failure will seriously affect the competitiveness of the market if the equipment failure. However, fault diagnosis technology plays an important role in the maintenance of equipment and products, fault diagnosis research has gradually focus on condition monitoring, predictive maintenance and early fault diagnostic. The new concept is the use of intelligent maintenance system (IMS), constantly monitoring the status of equipment and product performance, forecasting and assessing, make a maintenance plan to prevent them from fault. The core technology of IMS is predicting and assessment the performance degradation process of the equipment and products. Shock model is one of the important researches in the reliability mathematical theory and describes system failure, maintenance and so the phenomenon of life in randomly changing environment whose central issue of the research is system failure or system life.

It is believed that at least part of these costs can be avoided if adequate system prognosis programs are used. The aim of these programs is to evaluate the current state of an aircraft component based on the available system data (e. g., flight and maintenance data) and to estimate the future performance and the remaining useful life of this component. Several algorithms can be used for this purpose. This paper proposes a method of performing prognostics on aircraft component based a binary classification Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification algorithm. The algorithm is used to classify each flight according to a fault pattern which the algorithm was trained to recognize. Flight data and maintenance logs were used to generate the training and testing datasets. In this case study, for each flight, a number of characteristics were extracted from parameters of the aircraft Air Management System. From the classification results a degradation index is created to serve as an aid to better plan the aircraft maintenance. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require a deep knowledge on the system. Furthermore, it does not need a large amount of input-output samples to be trained. The method should be easily extended to other aircraft systems as long as enough flight data and maintenance logs are available.

This paper presents a novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using Deep Belief Networks (DBN). The DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using the DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing the sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for the diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. The performance of health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification is compared with support vector machine technique and demonstrated with aircraft wing structure health diagnostics and aircraft engine health diagnosis using 2008 PHM challenge data.

Optimal prognostic maintenance planning for multi-component systems	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			OPTIMIZATION	Decision making based on predictions of remaining useful life is still an underexplored area in maintenance management. The objective of this paper is to optimally plan maintenance for a multi-component system considering different levels of dependencies (economic, structural and stochastic dependence) based on prognostic information. The added value of prognostic information in maintenance planning and decision making is quantified. This is achieved by constructing a stochastic discrete-event simulation model, which optimizes maintenance action scheduling by considering different maintenance policies. A multi-objective optimization is performed by taking into account both cost and availability criteria as the maintenance objectives. Considering cost and availability as two separate objectives makes it possible to adapt and find the optimal maintenance policy according to the business environment at the time of decision making. A genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimal maintenance schedule which takes into account the predicted deterioration of all components. The added-value of prognostic - information in maintenance planning is determined by comparing this maintenance policy to five other conventional maintenance policies, which are: corrective maintenance, block-based and age-based preventive maintenance, inspection-based CBM and continuous CBM. A multi-component system is investigated to illustrate the ability of the prognostic maintenance policy to react to different and changing deterioration patterns and dependencies between all considered components. In this way an optimal maintenance policy is guaranteed all of the time and not only over time. The developed dynamic maintenance planning model is illustrated and validated by a real life case study on manufacturing equipment.

The traditional approach depends on constant summary of experiences from the experts. However, the acquired knowledge is probably inaccurate and inefficient. With the benefit of network, the different companies and users that have the same equipments can be organized to form an integrated information source in order to share the original data and diagnosis knowledge. Thus, the more accurate diagnosis knowledge may be acquired using know ledge mining and information fusion so that the precision of status identification can be improved. Furthermore, the diagnostic services based on remote knowledge service can be provided via network. The framework of remote knowledge service system based on web service technology is proposed in this study. Combined with the ferrography analysis method, the application of knowledge service for remote wear debris analysis has been studied and demonstrated in this study.

For this reason, machine condition monitoring has been developed to recognize incipient fault conditions. In this paper, the fault diagnostic problem is tackled within a neuro-fuzzy approach to pattern classification. An important practical issue for the applicability of any diagnostic tool is the transparency of the underlying classification model, to allow for a direct physical interpretation and inspection for validation purposes. In this view, besides the primary purpose of a high rate of correct classification, the proposed neuro-fuzzy approach strives for obtaining also a transparent classification model, i.e. readable and easily interpretable from the physical point of view. To this aim, appropriate coverage and distinguishability constraints on the fuzzy input partitioning interface are used to achieve the physical interpretability of the membership functions and of the associated inference rules. The efficiency of the approach is verified with respect to a literature problem and then applied to a case of motor bearing fault classification.

Our framework consist of two phases: an approximated diagnosis on the first phase and a refined diagnosis on the second phase. On the first phase the system behavior is modelled with a Dynamic Bayesian Network that generates a subset of most likely faulty components. In this phase the structure and parameters of the Dynamic Bayesian Network are learned off-line from raw data (discrete and continuous). On the second phase a Particle Filter algorithm is used to monitor suspicious components and extract the faulty components. The feasibility of this approach has been tested in a simulation environment using several interconnected electrical machines.

To ensure such system operates under working order, distributed parameter values are often inspected from subsystems or different points in order to judge working conditions of the system and make global decisions. In this paper, two parallel decision models based on support vector machine (PDMSVMs) are proposed and applied to the distributed fault diagnosis on diesel engine. Simulation results show PDMSVMs perform well in fault diagnosis. PDMSVMs are very convenient to information fusion of distributed decision system. PDMSVMs make decision based on synthetic information of subsystems and can richly exploit information of subsystems according to significance of subsystems to whole system. Therefore decisions made by PDMSVMs are reliable and accurate.

Early diagnosis and accommodation of faults could enhance safety. Fault-tolerant control is a methodology to help prevent that faults develop into failure. The means include on-line fault diagnosis, automatic condition assessment and calculation of remedial action to avoid hazards. This paper gives an overview of methods to obtain fault-tolerance: fault diagnosis; analysis of properties of a faulty system; means to determine remedial actions. The paper illustrates the techniques by two marine examples, sensor fusion for automatic steering and control of the main engine. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

They are needed as input information for a condition-based predictive maintenance strategy, for process optimisation or even for the identification of vibrations, for example torsional vibrations of the drive train, that may reduce the quality of the product. The structure of a computer-aided machine monitoring system is described with a focal point on a new torque measuring device that is based on strain gage technology. It fulfils the aggravated requirements in rolling mill applications. Some objects of examination and brief results of monitoring activities illustrate the benefit of permanent machine monitoring in rolling mills. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

Indeed, smart monitoring methods, that are implemented in this kind of manufacturing process, allow efficient tracking of a system degradation in real time through appropriate sensors. Then, the sensor data are analyzed and processed to extract effective health indicators for fault detection, diagnostic and prognostics. This paper aims to develop a practical methodology for constructing a new health indicator based on heterogeneous sensor measurements to efficiently monitor system states. The proposed methodology is applied to extract the health indicator of a robot cutting tool (i.e. end-flat mill). This indicator is then used to diagnose the different fault types of the tool by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model.

Due to the increase in the number of industrial robots, it has become more important to prevent any unexpected breakdowns of the factory. As a result, the lifespan prediction of machinery has become a crucial factor because such failures can be directly associated with factory productivity resulting in significant losses. Most of the failures occur within one of the core components of the robot arm, the servo motor, and thus we will focus on the analysis of the servo motor in this study. However, sensor attachment to such equipment is considered difficult due to the dynamic movement of the robot arm, meaning that internal instrumentation should be utilized during analysis. In addition, no definite measure to determine the degradation of the motor exists, and thus a new degradation index is proposed in this study. Therefore, in this study, the lifespan of the servo motor will be estimated through accelerated degradation testing methods based on a new system degradation assessment method, which estimates the fault of the system using observer-based residuals with encoder data obtained from internal instrumentation.

Three-stage Method for Rotating Machine Health Condition Monitoring Using Vibration Signals	2018 PROGNOSTICS AND SYSTEM HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM-CHONGQING 2018)	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Chongqing)	OCT 26-28, 2018	Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Ctr Adv Life Cycle Engn, CAS, Key Lab Space Utilizat, Univ Algarve, Harbin Inst Technol, Chinese Journal Aeronaut, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Carleton Univ, Int Soc Measurement, Management & Maintenance, Life Predict Technologies Inc, MDPI, Sensors		Machine Condition Monitoring; Compressive Sampling; Dimensionality Reduction; Multi-class Support Vector Machine	BEARING FAULTS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; MANIFOLD	This paper proposes a new three-stage method for rotating machines health condition monitoring. In the first stage of the proposed method, Multiple Measurement Vectors Compressive Sampling (MMV-CS) is used to obtain compressively-sampled signals from the acquired raw vibration signals. In the second stage, a process combining Geodesic Minimal Spanning Tree (GMST), Stochastic Proximity Embedding (SPE), and Neighbourhood Component Analysis (NCA) is used to estimate and further reduce the dimensionality of the compressively-sampled signals. In the third stage, with these reduced features, multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify machine health conditions. Experiments on a roller element bearing fault detection and classification task based on vibration signals are used to verify the efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method with fewer features achieved high classification accuracy of bearings health conditions and outperformed recently published results.	[Ahmed, H. O. A.; Nandi, A.

While PdM can be administered using various methods, growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has lead to current state of the art PdM relying on machine learning (ML) technology. Like other tools used in PdM for asset management, standards for applying ML technology for PdM are required. This work introduces a standard of practice in regards to usage of asset data to develop ML analytic tools for PdM. It provides a standard method for ensuring asset data is in a form conducive to ML algorithms, and ensuring retention of asset information necessary for optimum PdM during the data transform. In the ML domain, it has been proven through research initiatives that the data structure used to train and test ML algorithms has a great impact on their performance and accuracy. Using poorly trained models for estimation due to improper data usage, can leave some AI-based PdM tools vulnerable to high rates of inaccurate estimations. Thus, leading to value loss during an asset's life cycle. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, the extensive instrumentation of machines and the advancements in Information Communication Technologies are re-shaping the role of assets in our industrial systems. An emerging concept here is that of 'social assets': assets that collaborate with each other in order to improve system optimisation. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are formed by embedding the assets with computers, or microcontrollers, which run real-time decision-making algorithms over the data originating from the asset. These are known as the 'Digital Twins' of the assets, and form the backbone of social assets. It is essential to have an architecture which enables a seamless integration of these technological advances for an industry. This paper proposes a Multi Agent System (MAS) architecture for collaborative learning, and presents the findings of an implementation of this architecture for a prognostics problem. Collaboration among assets is performed by calculating inter-asset similarity during operating condition to identify 'friends' and sharing operational data within these clusters of friends. The architecture described in this paper also presents a generic model for the Digital Twins of assets. Prognostics is demonstrated for the C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation simulated data-set (Saxena and Goebel (2008)).

Bearing as a critical and fragile component plays a great influence on the health condition and RUL of wind turbines. Thus it attracts more and more attentions. In this paper, a data-driven method to predict the RUL of wind turbine generator bearings is presented. Firstly, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) combined with an indicator is used to de-noise and extract the bearing fault signals from raw vibration signals. Then, the fault development feathers (FDFs) are extracted from the fault signals. After that, the prediction model based on the support vector regression (SVR) is constructed to predict the RUL of the bearings. At last, the performance of the proposed method is cross-verified by actual vibration datasets from two wind turbines. The prediction result shows that the performance of the proposed method is good.

To accomplish a task of this kind, we propose a new method by integration of the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and one-class SVM. The ARIMA model has been introduced and adopted for this problem in a previous work, where parameters in the model are somewhat difficult to estimate. In this paper, we propose to use the one-class SVM for the ARIMA model identification. This replacement can take advantage of machine learning method to learn a more reliable and more accurate model; meanwhile, it uses an unsupervised manner to detect the potential change which makes it different from other existing integrated methods that require massive samples to accomplish a prior model training. We conducted experiments based on an experimental setup. Results along with comparisons with representative methods demonstrated the effectiveness and propriety of the proposed method in real engineering applications.

Sensor accuracy can be affected by many factors such as extreme working conditions, sensor deterioration and interferences from other devices. It may be difficult to distinguish sensor errors and real dynamic changes in a system. A hybrid online multi-sensor error detection and functional redundancy (HOMSED&FR) algorithm is developed to monitor the performance of multiple sensors and reconcile the erroneous sensor signals. The algorithm relies on two methods, outlier-robust Kalman filter (ORKF) and a locally-weighted partial least squares (LW-PLS) regression model. The two methods have different way of using data, ORKF is comparing current signal samples with the signal trace indicated by previous samples and LW-PLS is comparing samples in the past window with the samples from a database and uses the samples with the most similarity to build a model to predict the current signal values. The performance of this system is illustrated with a clinical case involving artificial pancreas experiments, which include data from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and energy expenditure (EE) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) information based on wearable sensors that collect data from people with type 1 diabetes. The results indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect most of the erroneous signals and substitute them with reasonably estimated values computed by the functional redundancy system.

The proposed diagnostic scheme extracts the informative features from each component by resorting to the second generation wavelet transform. Undoubtedly, a large dimension of features brought more challenges to detect healthy and defective bearings. In this regard, the dimensionality reduction phase makes use of linear discriminant analysis that aims to obtain a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data as well as achieves maximum separability between different classes. Furthermore, self organizing maps (SOM) helps in evaluating and facilitating visual comprehension of the extracted features.

The bond graph model that deals with various energy forms in a unified way is constructed to carry out fault diagnosis which consists of fault detection and isolation through deducing analytical redundancy relations to calculate residual of system. The fault estimation is used to identify the parameters of the isolated fault set and determine the true fault as well as remaining useful life prediction. Since the fault parameters exhibit slow-time varying characteristics and the system states show quick-time varying characteristics, the double time-scale particle filter is developed to simultaneously estimate and predict the system states and parameters on two different time scales for diagnosis and prognosis purpose. The effectiveness of the proposed double time-scale particle filter algorithm is validated by the simulation results on the nonlinear electromechanical system.

Their failure can result in unexpected downtime and productivity reduction. Remaining useful life prediction of rolling bearing has aroused extensive attention, since it can avoid failure risks and improve stability and security of operation. This paper attempts to summarize various methods of bearing remaining useful life prediction which can be roughly classified into three kinds: physical model-based methods, statistical methods and condition monitoring data-driven methods. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of each kind of these methods, some advice is given for prediction method selection in practical application. This paper is expected to provide a preliminary understanding of various bearing remaining useful life prediction methods.

Besides, APU also supplies air conditioning and electrical power in the cabin when the aircraft is at the gate. Its reliability determines the flight quality at a large degree. In the future all-electric aircraft, APU will also be adopted to provide some additional thrust. The safety of the more/ all-electric aircraft will also depend on the APU condition. Therefore, how to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the on-wing APU has become an important research interest. In this study, one kind of data-driven RUL prediction approach for APU is proposed, which is based on the combination of mutual information and Gaussian Process Regression. By predicting the RUL of APU, the condition-based maintenance can be scheduled more reasonably and precisely. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by utilizing the on-wing sensing data of APU APS3200 from the Shenyang Maintenance Base of China Southern Airlines Company Limited.

Most of the existing approaches assume degradation occurrence in a single component with a single degradation mode for the simplification of RUL prediction. However, in such system, degradation of many components may occur simultaneously and those may show different unknown linear or nonlinear degradation behaviors in their life cycle. Practically, RUL prediction is complicated when the degradation information is unknown a priori and shows nonlinear behaviour. Thus, this article proposes to progressively obtain the degradation estimates of the components through estimation process after their detection and thus multiple degradation models are postulated on-the-fly using the estimates of the degradations. RULs are regularly updated through adaptive degradation models identified by using the concept of sliding window estimation technique. The proposed technique is demonstrated through simulation on a multi-component electrical system. This article also includes the accelerated ageing experimental result which strongly supports the concept of activation of different degradation modes of the component during its life cycle.

To that goal, predictive maintenance has been founded based on prognostics methods. One of the best ways to present the future state of a machine is to predict its useful remaining life (RUL). Since RUL as the output of the prognostics stage is a quantity related to how much more a machine can properly operate, it can be used to create a flexible and effective maintenance schedule. In this paper, a data-driven prognostics method using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm is presented. This method uses a neuro-fuzzy structure that automatically provides us with optimum clustering, fuzzy rules and structural parameters. The main goal is to estimate the RUL of aircraft engines by studying the engine degradation process with only historical data provided. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by a implementing the method in a numerical example and providing evaluation of results.

First of all, a nonlinear analytical model of the degradation that depends on loading inputs is established. Then, a joint estimation of the unknown loading inputs and of the degradation state is performed with a particle filter. Moreover, a two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm is implemented to detect abrupt load variations and help the particle filter to adapt and learn new loading inputs values. With the combination of these two techniques, the prognosis module could be informed of the sudden crack length increase, and will correct the predicted remaining useful life. Real data from fatigue tests on fiber-reinforced metal matrix composite materials are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology for crack growth prognosis.

Based on review of historical failure data, we have discovered that 70% of their failure modes are not monitored by current commercial monitoring systems, which predominately focus on the internal failure modes associated with partial discharge or overheating using online monitoring methods or embedded fibre-optics. In this paper, we proposed a fusion prognostic model for subsea cable lifetime prediction, employing an analytical model which is supported by accelerated aging data. In addition, we presented the preliminary results of our low frequency (LF) sonar analysis of subsea cables with a view to insitu integrity monitoring of cables. Seminal analysis on the echo data allowed us to distinguish cable samples with different types and diameter differentials of 2mm. Future work will focus on the integration and validation of this sonar data into the predictions of a cable's remaining useful life	[Tang, Wenshuo; Brown, Keith; Flynn, David; Pellae, Hugues] Heriot Watt Univ, Smart Syst Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland	Tang, WS (reprint author), Heriot Watt Univ, Smart Syst Grp, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.	wt15@hw.ac.uk		Flynn, David/0000-0002-1024-3618; Brown, Keith/0000-0001-6836-1572	Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE); EPSRC project on HOME-Offshore [EP/P009743/1]; EPSRC Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets hub [EP/R026173/1]	This research is partly funded by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) (http://sse.com/).The authors from Heriot-Watt University also acknowledge the funding support from the EPSRC project on HOME-Offshore (grant EP/P009743/1) as well as the EPSRC Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets hub (grant EP/R026173/1).

Then the collected information is further used for different purposes, such as performance evaluation, anomaly detection and fault diagnosis of the complex systems. The first step of analyzing the large data sets is to discover the degree of similarity between preliminary given pairs of data sets. In this paper the similarity analysis of large data sets is performed by using the so called grid fuzzy models (GFM), combined with a procedure of fuzzy decision making The GFM are defined over an incomplete grid in the multidimensional input space and the number of the fuzzy rules depends on the concrete distribution of the data sets in this input space. The GFM is used to generate two important characteristics of the data set that are further processed by the fuzzy decision unit in order to produce the similarity degree. The whole technology is illustrated on the example of real data stream from a continuous technological process. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of machining systems, timely fault diagnosis avoids products out of specification and/or extreme machines damage. Optimum machining depends of several parameters, including the spindle performance, within which the bearings system represents the mechanical component with the greatest likelihood of failure. From an exhaustive bibliographic review, the advances in the use of the Wavelet Transform (WT) for the analysis of mechanical vibrations of spindle bearings are presented. A fault detection method is proposed, which automatically detects the frequency range where most information of the faults are located and separates them from other frequencies associated with noise. Early results validated with experimental data are promising. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

LHD machines execute ore haulage from mining faces to dumping points in a cyclic way. Time-varying and harsh environmental conditions determine high workload, so effectiveness demands are big challenges for maintenance staff. One of the most important issue is related to engine overheating, what is the main cause of unjustifiable loader stoppages and unwanted disturbances in production. Operator is obligated to react quickly and switch machine to idle operation until it cools down. Existing on-board monitoring systems dedicated for LHD machines provide data necessary to perform diagnostics of the engine as well as its cooling system. Understanding how load, wear level of machine and ambient temperature influence diagnostic data is the key in development of fault detection algorithms. In this paper, authors propose to use longterm temperature data. The Anderson-Darling statistic is applied in order to detect segments of different statistical properties which are related to different technical condition. Analysis of obtained two-dimensional data structure allows to find points of change of technical condition of the machine. It could be considered as training for diagnostic system that could be used for machine monitoring.

While it is true that time-based maintenance dominates the industry today, it is believed that condition monitoring could yield promising results with a better compromise on cost over effectiveness in the long run. The aim of condition-based monitoring in aeronautics is, based on the available system data (e.g., flight, event and maintenance data), to evaluate the current health state of an aircraft component and to estimate its remaining useful life. Several approaches have been studied in condition-based maintenance with the most promising being data-driven modeling. This paper proposes a comparison of a set of data-driven modeling techniques to perform prognostics on a critical component of the jet engine bleed system. The novelty of our work is twofold. First, we perform this comparative study on a real case study of a critical valve of the aircraft bleed system. Fielded data from different data sources are used in the models. To our knowledge, this is the first case study that merges data from the computer central maintenance system (fault messages), maintenance data, and flight data on a prognostics system. Second, a variety of data-driven techniques are compared from neural nets to regression support machines. The models are compared using the standard metrics of absolute, mean, and squared errors. A regressive accuracy curve is also used to compare the models along different prediction window sizes. The results show the best model comprised information from all data sources. The data that most contributed to the performance improvement was the maintenance, flight and fault data, in this order. This result comes to reinforce the notion that it is more difficult to extract quantitative information from fault events than flight data with data-driven regressive methods.

The approach starts from dynamic clustering results and, combining the information about operational modes, automatically generates a discrete event system that improves clustering results interpretability for decision-making purposes and enhances fault detection capabilities by the inclusion of event related dynamics. The generated timed discrete event system is adaptive thanks to the dynamic nature of the clusterer from which it was learned, namely DyClee. The timed discrete event system brings valuable temporal information to distinguish behaviors that are non-diagnosable based solely on the clustering itself.

Prognostics of Rolling Element Bearings with the Combination of Paris Law and Reliability Method	2017 PROGNOSTICS AND SYSTEM HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM-HARBIN)	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	2017 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Harbin)	JUL 09-12, 2017	Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA	COSIC, Calce, Reliabil Soc, IEEE Harbin Sect, IEEE		Bearing; Prognostics; Vibration Condition Monitoring; Level Crossing; Paris Law; Reliability	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; DEGRADATION; PREDICTION	In this research, a combination of the physical model based on Paris law and probability method is proposed for remaining useful life prediction of rolling element bearings. Level crossing is used as a feature that represents a linear relationship with defect size. Considering this linear relationship and using Paris law, a new model has been developed for bearings that follow degradation pattern with two stages. In this pattern, a bearing starts working in the healthy condition. Then it starts slow degradation stage and finally it goes to fast degradation stage until it reaches to the failure threshold. Considering a normal distribution for transition point from the slow degradation to the fast degradation stage, the model proposed in this article presents a probability distribution for the remaining useful life at any working point in slow degradation stage. In addition, the model presents a good and accurate prediction results in the fast degradation stage. The bearing run-to-failure vibration condition monitoring record is used for investigating the purpose of this study.

Data-driven methods are effective for feature extraction and feature analysis using statistical techniques. In the proposal, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to extract the features and to reduce the data dimension. Then, the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) is used to detect the fault occurrence by comparing the Probability Density Function of the latent scores. The faulty sensor is isolated thanks to a linear combination of the original measurements with binary coefficients denoted as Z-decomposition. The proposed approach is experimentally verified with vibration signals used for monitoring hearings in electrical machines.

In this paper, a novel method of fault pattern identification for rolling element bearing (REB) based on the time-wavelet energy spectrum with the Hermitian wavelet analysis, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The Hermitian wavelet has a desirable ability to detect the singularity characteristic and keep instantaneous phase of fault impact signal. Therefore, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based on the Hermitian wavelet is applied to acquire the time wavelet energy spectrum which indicates the fault statistical feature information. Then, the KPCA is used to reduce dimension of the energy spectrum because of its excellent nonlinearity. Finally, the feature vectors consisted of principle components (PCs) are fed into the SVM in order to realize fault classification. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can not only accurately recognize fault pattern, but also simplify the input of SVM and improve the recognition efficiency.

However, there are cases in which the system may be subjected to more than one failure (degradation) mechanisms due to different stress factors, types of components and their interactions with one another. Recently, we proposed an approach for estimation of RUL of the system with multiple failure mechanisms using the particle filter algorithm and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). However, it is well known that standard particle filter suffers from sample degeneracy and impoverishment. In this study, we introduce the Heuristic Kalman algorithm (HKA), a metaheuristic optimization approach, in combination with particle filtering to tackle sample degeneracy and impoverishment issues and use it for improved prediction /estimation the RUL distribution of any system with multiple failure (degradation) mechanisms.

As the concerned system is getting complicated and more sufficient health monitoring measurement is available, the traditional reliability prediction schemes resorting to only one kind of prediction approaches, model-based or data-driven, begin to show their limitations. This paper proposes an ensemble prognostic method by combining traditional model-based with data-driven approaches. Initially, two member algorithms for state-of-health (SOH) prediction are weighted-sum by utilizing the historical prediction error. Then, to compare the performance of our ensemble prediction with the model-based, data-driven, kalman filter and hybrid approaches, experiments based on electrolytic capacitor capacitance degradation and lithium-ion battery capacity degradation are performed. Finally, by employing the available data as well as dynamically adjusting weights, smaller prediction error and standard deviation are derived.

The manufacturers and users of AMR systems are now keen to include diagnostic features in the systems to improve salability and reliability. However, traditional manual fault detection methods are time-consuming and inaccurate. automatic fast fault detection methods are urgently needed. In this paper, we propose several machine learning based fault detection models to meet this requirement. Furthermore, we use novel boosting strategy to fuse multiple models to leverage multi-aspect information in AMR systems.

This paper presents a health indicator construction method based on distance metric learning (DML). First, multiple features are extracted from the raw monitoring vibration signals, including a designed feature named as average energy of fault frequency band (AEFFB). Then, the optimal features are selected from the extracted features according to monotonicity and correlation metrics, where the correlation metric is calculated by the determination coefficient in random forest regression. Finally, a distance metric is learned utilizing DML, which is then used to construct a health indicator with the help of self-organizing map. The effectiveness of the proposed health indicator is validated by accelerated degradation data of bearings.

A kurtosis energy based spectrum synch (KESS) technique is proposed in this work to detect incipient IM broken rotor bar defect using electric current signals. In IM fault detection, the proposed KESS technique will capture the peakedness of the fault frequency components distributed over several fault related local bands. These bands are synchronized to enhance fault features. A central kurtosis energy indicator is proposed to extract representative features and formulate a fault index for incipient IM fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the developed KESS technique is demonstrated on IM with broken rotor bars. Test results show that the developed KESS technique can detect incipient IM faults effectively.

Thus, prognostic and health management (PHM) of rolling bearing plays an important role on the working status of the machine system. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is the core of PHM. It's well known that original auto-regression (AR) model is suitable for the prediction of linear and stationary time series. However, the collected bearing vibration signals are non-linear and non-stationary. Moreover, most of the existing techniques require considerable training and parameter tuning which are difficult for practical applications. To overcome these issues, a RUL prediction method for rolling bearing degradation analysis is proposed in this work based on sparse coding (SC) and sparse linear AR model without training and parameter tuning. SC is formulated as a basis pursuit Li-norm problem, where a sparse set of weight is estimated for each test vector. Sparse local linear and neighbor embedding are employed to construct the weight constraint sparse coding (WCSC). Fault trend of rolling bearing is indicated via time-domain features, such as root-mean-square (RMS), peak-to-peak (P2P) and kurtosis. Experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for RUL prediction in bearing.

The gene expression data has been widely used in disease diagnosis and deep learning approach has achieved great successes in this task. However, the deep learning approach may fail when the expression data for a particular tumor is insufficient for training an effective model. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning (MTDL) to overcome the aforementioned deficiency by leveraging the knowledge among multiple expression data of related cancers. MTDL learns local features from each task with some private neurons, and learns shared features for all tasks simultaneously with some shared neurons, and learns to inference for each task separately in the end layer. Since MTDL leverages the expression data of multiple cancers, it can learn more stable representation for each cancer even its expression profiles are inadequate. The experimental results show that MTDL significantly improves the performance of diagnosing each type of cancer when it jointly learns from the expression data of twelve cancer datasets.

Dynamic reliability assessment and prognostics with monitored data for multiple dependent degradation components	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde			MAINTENANCE; DIAGNOSTICS; FRAMEWORK	The traditional risk assessment and prognostics take into account data from a population of similar equipment, and, thus, the derived models give always a somewhat average performance of an equipment, not capturing the specific behavior of the individual equipment of interest. By taking into account the monitored data on the individual equipment, the risk assessment and prognostics can be made dynamic and the results improved. In this paper, we consider the dynamic risk assessment and prognostics of multiple, dependent, degrading components. As practical reference, the system considered is composed of two dependent components: a pump, whose degradation is modelled by a multi-state piecewise deterministic Markov process and a valve, whose continuous degradation process is described by a physical model. The monitored data are supposed to be noisy. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that the continuous degradation process, dependencies among components and observation noise are considered in a dynamic risk assessment and prognostics framework. The results on a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the inverter, SiC-GTO (Gate-Turn-Off Thyristor) is considered as the key device to achieve pulse-width modulation. So the performance degradation of SiC-GTO device induced by interface-states is critical for the health conditions of inverters. In the research, key electrical parameters, including the forward blocking voltage and the dynamic switch characteristics, are evaluated for SiC-GTO device with elevated interface-states density. Results indicate that the forward blocking voltage, turn-on/off speed and gate drive current can be used as precursors for the failure. Based on further study, a test structure and an indirect precursor are developed for feasibly application on health prognostics algorithms (data-driven or physics-based) of failure with interface-states accumulation as a mechanism.

Fault Tolerance Considerations for Long Endurance AUVs	2017 ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)	JAN 23-26, 2017	Orlando, FL			autonomous underwater vehicles; fault tolerance; fault recovery; FDIR; technology refresh; safety		Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) work in a harsh and uncertain environment which imposes challenges on their energy, navigation, and communications. Given the environment, there is little bandwidth to communicate solutions to an on-board fault or failure. The AUV application discussed is for Naval Mine Countermeasures (NMCM) survey and minehunting missions. For such missions, operational availability, reliability demands, and system safety are of high importance. To address this, an on-board Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) system is provided by the manufacturer for basic faults like slow leaks, overdepth, and time-outs due to unreceived operator commands. With that, most AUVs can implement a scripted mission but are generally unable to recover from more complex failures like low energy, or reduced functionality in hydroplanes. These two cases are presented here as implemented examples. The examples show that an autonomous on-board recovery system could be devised and implemented for timely recovery from these types of failures. With such measures, the AUV can be adaptive and as fault tolerant as possible to unexpected changes in itself, the environment and the mission. The recovery employed machine learning to gain insight into the best solution for a specific failure and the reason for failure from observations on faults/failures. Further, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) are proposed as a novel FDIR approach towards AUV reliability for long endurance NMCM missions. DBN are suited to address partial observability, uncertainties inherent in the AUV subsystems' evolution, and the subsystems' interaction with the harsh and uncertain environment. This makes advanced reactive and preventive fault/failure recovery possible.	[Seto, Mae.

Firstly, the sample points of the observed composite signals are selected by calculating the direction angle of the composite signal as standard to discard the interference points. And the selected sample points are trained using support vector machine method. Then the optimal classification plane is determined to classify the observed signals. In addition, the mixed matrix is estimated by means of weighted summation of the confidence intervals. Finally, the source signals are separated based on shortest path method. Experimental results manifest the proposed method can extract the fault signal of rotating machinery successfully.

A Data-Driven Approach For Actuator Servo Loop Failure Detection	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control		Flight Control; Fault Detection and Diagnosis; Oscillatory Failure Case; Distance; Correlation; Classification; Support Vector Machines	FLIGHT CONTROL-SYSTEM	This paper studies a data-driven approach to detect faults in flight control systems of civil aircraft. A particular class of failures, referred to as Oscillatory Failure Cases (OFC), impacting the actuator servo loop has motivated the authors to consider a data-driven approach based on distance and correlation measures (see reference [Goupil et al.(2016). A data-driven approach to detect faults in the Airbus flight control system. IFAC-PapersOnLine, 49(17), 52-57] of this paper) leading to promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on analytical redundancy. The present paper extends the formulation and the results of the considered OFC detection approach investigating Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques to define a more accurate detector based on distance and correlation measures.

By fault diagnosis, proper maintenance can be arranged to avoid accidents, ensure safety and reduce maintenance costs. However, variable operating conditions and background noise always reduce effectiveness of traditional fault diagnosis methods. Currently the most advanced machine learning technology, that is deep learning, not only has strong ability for hierarchical representations, but also can adaptively extract feature information from considerable measured data without necessary of much prior knowledge. Nevertheless, only the last layer is utilized for feature extraction in current deep learning models, due to its better performance of feature abstraction and compactness than that of the lower layers. Different feature layers hold different identification ability. In order to consider all features in different layers and achieve effective fault diagnosis, an alternative method of feature ensemble learning based on stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) is proposed in this paper. Our proposed method can be constructed in three steps: first, obtaining the samples of raw data under different health conditions. A deep neural network with multiple hidden layers is then established layer-by-layer by considering each pair of layers as a denoising autoencoder (DAE), with the strategies of greedy layer-wise pre-training and fine-tuning. Finally, softmax regression is created by the last hidden layer and integrate feature to classify different fault types. Feature ensemble is considered by mutually independent rules with different weights according to corresponding accuracy. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated though identifying health conditions of an induction motor.

It is needful to build an efficient and excellent accuracy method to monitoring and diagnosis the baring failure. A novel method is presented in this paper to classify the fault feature by wavelet function and extreme learning machine(ELM) that take into account the high accuracy and efficient. The morlet wavelet function was constructed as the activation function of ELM neural nodes. In order to construct the best wavelet basis function. The minimum Shannon entropy and SVD methods are used to select the optimal shape factor and scale parameter for the morlet wavelet, respectively.

The complex internal gears dynamic behaviors and the resultant vibrations make the fault diagnosis of planetary gears problematic. Effective diagnostic methods for planetary gear system are in demand. In this paper, an order analysis based second-order cyclic function method is proposed to extract the damage caused amplitude modulation under non-stationary operational conditions. The damage caused fault information is emphasized and being extracted and calculated as a distinctive indicator for fault diagnosis of planetary gear system.

A prerequisite for the success of such automation is that the underlying data driving it is reliable. Current technology, however, still warrants human supervision in coping with (data) uncertainties and consequently in judging the validity of machine decisions. In this paper the Ecological Interface Design (EH)) framework is explored to assist controllers in fault diagnosis using a prototype ecological interface (called the Solution Space Diagram) for tactical conflict detection and resolution in the horizontal plane. Results from a human-in -the-loop experiment with sixteen participants indicate that the ecological interface with explicit presentation of the means-ends relations between higher-level functional goals and lower-level physical objects (i.e., aircraft) enables improved sensor failure detection. Especially in high complexity scenarios, this feature had a positive impact on failure detection performance. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation Control) Hosting By Elsevier Ltd.

Since its inception as an engineering discipline, a lot of diagnostics and prognostics algorithms were developed and furthermore methodologies for health management and PHM development established. These solutions were applied in a lot of industrial cases aiming a maintenance transformation. In the Aerospace and Military systems, for example, the PHM has been applied more than 20 years with systems and components applications. During this last decade, the railway industry focused on maintenance issues and expressed a special interest on the PHM systems. The maintenance of the railway infrastructure requires considerable resources and an important budget. Many of the developed algorithms and methodologies can be imported to the Rail Transport systems. However, a methodology to develop a PHM system for a railway infrastructure must be established. This paper provides an overview on the key steps to design a PHM system regarding to the specific characteristics of the railway infrastructure. In addition, tools and procedures for each level of the PHM process are reviewed, as well as a summary of the existing monitoring, health assessment and decision solutions for the railway infrastructure.

Application on multi-stack fuel cell systems is considered. In order to propose a solution to the insufficient durability of fuel cells, the purpose is to define a commitment strategy by determining at each time the contribution of each fuel cell stack to the global output so as to reach the demand as long as possible. Two algorithms making use of convex optimization are proposed to cope with the assignment problem. First one is based on the Mirror-prox for Saddle Points method and second one uses the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) principle. Results based on computational experiments assess the efficiency of these two approaches in comparison with an intuitive resolution performing successive basic convex projections onto the sets of constraints associated to the optimization problem.

It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e.g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the machining centre (e.g. productivity, availability). The mastering of these two types of performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control performances of one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing is to be able to control part deviations from the mastering of the machining centre degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from machining centre performances.

To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. By continuously monitoring turbine health, it is possible to detect incipient faults and schedule maintenance as needed, negating the need for unnecessary periodic checks. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost. In this paper, data is obtained from the SCADA system of a turbine in the South-East of Ireland. Fault and alarm data is filtered and analysed in conjunction with the power curve to identify periods of nominal and fault operation. Classification techniques are then applied to recognise fault and fault-free operation by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show success in predicting some types of faults.	[Leahy, Kevin; Hu, R.

The failure of electro-hydraulic servo valve has great influence to the reliability of hydraulic servo system. The valve element wear failure has a highly frequency and concealment. Failure simulation technology has been widely used in astronautics field, and it also made success in other field. Composition and structure of electro-hydraulic servo valve have been studied in this paper. Mechanism of hydraulic wear fault which mostly caused of abrasion has been discussed. Mechanism study is an important session of failure diagnosis. Model of electro-hydraulic servo valve was built and simulated by using AMEsim. The valve element failure features knowledge base was built by using electro-hydraulic servo valve element wear failure information according to the simulation model. Flow characteristics under different wear condition were simulated by valve element wear simulation. Simulation data was got and simulation curve was fitted. Different degree of valve element could be distinguished by Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which was trained according to simulation data. The effectiveness of electro-hydraulic servo valve simulation model was validated in this paper.

Stochastic resonancep (SR) is a technique to detect weak signal which is swamped in dense noise. However the output results of convential SR methods driven by Gaussian noise are still unsatisfactory to detect mutli-frequency signals. We study multi-stable SR system in the presence of alpha stable noise instead of Gaussian noise to detect faults induced in rotating machines. The alpha stable noise distribution has heavy-tailed fluctuations and infinite variance. It can increase the performance of SR phenomenon when the noise deviates from the ideal Gaussian conditions. The appropiate alpha stable noise level can amplify the weak signal and improves the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the output signal. The simulation results show that the proposed method efficiently detects the weak signals which are submerged in strong background noise. The present method is usable in different scientific and engineering applications.

The degradation process of a system is the result of interaction between its inner states and working environments. To provide a reasonable reference for the sequential decision making based on prognostic result, the influence of operation process has to been incorporated into degradation modeling and prognosis. Therefore, this paper concerns the residual life prediction issue for system experiencing switching operation process whose influence on the system's performance degradation includes both deterioration and shocks. Besides the fact that the concerned system exhibits different deteriorating rates in each operation state, the change of operation states introduces external stresses and causes mutation in performance of the system. Therefore, the operation process depicted through a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) is incorporated into the system's degradation modeling, based on which the system's residual life distribution is derived approximately yet explicitlyafter it is defined under the concept of first hitting time (FHT). Such a residual lifetime distribution is quite desired in prognostics and health management, especially for cases where online updating is required. The proposed approach is illustrated and validated by a numerical study.

Frequency domain reflectometry for remaining useful life estimation of instrumentation and control cables	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE		Nuclear power; cable aging management; polymer aging; frequency domain reflectometry; prognostics; remaining useful life		As the existing fleets of nuclear power plants age, a greater emphasis has been placed on technologies to quantify the remaining useful life of safety-critical components and to ensure that these systems will operate as intended when called upon, especially in emergency situations. Some of the most important, yet often overlooked components, are the cables that provide the signal paths for instrumentation and control systems used to ensure safe and efficient operation of nuclear power plants. Instrumentation and control cable aging, in particular, is primarily concerned with degradation of the polymer material by thermal oxidation while exposed to heat, humidity, radiation, and other environmental stressors. Consequently, as the polymer becomes embrittled, it cracks and becomes susceptible to moisture intrusion that can cause shorts and shunts in the cable circuits. This article describes the development of two prognostic models to estimate the remaining useful life of nuclear power plant cables. The first model uses data compiled in an existing polymer aging database as background for introducing the remaining useful life model development methodology. The second model uses data generated from accelerated cable aging experiments performed by the authors and explores the use of in situ electrical measurements such as frequency domain reflectometry for predicting the remaining useful life of instrumentation and control cables typically found in nuclear power plants.

Power electronic semiconductor devices play an important role in power electronic converter and inverter and rectification systems and design enhance the efficiency of EV performance as well as lowering the cost of electric power propulsion systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a prognostics capability for estimating remaining useful life (RUL) of power electronics components. There is a need for an efficient prognostics algorithm that is embeddable and able to improve on the current prognostic models. A positive aspect of this approach is that the IGBT failure model develops using fuzzy logic adapts prognostic model with the fuzzy nature of failure mechanism. Actually, this method is like adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). We also compare the results from the proposed prognostic model with stochastic Monte-Carlo approach which can efficiently estimate the remaining useful life of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT). The RUL (i.e. mean and confident bounds) is then calculated from the simulated of the estimated degradation states to support on-board real-time decision-making. The prognostics results are evaluated using RMSE prognostics evaluation metrics.

Ltd		health precursor; power MOSFET failure; power convter		Current statistical data show that the failure of power converters is the main cause of entire electronic system failure. This may cause enormous economic loss and even personal injury. The introduction of PHM will guarantee the system to be more efficient and safe. In the power converter subsystem, the switching component (MOSFET or IGBT) is with high failure rate during operation. Based on these, this paper focuses on DC-DC converters, and regards MOSFET failure as the main failure mode. The in-situ prognostics method of MOSFETs is also proposed. The fundamental of MOSFET failure modes and the degradation process are described first. Next, the dynamic process features are analyzed and the turn-on time is selected as a new online health precursor of MOSFET. The accelerated degradation test is used to prepare degraded MOSFET components. MOSFET specimens are then injected into the real DC-DC converter subsystem in order to verify the practicality of the proposed health precursors. Finally, a health monitoring system of DC-DC converters is made to achieve the RUL estimation based on the particle filter.

A novel method is proposed to exploit jointly degradation measurements originating from a set of identical spare parts and maintenance practices for making a degradation prognosis. The systems experience different degradation processes depending on operational conditions, and assumed to be Gamma processes. The aim is to cluster the degradation paths in classes corresponding to the different operational conditions in order to group properly the data for the estimation of degradation process parameters. A model of Gamma process mixture is considered and an expectation-minimization approach is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters. The feasibility of the method is shown on simulated cases. Prognosis results obtained with the proposed method are compared with results obtained with basic strategies (considering each system alone or all systems together).

However, achieving this improvement in reliability, availability, and maintainability, necessitates the development of a predictive monitoring system for the fleet of point machines. This monitoring system would include acquiring the appropriate signals, the use of advanced pattern recognition and statistical methods for finding the early symptoms of point machine degradation, and a user interface for displaying and reporting the health results. This research effort focuses on the development of the statistical and pattern recognition tools for point machine health monitoring. The health monitoring algorithm development was performed for an MET electromechanical point machine, in which a test-bed was constructed for the data collection and algorithm development and validation. The introduction of seeded faults and degraded conditions were used on the test-bed to determine the level of accuracy, false alarm rate, and sensitivity of the health-monitoring algorithm to various failure modes. A series of algorithm processing steps, which include segmenting the point machine movements, statistical feature extraction, and multivariate health assessment tools such as principal component analysis and self-organizing maps were used in this study. The results showed significant promise, and it appears that the health condition assessment is quite good for various levels of friction degradation, obstacle detection, and detecting the higher levels of misalignment. From a technical perspective, future work could include a more robust and general approach for segmentation, along with an improved method for threshold setting. From an implementation perspective, there is still additional work needed for selecting the appropriate hardware and software platform for deploying this health monitoring system for point machines.

Selecting an appropriate maintenance strategy in wide variety of maintenance strategies generates profits. Prior art search has standalone analysis on machines or study on costs experienced in machine maintenance. Interrelated study on machines and cost incurred with maintenance of different individual parts is limited. This work explains when an industry with rotating machines should decide on PHM (Prognostic health management) with cost effective maintenance strategies. Computing, analysis of net revenue for any industry employing rotating machines with measures on improving performance of machines will be profitable. Parameters impacting machines health, failure rate of machine, shell factor, repair rate its impact on revenue of the industry, maintenance strategy which generates maximum profit are proposed. Widely used maintenance strategies i.e. corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance (PM) are reviewed using proposed Cost Benefit Analysis method. Formulated equation of revenue analysis are tested with realistic cost information of an air compressor such as cost involved in labor for repairing machine, establishment of a maintenance strategy, etc. Failure rate, repair rate, life time, etc. of reciprocating air compressor and its components are suggested. Case study on reciprocating air compressor is used to validate results.

Indeed, the prognostics part of the PHM whose goal is to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system in order to furnish the decision part of PHM the information needed for select the good actions has not been really developed for PEMFC. It is then the next step that need development and that would allow to optimize the use of the fuel cell and then extend it's too short life duration. For that purpose, the development of a behavioral model is necessary as it would be able to predict the dynamic of the fuel cell. A model of this kind is developed here, it is composed of a static and a dynamic part. The ageing in this model can be included by the parameters in each parts. However it is necessary to analyze which parameters is critical for the development of the ageing, as the number of parameter is high face to the data available. The discussion of the parametric sensitivity of the model is presented here as well as the validation of the model.

The prognostic method extracts a series of health indices (HIs) with on-line monitoring parameters to conduct indirect RUL prediction. As a result, in-orbit cycle life estimation for satellite can be achieved. The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is applied, in which an optimized AutoRegressive (AR) model is integrated to improve the longterm predicting performance. Consequently, this method constitutes a probabilistic prognostic framework with uncertainty management capability using a heterogeneous mixture distribution fusion, which provides a more comprehensive criterion for decision makers in scientific maintenance. The actual satellite lithium-ion battery data is used to evaluate and verify the proposed approach, and the experimental results prove its effectiveness.

However, the lithium-ion batteries are a core component of many machines and critical to system's functional capabilities. Remaining useful life prediction is central to the PHM of the lithium-ion batteries. The remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries is defined as length of time from current time to the end of available life. An efficient method for the lithium-ion batteries monitoring would greatly improve the reliability of these machines and systems. For the lithium-ion batteries, the capacity induced by the charge-discharge operational cycle is suitable feature to represent battery degradation trend. The main challenges in battery remaining useful life prediction are to improve predicting accuracy and narrow the probability distribution function of the uncertainty. A novel data-driven approach for lithium-ion batteries remaining useful life using an improved exponential model by particle filter is proposed. To validate our proposed prognostic approach high prediction accuracy and small uncertainty, four case studies were conducted. We compared the remaining useful life prediction results associated with the original exponential model using the particle filter method. The experimental results show the following: 1) the improved exponential model needs fewer parameters than the original model; 2) the proposed prognostic method has stable and high prediction accuracy; 3) the proposed method has small uncertainty.

In other words, by clustering products into fleets based on categories of interest (e.g. subsets of assets belonging to the same customer or installed in the same region or operating for the same industrial application) the fleet-specific usage and degradation profiles can be extracted by statistically analyzing the operational, monitoring and failure data of the assets belonging to the selected fleets. In this paper we describe the process of extracting reliability knowledge (in terms of usage and degradation profiles) at the single product level and at the fleet level. The extracted knowledge is then exploited to determine the remaining useful life of a unit in the fleet. In this context, a simple but an effective data-driven prognostic algorithm is proposed. The algorithm makes use of the knowledge extracted at a fleet level to enhance its forecasting capabilities.

Currently, the prognostics and health management research of the power electronic system, including switch mode power supply (SMPS), are based primarily on field data with specified usage stress. The usage stress (including input voltage, temperature, load, etc.) is specific, therefore, it is difficult to adapt to the measurement in other stress conditions. The tolerance of the system is rarely considered. In addition, the basis of the health- assessment is the database containing degradation features of multi-component degradation. However, the degradation degree of components can rarely be controlled by experiment. By injecting degradation parameters of components into the high fidelity SMPS model, a health-assessment methodology for SMPS based on simulation is proposed. Firstly, SMPS with multi-component degradation in various tolerance and stress conditions is simulated by using the design of experiment (DOE) method; Secondly, the testable signals in the system such as output signals and gate-source voltage of MOSFET are pre-treated to reduce dimensionality and to eliminate redundant information, and the database containing degradation characteristics is created. Then, based on the database, the degradation status of SMPS is identified by Mahalanobis Distance (MD) calculation. The methodology proposed in this paper provides a general platform for prognostics and health- management research of SMPS. A flyback SMPS is studied to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of proposed methodology.

The purpose is to provide a production scheduling that maximizes the production horizon. The use of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results in the form of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) allows to adapt the schedule to the wear and tear of equipment. This work comes within the scope of Prognostics Decision Making (DM). Each considered machine is supposed to be able to provide several throughputs corresponding to different operating conditions. The key point is to select the appropriate profile for each machine during the whole useful life of the platform. Many heuristics are proposed to cope with this decision problem and are compared through simulation results. Simulations assess the efficiency of these heuristics. Distance to the theoretical maximal value comes close to 10% for the most efficient ones. A repair module performing a revision of the schedules provided by the heuristics is moreover proposed to enhance the results. First results are promising.

Even if this technology is close to being competitive, it still suffers from too short life duration. As a consequence, prognostic seems to be a great solution to anticipate PEMFC stacks degradation. However, a PEMFC implies multiphysics and multiscale phenomena making the construction of an aging model only based on physics very complex. One solution consists in using a hybrid approach for prognostics combining the use of models and available data. Among these hybrid approaches, particle filtering methods seem to be really appropriate as they offer the possibility to compute models with time varying parameters and to update them all along the prognostics process. But to be efficient, not only should the prognostics system take into account the aging of the stack but also external events influencing this aging. Indeed, some acquisition techniques introduce disturbances in the fuel cell behavior and a voltage recovery can be observed at the end of the characterization process. This paper proposes to tackle this problem. First, PEMFC fuel cells and their complexities are introduced. Then, the impact of characterization of the fuel cell behavior is described. Empirical models are built and introduced in both learning and prediction phases of the prognostics model by combining three particle filters. The new prognostic framework is used to perform remaining useful life estimates and the whole proposition is illustrated with a long term experiment data set of a PEMFC in constant load solicitation and stable operating conditions. Estimates can be given with an error less than 5% for life durations of more than 1000 hours. Finally, the results are compared to a previous work to show that introducing a disturbance modeling can dramatically reduce the uncertainty coming with the predictions.

The method learns the relation between acquired sensor data and end of life time (EOL) to predict the RUL. The proposed method extracts monotonic trends from offline sensor signals, which are used to build reference models. From online signals the method represents the uncertainty about the current status, using discrete Bayesian filter. Finally, the method predicts RUL of the monitored component using integrated method based on K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using two real data sets from NASA Ames prognostics data repository. The results show that the algorithm obtain good results for both application.

In many applications unsupervised learning techniques are preferred in fault detection due to the lack of training data. Unsupervised learning techniques such as k-means clustering are most widely used in machinery health monitoring. These methods face two challenges: firstly, they cannot cluster non-convex data, which may have arbitrary shape; secondly, no rule has been established for these techniques to find a fault threshold. This paper introduces a fault detection methodology based on density clustering to address these challenges. This methodology assumes that data from healthy bearings is located in regions with a high density and data from faulty bearings is located in low density regions. By finding boundaries of these regions, which may be non-convex, data from faulty bearings can be identified. In this paper the value of the density for healthy bearings and faulty bearings is evaluated. The rate of change of the density from healthy to faulty is identified as a fault threshold. The methodology is validated by experimental data. This methodology can be applied to applications where faulty data are too difficult or costly to acquire. Also it can be used in applications where fault thresholds are difficult to determine.

On the use of predictive information in a joint maintenance and inventory policy	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE HORIZON			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Delft Univ Technol, Dutch Soc Risk Management & Reliabil Anal, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			REPLACEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Industrial manufacturing equipment and systems are becoming more complex; this complexity introduces additional interdependencies between components and systems. To cope with this, new maintenance policies like condition monitoring and prognostics are developed to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components. However, decision making based on these predictions is still an under-explored area of maintenance management. Furthermore, maintenance relies on the availability of spare parts in order to reduce failure downtime and costs. Accurate predictions of component failure times can be used to improve both maintenance and inventory decisions. During the past decades, several joint maintenance and inventory optimization systems have been studied in literature. Compared to the separate optimization of both models, these publications reported a remarkable improvement on total cost due to joint optimization. However, the inclusion of RUL in joint maintenance and inventory models for multi-component systems has not been considered before. The objective of this paper is to quantify the added value of predictive information (RUL) in joint maintenance and inventory decision making for multi-component systems considering different levels of inter-component dependence (i.e. economic, structural and stochastic). A dynamic predictive maintenance policy is developed, which optimizes both maintenance and inventory parameters while minimizing the long-term average maintenance and inventory cost per unit time.

This method can carry out ensemble empirical mode decomposition and extract feature information of different machine parts in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. The criterion of adding white noise in EEMD method is established. EEMD is used for avoiding mode mixing in signal decomposition, and it is combined with the AR spectrum in this paper. Then the AR model estimation is applied to each intrinsic mode function and the AR spectrum is obtained. Finally, the proposed method is applied to analyze the rolling bearing vibration signal and the result confirms the advantage of the proposed method.

The traditional empirical data-driven approaches for RUL prediction usually need multidimensional input physical characteristics including the current, voltage, usage duration, battery temperature, and ambient temperature. From the capacity fading analysis of lithium-ion batteries, this paper found the energy efficiency and battery working temperature closely related to capacity degradation, which not only consider all performance metrics of lithium-ion batteries with regard to the RUL but also take the relationships between some performance metrics into account. Thus, we devise a non-iterative prediction model based on flexible support vector regression (F-SVR) taking the energy efficiency and battery working temperature as input physical characteristics. The F-SVR method divides the training sample dataset into several regions according to the distribution complexity and then generates different parameters set for each region, so it can accurately fit the RUL trend. The proposed prognostic method has high prediction accuracy and the proposed model needs fewer dimensions input data than the traditional empirical models from the experimental results.

Second, the condition monitoring data of actual operated equipment is put into least-squares nonlinear regression to obtain the failure rate trend. Finally, the failure criteria are determined with statistical knowledge, and then the remaining useful life of the equipment is predicted.

Particle Filtering (PF) is widely used as prognostic tool in support of PrM, by reason of its capability of robustly estimating the equipment RUL without requiring strict modeling hypotheses. However, a precise estimate of the RUL requires tracing a large number of particles, and thus large computational times, often incompatible with the need of rapidly processing information for making decisions in due time. To circumvent this problem, the Risk Sensitive Particle Filtering (RSPF) technique is exemplified in this work by way of a case study concerning a mechanical component affected by fatigue degradation.

The extraction of the bearing feature signal is critical for signal analysis and fault diagnosis of bearings. In this paper, an adaptive signal processing method is proposed to extract a weak bearing signal from a raw vibration signal. To provide sufficient extremes for signal decomposition using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, a spectral-kurtosis-based band-pass filter is firstly used to process the raw signal, and the EEMD method with parameter optimization is then used to further extract the weak bearing signal. Experimental results of a faulty bearing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Limited by technology and time etc., it is very difficult to model, analyse, and estimate the reliability of an Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifier by means of traditional methods, since Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifiers are characterized by small sample size and long life, and it is hard to get large samples of the failure criteria in a short time. However, the failure criteria of the product are created by combining the Physics of Failure (PoF) analysis and the information from historic data about failed products. Based on the degradation trends and the failure criteria, the storage lifetime of the product can be predicted. Degradation of GaAs microwave device nearly related to stability of device's metallization which includes gate contact and ohmic contact. This article establishes a performance degradation model based on failure physics with uncertain activation energy. High temperature accelerant strass life test was performed on GaAs device to calculation the activation energy, and then uses the performance data and scanty life data to estimate the storage lifetime based on the new model. The instance analysis proves that the failure-physics-analysis-based method for the Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifier is more effective in life forecast and consistent with engineering facts than the fake-life-based method.

This aging causes degradation of the device performance and faults which can lead to the failure bringing huge loss and catastrophic influence. To avoid those failures, the monitoring of the device operation and the detection of an aging state remain as a priority. This paper, at first, describes the failure mechanism of power cycling by analyzing of the structure of lead-based solder and joint failure due to solder fatigue. Secondly, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model supporting uncertainty representation is used to realize the prognosis for the junction temperature of the IGBT. Furthermore, the comparison of GPR prediction with the Neural Network algorithm has been achieved, and the dynamic model is introduced to improve the prediction accuracy for the IGBT health assessment. Meantime, GPR owns more simple computational complexity and less time consuming.

A set of well known computational intelligence techniques such as Decision Trees, Fuzzy Logic, and Genetic Algorithms is used to generate a hybrid model which is called Genetic Fuzzy Rule-Based System (GFRBS) supported by a Decision Tree. The proposed method automatically generates fuzzy rules and tunes the associated membership functions. Accuracy and improved interpretability are achieved during training since they are coded in the fitness function used by the genetic algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of degradation of aeronautical engines. The task is to estimate the remaining useful life of a commercial aircraft engine using only historical data gathered by the sensors embedded in the engine.

B	Javed, K; Gouriveau, R; Zerhouni, N; Nectoux, P			IEEE	Javed, Kamran; Gouriveau, Rafael; Zerhouni, Noureddine; Nectoux, Patrick			A feature extraction procedure based on trigonometric functions and cumulative descriptors to enhance prognostics modeling	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 24-27, 2013	Gaithersburg, MD	IEEE, Reliabil Soc				Performances of data-driven approaches are closely related to the form and trend of extracted features (that can be seen as time series health indicators). 1) Even if much of data-driven approaches are suitable to catch non-linearity in signals, features with monotonic trends (which is not always the case!) are likely to lead to better estimates. 2) Also, some classical extracted features do not show variation until a few time before failure occurs, which prevents performing RUL predictions in a timely manner to plan maintenance task. The aim of this paper is to present a novel feature extraction procedure to face with these two problems. Two aspects are considered. Firstly, the paper focuses on feature extraction in a new manner by utilizing trigonometric functions to extract features (health indicators) rather than typical statistic measures like RMS, etc. The proposed approach is applied on time-frequency analysis with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Secondly, a simple way of building new features based on cumulative functions is also proposed in order to transform time series into descriptors that depict accumulated wear. This approach can be extended to other types of features. The main idea of both developments is to map raw data with monotonic features with early trends, i.e., with descriptors that can be easily predicted. This methodology can enhance prognostics modeling and RUL prediction. The whole proposition is illustrated and discussed thanks to tests performed on vibration datasets from PRONOSTIA, an experimental platform that enables accelerated degradation of bearings.

RUL estimates are presented analytically. Random walk model of finite segments of the wavelet coefficients of observed signal is considered as the original model. We consider all possible cases in the problems of multidimensional random walk vectors free walk, walk with limitations of walk in a multiply connected space. In this case, the problem of RUL estimate is reduced to the assessment of the achievement by the wandering vector the preassigned critical values or areas of critical values. For this the probability of transition from the initial value to some preassigned values is determined using the representation of this probability by the Feynman path integral. During the monitoring of the operation of mechanical block is determined the type of random walk of observable process. After that there is an automatic choice of model for RUL estimates. In some cases it is possible to calculate the Feynman path integral and result analytical formula for RUL estimates. In other cases, after select the type random walk for RUL estimates the solutions of evolution equations for the transition probabilities are studied numerically. It is shown that for the RUL estimates is needed mode of continuous or periodic monitoring, because the state of the mechanical system can change and therefore the conditions of applicability of the random walk model are changed. In this case, the correction of the calculated estimates is needed. Therefore, the paper discusses the issue about prognosis of changing the conditions of applicability of random walk models. The described algorithm is implemented in PHM computing cluster. For full analysis of life time estimates the cloud computing service is used. The experimental data are shown.

Those variables are named Health Indicators (HI) and they are the keystone of PHM. However, they are subject to a lot of uncertainties when computed in real time and the stochastic nature of PHM makes it hard to evaluate the efficiency of a HI set before the extraction algorithm is implemented. This document introduces Numerical Key Performance Indicators (NKPI) for the validation of HI computed only from data provided by numerical models in the upstream stages of a PHM system development process. In order to match as good as possible the reality, the multiple sources of uncertainties are quantified and propagated into the model.

On the other hand, similarity-based RUL estimation approach performs well in thus condition. The basic conception was introduced in the first part and detailed methodology was given in the second part. In this part, a type of Euclidean function was used as similarity-calculation function.

Accurate measurement of the current degradation of system components and structures is important for correct estimates of their remaining useful life (RUL). The propagation of the uncertainty involved in both the measurements and model construction of these system components is vital for finding the uncertainty of the overall system RUL calculation. Prognostic methods should seamlessly operate from beginning of component life (BOL) to end of component life (EOL). We term this "Lifecycle Prognostics." When a component is put into use, the only information available may be past failure times, and the predicted failure distribution can be estimated with reliability methods such as Weibull Analysis (Type I). As the component operates, it begins to consume its available life. This life consumption may be a function of system stresses, and the failure distribution should be updated (Type II). When degradation becomes apparent, this information can be used again to improve the failure distribution estimate (Type III). Current research typically focuses on developing methods for the three types of prognostics. This research focused on developing a framework using Bayesian methods to transition between prognostic model types and update failure distribution estimates as new information becomes available. This paper will present methods developed that integrate models from the three prognostics categories into a single prognostic system to estimate RUL over the life of the component: Lifecycle Prognostics. The methods will also be validated on a range of test beds.	[Nam, Alan; Sharp, Michael; Hines, J.

Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Electric Cables in Nuclear Power Plants	2013 PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM)	Chemical Engineering Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Electric cables help form the backbone of instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants by providing power to electrical equipment and transmission paths for instrumentation signals used to perform safety functions and control plant operation. Operating experience in the existing fleet of nuclear reactors has shown that the number of cable failures increases with plant age resulting in plant transients, shutdowns, and in some cases, the loss of safety functions (NRC, 2012). As a result, cable condition monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation have become increasingly important in recent years, especially as many plants begin operation beyond their original licensing periods. To facilitate the understanding of cable aging mechanisms and degradation detection, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) developed the Cable Polymer Aging Database (CPAD). The CPAD provides a repository of test results from cable aging experiments performed by a number of research institutions and represents one of the most comprehensive sources of cable degradation data that is publically available (EPRI, 2002). This paper describes the process the authors used to select appropriate prognostic parameter(s), develop prognostic models, and estimate the RUL of nuclear power plant cables from the data contained in the CPAD.

To cope with this, new maintenance policies like condition monitoring and prognostics are developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of components. However, decision making based on these predictions is a still underexplored area of maintenance management. The objective of this paper is to quantify the added value of prognostic information (RUL) in maintenance decision making for multi-component systems considering different levels of inter-component dependence (i.e. economic, structural and stochastic). Furthermore, the effect of implementation of the prognostic maintenance policy on the component lifetimes is investigated, as generally in literature the use of prognostics in maintenance scheduling is perceived as to increase component lifetimes. A dynamic prognostic maintenance policy is developed, which takes into account the real component degradation and inter-component dependencies to optimally plan maintenance while minimizing the long-term average maintenance cost per unit time. The added-value of scheduling maintenance actions based on prognostic information is determined by comparing it to two other conventional maintenance policies, these are: age-based preventive maintenance without grouping and age-based preventive maintenance with grouping of maintenance activities. The ability of the prognostic maintenance policy to react to different and changing deterioration patterns and dependencies between all considered components is validated and illustrated by a real life case study on a multi-component manufacturing system. The results show that the developed dynamic prognostic maintenance policy reduces the long-term maintenance costs. Moreover, it is shown that the magnitude of this cost reduction and increase or decrease in component lifetimes depends on the component dependencies.

The principal idea is to first build statistical relationship between failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels on the basis of off-line training data sets, then identify possible failure times for on-line testing units based on the constructed statistical model and available on-line testing data. Specifically, three technical components are proposed to implement the methodology. First of all, a generic health index system is proposed to represent the health degradation of engineering systems. Next, a Copula-based modeling is proposed to build statistical relationship between failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels. Finally, a sampling approach is proposed to estimate the failure time and remaining useful life (RUL) of on-line testing units.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a promising algorithm for RUL prediction because of its advantages to deal with small size of training sets and multi-dimensional data. Recently, many methods of RUL prediction using SVM have been proposed. In this paper, a review over 60 references within the last 10 years on this topic is conducted, which includes introduction of the improvement algorithms and applications of using SVM to predict RUL and possible problems to be solved in future work.

The working principle of fault prognostic model is to train multi-output SVM to fit the nonlinear relationship between performance degradation data and reliability data. The reliability of components can be predicted by using the trained SVM. Finally, a magnetron experimental data as an example is used to verify the prognostic model in terms of prognostics for the electronic products.

According to different machine degradation states, the feature parameters from multifractal aspects are first calculated and further optimized by a MTS statistical method, based on which incipient faults can be subsequently identified and diagnosed accurately. A comparative application study of the effectiveness of the proposed method is carried out through case study of bearings. It is also proved to be a powerful and comprehensive tool for machine's elaborate condition monitoring management which combines a unified representation in both current and predictive perspectives of the fault degradation behavior.

Predictive maintenance policy for oil well equipment in case of scaling through support vector machines	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			TUTORIAL	The formation of mineral scale is a persistent, expensive and one of the most serious problems in oil and gas industries. This may cause undesirable consequences such as unscheduled equipment shutdowns, interruption of oil production as well as economical losses related to oil well unavailability. This paper proposes using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build a non-linear mapping between a set x of variables and the scale build-up y. Thus, SVM will be adopted to predict future scale deposition values over time. Given this model, it is possible to establish appropriate maintenance strategies that aim at preventing wellbore unavailability. In this context, SVM works as a valuable tool to anticipate the knowledge about system failures. An example of application of this methodology is provided considering scaling data obtained from simulated real environmental conditions of deepwater oil wells.	[Moura, M. C.; Lins, I.

In this paper, we discuss a systematic data-driven process for detecting and diagnosing faults in the regenerative braking system of hybrid electric vehicles. The process involves data reduction techniques, exemplified by multi-way partial least squares, multi-way principal component analysis, for implementation in memory-constrained electronic control units and well-known fault classification techniques based on reduced data, such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, partial least squares, principal component analysis and probabilistic neural network, to isolate faults in the braking system. The results demonstrate that highly accurate fault diagnosis is possible with the pattern recognition-based techniques. The process can be employed for fault analysis in a wide variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to buildings to aerospace systems.

However, it can be a non trivial task to develop and implement effective prognostics models including the inherent uncertainty of prognostics. Moreover, there is no systematic way to construct a prognostics tool since the user can make some assumptions: choice of a structure, initialization of parameters ... This last problem is addressed in the paper: how to build a prognostics system with no human intervention, neither a priori knowledge? The proposition is based on the use of a neuro-fuzzy predictor whose architecture is partially determined thanks to a statistical approach based on the Akaike information criterion. It consists in using a cost function in the learning phase in order to automatically generate an accurate prediction system that reaches a compromise between complexity and generalization capability. The proposition is illustrated and discussed.

During a flight mission, the aircraft, the operation of crew members and the dynamic change of flight environments interacts as a system. The change of safety situation of an aircraft should be attributed to the behavior of those human-machine-environment factors, which established the basis of the in-flight safety monitor system designing. The research extends the implementation of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) methodology from aircraft system health to aircraft in-flight safety. An integrated safety monitoring function architecture that developed on the platform of Centralized Maintenance System (CMS) is presented. Starting with identification and selection of a set of flight safety situation indicators that describe the risk level of aircraft system, the safety monitoring system should detect and monitor the operation of crew members, the condition of systems and components and advert of flight environments in a real-time or near real-time manner, determine and assess the safety level of the aircraft instantly, detect and track errors of human operation, anomalies of systems, and abnormal event of flight environment, diagnose the causes for the above abnormal events, and estimate the near future safety situation of the current flight aircraft. During a flight, if there are any abnormal event that may led to a critical safety situation is being detected, the flight safety monitoring system should also trigger a alert or warning report, present the relationship between the information of a abnormal event and its root cause, its effects and consequences, and the emergency response knowledge for it, provide crew members with situational awareness of the system safety, and promote better safety decision support. The technologies and tools for the implementation of flight safety monitoring and early warning are also discussed.

Using thermal image, it is easy to obtain information about the machine condition rather than other conventional methods of machine condition diagnostic technique. Thermal image technique can be successfully applied in the field electrical and electronics system, mechanical system, energy system and medical diagnosis. To get information from the image many techniques of image processing such as discrete Fourier transformation, discrete cosine transformation, neural networks, wavelet transform and many others methods is being used. In this study, our main focal point is to analysis thermal image by discrete wavelet decomposition and tries to find out significant result of machine condition monitoring. In this work, decomposition level of 2 shows satisfactory result for machine condition diagnosis.

Along with developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.

Since Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are building blocks for the electronic systems and their components, the diagnosis and prognosis of potential FET system failures are critical to the flight and ground crew. In this paper, we developed an advanced prognostic methodology based on the Direct Drain Quiescent Current (IDDQ) testing technique for potential Field Effect Transistors (FETs) failures. To predict the Remaining useful life (RUL) of the FET-based devices, a thorough failure mechanism study for FETs was performed in order to select a subset of failure mechanisms that cause progressive degradation and relate with IDDQ signals. With the selected failure mechanisms, we utilized the symbolic dynamics-based method to perform the fault degradation status estimation and a novel Uncertainty Adjusted Prognostics (UAP) method to predict the RUL with uncertainty management. Finally, the prognostic methodology was verified using developed 2-D/3-D simulation models.

A large amount of research has been conducted to investigate good performance networks for practical problems including machinery fault diagnosis. However, due to the complexity of Artificial Neural Networks, there is no easy way to select the best models from amongst the numerous possibilities. Resulting from the fact that networks are initialised randomly, the other problem that multi-layer neural network users often experience is how to achieve network repeatedly. In this paper, a systematic way of finding the best performance networks for prediction of certain pump faults is presented, By comparing a series of network structures, network training times, simulation errors, and correct prediction rates, the performance of the networks were evaluated. The network repeatability was also achieved through Matlab programming. A water pump vibration monitoring system has been set up as a laboratory test-rig and common faults such as pump impeller wearing problems, impeller imbalance problems, and pump bearing faults were simulated on the test-rig. Vibration signals under different pump conditions were sampled and pre-processed before being applied as inputs to multi-layer neural networks. Suitable feature extraction methods for these problems were discussed to establish the patterns for neural network classification.

Its condition monitoring and fault diagnosis have been addressed for a long time. This paper presents a new signal processing method-Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to detect the faults in rolling bearings. The ICA has been widely adopted for blind source separation without any prior information on the sources and their mixing process. However, some limitations exist in natural signals separation because of the embedded noise signal, convolution, etc. In practice, there should exist some prior knowledge useful for source separation about the collected signals. For example, the knowledge about the structure of the machine under examination and the sensor layout are helpful to identify the source behavior and the number of independent components. Considering these prior knowledge, the source separation process becomes partially blind, Example reveals the advantages of this method. The potential applications of Independent Component Analysis in machine diagnosis are also reviewed.

Process data for modeling were provided by the Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.'s Grande Prairie pulp mil. Using the PLS modeling technique, it was found that the breaks process can be modeled with 3 latent variables. Instead of using the numerous process variables, the 3 latent variables (linear combinations of the original variables) were used for process monitoring and fault detection. The developed model indicated to the expert system if the process was trending toward a sheetbreak, at which point the expert system would start trouble-shooting. The expert system was designed to perform diagnosis of the process and identify the cause of sheetbreaks by analyzing information from major operating variables as well as operator inputs. The system would also suggest remedies for the anticipated sheetbreak so that the operators can take corrective action. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

In this regard, some remarkable achievements have been obtained when using Lebesgue-sampling (LS) methods to build empirical degradation models in terms of statistics of the Time-of-Failure distribution, such as the Just-in-Time Point (JITP). This article studies some theoretical issues related to the implementation of LS-based prognostic methods, and analyzes the impact associated with the utilization of alternative procedures for the computation of Time-of-Failure probability density function statistics.

We assume power law (Weibull) form of the time-dependent portion of failure intensity and the Cox proportional hazards assumption for the covariate portion of failure intensity. We model the effects of preventive and corrective maintenance as multiplicative on both time and either health indicator, or raw observed covariates. Thus, we incorporate both time- and covariate-dependent parts, as well as the maintenance effects in one failure intensity function. The effects of preventive or corrective types of maintenance are modelled as different maintenance effect parameters. We derive the likelihood function and obtain the least squares estimates (LSE) of covariate coefficient(s), Weibull shape and scale parameters, as well as the preventive and corrective maintenance effect estimates on time and covariate(s). The application of the proposed model is shown in a real case study of railway point machines subject to periodic preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance on failures.

The excessive time required to diagnose the failure and return the item to service can often be attributed to inadequate diagnostics capability and complex manual troubleshooting procedures. Unfortunately, these problems also lead to pulling the wrong item resulting in Cannot Duplicates (CNDs), repair turnaround time (RTAT) increases and a decrease in field operational availability. While purchasing additional spares, developing more training, and designing more sophisticated external test equipment is a solution to this issue, it is often costly from both a schedule and budget perspective and burdensome for the maintainer, operator and the customer. Alternatively, a solution that enhances diagnostics and decreases the time to isolate a failure is more attractive as it reduces the spares demand and minimizes downtime, thus improving mission availability. Integrating an interactive diagnostic capability within the maintenance environment assists the maintainer in faster and more robust troubleshooting capabilities. A graphical model-based analysis highlights selections of equipment involved in the ambiguity group based on Built-In-Test (BIT) results, failure symptoms, and/or manual troubleshooting outputs. Links to appropriate sections of maintenance procedures are embedded for quick access to remove and replace procedures. This solution transforms maintenance troubleshooting capabilities enabling faster decision cycles and reduced system downtime when failures occur. This paper describes how diagnostic dependency models can be utilized along with developing maintenance procedures to enhance troubleshooting capability. Diagnostic dependency models created during the development phase can be further employed while designing the architecture and approach for maintenance procedures helping solve this diagnostic gap. In summary, this paper features how a diagnostic model-based maintenance capability advances human-machine integration throughout the sustainment phase.

Developed in the scope of the Industry 4.0 Lab of the Manufacturing Group of the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano, the Digital Twin is capable to run in parallel to the drilling machine operations and, as such, it enables to predict the evolution of the most critical failure mode, that is the imbalance in the drilling axis. The real-time monitoring of the drilling machine is realized with a low-cost and retrofit solution, which provides the installation of a Raspberry-Pi accelerometer, able to enhance the extant automation. Relying on a joint use of real-time monitoring and simulation, the Digital Twin implements a random coefficient statistical method through the so-called Exponential Degradation Model, eventually demonstrating to increase the prediction precision as monitoring data arrives. The Digital Twin Proof of Concept is described according to the entire process from data acquisition to Remaining Useful Life prediction, following the MIMOSA OSA-CBM standards.

Maintenance planning and scheduling is one of the most important manufacturing components in such systems, due to importance of availability and high investment for this kind of system. In order to consider real machine operation state, recently, predictive maintenance method is proposed. However, in traditional methods, historical failure data is the main source for this planning. In this paper, we propose a methodology for dynamic predictive maintenance for a real case in automotive industries with considering multicomponent structural and positive economic dependencies between them. In our methodology, we propose to gather data science with mathematical optimization method. Prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machine parts has been made by Artificial Neural Network method with considering sensors data. With this RUL values and other cost values and optimization model parameters, and by solving proposed mathematical model, an optimal schedule is achieved with minimization of maintenance costs. Through a dynamic proposed procedure, when a new data is received, RUL values and model parameters are readjusted and new optimal solution for maintenance planning and scheduling can be achieved.

The approach aims to build a decision support tool (DST) that helps operators in large-scale processes diagnose faults and make the correct decisions that will keep production schedules on track. The idea is to combine diversified supervised and semi-supervised machine-learning methods to exploit the strength of each of them in fault diagnosis. Despite their accuracy in classifying faults, supervised methods have two limitations: they do not provide meaningful explanations about their results and cannot diagnose novel faults. Semi-supervised methods can detect and isolate novel faults but cannot disclose their root causes. The proposed approach uses the best of both, providing operators with a descriptive decision that improves the diagnosability of detected faults, whether novel or not. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a benchmark industrial process. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

It brings a new idea of the complex system fault diagnostics and prognostics. Combining the characteristics of complex system test data and the advantages of deep learning, a fault diagnostics method based on convolutional neural network is proposed, including preprocessing, model training and optimization. Then a complex system fault diagnostic algorithm platform based-on deep learning method is realized. The simulation method of an aero-engine gas path test proves that the proposed method has good feasibility and effect, can fully utilize the advantages of deep learning, and is more suitable for characterizing the complex and varied characteristics hidden inside the complex system data. It can provide the technical support for the design, test and management of the complex system, and improve the safety and effectively reduce the life cycle costs of the complex system.

The system is based on the sub-cycle time monitoring (mini-terms) and how the cycle time variability of machine parts can be used as a deterioration indicator that could describe the dynamic of the failure for the machine parts. The mini-term, by definition, is a sub-cycle time and had only been used to improve production. The most used sensors to perform the maintenance prognosis are vibration, noise, temperature, pressure, flow, etc. These sensors use an abrupt change (Change point) in the measurement as an indicator that something anomalous is happening. The present paper demonstrates that the Change point also affects the cycle time but with some important advantages compared with common sensors, the mini-term is easy and cheap to install. It is cheap because no additional hardware installation is required to measure the sub-cycle time, only the use of the PLC and sensors installed for the automated production process, and it is easy because we only need to code extra timers into the PLC. At the end of the paper is shown the experimental setup to measure mini-terms at Ford plant in Almussafes factory, the so-called Mini-term 4.0 and a summary of the different kinds of pathologies that through the mini-terms we are able to detect until now.

The dependency among cells is critical to the useful life of the pack. Such dependency is attributed to many factors such as battery pack configurations and the mismatch of internal resistance. This paper proposes a general spatio-temporal prognostics method to model and quantify the dependency among cells through a class of selected spatial covariance structure. The covariance function in the proposed spatio-temporal model is estimated based on the cells capacity. Since cell-level capacity measurements in a battery pack may not be directly available, a capacity estimator based on sample entropy of current and voltage is proposed. The capacity degradation behavior of a battery pack with two parallel connected cells is investigated using the proposed method. In addition, the cycle life at pack level is assessed through simulation results from the estimated spatio-temporal model.

The aircraft landing gear shock absorber is a critical system and to enhance its reliability, a health monitoring system can be introduced to detect loads which can impact its structural integrity, functional and performance degradation, operational incidents, impending failures and provide advance warning for proactive maintenance actions. A number of health monitoring schemes have been proposed which check the condition of landing gear shock strut components but these do not provide a systems level coverage and analysis for the different failure modes which a landing gear can experience. With the rapid advances in sensor accuracy, design technology and data communication, a prognostics and health monitoring system design can detect diverse functional and operational failure conditions, support maintenance activities and ensure higher aircraft operational availability.

But most of existing data-driven prognostic methods still lack an effective model that can utilize operational conditions data to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of engineered systems. To fill these practical gaps, this paper develops a novel prognostic method based on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network. The proposed method can effectively integrate multiple sensors data with operational conditions data for RUL prediction of engineered systems. In the proposed prognostic framework, multiple raw sensors data, operational conditions data, and inspection time epoch are preprocessed to form the desired sequences data with fixed length, and then are taken as main inputs and auxiliary inputs to fed into proposed BLSTM based network. And the labeled RUL are used as actual output for training the proposed model. Different from other deep learning (DL) based prognostic methods, the developed method can simultaneously model both sensors data and operational conditions data in a consolidated framework. The proposed approach is validated through a case study on aircraft turbofan engine, and comparisons with other existing state-of-the-art methods are also included.

This paper identifies the optimal health feature (HF) as well as the state-of-charge (SOC) based optimal testing profile through IC analysis, which enables the LIB health monitoring through partial charging data that is practically achievable for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) application. Experimental data from various different aging profiles have been applied to validate the identified optimal HF and SOC-based optimal testing profile. Impacts of diverse usage patterns on LIB aging are analyzed through different combinations of four key characterizing stress factors, namely, depth-of-discharge (DOD), charging C-rate, operating mode and temperature. Results on impact analysis can be closely related with realistic automotive usage patterns, thus providing useful guidance to the design of battery management system (BMS) to achieve a more reliable prediction of LIB remaining useful life (RUL) and the improved lifetime control strategies.

A hybrid fault diagnosis approach is proposed using model-based residuals as input to a set of data-driven fault classifiers. As a case study, sensor data from an internal combustion engine test bed is used where faults have been injected into the system and a physical-based mathematical model of the air flow through the engine is available. First, a feature selection algorithm is applied to find a minimal set of residuals that is able to separate the different fault modes. Then, two different fault classification approaches are discussed, Random Forests and one-class Support Vector Machines. A set of one-class Support Vector Machines is used to model data from each fault mode separately. The case study illustrates an advantage of using one-class classifiers, which makes it possible to detect unknown faults by identifying samples not belonging to any known fault mode.

The role of prognostic and health management (PHM) in battery application is to ensure that the battery system is reliable and safe through the estimation of State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the battery. Although there is a growing research trend in predicting the SoH and RUL using various machine learning algorithms, there has not yet been many sophisticated works that employ the deep learning algorithms for PHM in battery analysis. This research presents the preliminary development of a predictive data-driven model using Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm. The proposed DNN algorithm is a deep learning approach that is fundamentally based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with advanced hidden layers to analyze more complex data features, such as, the SoH and RUL of a battery. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed DNN algorithm, the lithium-ion battery dataset obtained from the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) is presented as a case study. The proposed deep learning algorithm is compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular ANN. The results demonstrate that the DNN algorithm exhibits in a better prediction. Further, the proposed approach hopes to serve as a benchmark algorithm for all future deep learning algorithms in predicting SoH and RUL of battery data.

Although established practices can significantly reduce the frequency of alarms, operators often cannot resolve the failure cascades commonly occurring during emergency situations. Automating control rooms by incorporating design and operation knowledge about the systems can significantly improve operator efficacy. Intelligent support systems should reduce the amount of information and provide more context to the operators. The operators focus should be shifted from information acquisition to taking informed decisions about mitigation steps. This contribution gives a brief review of the development of Multilevel Flow Modeling (MFM) and its application to provide operators with decision support and situation awareness, focusing on implementations directly utilising the knowledge represented in MFM. Finally, current efforts toward a comprehensive intelligent human machine interface for operators are outlined. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

For an assembled product, the prediction of wear life is difficult because there is no an appropriate method for direct measurement. The direct product of wear is believed to contain key information of the wear status of the contact surfaces and has been suggested as an indicator for mechanical failures. Currently, several online oil debris monitoring methods are proposed with high precision for accurate debris detection, but there is still a lack of a model to describe the relationship between the wear status and the debris. This paper presents a physics-based model to predict the generation of abrasive debris of contact pairs with a certain roughness, so as to predict the wear life of mechanical components. The probabilistic model is given in a numerical way, based on the boundary element method and atomic attrition mechanism. The proposed method is able to provide predictive features of wear debris including the amount, the distribution of sizes and morphological information. Combining the online oil debris detection approaches, the method is applied to the prediction of an aviation hydraulic pump. The experimental result indicates that the method is effective in predicting the remaining useful life of mechanical components.

In the feature extraction step, eight time-domain degradation features are extracted from the faulty variables. A fitness function as a weighted linear combination of the monotonicity, robustness, correlation and trendability metrics is defined and used to evaluate the suitability of the features for RSL prediction. The selected features are merged using a canonical variate residuals (CVR)-based method. In the prognostic step, exponential regression is used in combination with empirical Bayesian algorithm for RSL prediction in the presence of scarce failure data. The proposed approach is validated on failure data collected from an operational industrial centrifugal pump.

Fault diagnosis in gearboxes is a cutting-edge topic nowadays mainly addressed by machine learning approaches. The success classifying a fault under this approach depends directly on the quality of the information provided to the models, and in gearboxes, quality of captured information depends on the place where a sensor is located. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the evaluation of the best of two accelerometers positions for classifying nine severity levels in gearboxes. Based on the performance of LSTM models whose hyperparameters have been found by a Bayesian optimization, we show which one is the best source of information for this layout. Also, we have performed statistical comparisons in order to find any statistical differences between models and accelerometers.

Using a complex control strategy, the generated power is controlled and the effects of the disturbances which occur in the system, including the faults, are rejected, making the proposed solution a robust and a fault tolerant one. The integrated control solution contains algorithms for the appropriate control of both the boost DC/DC converter and of the single phase inverter blocks. The proposed approaches are directed toward developing algorithms suitable for real-time implementation on 32 bit ARM processors.

The proposed FDI method is based on multi-classifier fusion with diverse learning algorithms and configured in a parallel form where a unique module simultaneously performs both detection and isolation tasks. In other words, a multi-classifier-based arrangement is presented on the basis of Mixed Learning strategy where four classic and well-practised classification schemes including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Partial Least Square, and Naive Bayes are incorporated into FDI module in order to make a decision on the occurrence of a fault and its location. Extensive simulation results with a high-fidelity nonlinear spacecraft simulator considering gyroscopic effects, measurement noise, and exogenous aerodynamic disturbance signals show that the proposed FDI scheme can cope with faults affecting reaction wheel torques and obtain promising FDI performances in most of the designed scenarios.

This data is useful for model training as well as for validation purposes. This paper demonstrates how a living lab, consisting of 7 identical drive train sub-systems, can enable smart machine maintenance and support the adoption of condition monitoring technologies in the industry. The living lab allows to perform accelerated lifetime tests of bearings and to speed up the process of collecting large amounts of data about degrading bearings. It is shown that the data can be used to benchmark diagnostic algorithms. Three methods are compared: a data driven approach developed by the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), a diagnostic method of Flanders Make (FM) and an approach developed by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). It is concluded that the method of IMS and FM, employing bearing specific features, tend to be slightly more sensitive to early detect bearing faults than the data driven approach employed by LCM. On the contrary, the method of LCM does not require specific system knowledge and is not limited to bearing monitoring only. The method is more widely applicable to fault monitoring problems. Besides a benchmark study, the living lab can also be used to develop, test and validate new diagnostic and prognostic methods. In this way, the living lab provides opportunities to enable a wider adoption of condition monitoring technologies in industry.

Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault & Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: 1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; 2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures. Finally, the potential challenges that come along with the implementation of Deep Learning technologies for industrial applications are discussed and future research directions are proposed.

However, there have as yet been no specific attempts to apply PHM or another advanced reliability-estimation methods to South Korea's defense systems. We herein examine a feasible application to improve the reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) of defense system performance, mainly through simulation-study-based comparison of South Korean and United States reliability-estimation technologies and strategies. We then provide a long-term-perspective roadmap for the introduction of PHM to South Korea's defense systems. In particular, it is expected that availability improvement in South Korean defense systems can be achieved through accurate RUL prediction by introducing PHM to defense system operation.

Unlike most studies in the literature that focus on chemical analyses, using prior knowledge on the deterioration phenomenon and predefined contaminating parameters, this works aims at defining a general method for water quality contamination detection. Thereafter, it will allow decision makers in charge of water resource management to predict its quality deterioration and anticipate any consequence on human health. To this end, Prognostics and Health Management, which is usually applied on industrial systems, has been transposed to water to continuously monitor it, detect and predict anomalous cases. Due to a high rate of missing values, a model selection method for multiple imputation has been implemented in order to reduce the induced uncertainty of the observations, while a dimensionality reduction method has been performed to mitigate the noise induced by the large amount of parameters of interest (more than fifty). To process the detection, unsupervised and supervised learning methods have been combined, which allowed to determine four classes of water quality and to provide relevant insights on the anomalous cases. Finally, the homogeneity of the resulting classes has been evaluated using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The proposed method does not depend on a specific context and therefore, can be generalized to provide accurate rules for water quality classification of any source of data.

One of the methods to avoid the failures is to use historic data. Using historic data enables us to predict faults and take necessary precautions to minimize the down-fall times of systems and therefore, optimize the overall performance. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) is one of the most conventional ways to assess the risk of system performance. LOLIMOT algorithm benefits from a neuro-fuzzy structure that enables it to provide more accurate RUL estimation results than traditional neural networks or SVMs. To further enhance the LOLIMOT algorithm performance, multiple degradation processes are considered in training the prediction module. In this paper, the enhanced LOLIMOT algorithm is used to perform the prognosis of gas turbine engines using only historic data. In the case study, the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated. The results show that more accurate results can be achieved by using neuro-fuzzy structures in prognosis process.

What do we realize for an affluent society using IoT and AI? It is a matter of great urgency to answer this question. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) actually changed their policy in 2017, from "Digital First" to "IoT First" [1] as shown in Figure 1. METI hopes that IoT and AI will provide clear solutions to home appliance accident prevention and accurate plant maintenance by making good use of big data on network services. [GRAPHICS] Every electrical component has the possibility to report many conditions using data measurement sensors, so it is possible to build big data related to the failure of electrical facilities in network services. However, failure modes of almost all electrical parts involve a sudden breakdown without clear signs of degradation. It is not clear what engineering method is applicable for analyzing big data to provide accurate electrical facilities maintenance. This problem should be solved quickly. The solution should lead to the development of a new risk analysis methodology for electrical facilities maintenance. This paper summarizes the research progress of diagnostic and prognostic techniques for electrical components first, and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of one candidate technology for this research is introduced. This paper discusses the near future goal of plant mechanical facilities maintenance by applying IoT and AI in Japan, and then clarifies the engineering problem for electrical facilities maintenance. This paper further discusses that the latest risk analysis research cases in four engineering fields. Finally, a new research plan for risk-based maintenance (RBM) methodology applying IoT to electrical facilities is proposed.

Prognostics, which is the basis of CBM, deals with predicting the future behavior and remaining useful life (RUL) of systems. In many applications, the system composed of multiple components that are stochastically dependent (S-dependent). Most of the earlier works that characterize RUL estimation of the multi-component systems are developed on the premise that components in a system are independent. The existing methods fail to perform when the components are interdependent. This paper proposes a RUL prediction approach based on instance-based learning considering the S-dependency between multiple components of a given system. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulated dataset is used. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with another popular approach and the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset.

The main problems in the existing HI construction methods are as follows: (1) existing methods use fixed learning rate to train deep learning network, which is inefficient; (2) existing HIs construction methods do not take into account phase degradation; (3) failure threshold is difficult to determine in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. In this paper, a HI construction method of rolling bearings based on a deep convolutional neural network with polynomial decaying learning rate (PDCNN) considering phase degradation is proposed. In this paper, the original vibration signal is input into the PDCNN, and the features extracted from the deep convolutional neural network are input into the deep neural network (DNN) to construct HI. The training label setting takes into account phase degradation. The polynomial decaying learning rate is used to train the neural network efficiently. Examples show that the HI constructed by the proposed method is superior to compared three methods in monotonicity and trendability. The polynomial decaying learning rate can improve the training efficiency of deep neural network and save a lot of time. The value of the constructed HI is in the interval [0, 1], which solves the problem that the failure threshold is difficult to determine in RUL prediction.

However, latent within the data, valuable signals are hidden that, if discovered, can offer abundant information, such as fault detection. Traditionally, principal component analysis has been used to perform fault detection in large, multivariate systems. However, these methods often struggle to find the true origin, as they are susceptible to contribution smearing. In this work, a chemical plant system was analyzed and a novel cluster and detect method for fault detection utilizing machine-learning clustering algorithms was created in aim to improve fault detection time and diagnosis. Plant data containing complex variables were simulated, clustered into groups through a unique algorithm based upon correlations, and analyzed through principal component analysis as individual groups. This approach often resulted in quicker identification and more accurate diagnosis than the traditional principal component analysis method.

An insert breakage detection method based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed, which consists of off-line phase and on-line phase. In the off-line phase, 13 AE signal features were extracted as input and then the SVM model was established and optimized In the on-line phase, the constructed model was used to detect insert breakage. The proposed method was applied and validated by an experiment conducted on a rotor slot milling machine in a factory. The result shows the validity and practicability of this method.

In this paper, a multilayer gated recurrent unit (MGRU) method is proposed, which uses a three-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) to deal with the fault diagnosis of the spur gear. Due to the complexity of the spur gearbox fault, vibration measurement is carried out separately at first. Then the vibration signals are extracted from the time domain and time-frequency domain. Finally, MGRU is used to learn representation and classification. By using this model, fault features can be deeply learned layer by layer, and feature types can be identified with higher accuracy. The proposed method was applied to two spur gears (number of teeth Gearl= 53, and Gear2= 80), which were installed on the input and the output shafts of the gearbox, and there are 10 state modes in total. To evaluate the method's performance, four methods were applied to compare, which are (GRU, multilayer long short-term memory (MLSTM), long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machine (SVM)) respectively. The classification result of MGRU model shows that it is effective for spur gear fault diagnosis.

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning methods, manufacturing systems are able to monitor physical processes and make smart decisions through real-time communication and cooperation with humans, machines, sensors, and so forth. Artificial intelligence enables manufacturers to reduce equipment downtime, spot production defects, improve the supply chain, and shorten design times by using machine learning technologies which learn from experiences. One of the last application of these technologies is the development of Predictive Maintenance systems. Predictive maintenance combines Industrial IoT technologies with machine learning to forecast the exact time in which manufacturing equipment will need maintenance, allowing problems to be solved and adaptive decisions to be made in a timely fashion. This study will discuss the implementation of a milling Cutting-tool Predictive Maintenance solution (including Wear Monitoring), applied to a real milling data set as validation of the framework. More generally, this work provides a basic framework for creating a tool to monitor the wear level, preventing the breakdown, of a generic manufacturing tool, in order to improve human-machine interaction and optimize the production process.

The collected information could be further used for different purposes, such as performance evaluation, anomaly detection, change detection or fault diagnosis of the operating systems. The analysis of the data streams is done by a calculation tool for estimating the similarity level between pairs of given chunks of data from the data stream, considered as data clouds. One of these data cloud represents a prerecorded (previously known) abnormal operation of the system, while the other data cloud represents a current (still unknown) behavior of the system. Then the similarity analysis will show how close the two data clouds are. In this paper we propose a novel method for similarity analysis that uses two types of models called Data Cloud Model (DCM) and Window Cloud Model (WCM). The DCM is obtained from the data cloud that represents a previously known operation of the system, while the WCM is obtained from the newly collected data cloud from the data stream, called window data cloud. Both data clouds have an equal length (number of data). The algorithms for creating the DCM and WCM are explained in the paper. The DCM consists of Active Grid cells that represent approximately the data density within the known data cloud. The WCM estimates the data density at the same active grid cells, but based on the data from the new window data cloud. Both densities are represented as two Histograms that are compared to each other in order to calculate the similarity level as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Another problem discussed in the paper is finding a plausible method for detection of significant changes in the data streams. Here the moving window technique is used for collecting series of subsequent data clouds. Then two procedures of moving windows are run in parallel, each of them with different window lengths, in order to calculate the center-of-gravity of the respective data in a real time. The difference between the results of the two moving windows is used as an estimate of the change in the process operation. Both technologies developed in this paper are explain in details in the paper and illustrated on the example of real data stream from a petrochemical plant.

However, these kernel functions have unsatisfactory diagnosis accuracy when the sample data have a complex and high-dimension space distribution. For enhancing the diagnosis accuracy, this paper proposes the RVM with a new nonlinearly mixed kernel function. This kernel function consists of a weighted Gaussian kernel and a weighted polynomial kernel. For searching the optimal weights of this new kernel rapidly, this paper constructs an ant colony system which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to search the optimal solution. Finally, this paper uses a real DC power supply switching circuit to verify the high diagnosis accuracy of the ACO-RVM with a new nonlinearly mixed kernel function.

Solving these domain adaptive transfer learning tasks has the potential to save large efforts on manually labeling data and modifying models for new machines in the same fleet. Although data driven methods have shown great potential in fault diagnosis applications, their ability to generalize on new machines and new working conditions are limited because of their tendency to overfit to the training set in reality. One promising solution to this problem is to use domain adaptation techniques. It aims to improve model performance on the target new machine. Inspired by its successful implementation in computer vision, we introduced Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to our context, along with two other popular methods existing in previous fault diagnosis research. We then carefully justify the applicability of these methods in realistic fault diagnosis settings, and offer a unified experimental protocol for a fair comparison between domain adaptation methods for fault diagnosis problems.

This network consists of segments of roads, which are grouped into clusters that have similar degradation profiles. These models are applied in order to predict the roads' deterioration, and to estimate the needs for maintenance, as well as to plan for the necessary budget, according to different investment scenarios. Some of these segments' clusters are not sufficiently well defined by the current explanatory variables, such as the segments' structural categories, the functional classes of roads, and the levels of traffic, in order to be adequate predictors of segments' deterioration. This paper presents a project that was accomplished in order to solve the segments' clustering problem that aims at reducing the variability of the performance indices (PI) of segments that belong to the same cluster, at the same age, or at similar profile of degradation. Thus, the paper focuses on the problem of clustering road segments whose deterioration is similar, by using artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, it aims at finding the profiles that best describe segments with similar degradation, and the analysis of this degradation over time. A unique segment's identifier, several performance indices (PI), a set of characteristic factors, and the age at the time of collecting an observation, describe each road's segment. The results show that using artificial intelligent techniques leads to better clustering of the roads' segments and to a decrease in the variability of the performance indices within the same cluster.

Firstly, The PCA is used to extract low-dimensional fault features from high-dimensional fault data to eliminate the correlation between features. Then, the grid search algorithm (GSA) is used to optimize the loss parameters and kernel function parameters of the SVM model. Secondly, low-dimensional fault features are used as input training classifiers for SVM. Finally, fault diagnosis is carried out through feature classification. Simulation results have shown that the diagnostic accuracy could reach 100% when Polynomial kernel function and two-dimensional principal component analysis were used, indicating that this method can quickly and effectively diagnose various faults.

Firstly, the vibration signal is preprocessed, followed by 3-layer wavelet packet decomposition, and the energy entropy percentage of the reconstruction coefficient is extracted as the feature vector. Then, the 8-dimensional fault feature vector is reduced to a 2-dimensional feature vector by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the 2-dimensional feature vector is taken as the input sample of PSO-LSSVM. In order to diagnose the three fault states of the inner ring, the ball and the outer ring of the rolling bearing, four LSSVM classifiers are established. After the simulation analysis of the bearing vibration data, the diagnostic accuracy rate of the LSSVM multi-classifier group was 100%, which proves the feasibility and effectivity of the method.

Several linear regression and deep learning models have been studied to extract features from segmented time windows and learn the degradation patterns. However, distributions of features are varying between source learning domain and target test domains, due to different working conditions and environments. Thus, the generalization of traditional methods will be influenced, which leads to performance degradation. This paper develops a domain adaptive CNN-LSTM (DACL) model to predict the RUL of a system based on the multi-dimensional sensor data. The DACL model combines the CNN and LSTM with domain adaptive transfer mechanism and take the operating conditions into consideration. The features extracted by CNN of both source and target data are transformed to a higher dimensional space by reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and the loss function is compensated by using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to reduce the distributions discrepancy. The model is evaluated on C-MAPSS dataset and demonstrate its performance improvement by comparing with previous methods.

This method consists of multi-sourced monitoring data capturing, data preprocessing and multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based end to end fault diagnosis. As the core of the method, multi-stream CNN integrates feature learning, feature fusion and fault classification into one body, which has two advantages. (1) One is that it can directly process raw multi-sourced monitoring data and learn fault-sensitive features even if the data have completely different formats, which free us from the burdensome signal/image processing and artificial feature extraction. (2) The other is that it can adaptively fuse multi-sourced monitoring data in the feature level, which is propitious to remove the redundant features and preserve complementary information. The proposed method is validated by experimental studies on a rotor test bed, and the results confirm that the proposed method is more effective than other methods.

This paper attempts to survey recent advancements of PHM methodologies associated with deep learning. After a brief introduction to several deep learning models, we reviewed and analyzed applications of fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis using deep learning, respectively. The survey reveals that most existing work utilized deep learning to conduct feature learning from unstructured raw data including vibration data, current signals, images and videos. Deep learning provides a general framework for PHM applications: fault detection uses either reconstruction error or stacks a binary classier on top of the network to detect anomalies; fault diagnosis typically adds a soft-max layer to perform multi-class classification; and prognosis adds a continuous regression layer to predict remaining useful life. We further pointed out some challenges and potential opportunities in the field.

Hence, Health Index (HI) construction is a research field of interest. In conventional HI construction methods, performance features have to be selected manually based on experience and expert knowledge. This is a time-consuming procedure requiring a detailed understanding of the component. Furthermore, outliers usually exist in any HI constructed, and these can result in false alarms when HIs are subsequently used. To solve those problems, a new 'end-to-end' methodology, which combines Deep Convolutional Inner Ensemble Learning (DCIEL) with an Outlier Removal method, is proposed for the degradation assessment of roller bearings. In the DCIEL algorithm, an inner-ensemble structure including multiple Deep Learning (DL) blocks is used to extract features directly from raw vibrational signals obtained from bearings. A novel DL block including two convolution layers and one nonlinear pooling layer is proposed. The obtained features are mapped into the HI using a Global Average layer, an Averaging layer, and a Logistic Regression layer. Finally, a novel outlier removal method, based on sliding thresholds, is proposed in order to detect and remove outliers in the constructed HIs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using an open-source bearing health dataset. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages across multiple HI assessment metrics in comparison with different DL blocks and commonly used HI construction methods.

EARLY FAULT DETECTION OF ELEVATORS USING REMOTE CONDITION MONITORING THROUGH IOT TECHNOLOGY	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th SAIIE Annual Conference on Remote Codition Monitoring for Fault Indication in Elevators using IoT Technology for Improved Maintenance	OCT 25-27, 2017	Vanderbijlpark, SOUTH AFRICA	SAIIE			INTERNET	Remote condition monitoring (RCM) of machines seeks to enhance proactive maintenance through just-in-time responses to machine faults and process deterioration. This approach offers the benefit of reduced manning of machines and robust joint maintenance decisions, due to remote access to the machines' condition. This paper employs a remote condition monitoring approach to two elevator parameters, vibration and machine room-temperature, using an Internet of Things (IoT) device for remote data acquisition and remote fault indication. A remote monitoring set-up was developed that uses augmented sensors, networked connections, and an Arduino Yun microcontroller installed on the elevator system to monitor remotely any deterioration in its working condition. The set-up was configured to monitor the conditions online remotely through an email application service. The data from the email were analysed, and notifications were generated at the machine's severity level. The result showed that RCM enables faster repair and maintenance decisions, prevents the catastrophic breakdown of machines, and serves as a troubleshooting guide for fault diagnosis.	[Olalere, I.

Because time-series data are relatively cheap to acquire, they (e.g., vibration signals) have become a crucial part of big data even in manufacturing shop floors. Recently, deep-learning models have shown state-of-art performance for analyzing big data because of their sophisticated structures and considerable computational power. Traditional models for a machinery-monitoring system have highly relied on features selected by human experts. In addition, the representational power of such models fails as the data distribution becomes complicated. On the other hand, deep-learning models automatically select highly abstracted features during the optimization process, and their representational power is better than that of traditional neural network models. However, the applicability of deep-learning models to the field of prognostics and health management (PHM) has not been well investigated yet. This study integrates the "residual fitting" mechanism inherently embedded in the wavelet transform into the convolutional neural network deep-learning structure. As a result, the architecture combines a signal smoother and classification procedures into a single model. Validation results from rotor vibration data demonstrate that our model outperforms all other off-the-shelf feature-based models.

J	Shin, I; Kwon, D				Shin, Insun; Kwon, Daeil			Lifetime prediction of optocouplers in digital input and output modules based on bayesian tracking approaches	SMART STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Asia Pacific Conference of the Prognostics-and-Health-Management-Society (PHMAP)	JUL 12-15, 2017	SOUTH KOREA	Prognost & Hlth Management Soc		digital input and output modules; optocouplers; lifetime prediction; particle filter; extended Kalman filter Bayesian tracking approaches	PARTICLE FILTER	Digital input and output modules are widely used to connect digital sensors and actuators to automation systems. Digital I/O modules provide flexible connectivity extension to numerous sensors and actuators and protect systems from high voltages and currents by isolation. Components in digital I/O modules are inevitably affected by operating and environmental conditions, such as high voltage, high current, high temperature, and temperature cycling. Because digital I/O modules transfer signals or isolate the systems from unexpected voltage and current transients, their failures may result in signal transmission failures and damages to sensitive circuitry leading to system malfunction and system shutdown. In this study, the lifetime of optocouplers, one of the critical components in digital I/O modules, was predicted using Bayesian tracking approaches. Accelerated degradation tests were conducted for collecting the critical performance parameter of optocouplers, current transfer ratio (CTR), during their lifetime. Bayesian tracking approaches, including extended Kalman filter and particle filter, were applied to predict the failure. The performance of each prognostic algorithm was then compared using accuracy and robustness-based performance metrics.

The approach deals with nonlinear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system subject to degradations. The aim of this work was to estimate online the duration before the system performance requirement is no longer met, this without adding sensors. To carry out this aim, we used a Nonlinear Unknown Input Observer to estimate relevant parameters which are able to characterize system performance and a statistical inference method which is the maximum likelihood estimation to identify the models describing the parameter dynamics To illustrate the performances of the approach, a simulated coupled four tank system was used.

First, the model of an inverter-fed permanent magnet motor, simulated using Matlab/Simulink, is briefly presented. The proposed model enables the generation of electrical, magnetic and vibration signals under healthy and faulty behaviors. The presented work focuses mainly on the rotor demagnetization and eccentricity faults. Then, different indicators including time, frequency, space and space harmonic characteristics are extracted from vibrations for different cases. These features are analyzed with respect to fault type and severity to select the most discriminative ones. For fault detection, a statistical test is used to compare each of the selected indicators with a decision threshold to detect the occurrence of a fault in the motor. The values of different thresholds are calculated in order to achieve a given low false alarm rate (alpha). The test power (1 - beta) of each fault indicator is also evaluated for its corresponding threshold. The fault isolation is then realized using a fault signature table. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on two sets of noisy simulated data related to different machine conditions.

The greater structural flexibility of such machines necessitates considerations of reliable load mitigation techniques in order to alleviate the effects of asymmetric wind loads and fatigue. This paper proposes a reliable load mitigation scheme, referred to as 'fault-tolerant individual pitch control', which involves adjustments in pitch angles of the wind turbine blades individually in the presence of blade pitch actuator faults. The proposed scheme consists of a collective pitch control augmented with an individual pitch control, and a fault detection and diagnosis system. Simulation results obtained for a large-scale offshore wind turbine with a stochastic wind field illustrate effectiveness as well as fault-tolerance of the proposed scheme compared to the scheme based on control of pitch angles collectively. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only ensures more uniform output power with reduced loads on the turbine, but also tolerates the effects of possible faults in pith actuators of the blades.

According to the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), the worldwide global installed wind power capacity has reached 486.8 GW in 2016 and may reach 817 GW by 2021. Commonly, wind turbines (WTs) are located in remote areas with limited access and their maintenance and repairing operations often require the use of expensive equipment such as cranes and lifting machinery, increasing significantly the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs that may far exceed the cost of the failed component itself. Moreover, one of the main sources for the O&M costs is the unscheduled maintenance due to unexpected failures. Therefore, fault diagnosis and prognosis are critical to help reducing O&M costs and keeping wind power a competitive energy source. The main contribution of this paper is an updated, unbiased and repeatable search, review and analysis (summary and classification) of the main approaches, e.g. methods and techniques, for WTs fault diagnosis and prognosis. A systematic review of neurocomputing based approaches is presented, including innovative comprehensive lists of references grouped by the studied WT components. The paper concludes with a discussion on some promising future research directions.

To avoid operational downtime and, even more, accidents timely maintenance of the railway infrastructure becomes a crucial aspect. Current maintenance policies are mostly reactive or periodic, which give surge to a high O&M cost. Reducing maintenance cost while enhancing asset reliability may be achieved through the adoption of predictive maintenance policies. This requires the availability of a condition monitoring system able to assess the infrastructure health state through diagnosis and prognosis of degradation processes occurring on the different railway components. Central to any condition monitoring system is the a-priori knowledge about the process to be supervised in the form of either mathematical models of different complexity or signal features characterizing the health state. This paper proposes a statistical model for the switch panel of railway turnouts that characterizes two key components: railpad and ballast. Exploiting vibration data collected during train passages their natural frequencies are estimated through an estimation scheme based on empirical mode decomposition and subspace identification. By analysing vertical acceleration data corresponding to 400 train passages the estimated resonance frequencies associated with the ballast and the railpad have been well characterized by normally distributed random variables. The proposed estimation architecture and the resulting low-complexity statistical model opens an opportunity for the monitoring of developing degradation processes in the railway's turnout.

The objective of this paper is to describe a process enabling to schedule simultaneously the production activities and maintenance operations. The proposed process is based on a multi-agents system that has shown its effectiveness in dealing with conflict situations. It consists in scheduling the production activities on the resources taking into consideration their health states. Thus, instead of waiting for the resource to fail or of planning in advance preventive maintenances where some would be unneeded, the health assesment functions provide information about the reliability of the production technical resources. Among this information, degradation measurements permit the prediction of the remaining durations of use also known as remaining useful lifetimes. Thus they enable prior planning for maintenance orders and scheduling the production activities, so that conflicts can be managed between maintenance and planning activities.

The goal is to assess the health status of the system and to predict the remaining useful lifetime before observing a failure. In the presented paper, the detection of the degradation beginning, the isolation of the faulty component, and the estimation of the degradation profile are performed in an integrated way by using the Bond Graph tool. Regarding the remaining useful lifetime, it is predicted from the considered dynamic of parametric degradation described by ordinary differential equations. To validate the proposed method, an experimental implementation is done on a mechatronic system. The prediction performances are evaluated by using universal metrics.

A function for a degradation process is numerically determined by using a first stage and a second stage diagnostic bond graph model (DBG). Evaluation of the Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARRs) from the first stage DBG provides residuals that enable to detect the onset of incipient faults. The second stage DBG model accounts for parametric degradation by means of an unknown function. ARRs derived from the second stage DBG make use of the residuals of the first stage ARRs and constitute an implicit relation for the unknown degradation function. The computation takes place online concurrently to the monitoring of a real system and the measurement of its output signals. Once the time evolution of a degradation process has been computed up to some time instant, the time evolution of an ARR residual using it can be projected into the future in order to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system. With progress of time the computation of a degradation process can be repeated and estimations of a RUL can be improved.

However, major challenge is the selection of the handcrafted statistical features, which limit performance of the classifiers immensely. Deep learning, a feature representation based method opens up a new horizon, where feature descriptors are extracted from the raw signals. This paper has exploited merit of deep learning and reports a preliminary findings in motor fault detection using novel semi 2D Convolution Neural Networks. The experimental results of the proposed approach show 3-10% enhanced performance compared to the conventional feature engineering based methods. The computation is relatively faster than 2D Convolution Neural Networks and the generalization of the results is promising for real life applications.

Firstly we processed the collected vibration signal with minimum entropy deconvolution, separating high-low frequency stages and excluding uncertain signal; Secondly the LMD algorithm was applied in the processed signal, the PF components sensitive to the fault feature were selected to reconstruct the signal, and the information entropy was extracted from this signal as fault features; Finally the construction of hypersphere and classification were done by inputting these features to hypersphere multiclass SVM. The validity of the model was verified by analyzing the experimental data.

The traditional health assessment methods cannot accurately characterize the operating characteristics of a multi-state manufacturing system. It has become a bottleneck to limit the development of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) for manufacturing systems. To solve this phenomenon, a novel health assessment approach for multi-state manufacturing system was proposed. Firstly, based on the operating characteristics of the manufacturing system, it is proposed that the health assessment for multi-state manufacturing systems should comprehensively analyze the machine performance state, task requirement state and Work In Process quality state. Secondly, based on the multi-state characteristic of the manufacturing system, the new health connotation of the manufacturing system is proposed, and the operational quality data could be used as a tool for the health assessment of manufacturing systems. Thirdly, the health assessment process of a multi-state manufacturing system with rework process is described based on operational quality data. Finally, a case of a cylinder head manufacturing system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This process will generate masses of original data which would burden the storage and transmission. In data analysis, we can decode the compressed data we saved to recover the original vibration data and implement fault detection and diagnosis etc. with relevant available methods. The majority of the original data would be dropped, which should be an enormous waste of resources. Since the signal can be compressed, we should consider whether we can obtain compressive sampling data directly and omit much data containing useless information at the same time. This idea is the rudiment of compressed sampling. The general method for gearbox fault detection is achieved by using vibration signals which sampled in the frame of Shannon sampling theory. For this issue, a fault detection method based on compressed sampling theory is proposed in this paper. A condition indicator is extracted based on the measurements of the reconstruction deviation, and these reconstruction signal sets are all based on the normal redundant dictionary. The availability and effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the simulation data sets with different faults seeded.

Among these methods, Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machines (DAG-SVM) has been widely adopted due to its ability to handle the multi-class problem. Different from traditional DAG-SVM, a structure-selected DAG-SVM (ssDAG-SVM) is proposed such that the diagnosis performance will not degrade because of inappropriate node structure. By introducing the concept of class separability, the principle of evaluating the degree of class separability is integrated into the process of constructing the DAG-SVM structure. Subsequently, a proper structure can be selected to realize the planetary gearbox fault diagnosis with high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is illustrated by some practical experiments. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, a quantitative analysis method of bearing fault is presented in this paper based on the unit of dynamic mechanism and feature extraction algorithm of vibration signal. Based on this method, vibration signals for different sizes of rolling bearing fault in the outer race were simulated using a dynamic bearing model with five freedom degrees. Then, the quantitative size feature was extracted from the vibration signals with an algorithm of fast spectral kurtosis (FSK) and quantitative diagnosis of rolling bearing fault was obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by practical defective bearing signals of different defective sizes.

This increasing level of interaction and deployment frequency of robot inspections requires an understanding of how we can embed safe and trusted operational architectures within robots. Currently, robots can undertake constrained semi-autonomous inspections, using predetermined tasks (missions) with minimum supervision. However, the challenge is that the state of the world changes with time as does the condition of the robot. Therefore, robots must be able to undertake adaptive measures to support optimal outcomes during autonomous missions. In this paper, we propose an initial architecture to the safe verification and validation of health condition and certification of robotic and autonomous inspection systems for offshore assets. Our first contribution relates to the verification and validation architecture, which takes into account risks associated with asset inspection, safety protocols, evolving ambient changes, as well as the inherent state of health of the robot. The second part of our paper looks to how prognostic analytics can be used to support robot resilience in terms of sensor drift and accurate state of health estimates of critical subsystems. Initial results demonstrate that methods such as relevance vector machines and Bayesian networks can be used to accurately mitigate risks to autonomy.

Predictability property is defined with respect to a subset of discrete states, called critical set, representing for example faulty states or, more generally, any subset of states which is of particular interest from the system's behavior point of view. We define and characterize eventual and critical predictability properties by means of a set-membership-based formalism. Using the proposed framework, it is possible to check predictability properties with polynomial time algorithms.

With the collected fault signals, VMD is firstly applied to decompose the fault signal into some components, after which MAR model is built with all the components and its order is determined by Schwartz Bayes Criterion. Then, all parameters within the MAR model are identified blindly through QR decomposition. Finally, principal component analysis is applied to extract the key features, with which support vector machine is trained and used to recognize the fault mode. In order to assertain the effectiveness of the proposed method, engineering experiment and comparative analysis are conducted. The experimental result shows the superiority of the proposed method.

Under high temperature conditions, this paper analyzes the degradation process of the winding, and determines that the resonant frequency can be used as testing index of its degradation process. Therefore, the resonant frequency is used to monitor the performance degradation state of the transformer winding and realize the advance prediction, which can effectively avoid accidents. Accurate prediction of system reliability is of plenty of importance to engineering systems for accomplishing the designate function and system safety management. As the concerned system is getting complicated and more sufficient health monitoring measurement is available, the traditional reliability prediction schemes resorting to only one kind of prediction approaches, model-based or data-driven, begin to show their limitations. This paper proposes a PF prognostic method by combining traditional model approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by thermal degradation experiments. This method improves the reliability of power system and is conducive to the rapid development of smart grid.

In this paper, an investigation of faulty conditions in an industrial base metal refinery is conducted using standard statistical fault detection and diagnosis methods, and the IntelliSenzo (TM) monitoring dashboard. A workflow for offline fault investigation is described, and demonstrated on the industrial data, highlighting the need for careful record keeping, a structured approach, and iterative investigative steps. Potential propagation paths established links between the identified fault, process variables of interest, and engineering hypotheses, guiding the investigation and leading to recommendations of corrective action to the operating plant. The root cause of the fault (leaking and choked feed valves) were identified as potential causes in the investigation. Plant personnel confirmed that this structured approach, using process data, statistical techniques, and engineering knowledge, could speed up fault investigations, and reduce the costs of production losses and plant downtime.

Then, the derivation of the convexity conditions is introduced. Thus, the total cost function of the optimization problem formulated in the POGS method is guaranteed to be convex, while sparsity are maximally promoted using the non-convex regularization.

To solve this problem, a lossless compression algorithm for mechanical vibration signal based on 2D block adaptive quantization (2D-BAQ) is proposed. The method mainly consists of data segmentation, data transformation, adaptive quantization, and data encoding. Firstly, the original data is divided into blocks and subjected to 2D discrete cosine transform (DCT) to obtain frequency domain data. Then the DCT coefficients are quantified by using data association in the frequency domain data. Finally, the quantization parameters and quantization errors are encoded with lossless arithmetic coding. The compression performance of our proposed lossless compression method for mechanical vibration signal is compared with other compression methods. The experimental results show that our method 2D-BAQ can effectively achieve lossless compression of mechanical vibration signal, and outperform other common compression methods.

A new feature extraction method for gearbox fault diagnosis integrating singular value decomposition (SVD) with multidimensional scaling (MDS) is proposed in this article. SVD is used to extract the singular components (SCs), which reflect the main energy of the vibration signal, and the kurtosis values of SCs are calculated to detect the fault sensitivity of each singular value. The kurtosis-weighted singular values are applied to classify different conditions of gearbox supplemented by the MDS and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) method. Five gearbox operating conditions including tooth breakage, tooth pitting, gear eccentricity and normal are simulated to test the performance of proposed feature extraction method in an experiment rig. Partition coefficient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) are used to evaluate the classification effect of weighted singular values. The result suggests that the proposed kurtosis-weighted singular values perform better in distinguishing the different conditions of gearbox than original singular values.

Poor operating environment often makes them prone to failure, which may cause significant economic losses and catastrophic disasters. Once the incipient fault appears, the machinery will not operate correctly, and even go down. Therefore, detecting their incipient fault as soon as possible is useful for bearing prognostics and health management. According to stochastic resonance theory, the weak signal can be enhanced with the assistance of proper noise in a proper nonlinear system. Therefore, stochastic resonance is suited for fault diagnosis. In this paper, an adaptive mono-stable stochastic resonance based on cuckoo search is proposed for incipient bearing fault diagnosis. The exponential type single-well system is used as the nonlinear system of the mono-stable stochastic resonance. The bearing fault signal after pre-processing is processed by the mono-stable stochastic resonance. The cuckoo search is used to search the optimal parameters of the nonlinear system. The signal-to-noise ratio is used as the evaluation of stochastic resonance. Finally, we conducted two bearing fault test to validate the effectiveness of proposed methods. The results meet the expected effect of the proposed methods.

Moreover, manual feature extraction is often a necessary step for intelligent diagnosis, and such a process relies much on prior knowledge. To solve the above mentioned problems, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis method based on class incremental learning without manual feature extraction. Based on denoising autoencoder, the proposed method obtains the autoencoders using the raw data acquired for each health state. In the class incremental learning process, only the autoencoder of new health state need to be trained while the former trained autoencoders are retained. Test data is classified according to the minimal reconstruction error calculated through the autoencoders. At the end of this paper, the proposed method is validated through vibration data of rolling bearings for rail vehicle. The experimental results show that the presented method is effective.

However, conventional CVA is unable to handle the characteristics of time-varying processes. To address the limitations of the standard CVA for systems with time-varying properties, adaptive canonical variate analysis (ACVA) together with the first order perturbation theory are employed in this paper to detect faults in rotating machines. A bias-corrected exponentially weighted moving average approach is used in combination with the ACVA-based contributions to identify variables that are closely related to faults. The performance of the proposed technique is illustrated with condition monitoring data acquired from an operational centrifugal compressor. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively detect and diagnose faults in real industrial systems under time-varying operating conditions.

In this paper, an intelligent deep learning based method named deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) is proposed. Firstly, frequency spectrum sequences are adopted as inputs to reduce the input size. Then DRNN is constructed by the stacks of the recurrent hidden layer to automatically extract the features from the input spectrum sequences. Finally, softmax classifier is applied for fault recognition. The proposed method is verified with the experimental data, and the results confirm that the proposed method is more effective than traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods.

In this paper, we propose two deep learning models to solve feature extraction problem and faults diagnosis problem. First model is based on Auto-Encoder (AE) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). AE is used to reduce the dimensions of original signal and efficiently extract features. Then the extracted features are classified as the input of SVM. Second model is based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we propose a 1D-CNN model to process the original bearing vibration signal and directly output the type of fault. These models have yielded good results on the milling datasets and CWRU bearing dataset respectively. This paper verified the feasibility of these methods, summarized the application experiences and obtained their performance indicators as a benchmark for research.

Therefore, anti-islanding protection is a critical concern. A novel reactive power variation (RPV) islanding detection method based on correlation function data fusion and support vector machine (CFDF-SVM) approach is presented to reduce the non-detection zone (NDZ) and avoid the false detection caused by pseudo islanding phenomenon (PIP). The feature data sets (frequency, injected reactive power, fundamental and third harmonics of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage and current) are acquired by Fourier transform and fused by CFDF approach After that, the fused data sets are classified into two categories by an SVM approach: islanding and non-islanding. In addition, the proposed approach is based on the active intermittent RPV method which reduced the NDZ fundamentally. Compared with the traditional RPV method, the proposed method could detect islanding event accurately, and the false detection rate caused by PIP is significantly reduced. Then a single-phase-inverter is built by Simulink, the detection results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper aims to develop a novel fault diagnosis method based on modified morphological pattern spectrum (MMPS) and least square support vector machine (LSSVM) to identify the different health conditions of wheelset bearings. The opening minus closing gradient is proposed to replace the erosion and opening operator to calculate the morphological pattern spectrum (MPS) in consideration of its advantage for fault feature extraction. The proposed method is experimentally demonstrated to be able to recognize the different fault types of wheelset bearings.

First, SVESS is proposed and singular value decomposition and reconstruction are applied to the cylinder head vibration signal which is used to eliminate the noise and enhance the weak impact feature information of the signal. Then, the signal is decomposed into several smooth proper rotation components (PRCs) by ITD. Effective components are selected from the PRCs according to correlation criterion, and they are dealt with KICA to obtain independent components whose frequency bands are independent to each other. So the diesel engine fault features are reflected intensively in the sensitive frequency band. Finally, AR model parameters, fuzzy entropy and standardized energy moment of each sensitive independent component are extracted to establish feature space, and they are input into the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) to recognize different working conditions of the diesel engine. The tests results indicate that the proposed model effectively enhance the information sensitivity to diesel engine fault in cylinder head vibration signal and improve the diesel engine fault diagnosis accuracy.

When employing characteristic parameter monitoring method to implement radar fault prediction, the predictability measurement of the observation sequence should be solved first to ensure that the conclusion is valid and credible. Firstly, the composition of the radar performance monitoring sensor network, the characteristics of the performance parameter monitoring sequence and the applicable ARMA modeling prediction algorithm were introduced. Then a method was proposed to determine the predicting time advance applicable for the parameter observation sequences based on phase space reconstruction theory and chaos analysis. The method constructs the optimal embedding space and restores the dynamic characteristics of performance degradation of radar, by which the maximum predictable number of steps based on the largest Lyapunov exponent can be calculated to determine whether the performance observation parameters can be predicted. Furthermore, scientific basis of determining a valid time advance can be provided. Finally, the experimental analysis of radar signal-to-noise ratio parameter observation sequences was carried out, indicating that the proposed method is effective for radar equipment.

However, the bottleneck to improve the diagnosis performance is the lack of valid domain knowledge about bearing fault in the classification or regression model, especially when the collected fault data is insufficient. Moreover, inadequate fault information will result in unstable diagnosis result. To solve this problem, a new bearing fault diagnosis method based on multi-task learning is proposed in this paper. The intuitive point is the bearing fault with similar crack size and loads can provide useful domain information for each other. By considering the diagnosis model on one bearing as a task, this method uses marginal spectrum by Hilbert-Huang Transform as features, and constructs multi-task learning model on multiple related diagnosis tasks with different fault types to improve their diagnosis performance simultaneously. Compared to the single diagnosis task, the proposed method shares the domain information between various fault types and then builds a more efficient diagnosis model. Experimental results on CWRU bearing data set show that, compared with some traditional machine learning-based diagnosis methods, the proposed method can effectively improve the diagnosis accuracy and robustness under different working conditions and it's especially suitable for dealing with lots of tasks with insufficient data. Even with insufficient features, the proposed method gets the accuracy from 77.50% to 94.17%, which indicates the multi-task diagnosis can get help from related bearing fault information.

Acoustic features include the amplitude, frequency, and timbre, with the former two often used as diagnostics features. The timbre is also an indicator of the abnormal operation of machinery. The present study therefore focuses on the use of timbre-based features. Changes in stationary parts of observed acoustic signals (e.g., a change in period, which corresponds to the number of rotations) can be considered a physical quantity of the timbre. Because a rotary machine normally operates at a certain rotational speed, differences in the rotational period between adjacent frames are ideally zero in such normal operation. In contrast, the period differences should not be zero for a machine with a fault because observed signals contain characteristics of both the normal and faulty states and these characteristics vary over time. The present study therefore attempts to exploit the period difference of acoustic signals as a feature representation for fault detection. Experimental analysis conducted using acoustic signals recorded by microphones demonstrates that the proposed feature extraction contributes to the fault detection of rotary machines.

Besides, the gearboxes malfunctioning can cause economic losses, risks to the human safety and can impair the performance of the systems in which they are included. Thus, it is necessary to find feasible and efficient methods to evaluate their physical condition. This work proposes an approach that uses the Fourier Transform spectrograms and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the gearbox fault severity condition by analyzing the vibration signals provided by an accelerometer. We used a dataset with ten damage levels of one failure mode of a helical gearbox operating under different load and speed values to assess the performance of the proposed solution. Three different CNN configurations were compared concerning accuracy, training time and other parameters. The proposed system achieves average values of accuracy up to 0.9743 regarding AUC, while it presents classification times close to 0.03 seconds, showing itself to be a competitive solution.

Statistics show that turnout system faults account for the highest ratio of the total signal system faults. Therefore, many railway sections have installed the MMS (Microcomputer Monitoring System) to keep the condition of turnout systems under monitoring. In this paper, we present a fault mode analysis method based on monitoring data of point machines collected by MMS. Data features are used to identify the common types of fault and create a fault feature logic diagram for fault diagnosis. In addition, this paper also proposes an FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) based method for fault causation analysis. The important degrees of different causes are calculated to find the most likely cause and help improve the efficiency of maintenance work.

In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis method using deep belief network (DBN) via deep-layerwise feature extraction is proposed for rolling bearing fault identification. In this method, discrete wavelet packet transform is first used to calculate the original features from raw vibration signals. Due to information redundancy of the original features, the paper constructs a deep belief network with three hidden layers for deep-layerwise feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by two rolling bearing datasets and comparisons with the traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods are also carried out. The result confirms that the proposed method is capable to detect the faults in rolling bearing and performs much better than the traditional intelligent fault diagnosis method.

With the advantages of requiring no labels and strong online detecting performance, some prognostics methods have been applied to detect anomalies among satellite telemetry series. Especially, the probability prediction models, e.g., Gaussian Process Regression and Relevance Vector Machine, are more suitable to identify these discords with the ability of providing uncertainty presentation. However, the prediction interval (PI) is derived by the optimization on the prediction-related index which is not constructed for the application of anomaly detection, and its performance will be discounted in this case. Thus, this paper introduces the detection-related index, i.e., coverage-width-based criterion (CWC), to optimize the model parameters which focus on the width of PI, as well as the coverage probability of PI. And the experiments on different types of telemetry series validate the improvement of our proposed framework on PI. Finally, the experiment on actual satellite telemetry series with abnormal points validate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed method.

Normally, one has to resort to using sequential updating methods such as the particle filtering approach for effective prognosis and lumen maintenance life prediction of LEDs because of their long lifetime and reliability. However, the performance of the particle filter severely depends on the selection of the initial parameters. Moreover, it cannot deal with situations where there is missing data due to intermittent sensor failure or malfunction. The multi-task Gaussian process regression (MTGP) can model multiple correlated multivariate time series simultaneously. Thus, it can be used to learn the correlation between multiple degradation trends (from different similar units tested) even though they might be sampled at different frequencies and have training sets available only for different time spans. This paper presents the multi output (task) Gaussian process regression as a solution for prognosis of lumen maintenance life of LED devices in the event of "missing" data. We analyze the performance of the MTGP on the LED data extracted from previously published studies and demonstrate that it can give good prediction results even when there are missing data.

In this work, we have explored the degradation of Power MOSFETs due to thermal cycling and used the ON-resistance variation as the failure precursor for prognosis. The particle filter algorithm has been adopted for this purpose and the drawbacks of these algorithms such as particle degeneracy and particle impoverishment have been dealt with. An independent Gaussian jitter noise is purposely added to the resampled particle with the intention of roughening. The results indicate an improvement in accuracy over the standard particle filter algorithm. The impact of different degrees of roughening on the accuracy of RUL prediction is explored and the performance is evaluated using prognostic metrics such as relative accuracy and computational time.

The particle filter (PF) algorithm has proved to be an effective method for prognostics. However, the PF algorithm suffers from serious particle degeneracy and particle impoverishment problems. Most of the studies in the literature focus on solving the particle degeneracy problem but at a heavy computational cost. In this study, we aim to explore the time efficient Partial Stratified Resampling algorithm which can be used for online state estimation problems and compare it with conventional Stratified Resampling algorithms. The accuracy and precision of the algorithms are validated using the lithium-ion battery data sets from CALCE (R) research group.

For fault diagnosis, chronicles describe the nominal and faulty behaviors of the process. Powerful algorithms allow the recognition of chronicles in the flow of observations of the system and appropriate actions can be taken when a faulty situation is recognized. However, designing chronicles is not a trivial thing to do. The increasing complexity and capacity of data generation of highly-advanced processes cause the acquisition of a complete model difficult. This paper focuses on the problem of discovering chronicles that are representative of a system behavior from direct observations. A clustering approach to this problem is considered. The chronicle discovery algorithm proposed here designs chronicles with minimal knowledge of the system to diagnose. Furthermore, unprocessed data obtained directly from the system can be used in this clustering algorithm. Finally, the chronicle discovery algorithm proposed in this paper is illustrated on a sport performance monitoring device for a diagnosis of movement deviations in the temporal domain, in the event domain, or both, considered as faults for the athlete.

This work addresses the classification of nine levels of crack failure severity in a gearbox. First of all, features are extracted in time domain from signals coming from an acoustic emission (AE) sensor, and then selected by using four different ranking methods. The classification stage uses the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) technique. The results indicate that presented levels of severity can be successfully classified with five features extracted from the AE signal for the four ranking methods.

Once the rotating machinery failed, it would lead to economic losses, or even a serious safety accident. Therefore, rotating machinery fault diagnosis has attracted a great deal of attention. Since the fault vibration signal of the rotating machinery is a mixture of different frequency components, signal decomposition methods have become powerful tools to extract the local information of the fault signal. Empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is an effective and self adaptive signal decomposition method which has been widely studied. However, seldom of them attempt to conduct a systematic study on the performance of the EWT in terms of signal decomposition. In this paper, we perform the systematic simulations on how the retrieval performance of EWT is affected by the two-dimensional parameters, amplitude ratio and frequency ratio. By comparing the decomposition components with the original ones, we obtain the results which could guide people to evaluate the EWT method. Finally, the applicable region of the EWT in the fault diagnosis on rotating machinery are discussed.

For data-driven prognostics, machine learning algorithms are nowadays attracting the attentions of researchers. This paper introduces relevance vector regression (RVR) algorithm into RUL prediction, as it models the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the degradation process very well. However, the conventional RVR model cannot recognize the overall degradation pattern. When applying it for long-term prediction to estimate RUL, the result might deviate from the real situation greatly. This paper proposes a modified RVR model with a new design matrix (RVR-NDM) with an additional column vector which represents the overall degradation pattern. For an RVR-NDM model, both of the kernel width and normalization of input vector have impacts on the learning results. We propose a strategy for model optimization. For demonstrating the proposed method, a case study for turbofan engine RUL estimation is given. The results show that the RVR-NDM is effective for RUL prediction and better than the basic RVR and generalized linear regression methods.

However, with the battery cell degrading gradually, the performance of the battery pack also degrades. Therefore, it has to be focused on battery pack degradation state prognosis to ensure the system working safely and reliably. On the other hand, accurate degradation state prediction of battery pack is also helpful for conditional based maintenance which decreases the maintenance cost. The terminal voltage of the battery pack is utilized as the character presenting the battery degradation in this paper. The relationship between cycle number and the terminal voltage is described by an empirical double exponential function. Particle filter (PF) algorithm is applied to identify and update the parameters in the model. The battery degradation state can be directly predicted with the predefined cycle number. The battery remaining useful life (RUL) can also be estimated with the given failure threshold of the degradation feature. The experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction framework can get high prediction accuracy. At the same time, for the different operating conditions, this approach is of great robustness.

The traditional fault diagnosis methods mostly need a complex signal processing process in advance and there are fewer layers, the feature extraction and classification effect are not ideal. In order to diagnose the planetary gearbox effectively, this paper presents a fault diagnosis method for planetary gearbox based on hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM). This method analyses the time domain signal of fault vibration instead of the frequency domain signal, thus eliminates the time for complex signal processing to adaptively mine available fault characteristics and automatically identify machinery health conditions.

In view of the complex feature extraction process and the uncertainty of the traditional intelligent recognition, a method of fault feature extraction and recognition based on deep residual neural network is proposed in this paper. This method uses the original time domain signal to train the deep residual neural network and complete the intelligent classification of the fault type without periodic request to the time domain signal. Accordingly, it has strong applicability to effectively extract and identify features from multiple conditions, multiple fault locations and various fault levels. Compared with traditional fault diagnosis models, the deep residual neural network model improves the fault recognition rate and shows strong generalization performance.

The Use of Machine Learning Techniques to Assess Damage in Critical Infrastructure	MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, RISK, MANAGEMENT AND LIFE-CYCLE PERFORMANCE OF BRIDGES			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IBAMAS)	JUL 09-13, 2018	Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	VicRoads, Monash Univ, RMIT Univ, Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety Australia	Swinburne Univ Technol			Over the past decades researchers have tried to develop protocols to assess the current condition (diagnosis) and the potential for further expansion/distress (prognosis) of aging critical infrastructure. Among promising techniques, particular attention was given to quantitative microscopic procedures such as the Damage Rating Index (DRI). However, those techniques were found to be quite time-consuming and relied on the experience of petrographers able to properly judge their outcomes. It has been found that Machine Learning (ML) techniques might be used for efficient damage assessment in concrete. With the aid of modern software and some custom programming, petrographers could provide some "training" to the computer to diagnose concrete distress mechanisms. This paper discusses the potential use of ML to appraise damage in critical infrastructure. Validation is made with data obtained from laboratory test specimens with different amounts of damage from AAR. Preliminary results illustrate the promising character of ML in diagnosing AAR-affected concrete, which may also be suitable for other types of deterioration.	[Terra, M. A.; Pereira, R.

Without a systematic way to ensure reliable operation however, a very conservative operational strategy is often chosen, which can lead to sub-optimal operation and the loss of large potential profits. We propose to integrate condition monitoring and prognostics into the production planning problem to reduce conservativeness by actively steering plant degradation and preventing violation of health-critical constraints. We achieve this by combining equipment degradation models with regular process models and solving a shrinking horizon real-time optimization problem until the next planned maintenance horizon. A network of oil and gas producing wells with artificial gas lift, subject to particle induced choke erosion is used as a case example.

Deep learning techniques have recently been proven to be very effective in handling heterogeneous real time monitoring data. This paper presents a computational framework for machine fault diagnosis based on deep learning approaches and autoencoder variants. The framework includes methods for extraction of time domain and frequency domain features from raw data, training of autoencoders, and finally, detecting the presence of fault(s) using classifiers. A total of four different variants of autoencoders have been tested and analyzed for fault diagnosis framework; additionally, the option of reducing the learning complexity in autoencoder with layer wise feature selection strategy with ITER ranking has also been applied. For validation purpose, four standard fault diagnosis datasets were used. To obtain inferences, statistical tests was performed across all tested feature extraction techniques, autoencoder variants, and classifiers.

In the case of machining systems, timely fault diagnosis avoids products that are out of specification and/or extreme damage. Optimum machining is highly dependent on the performance and condition of the spindle, within which the bearing system represents the mechanical components with the greatest likelihood of failure. The advances in the use of the Wavelet Transform (WT) was analyzed and a fault detection method for spindles was proposed. This method automatically detects the frequency range where most information of the fault is located and separates it from other noisy frequencies. Furthermore, faults can be detected at early stages. Early results, validated with experimental data, are promising for an automatic system.

The main approach is to identify a correlation between the process settings and the quality of the final product. In this work, a two steps approach is presented to modelling an industrial process. The first step uses a fault detection method, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based method, to retain only individuals from a normal production process. The second step consists in using a Support Vector machines Regression (SVR) method to build a model of the considered process. It is based on the historic process data defined by an output (a criterion on the product quality) and multiple inputs (various production line settings). The proposed framework is tested on a fluidized bed combustion boiler in the context of paper industry. The experiments confirm the efficiency of our approach.

Defects in bearings will lead to a sudden stoppage of machines. In this paper, we develop a new fault detection method based on the numerical simulation determined band-pass filter and polynomial chirplet transform (PCT). Using band-pass filter, the sub-signal containing the information of fault feature is preserved and further decomposed by PCT to obtain time-frequency spectrum with higher signal to noise ratio (SNR). To design the efficient band-pass filter, the input center frequency is predetermined by finite element simulations. To improve the performance of the traditional chirplet transform (CT), a polynomial kernel function is employed to construct one of the parameterized time-frequency analysis methods, i.e., PCT. PCT reconstructs the time-frequency spectrum along the frequency trajectory so that the energy distribution on the spectrum is concentrated around the real instantaneous frequency of the signal. Thus, the PCT generates high time-frequency resolution, which is suitable for weak fault detection. The effectiveness of the proposed method in fault diagnosis is demonstrated by applications for vibration signal collected from bearings in both mechanical and hydraulic power transmission systems.

First, we perform cyclic analysis to divide the original signal into individual cycles, and then perform time synchronous average to obtain a structural average cycle. Finally, structural change detection is made based on hypothesis testing. We evaluated the proposed method on an experimental setup and the experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method under non-stationary machine operating conditions.

The uncertainties mainly include the inherent uncertainty associated with the progression of the degradation over time and the inevitable uncertainty caused by noise and disturbance. Handling uncertainties is important to improve the prediction accuracy of remaining useful life (RUL) in the degraded process from fault to failure. This study takes uncertainties into consideration via the relevant vector machine (RVM) approach in order to achieve a good accuracy. Firstly, a target vector is derived by first hitting time (FHT) to characterize the RUL. This is fulfilled off-line based on historical sample data. Then, a stochastic model is established by RVM under Bayesian framework. Further, parameters are updated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for an optimized RVM model. And then, the on-line RUL prediction is implemented with the updated RVM model. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by two real case studies of traction faults occurred in the high-speed train. The prediction results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The traditional method of fault diagnosis uses vibration characteristics of massive sample data clustering analysis method for fault classification and diagnosis, diagnostic performance by the characteristics of vibration data sampling and environmental constraints, and the detecting effect of fault is not good.

Motor failure will lead to the shutdown of a whole production line and cause great loss. Therefore, accurate, reliable and effective motor fault diagnosis must be performed. Currently, motors fault diagnosis has gained much attention to guarantee safe motor operations. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis method is proposed for the three-phase asynchronous motor using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which possesses the capacity to learn meaningful representations from raw signal without any feature engineering. Firstly, the acceleration signals of different fault motors were collected. Then, the raw data were directly fed into LSTM neural network to establish the relationship between the raw vibration signals and fault states. The whole proposition was experimentally demonstrated and discussed by carrying out the tests of six three-phase asynchronous motors under different fault conditions in the drivetrain diagnostics simulator system. Performances of other classification methods such as LR, SVM, MLP, and basic RNN, are tested and contrasted. Results show that the proposed approach achieves the highest fault diagnosis accuracy.

Engineers often use useable capacity to measure a battery's degradation and aging. In orbit environments, however, it is difficult to measure battery capacity accurately by the traditional fully discharging method. This paper proposes a data driven framework of satellite battery residual life (RL) prediction in operating fields. Firstly, a capacity prediction model is established with the partial charging data in sunlight periods. Secondly, the predicted capacity is introduced into the particle filtering (PF) updating approach to perform battery residual life prediction under an exponential degradation assumption.

For a new object or field, it's very difficult to extract features manually, while it's indispensable. With the development of digital information and the internet of everything, the data of equipment monitoring such as rotor machinery will tend to mass. In the face of mass data, the traditional feature extraction is more difficult to adapt. However, with deep learning driven by big data, the mapping from the input to output without feature extraction can be achieved. And deep learning has the transfer learning ability, which can be applied for imbalance samples. In this paper, a brief introduction for deep learning is described firstly. Secondly, a deep learning application for fault diagnosis is illustrated. Thirdly, the good performance of deep learning is verified by bearing test data. Finally, the application of transfer learning capability of deep learning on fault diagnosis of rotary equipment with scarce fault condition samples is represented.

In this paper, we concentrate on how to model the multi-phase degradation process and estimate its lifetime. Under this consideration, we firstly formulate a general degradation framework based on the multi-phase Wiener model to describe such the degradation process. Unlike traditional methods, we provide an analytical form of lifetime estimation for two-phase model with fixed jump, and a single integral form for two-phase model with random jump via taking full advantage of the uncertainty of the degradation state at the change point. In addition, we extend these results from two-phase model to multi-phase model and obtain a general result of lifetime estimation. Finally, a numerical case is provided for illustration.

While under normal operating conditions, bearings often run under variable rotational speed conditions especially when the machine starts and stops or there is a speed fluctuation with bearing fault. Under such circumstances the bearing signal is non-stationary, which makes the traditional bearing fault diagnosis methods inapplicable. Thus, rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on synchroextracting transform is proposed. Spectral kurtosis is used to find the optimal frequency band, based on which a band pass filter is designed. Then the synchroextracting transform is applied to the band-pass filtered signal to get the time-varying frequency demodulated spectrum and extract the fault features. Through the time-varying frequency demodulated spectrum, rolling element bearing fault can be diagnosed without resampling. The method proposed is illustrated by numerical simulated signal analysis, and is further validated via lab experimental rolling bearing vibration signal analyses.

First, according to the requirement of fault prognosis, an incomplete time slice Bayesian network with unknown future observed node is constructed. Moreover, the future states are described by the current measurements and his historic data in the form of conditional probability. Second, according to the completed part of historical data, a parameter-learning algorithm is used to obtain network parameters and the weight coefficients of distribution components. After that, using such weight coefficients as input-output data, the subspace identification method is employed to build a forecasting model which can predict weight coefficients at next sampling time. To achieve fault prognosis, an inference algorithm is developed to predict hidden faults based on the distribution of the measurements directly. Furthermore, the remaining useful life of process is estimated via iterative one-step ahead prognosis. As an example, the proposed method is applied to a continuous stirred tank reactor system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently predict and identify the fault, and estimate the remaining useful life of process, even though the measurements are partly missing.

However, fault feature extraction and selection take much manual effort, which make the design of the fault diagnosis system complicated and not universal. This paper proposes an analog circuit fault diagnosis method based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The proposed method uses the single pulse as the stimulus signal to circuit-under-test (CUT), and then the raw time domain response of CUT is directly sampled to construct fault samples, which are inputted into the ELM network to obtain fault diagnosis results. The experimental results show that the average diagnostic accuracies reach 100% and 99.5% on the Sallen-key band-pass filter circuit and the four opamp biquad high-pass filter circuit, respectively. The algorithm achieves good diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in the absence of feature extraction and selection.

The parameters of shield excavation are as the input of self-organizing feature maps(SOM) to perform partial fusion. Then the output of SOM is as the input of back propagation(BP) network to complete final fusion. The construction faults of shield can be diagnosed according the results of final fusion. The analysis of an illustrating example indicates that the proposed method is more effective and feasible. The diagnosis results can be a beneficial guidance for online-diagnosing the construction faults of shield.

Prognostics techniques enable the implementation of these strategies through up-to-date remaining useful life estimations. However, a cost-benefit assessment is necessary to verify the scale of potential benefits of condition-based maintenance strategies and prognostics for a given application. The majority of prognostics applications focus on the evaluation of a specific failure mode of an asset. However, industrial systems are comprised of different assets with multiple failure modes, which in turn, work in cooperation to perform a system level function. Besides, these systems include time-dependent events and conditional triggering events which cause further effects on the system. In this context not only are the system-level prognostics predictions challenging, but also the cost-benefit analysis of condition-based maintenance policies. In this work we combine asset prognostics predictions with temporal logic so as to obtain an up-to-date system level health estimation. We use asset level and system level prognostics estimations to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative maintenance policies. The application of the proposed approach enables the adoption of conscious trade-off decisions between alternative maintenance strategies for complex systems. The benefits of the proposed approach are discussed with a case study from the power industry.

Two data-driven prognostics models are considered, an Homogeneous Discrete-Time Finite-State Semi-Markov Model (HDTFSSMM) and a Fuzzy Similarity-Based (FSB) model. The predictions from the two models are ensembled with a switching approach that selects the most accurate model at each stage of the equipment life to guarantee the best performance throughout the degradation progression. Areal case study isworked out, regarding a fleet of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electric vehicles powertrains. In this specific case, the HDTFSSMM is selected at the early stages of the equipment degradation and the FSB model at the last stages of life. Results are compared with those achieved by each individual model, showing that the proposed ensemble approach is able to provide more accurate RUL predictions throughout the entire equipment life.

This paper investigates an effective deep learning method known as sparse filtering, which is used to extract features from fault signal directly. And then, the supervised learning method softmax regression is applied to classify the fault types. The training samples are the vibration signals under a certain rotational speed and the test samples are in different rotational speeds. The key parameters of the model are optimized and analyzed through orthogonal experiments and single factor experiment. The diagnosis results show that the sparse filtering model has strong robustness for rotating machinery fault diagnosis in the case of rotating speed fluctuations.

Because of its long-life cycle, it should be ensured with a long-term stable operation during the period. Compared to the application equipment on the ground, on-orbit payload is more difficult to get timely maintenance. Since on-orbit payload cannot be manually checked, we can only identify its status through the test point data and observation point data. In this paper, a method of monitoring the health status of on-orbit payload based on fuzzy classification and neural network is proposed to insure the stability of long-term orbit equipment. We choose the test point data and observation point data returned from the payload as the input, and the status of on-orbit payload as the output. The fuzzy neural network is used to assess the health status of the payload in its life span: the normal state, the performance degradation state, or the functional failure state. When aerospace payload is in the performance degradation state, was assess the degree of degradation of the system performance, and grasp the health status information of on-orbit payload. The health status monitor makes PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) more intelligent, so that the system failures can get early diagnosis, prevention and treatment. It can also reduce the cost of payload maintenance, and increase the length of life of on-orbit payload.

In this situation, trying to predict a future state or to classify internal features in the system becomes a challenging task that requires adequate conceptual and computational tools as well as appropriate datasets. A specially difficult case can be found in the problems framed under one-class learning. In an attempt to sidestep this issue, we present a machine learning methodology based in Reservoir Computing and Variational Inference. In our setting, the dynamical system generating the time series is modeled by an Echo State Network (ESN), and the parameters of the ESN are defined by an expressive probability distribution which is represented as a Variational Autoencoder. As a proof of its applicability, we show some results obtained in the context of condition-based maintenance in rotating machinery, where vibration signals can be measured from the system, our goal is fault detection in helical gearboxes under realistic operating conditions. The results show that our model is able, after trained only with healthy conditions, to discriminate successfully between healthy and faulty conditions.

Thus the degradation failure process and mechanism of MOSFET attract wide attention of scholars. However current research works cannot solve the real time degradation monitoring problem of MOSFET. Normally, MOSFET should be removed from the system for testing or monitoring. This paper presents a new in-situ prognosis method for MOSFET based on miller effect. According to the theory analysis, simulation and experiment results, the miller platform voltage is identified as a new degradation precursor. Then, particle filter algorithm is used for MOSFET remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on the degradation data of miller platform voltage. Meanwhile, MOSFET samples with different degradation levels are formed by "overstress of gate bias" accelerating life test. The samples are placed into application circuit for the monitoring and extraction of miller platform voltage, so as to verify the method proposed in this paper.

At the same time, the proposed method has been successfully applied to the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. In the proposed method, the frequency domain information of the vibration signal is used as input signal, and the deep neural network is obtained by the unsupervised training of the denoising auto encoder, the dropout method is employed to adjust the network parameters, reducing the problem of the over-fitting. Finally, the fault features obtained by learning of denoising auto-encoder is used for fault diagnosis. The experimental result show that the proposed method is very effective, and can effectively extract the implicit characteristics of the fault signal.

Currently, prognostics and health management (PHM) information is confined to the lowest levels of this hierarchy and finds primary use in decisions and control policies for machine maintenance and replacement. For the smart manufacturing systems of the future, however, PHM information should be passed to all levels of the hierarchy and incorporated into high level decision making about production quantities, rates, and locations. This paper proposes a hierarchical control methodology that passes PHM health estimates up the hierarchy and optimization objectives down the hierarchy. Individual nodes in the hierarchy are modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning is used to estimate optimal policies. This work makes several contributions to the PHM community. First, we propose a novel model of a control system that makes uses of health information throughout the manufacturing hierarchy. Second, we define a reinforcement learning based approach to solving the MDPs for optimal or near-optimal policies. Third, we illustrate the method on a numerical example based on a simulation of a real-world manufacturing environment.

Stragglers, the nodes which are 6-8 times slower than median nodes, can potentially degrade the overall cluster performance by increasing the job completion time. The existing solutions mainly concentrate on reactive measures after detecting stragglers but they lead to extended job completion time and resource wastage. Currently, proactive straggler avoidance techniques have introduced the application of machine learning methods to enhance the task scheduling. In this paper, a prognostic system that proactively avoids stragglers using predictive models is proposed. It has two stages: (1) To develop the prediction model for identifying the straggler nodes before allocation of the task using distributed machine learning and (2) To guide the scheduler to efficiently assign the tasks. This results in avoiding or minimizing the number of stragglers and leads to smarter scheduling. The proposed solution is compared with default Hadoop scheduler and has shown the significant improvement.			dshyam100@yahoo.com; jva.comp@coep.ac.in; kthirupathirao@kluniversity.in; drbtrao@kluniversity.in	Komati, Thirupathi Rao/U-7663-2018; Rao, B.Thirumala/F-4094-2015	Komati, Thirupathi Rao/0000-0002-0907-6824; Rao, B.Thirumala/0000-0002-5783-2460			ANANTHANARAYANAN G., 2010, OSDI; Bishop CM, 2006, PATTERN RECOGNITION; Burges CJC, 1998, DATA MIN KNOWL DISC, V2, P121, DOI 10.1023/A:1009715923555; Chang Chih-Chung, 2016, DISTRIBUTED LIBLINEA; Dean J, 2008, COMMUN ACM, V51, P107, DOI 10.1145/1327452.1327492; Fan Yuanquan, 2014, COMP INF TECHN CIT 2; Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, 2013, EFFECTIVE STRAGGLER, V13; MASSIE ML, 2004, PARALLEL COMPUTING, V30; Turkington G., 2013, HADOOP BEGINNERS GUI; Yadwadkar Neeraja J., 2014, S CLOUD COMP; Zaharia M, 2008, P 8 USENIX C OP SYST	11	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	2367-3370	2367-3389	978-981-10-3226-4; 978-981-10-3225-7	LECT NOTE NETW SYST			2017	5						411	420		10.1007/978-981-10-3226-4_41			10	Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BL0QT	WOS:000446378800041					2020-04-16	
B	Duong, PLT; Raghavan, N			IEEE	Duong, Pham L. T.; Raghavan, Nagarajan			Uncertainty quantification in prognostics: A data driven polynomial chaos approach	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 19-21, 2017	Dallas, TX	IEEE, IEEE Reliabil Soc		Moment- based arbitrary polynomial chaos; Prognostics; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty quantification	GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS	Prognostic deals with predicting the possible future failure of different types of engineering systems. For the purpose of prognostics, the failure of the system is defined to be the instant when the degradation (performance) level rises above (drops below) a defined threshold. It is impossible to make a precise prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system due to many sources of uncertainties. Therefore, one has to develop a structured approach to account for the different sources of uncertainties. While some methods such as Monte Carlo/Quasi Monte Carlo can be implemented easily, its accuracy is limited and the computational cost involved is large. Recently, it was shown that UQ in prognostics with the non-intrusive polynomial chaos approach is a good choice, thanks to its accuracy and low computational cost. Unfortunately though, it requires the prior knowledge of parametric distributions. This work tackles the challenge of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in model based prognostics using the moment-based arbitrary polynomial chaos approach. The moment-based polynomial chaos is suitable for this purpose and its advantages can be summarized as: 1) UQ can be done with small computational effort in comparison to the standard Monte Carlo method. 2) It avoids the necessity to assign parametric probability distributions. 3) It can be used with arbitrary distributions with arbitrary measures, which can be specified numerically by means of a histogram or a raw data set. 4) Global sensitivity indices are available directly and can be used to identify which parameter is relatively more important than the others over the entire parameter space of the models. The method is illustrated for an example of battery resistance degradation.	[Duong, Pham L.

Moreover, the generalization ability of these methods is restricted. This article proposes a deep machine learning based method on satellite power system fault diagnosis, which combines the characteristics of satellite power system data with the advantages of deep learning. The method uses Denosing Autoencoder (DAE) as unsupervised algorithm in preliminary training stage, and back propagation (BP) algorithm as supervised algorithm in fine-tuning stage. Tested by the practical satellite power system, the method takes full advantages of deep learning, and achieves organic combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. It extracts fault features based on big data, and identifies fault states, which overcomes the disadvantages of traditional methods. In addition, the proposed method is more suitable for characterization of hidden complex features of equipment data, which enables more accurate recognition of equipment health state under complex monitoring tasks.

This paper provides three methods to predict the remaining useful life of three-shaft gas turbine engine, which are regression analysis of standard low-pressure turbine outlet temperature, relevance analysis and multiple regression, regression analysis of heat loss index obtained based on mathematical model of gas turbine. Example shows that the three methods all can predict the life. But in the first one the linear regression can't explain the temperature fluctuations well, and the predictions of the quadratic and cubic regression are not consistent with the actual situation. The multiple regression analysis takes the multiple monitoring parameters related to low pressure turbine outlet temperature into account, increasing the adjusted R-squared, but it couldn't consider the influence of compressor washing, and the prediction interval is large, which may not meet the needs of the project. The third method can accurately know and guide the compressor washing time according to certain degradation rate, and can predict remaining useful life effectively, which is a feasible way for gas turbine health assessment and maintenance decision-making.

Various inspection and maintenance methodologies are performed on rolling stock equipment to fulfill the above performance measures. This paper suggests a new approach, namely, intelligent functional test (IFTest) to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the equipment, subsystems and systems of rolling stock dynamically by data driven methods. IFTest generates a baseline of the current operational abilities in contrast to the required abilities. The test integrates the historical and new set of data to track the trend of degradation of equipment. With this approach, the operation and maintenance personnel have ample time to make decisions for the maintenance and failure consequences. In addition, it is supposed that by using such data we are achieving a more accurate result for the estimation of reliability and RUL of critical rolling stock equipment.	[Garmabaki, A. H.

In largely interconnected systems, not only the individual performance of one channel, but also its interaction with other components, must be considered. In this conceptual paper, we outline a newmaintenance concept for the detection of software faults in control systems. The concept includes two approaches, morning gymnastics test and envelope analysis. The morning gymnastics test generates data for a baseline of the current operational abilities in contrast to the specified abilities and should be applied when feasible in continuous production systems. The test integrates historical and new sets of data to track degradation trends. Envelope analysis can be performed to detect operational anomalies and is based on subsequent deep analysis to distinguish software and hardware faults from each other. By using the envelope analysis it is possible to identify failures and disturbances affecting the control system. Thus, the proposed maintenance concept may facilitate detection and identification of potential failures in critical automated system.	[Garmabaki, A. H.

In view of the inherent polymorphism of manufacturing systems (i.e., dynamic production scheduling and performance degradation), the connotation of mission reliability of equipment is defined and modeled based on the processing capacity distribution which integrates multiple fault data. Further, the relationship between mission reliability and performance of equipment is established by using the unavailability as the intermediary. The optimal predictive maintenance policy, the best mission reliability threshold for performing predictive maintenance action, is obtained by minimizing the comprehensive cost which includes processing capacity loss, corrective maintenance cost, predictive maintenance cost and indirect loss caused by failing to meet due dates over the planning period. This paper will also evaluate a manufacturing system of the cylinder head of an automotive engine as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The final result shows that a more significant economic benefit can be achieved by the proposed approach, which considers the mission reliability and comprehensive cost relative to the periodic preventive maintenance policy.

Firstly, an empirical model of power fading is developed based on battery test data. Then, the obtained model has been used in a particle filtering (PF) framework for making end of life (EOL) predictions at various stages of its cycle life. Finally, the predictions were validated with battery power fade data. From the results it can be observed that as more volume of data becomes available, the accuracy of prediction gradually improves. The prognostics framework proposed in this work provides a systematic way for monitoring the state of health (SoH) of a battery.

Traditional methods of degradation analysis often rely on many theoretical assumptions to offer the detailed relationship between the machine's condition and the failure probability. However, this kind of theory approximation may not reflect the real complicated relationship. Besides, one of the challenges of predicting the defect distribution lies in the rich kinds of different defects. The sparsity of the defect kinds on a single circuit breakers makes it hard to establish a statistical significance. This paper introduces an data-driven latent Dirichlet allocation method to automatically build the quantitative relationship between the individual circuit breaker and its defect distribution on many kinds of defects. Firstly, a latent layer is introduced between the circuit breaker and its defect distribution as a matrix factorization method. The defect distribution of the circuit breakers is remodeled as the distribution between the circuit breakers and the latent layers, and the distribution between the latent layers and the defects based on Dirichlet allocation, which greatly reduced the state space to build a reliable discrete distribution on each kind of defect. Second, an Bayesian inference is also introduced as an online extension of the basic method. The method offers a new way to analyze large amounts of log data in the power grid, and has the ability to predict the defect distribution of a single circuit breaker. The experiment shows that the accumulated probability of the enhanced LDA method is 23.1% better than the statistical model and 6.2% better than the LDA model. the proposed method has a good performance of defect distribution prognosis and can offer reasonable operation advice.

Its capacity degradation modeling and cycle to failure estimation has become very significant. Repeated capacity measurements over the whole life of batteries, i.e., the longitudinal data, are investigated to understand the degradation process and the cycle to failure behavior. This paper proposes a method for prognostics of lithium ion batteries based on the functional principal component analysis. The observed degradation signal is decomposed into the mean function and variance-covariance function. The local quadratic smoothing method is used to estimate the mean function. Functional principal components of the variance-covariance function are represented and modeled through eigenfunctions, which are further approximated and estimated using a combination of BS-plines. For the battery capacity prognostics, three eigenfunctions explained 99.98% of the total variation.

Thus, it is of great significance to carry out fault diagnosis of rotating machinery to ensure the complete machinery system to perform in a normal statement. To effectively separate the multi-faults and achieve the fault diagnosis, sparse component analysis based on the sparsity of objective signals was proposed. However, the vibration signals are scantily sparse and it usually cannot be represented in a sparse way. Therefore, a novel approach is suggested to overcome the above problem. First, tunable Q-factor wavelet transform is used to obtain the sparse signal. Then, the quantity of source signal and the mixed matrix are approximated grounded on the potential function which is calculated according to the sparse signal. Ultimately, the shortest path method is taken advantage of gaining separation of the source signal. The simulate signals and vibration signals are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that it is telling to accomplish the separation of multi-faults.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an optimizing cost-sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM) model. The proposed method is based on cost-sensitive support vector machine. The improved genetic immune particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to select the best regularized constants C+, C-, and kernel function parameter g. This paper use the optimizing CS-SVM proposed to train and predict the bearing vibration signals. The experimental results showed that the CS-SVM can effectively deal with unbalanced small fault class sample in aero-bearing fault diagnosis, it can also improve the diagnosis accuracy of the fault class sample.

The problem is to associate a system to each mission and to integrate the necessary maintenance operations in the schedule according to the real state of health of systems. This problem, which falls within the decision part of PHM, is proposed to be solved using an optimal approach based on Linear Programming.

Finally, the RUL prediction of airborne fuel pump is realized by the fusion particle filter algorithm. The experimental results illustrate that compared to traditional regression approach, the proposed approach not only can effectively predict the life of airborne fuel pump, but also has the uncertainty expression of the prediction result.

In this paper, a framework of CPS is presented to describe the CPS as a 5C architecture, including Connection level, Conversion level, Cyber level, Cognition level and Configuration level. The 5C architecture clearly states how to convert data to information; so the transparency and predictability enable to predict the degradation of the critical assets so as to use the information for smarter decision support. The transformation from traditional maintenance strategy to predictive maintenance strategy is the highlight to enable the worry-free entities. In order to fully understand the CPS architecture and how it can be applied to various industrial applications to realize a worry-free system, two successful case studies of CPS applications are introduced to present the application of CPS enabled cyber manufacturing with critical component health management as an example, and the worry-free wind turbine health management system.

Cyclostationarity indicators and bi-frequency maps help to quantify fault related modulations of vibration signals. High quality and robustness of these tools are achieved at a relatively high computational cost. Thus, industrial application of cyclostationarity is limited to off-line analysis in the post-processing stage. In this paper an on-line updating of cyclostationary tools is investigated alternatively to the moving block approach. As an exemplary cyclostationary tool the cyclic modulation spectrum is involved. The filter bank approach is proposed in order to carry out the sample-by-sample updating. We compare properties of the newly proposed method with the one based on sliding discrete Fourier transform.

Considering the collective anomaly data to be detected sensitively, this paper presents a symbolic approach and applies it to anomaly detection of gas turbine subsystem. The trained finite state machine evaluates the posterior probabilities of observed symbol sequence. Thus, an anomaly detection strategy based on FSM estimation is used to detect the defects. Experimental results indicate that, despite the high performance of the model, the robustness of the model is strong, especially within a certain sequence length. Therefore, the proposed method can be a good way to promote the existing anomaly detection performance in gas turbine subsystem.

And a time domain signal feature is extracted, the time domain signal feature is highly sensitive to the defect. Firstly, in order to analyze the change trend of time domain signal under intermittent disconnection. The influence of conductor crack on the physical parameters is analyzed. The physical parameters include AC/DC resistance, inductance and capacitance. And then the principle of signal reflection is described. The ringing phenomenon that caused by signal reflection is used for crack intermittency detection. Therefore the maximum, minimum and peak-peak values of time domain signal are used to detect intermittent disconnection. At last solder joint equivalent circuit is used to verify the effectiveness of the method. When the intermittent disconnection happened in circuit board, the time domain reflection phenomenon is observed clearly.

Considering the heteroskedasticity of characteristic signal under the vibration loading, the general time series model cannot describe heteroskedasticity, a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic model (GARCH) is proposed. Firstly, the upper and lower quantiles of the voltage signal are extracted. The failure time is determined by using the upper quantile and the degradation process is analyzed by the lower quantile. Secondly, the Auto-Regressive(AR) is built as the regressive basic model. Thirdly, a GARCH (1,1) model is proposed, which is tested by the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) method, the parameters of the model is estimated by the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Finally, the performance of the presented GARCH based degradation model is examined by real data from experiment, which is compared with the classical AR model according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The results suggest that GARCH (1,1) is superior to AR model, presented a theoretical foundation for further study about the degradation modeling of solder joint under vibration loading.

Stochastic process model-based methods are widely used in the RUL prediction of machinery. One of the major issues in the stochastic process model-based methods is that how to deal with the unit-to-unit variability during the RUL prediction process. Traditional methods generally handle this issue by introducing a unit-to-unit variability parameter into the model expression and estimate the parameter using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. There exist two major limitations in the traditional methods. 1) The degradation processes are assumed to be dependent on only the age, which restricts their implementation in the cases of the state-dependent degradation processes. 2) They do not discuss the influence of the unit-to-unit variability in the RUL prediction processes systematically. To deal with these two limitations, a new RUL prediction method based on age-and state-dependent stochastic process models is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a generalized expression of the age-and stage-dependent stochastic process models is generated. An enhanced MLE algorithm is developed to estimate the model parameters according to the measurements of the available training units. And the unit-to-unit variability parameter is updated according to the real-time measurements of the testing unit. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a numerical simulation dataset of fatigue crack-growth.

Critical reciprocating compressors that operate under high-speed conditions, flow hazardous gases and have a high duty cycle are target rotating equipment on maintenance improvement lists due to downtime risks and safety hazards. Estimating performance deterioration and failure time for reciprocating compressors could potentially reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and improve safety and availability. This study presents an application of Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPHM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to estimate failure degradation and remaining useful life based on sensory data acquired from an operational industrial reciprocating compressor. CVA was used to extract a one-dimensional health indicator from the multivariate data sets, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the original data matrix. The failure rate was obtained by using the CPHM based on historical failure times. Furthermore, a SVR model was used as a prognostic tool following training with failure rate vectors obtained from the CPHM and the one-dimensional performance measures obtained from the CVA model. The trained SVR model was then utilized to estimate the failure degradation rate and remaining useful life. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effectively used in real industrial processes to predict performance degradation and failure time.

The stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) is used to extract the abstract features of time-domain features of multi-source signals, and then locality preserving projection (LPP) is used to dimension reduction to complete the feature fusion. Finally, the fused low-dimensional features act as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) to realize the failure detection and fault location of typical fault modes of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system. The inhibitory effect of the closed-loop system on the incipient fault is discussed as well. Moreover, a health assessment method is presented considering the gradual degradation of leakage fault of the actuator. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate and reliable than any single signal result. The model of health assessment can give the internal leakage severity of the actuator. The significance of this paper is to provide a feasible idea of the fault diagnosis and health assessment of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system.

Firstly, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) was used to decompose vibration signals into several sub bands. The fault features were extracted from the sub-bands to construct a high- dimensional fault feature set, and the improved kernel space distance evaluation method was used to extract the sensitive fault features. Then, orthogonal semi supervised linear local tangent space alignment (OSSLLTSA), which is a semi-supervised manifold learning method, was proposed to reduce dimension of the fault feature set, and extract fusion features with low dimension and high clustering performance. OSSLLTSA is able to extract the structural information in both labeled and unlabelled samples, and so OSSLLTSA overcomes over-learning problem of supervised manifold learning. Meanwhile, OSSLLTSA also avoids the drawback of weak pertinence of unsupervised manifold learning. Finally, the extracted low dimensional feature set was input into TSVM for fault diagnosis. TSVM is able to completely utilize the fault information contained in unlabelled samples to modify the model, and as a result the trained fault diagnosis model has better generalization ability. Through a gearbox fault instance, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is able to achieve very high fault diagnosis accuracy even when labeled samples are insufficient.

Enhanced algorithms are being designed and applied on large datasets to help discover hidden insights and correlations amongst data elements not obvious to human. These insights help businesses take better decisions and optimize key indicators of interest. The growing popularity of machine learning also stems from the fact that learning algorithms are agnostic to the domain of application. Classification algorithms, for example, that could be applied to categorize faults in windmill blades can also be used for categorizing TV viewers in a survey. The actual value of machine learning however depends on the ability to adapt and apply these algorithms to solve specific real world problems. In this paper we discuss two such applications for interpreting medical data for automated analysis. Our first case study demonstrates the use of Bayesian Inference, a paradigm of machine learning, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on cognitive test results and demographic data. In the second case study we focus on automated classification of cell images to determine the advancement and severity of breast cancer using artificial neural networks. Although these research are still preliminary, they demonstrate the value of machine learning techniques in providing quick, efficient and automated data analysis. Machine learning offers hope with early diagnosis of diseases, help patients in making informed decisions on treatment options and can help in improving overall quality of their lives.

An approach based on Dictionary learning for sparse representation aiming at gearbox fault detection is proposed. A gearbox vibration signal database with 900 records considering the normal case and nine different faults is analyzed. A dictionary is learned using a training set of signals from the normal case. This dictionary is used for obtaining the representation of signals in the test set considering either normal or faulty condition vibration signals. The dictionary based representation is analyzed for extracting features useful for detection of faults. The analysis is performed considering different load conditions. Additionally the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is performed for ranking the extracted features. Results are promising as there are significant statistical differences between the normal case and each of the recorded faults. Comparison between faults also shows that faults tends to group into several clusters in the feature space where classification of faults could be feasible.

The vibration signals generated from gearbox show strong nonlinearity or chaotic behavior. To identify the complex nonlinear behavior of gear faults, recurrence network is introduced to extract features of gear vibration under different conditions. Quantitative characteristics (such as mean degree centrality, global clustering coefficient, or assortativity of the recurrence network) related to the dynamical complexity of a time series are chosen to help classify the different faults. Experimental study on four different gear conditions has proved that the recurrence network provides a good alternative approach to characterize gear fault.

B	Moedden, H		Walls, L; Revie, M; Bedford, T		Moedden, Heinrich			Probabilities in safety of machinery-risk reduction effects by combination of full enclosure and fault detection in the process	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde				The issues risk assessment and tolerable risk are causing conflicting reactions not only among Health and Safety experts. Experienced designers are sometimes unsettled, too. The controversies are mainly about numerical probabilistic representations. These were recently introduced in the field of general machinery safety. The probabilistic methods encounter a well-proven practical state-of-the-art, which is merely based on qualitatively defined requirements. From this non-quantitative descriptive background, the advantage of the probabilistic theory is clearly visible: the entire risk reduction process can be detailed in single quantitative factors showing the proportions to enable a more effective engineering. Surprisingly, the key term "probability" turned out to be ambiguous. It is obvious that verifiably founded probabilities, such as e.g. real findings in the operational field and logically deduced probability estimations are better than not scalable subjective gut feeling, speculation and pure hypothetical assumption. That is to say, objective probabilities are always more reliable than subjective probabilities. It is hard to believe, but for the time being, the normative frame for machinery safety does not contain a numerical risk model, which summarizes the single factors plausibly to an overall risk, in order to e.g. compare theoretical results with empirical field data. As a consequence, fictitious hazards and the actual risks are being mashed up again and again, so that in controversial discussions in the world of safety standardi-zation (ISO 12100, ISO 13849-1 etc.), mostly the strongest gut feeling overtrumps logical considerations. As regards the high safety level of German machine tools, it is frustrating that the "secret of our success" in reducing accident data still cannot be explained plausibly on the background of existing safety standards: it is the massive risk reduction effects due to the combination of a) moveable and fixed guards of the full machine enclosure, and b) the implicit and explicit fault detection in the process. It brings about a kind of "systematic safety integrity" on the machine level, on the background of very high availabilities (which is equivalent to high inherent safety). It can only be incorporated in the risk parameter "O" (reducing the occurrence probability of a hazard). Unfortunately, the recently amended functional safety standard ISO 13849-1 does not at all provide a consideration of this very important risk reduction principle, despite it has a long and successful history in standardization and in the operational practice of automatic production. And it even is a key element of the proven-in-use findings, which VDW presented at the ESREL symposiums every year since 2013. And in 2016, another paper of IMA and VDW is going to illustrate the most recent empirical results out of a two decades long data base.

We focus on the fact that human experts in many maintenance areas generally listen to sounds when monitoring machine conditions. They can determine machine conditions by listening. Therefore, it is possible to assess machine fault sound simulators based on whether humans find the sound plausible. We successfully generated abnormal sounds that were synthesized from normal machine sounds using several parameters. The simulated sounds were assessed in two steps. One used theoretically synthesized sounds at various loudness levels and a vibration knowledge database. The other involved assessment by human experts by ear. We successfully generated plausible sounds for three rotor rotation machine failures and four roller bearing faults. The sounds were assessed by three human experts who had more than 10 years of experience in machine maintenance in two different areas. Their assessment results were consistent for our parameters.

Considering the cost limitations, the main goal is to optimize the machinery system availability. The model takes the advantage of a classification tool based on support vector machines principles. Statistical assumptions are also considered for validity of the analysis. The test and statistical demonstration phases are also supported with the data, gathered from the specifically created operational scenarios in ship engine room simulator. The results of the study can be adopted to conceptualize a continuous monitoring tool on ship system reliability. Furthermore, real case application potential of the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis system is comprehensively discussed.

This paper proposes a framework to detect new patterns of abnormal conditions in gearboxes, that would be associated to new faults. This is achieved through a Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm for Evolving Models in scenarios of Classification and Clustering (HHA-EMCC), which is a machine learning algorithm that can be adapted to solve problems related to classification and clustering both combined. The design aims at creating clusters and classes inspired by the main principles of the nearest neighbour (1-NN) strategy and K-means. HHA-EMCC has the particularity of detecting new clusters after being trained, this characteristic defines some guidelines that determine whether a cluster represents new knowledge or not. The framework is able to discover abnormal conditions from unlabelled data through cluster constructions. This analysis can lead to labelling these clusters as new classes. Once a new pattern is identified, the associated data feeds the current classifier for a new training phase. The proposed framework is tested on a fault dataset for gearboxes and experimental results show that valuable new knowledge is obtained.

In current literature, there have been a few studies highlighting life prediction for equipment subjected to the influence of imperfect maintenance activities. Aiming at this problem, we firstly put forward a stochastic degradation model based on the Wiener process considering the influence of imperfect maintenance activities on the degradation level and degradation rate. Then, the theoretical expression of life probability distribution can be derived under the concept of first hitting time using the convolution operation, and the approximate expression of life probability distribution can be derived by the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the newly proposed life prediction method.

Usually, feature selection or reduction are conducted through several techniques proposing a unique set of representative features for all available classes; nevertheless, in feature selection, it has been recognized that a set of individually good features do not necessarily lead to good classification. This paper proposes a general framework to analyse the feature selection oriented to identify the features that can produce clusters of data with a proper structure. In the first stage, the framework uses Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) combined with Tukey's test for ranking the significant features individually. In the second stage, a further analysis based on inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances, is accomplished to rank subsets of significant features previously identified. In this sense, our contribution aims at discovering the subset of features that are discriminating better the clusters of data associated to several faulty conditions of the mechanical devices, to build more robust fault multi-classifiers. Fault severity classification in rolling bearings is studied to test the proposed framework, with data collected from an experimental test bed under real conditions of speed and load on the rotating device.

Owing to these advantages, deep neural networks (DNNs) are superior to traditional artificial neural networks with shallow architectures, and are thus becoming widely used in the fault diagnosis field. To overcome the difficulties in bearing fault type classification and severity diagnosis, a two-layer hierarchical fault diagnosis network based on sparse DNNs is presented in this paper. In the proposed hierarchical fault diagnosis network, the first layer is responsible for fault type identification, and the second layer is responsible for fault severity diagnosis. An autoregressive (AR) model is established using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain the AR parameters as the input vectors of the proposed diagnosis network. The AR parameters are regarded as the low-level features which are helpful for the diagnosis network mine more useful high-level features.

The inverse first-order reliability method (Inverse FORM) is an uncertainty propagation method that can be adapted to remaining useful life (RUL) calculation. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is first applied to estimate the current degradation state of the system, then the Inverse FORM allows to compute the probability density function (pdf) of the RUL. In the proposed Inverse FORM methodology, an analytical or numerical solution to the differential equation that describes the evolution of the system degradation is required to calculate the RUL model. In this work, the method is applied to a Paris fatigue crack growth model, and then compared to filter-based methods such as EKF and particle filter using performance evaluation metrics (precision, accuracy and timeliness). The main advantage of the Inverse FORM is its ability to compute the pdf of the RUL at a lower computational cost.

Nonstationary signal analysis is considered one of the main topics in field of machinery fault diagnosis. A set of signal processing techniques has been studied to investigate their feasibility for bearing fault detection in wind turbine gearbox. These techniques include statistical condition indicators, Spectral kurtosis, and envelope analysis. The result of vibration analysis showed the possibility of bearing detection in wind turbine high speed shaft using multiple signal processing techniques. However, among all these signal processing techniques, Spectral Kurtosis followed by envelope analysis provides early fault detection compared to the other techniques employed.

Compared with the single-component systems, the output of control systems may remain satisfactory tracking on the reference output due to the distinctive structure of closed-loop feedback, even if the structural parameters of internal components degenerate. This will result in the inner degradation difficult to detect, showing a characteristic of hidden degradation. In the existing literatures, there are scarce researches on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction of control systems, which consider the hidden degradation process under the closed-loop feedback control. In this paper, a prediction method of RUL based on analytic model is proposed for a class of deterministic closed-loop control systems only considering actuator degenerating. In addition, there are more factors that affect the reliability of control systems than the single-component systems. This paper considers three-source factors: control constraint, degradation model and random disturbance, which have direct or indirect effects on the systems reliability. Then, the factors are respectively abstracted into a corresponding parameter in the system model for conveniently discussing their specific influence on the results of RUL prediction. The simulation results of stabilization loop control system in inertial platform indicate that the corresponding RUL prediction method is effective and feasible.

Reliability analysis of product fleets based on operating data: Separation of risky fleet parts and partial risk prognosis	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde				The increasing complexity of product functionality and manufacturing process parameters often leads to complex failure modes and reliability problems within the product life cycle. Especially in the case of mass production of consumer goods - e.g. automobiles, washing machines, personal computers - an increasing percentage of damaged products within the product fleet can lead to garage or recall actions. If the manufacturer receives knowledge about the first damage claims based on a field observation, a risk probability prognosis is the base of operations regarding further actions. This paper outlines an approach to determine the risk probability in product fleets based on a combined multi-variate analysis of the product failure behaviour and the customer product usage profile. It shows a possibility to implement different lifespan variables into one risk prognosis. Using a multivariate cluster analysis gives high detailed information about the fleet, the failure mode and the field actions based on the results of the risk prognosis than the classical way. Additionally the influence of using different multivariate cluster analysis methods regarding to the risk prognosis will be shown and compared. This paper demonstrates the theoretical background and describes the application of this approach. Additionally the primary focus of this paper is on the comparison of the result using different clustering methods and the impact on the risk prognosis after clustering. The paper shows only a little extraction of a bigger case study to give an impression of the requirements choosing the right cluster criteria. The demonstrated case study is based on a synthetic field data set from the automotive industry and includes e.g. field operating times, kilometrage and switching cycles on the car and component level.

Therefore, the efficient diagnosis method to detect faults and distinguish fault types at an early stage in bearings is necessary. This paper presents a fault diagnosis method for bearings using finite element method (FEM), wavelet packet transform (WPT) and support vector machine (SVM). In this method, the accurate FE models of the faulty bearing (faults in inner race and rolling body) are constructed and the vibration signals of the faulty bearing are obtained. Decompose the vibration signal into eight signal components using WPT and ten time-domain feature parameters of all the signal components are calculated to generate the training samples to train the SVM, the measured vibration signal and its components decomposed by WPT serve as a test sample to the trained SVM.

Robust and accurate battery prognosis is indispensable not just in satellite autonomous mission planning but also in self-determined maintenance. Prognosis based on indirect health indicators (HIs) provide an effective non-invasive approach to identify the battery degradation state. But identification and extraction of effective HIs in different working conditions is still a challenge. In this paper, a self-adaptive non-invasive HIs extraction approach is explored, which benefits enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the indirect health indicators under different working situation. A cluster of potential HIs are extracted from the data samples of the battery. Principle component analysis (PCA) is taken into consideration to select and fuse those different HIs. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid HI. The verifications show that the proposed self-adaptive indirect HIs extraction approach can achieve promising results with high relativity with direct HIs, even operating with diverse conditions.

First of all, nonlinear de noising method with unsupervised manifold learning is presented, by combining advantages of manifold learning in mining of nonlinear structure and phase space reconstruction in representation of signal and noise spatial distribution. Then, the frequency spectrum of vibration signals after de-noising is used for fault feature extraction. In order to reduce the high dimensionality and remove redundant information of frequency spectrum, an improved supervised local tangent space alignment (ISLTSA) is proposed. ISLTSA further increases interclass distance and further reduces intraclass distance, and as a result the extracted fault features are more identifiable. At last, the extracted low-dimensional fault features are inputted into a pattern recognition method for fault identification. A fault diagnosis case in bearings is studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper presents a model-based method to implement the condition estimation and a data-driven method to conduct the prognosis for boost converter. Firstly, the equivalent circuit for non-ideal boost converter should be simplified and the state space equation should be obtained. Then, constructing the objective function for crow search algorithm (CSA) and several parameters like inductance, on-resistance of Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), capacitance and equivalent series resistance of capacitor are estimated based on CSA. Considering components degradation and variable operating conditions, several simulation experiments have been conducted to validate the presented approach. Finally, the prognosis for capacitor of the boost converter has been conducted based on the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm. The results show that this technique characterizes high computation efficiency and good estimation accuracy. Also, it will be a basis of further study for the circuit-level remaining useful life prediction.

Therefore, performing bearing fault diagnosis is a key point to improve the reliability of the mechanical systems and reduce the corresponding operating expense. Recently, more and more studies focus on addressing this problem through detection transient signal by means of sparse representation (SR) theory. Although tremendous progress has been made, one important drawback remains to be solved: in the early stage of bearing failure, the incipient impact signal is relatively weak, which is hard to detect due to other mechanical components harmonic signals and interference of noise. In order to solve this problem, spectral kurtosis (SK), a popular tool to detect non-stationary signal, is introduced as a pre-procedure of the transient signal sparse representation. A novel sparse representation based on spectral kurtosis method is proposed in this work, namely the SKSR. SKSR utilizes the advantages of both of the methods: it is possible to choose the best matching of the atomic signal with the failure signal structure feature to gain sparse representation and efficiently extract transient signal from strong noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerically simulations and lab experiments. The results show that the presented method is efficient for the title problem.

The least square support vector machine (LSSVM), which is a kind of novel artificial intelligence technology, has scored tremendous achievements in this field. Among kinds of methods, multivariable LSSVM takes a full consideration of multiple variables to improve the accuracy of prediction. However, it may ignore the influence factors with time. To improve the performance of multivariable LSSVM, a kind of multivariable LSSVM over time slices is proposed which considers both the influence of multivariable and volatility of data. Firstly, several sensitive features are chosen to construct a new training sample which include the information of data volatility. Then LSSVM is employed to construct the model for prognosis. The vibration signals generated by an accelerated bearing run-to-failure experiment are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results show that the multivariable LSSVM over time slices outperforms general multivariable LSSVM.

In order to detect incipient failures due to a progressive wear of a primary flight command EMA, prognostics could employ several approaches; the choice of the best ones is driven by the efficacy shown in failure detection, since not all the algorithms might be useful for the proposed purpose. In other words, some of them could be suitable only for certain applicationswhile they could not give useful results for others. Developing a prognostic algorithm able to identify the precursors of the above mentioned EMAs faults and their degradation pattern is thus beneficial for anticipating the incoming failure and alerting the maintenance crew such to properly schedule the servomechanism replacement. The goal of this paper is to propose an innovative model-based fault detection and identification (FDI) method, based on Simulated Annealing (SA) Algorithms, investigating its ability to timely identify symptoms alerting that an EMA component is degrading and will eventually exhibit an anomalous behavior. In particular, this work is focused on the analysis of progressive faults typically affecting the electrical components of the EMAs (e.g. electronic control, BLDC motor windings) and proposes a robust algorithm able to deal multiple faults. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed FDI technique, an appropriate simulation test environment was developed: two MATLAB Simulink models representing the real EMA and the corresponding monitor have been respectively used to simulate progressive failures and to evaluate the accuracy of this prognostic algorithm. The results showed an adequate robustness of the FDI technique and a satisfying confidence was gained about its ability to early identify an eventual EMA malfunctioning with low risk of false alarms or missed failures. This paper aims to be a starting point to future works based on this method for PHM applications.	[Vedova, Matteo D. L.

A deep neural network (DNN) method for gear fault diagnosis based on stacked autoencode (SAE) and softmax regression is presented in this work. SAE is first utilized to extract features from the frequency spectra of vibration signal. And then the learned features are used to train softmax regression classifier for identifying gear faults. The diagnosis results validate that the method is feasible and is able to acquire superior classification performance. With the increasing layers of DNN, the learned features of each hidden layer are becoming more and more robust for classification. In this paper, a novel view on the visualization of the learned features is displayed to evaluate the DNN-based fault diagnosis method.

Generally, most of the models used for fault diagnosis are based on the same data distribution, while the applications of the equipment in actual production and operation are mostly under unstable conditions, which may make data distribution different and the model unavailable. For example, various operating conditions (e.g. variable speed) in reciprocating compressor may cause difference of data distribution, so the present model established under a stable condition is no longer applicable to fault diagnosis of the compressor under other conditions. Therefore, a model should be established to reduce the differences caused by different operating conditions as much as possible. And at the same time, the model is supposed to synthesis representative features under different conditions containing defects. Domain adaptation is widely used for cross-domain data mining and setting up a learning model applied to source domain and target domain sampled from discrepant distributions. So it can be used to reduce the cross-domain discrepancy by learning joint feature representation. Nonetheless, when it comes to the random assimilation, the feature representation assimilated for each category makes it impossible to distinguish. Hence we propose a strategy that auxiliary feature, as another type of abstract feature which is adept in representation of respective domain for category, is embedded to enhance the representative features for classification. And we also establish an actual complex model. This model can take advantage of rational weakening and strengthening from domain adaptation and assisted training features to ensure a high classification accuracy in the target domain. Experimental results of a reciprocating compressor under different operating conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This paper proposes a novel fractional-order smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (FrSPWVD) to solve the above problem. The details about step of the calculation are as follows: the appropriate fractional order of original signals are determined firstly; then fractional order Fourier transform transforms the original signals in the most appropriate fractional domain, and transformed signals are analyzed by SPWVD; lastly, parameters of original signals are accurately extracted according to the corresponding appropriate fractional order and fractional frequency of signals. By analyzing the signals in the most appropriate fractional domain, the proposed time-frequency distribution can obtain the time-frequency representation with much higher resolution compared to the classical SPWVD. Simulation results and fault diagnosis cases show the efficiency of the proposed method.

Statistics show that 75% of hydraulic system mechanical failures are caused by oil contamination. During the normal working condition of hydraulic equipment, the particles in hydraulic oil have a constant concentration and small size. When abnormal wear occurs, the concentration and the size of particles will increase rapidly. Compared with conventional hydraulic system, marine hydraulic system works in a harsh environment, so it requires high clean hydraulic oil. The qualitative detection and quantitative counting of oil particle contamination is of important significance to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the marine machineries. A novel inductance/ capacitance microfluidic chip is presented for the detection of multi-contamination in marine hydraulic oil in this paper. The microfluidic chip consists of d a straight microchannel with two embedded single-layer inductance coils, which is not only a micro inductor to detect the inductance changes of the oil but also a micro capacitor to detect the capacitance changes of the oil. In the inductance experiments, iron particles in the size of in the size of 80 to 90 mu m and copper particles in the size of 150 to 160 mu m in the oil are successfully detected and the inductance signals of the two type particles are distinguishable. In the capacitance experiments, water droplets in the size of 180 to 190 mu m and bubbles in the size of 240 to 260 mu m in the hydraulic oil are detected and their signals are also distinguishable. Based on the inductance/capacitance microfluidic chip, an integral micro detection system is presented. The micro detection system is expected to provide supports for fault prognostics and diagnosis in marine hydraulic systems.

This paper presents a Particle Filtering based multi-level prognostics approach to predict the Remaining Useful Life of a system based on its State of Health degradation estimation with online inspections of covariates. A degrading system is simulated with covariates at different level. By investigating the covariate online, the degradation estimation shows a better prediction and lower cost than the estimation without inspection.

In the existing literature, most RUL prediction methods are under the assumption that there is no maintenance activity during the whole life time of the degrading system. However, most practical systems experience various kinds of maintenance activities when they are in operation. This article presents an approach to predict the RUL of a class of nonlinear degrading systems with stochastic maintenance. To predict the RUL for systems with stochastic maintenance, a wiener process based degradation model is proposed. The switches between states of normal operation and maintenance are described by a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). In addition, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is adopted to estimate both unknown parameters in the degradation model and the transition probability between normal operation and maintenance. The analytical form of first hitting time (FHT) of degradation process is difficult to derive with the presence of maintenance activities. To avoid complicated mathematical derivation of stochastic differential, Monte Carlo method is used to obtain a numerical result of the RUL distribution. A numerical study is presented to illustrate and validate the proposed method.

However, due to the shutdown during a short period, the regeneration phenomena may occur and further affect the degradation state and rate. In this paper, we concentrate on degradation modeling for such degradation process with the regeneration phenomena. Firstly, we adopt the traditional Wiener process to describe the continuous degradation path and a nonlinear regression model to reflect the regeneration process. Secondly, since the analytical forms of parameters estimation via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) cannot be obtained, we identify the parameters by combining the Bayes rule and expectation conditional estimation (ECM) algorithm. Thirdly, a numerical approach based on Monte Carlo method is given for deriving the RUL under the concept of the first passage time (FPT). Two case examples are provided for illustration including numerical and practical cases.

This paper presents a locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA) based feature dimensionality reduction approach. Different from locally preserving projection (LPP) that only preserves the local structure of data manifold, LSDA can also employ the discriminant information at each local area when conducting the projection. In the proposed fault diagnosis approach, various multi-domain features are calculated aimed at exploring the machinery condition information roundly from different perspectives. LSDA is applied to discover the representative information contained in the high dimensional feature set. Then a lower informative feature space can be constructed with LSDA. Finally, the effective KNN classifier is used to recognize the condition of machinery with the most representative eigenvectors. A bearing fault experiment is conducted to verify the proposed method. The comparison study with PCA, LPP and KLPP indicates that LSDA has advantages in dimensionality reduction and the proposed fault diagnosis approach is effective.

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, as one main approach of PHM, provides early warning of failures that can be used to determine the necessary maintenance and replacement of batteries in advance. The existing RUL prediction techniques for lithiumion batteries are inefficient to learn the long-term dependencies of aging characteristics with the degradation evolution. This paper investigates deep-learning-enabled battery RUL prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to learn the capacity degradation trajectories of lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM RNN is adaptively optimized using the resilient mean square back-propagation method. The developed LSTM RNN is able to capture the underlying long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities such that an explicitly capacity-oriented RUL predictor is constructed. Experimental data from one lithium-ion battery cell is deployed for model construction and verification. This is the first known application of deep learning theory to battery RUL predictions.

When fault exists, gearbox vibration signals feature amplitude modulation as well as frequency modulation, resulting in complex frequency structure. Besides, gearboxes often work under nonstationary conditions due to time-varying speed/load, resulting in nonstationary vibration signals which makes conventional frequency domain analysis ineffective. In this paper, we propose a time-frequency demodulation analysis method for presenting time-frequency spectra of both amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of analyzed signal, which directly reflect the fault frequency components on time-frequency plane without complex sidebands. To fulfill the mono-component requirement of instantaneous frequency estimation by Hilbert transform, iterative generalized demodulation is effectively exploited to decompose multi-component nonstationary signals into mono-components. Both numerical simulated and lab experimental gearbox vibration signals under nonstationary conditions are analyzed by the proposed method, and gear faults are effectively detected.

This paper presents a novel fault diagnosis method to diagnose ordinary soft fault and incipient soft fault for linear analog circuit. Due to the presence of analog circuit noise stress and the tolerance of the components, the linear circuit responses are considered as a stochastic process; and the time responses are acquired by sampling the outputs of the circuits under test. In this study, the local mean decomposition (LMD) method is used to decompose the stochastic series into a set of functions, each of which is the product of an envelope signal and a frequency modulated signal. The noises are decomposed and extracted from the sampled signals, which are later reconstructed. In the next step, the fault signatures are extracted from the de-noised series by applying the improved wavelet transform. Then the de-noised series samples are randomly selected as the training sample group and testing sample group. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is tested by SVM classifier. The proposed incipient fault diagnosis procedure is performed and verified on a Sallen-Key band-pass filter circuit and a four-op-amp high-pass filter circuit, which reveals improved accuracy of the proposed approach.

Accurate RUL prediction is crucial not only to the verification of mission goals but also to failure prevention and maintenance decision in a more effective and efficient manner. However, the substantial nonlinearity is one of most important challenges in deterioration modeling and RUL estimation of nonlinear mechanical system. An interesting contribution is the improvement of RUL prediction accuracy by the use of both greedy kernel principal components analysis (GKPCA) for dimensional reduction to extract feature from multi dimension data set of monitored nonlinear mechanical system and nonhomogeneous hidden semi-Markov model (NHSMM) to model the multistate deterioration process. A case study with the data set from turbofan engines is analyzed using the methodology, and by comparing the prediction accuracy with the previously linear PCA-NHSMM's, the result verifies the effectiveness (closer to actual RUL, earlier tracked health state, smaller boundary width) and efficiency(higher prognostics robustness) of the methodology.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has the characteristics of simple, easy to implement and found the local optimum quickly. This paper proposes the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to optimize the two parameters and to obtain the electronics system fault diagnosis based on PSO-ELM. Two analog circuits, one is complex; the other is simple, are designed to obtain the original data in the essay. Then, wavelet transform and PCA are combined to extract the feature of samples information. Take the processed data into the PSO-ELM to get the diagnosis results, meanwhile, compared the optimal performance of PSO, glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) and bat algorithm (BA) to ELM, experiments show that PSO is the most efficient to improve the diagnostic accuracies of the two circuits, the results obtained with PSO-ELM reach to 98.89% and 99.46% respectively.

Manufacturing and processing enterprises always want to improve the passing rate and the life of the machining workpiece and reduce unnecessary costs during processing. This must strictly control machining process based mechanical process systems, however, due to non-ideal conditions of the actual process, the process is unstable, resulting in the quality of the product cannot be controlled during processing. In this paper, we propose a kind of machine fault pre-warning and diagnosis method based online testing of the process to solve this problem that machine fault can cause the quality problems of the workpiece during machining, collecting real-time machine state parameters by the sensor signal, using signal analysis methods such as Fourier transform and wavelet analysis, and analyzing real-time process monitoring data, and classifying data By KNN algorithm, and judging the machine working status and it's fault occurrence, and using LabVIEW to construct of the entire monitoring and controlling environment and to applied to the actual data, and processing and analyzing real-time data in the machining process that can judge the state of the machine, so the faults of the machine can be early found, there, by reducing the failure rate of the workpiece.

It is easy to be damaged which can cause mechanical fault. Thus, it is significance to study fault diagnosis technology on rolling bearing. This paper presents a Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM) model to identify the fault condition of rolling bearing. A data set with seven fault patterns is collected to evaluate the performance of DBM for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, which is based on the health condition of a rotating mechanical system.

More accurate RUL prediction results will lead to more reasonable decision making on sequential management activities including maintenance, replacement, spare parts ordering, etc. In engineering practice, many products exhibit more volatile degradation paths when they have high degradation rates. By this observation, this paper concerns the problem of RUL prediction for a class of critical products which possess positive correlation between degradation rate and volatility. A Wiener-process-based degradation model with a special volatility parameter form is developed to achieve the aim. In this model, the volatility parameter has been set dependent on the drift parameter reflecting the degradation rate to describe the concerned problem. Both Bayesian updating and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm are used to estimate the unknown parameters in the model depend on the historically-observed degradation data. An exact and closed-form RUL distribution, which incorporates the random-effect capturing the unit-to-unit variability, is derived under the concept on the first passage time. Finally, a practical case study is used to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method. The results show that the proposed approach can provide a more accurate RUL estimation for degradation system with volatile degradation path.

A novel model combining SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) and binary tree (BT) based on Mahalanobis distance is put forward to address the multi-classification problems under unbalanced datasets. The idea of the proposed method is to divide the original samples into a series of subsets by adopting binary tree, and then build classifier by describing the boundary of the target via SVDD. The proposed method has emphatically studied on: 1) Separability measure based on Mahalanobis distance. It represents the separability degree which takes the unbalanced degree and distance between each class into account, and takes the advantages of considering the relations among all the features of the datasets by the definition of Mahalanobis distance, it is helpful to determine the structure of the binary tree. 2) Train classifiers by using SVDD. Choose the target class according to the order of binary tree. The proposed method can be applied to multi-classification problems with unbalanced datasets issues. To validate this methodology, samples from unbalanced rotor are employed for experiment. Then, the experimental result compared with other methods is presented showing that the proposed methodology has a better performance and higher classification accuracy on multi-classification problems under unbalanced datasets.

To gain maturity and to take more accurate decisions, algorithms need a reality check on the significance of their results. Algorithms have been deployed on in service fleets of engines, getting access to large amounts of data. Nevertheless, probabilities of failure are very low. Thus there are not enough degradation cases collected to compute with accuracy performance metrics, such as Probability of False Alarm (PFA) and Probability of Detection (PoD), for each algorithm. To address this issue, healthy indicators distributions are used to set detection alarm thresholds. Those thresholds are first checked on healthy data and on rare degradations. Algorithms shall indeed raise no alarm on healthy cases and detect all rare degradations. This allows to alarm the operator only when a health indicator is changing. On the base of following observed failure mechanisms, simulations can help to compute with accuracy performance metrics.

Traditional signal processing methods, such as Fourier analysis, as a result face challenges for a proper fault diagnostic. To achieve a more effective fault diagnosis, this paper proposes a signal selection scheme which is based on order tracking techniques. The basic procedures of the proposed scheme are as follow: Firstly, Computed Order Tracking is applied to reveal order contents and identify the order(s) of interest. Secondly, Vold-Kalman filter order tracking is used to extract the order(s) of interest - these filtered order(s) constitute the so called selected vibration signal. Experimental studies on planetary gearbox demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis.	[Feng, Ke; Wang, K.

By utilizing noise instead of suppressing noise, stochastic resonance (SR) has been successfully applied to weak signal detection in some fields. Aiming at solving one of open problems in the normal SR, i.e. the effective detection of a multi-frequency weak signal, this paper proposes a modified mechanism, in which the cascaded SR and the parallel SR systems are combined together to detect possible weak signal components in a complicated signal. The signal to be analyzed is firstly divided into multiple data segments and then concurrently processed by the parallel SR system to detect its weak signal components. Considering that the output of single enhancement may be not enough for the feature signal detection, this output signal is further enhanced by the cascaded SR system until the weak signals can be clearly identified from its spectrum analysis. The simulation result and comparison demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for detecting multiple weak signals.

The proposed approach is based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELM). OS-ELM have the advantages of a strong learning ability, very fast training, and online learning. The concept of applying OS-ELM to fault detection is demonstrated on an artificial case study. We expect that OS-ELM can contribute to improve the fault detection and also the associated initiation of maintenance activities for engineering components working in an evolving environment such as electric components, bearings, gears, alternators, shafts and pumps, in which the monitored signals are not only significantly affected by working load and surrounding environment but may also experience some modifications due to a slow aging and degradation process.

Closed-loop control instead of open-loop control have been adopted in SEPIC converters, and the fault prognostic methods used for open-loop converters sometimes are no longer suitable for closed-loop converters. Besides, the system-level fault feature parameters (FFP) is often influenced not only by the fault modes, but also by the variation of working conditions. To address these problems, an innovative system-level FFP represents the degradation status of the entire converter under variable operating conditions is extracted, and a prognostic method based on the degradation trend of the FFP is proposed. Firstly, the deterioration laws of some system-level parameters with the change of critical components under different operating conditions are studied. Then, a system-level performance parameter of closed-loop SEPIC converters which is sensitive to the degradation of all critical components and has regular trend is chosen, and the degradation performance parameter under rated operating condition is obtained as FFP by multivariate least-squares regression. Finally, the trend prediction of the FFP is performed based on Extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize the prognosis of closed-loop SEPIC converters. The experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The health condition assessment index is constructed with Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between two alpha-stable distributions, which are statistical models of vibration signals in normal condition and fault condition. Experimental results based on the run-to-failure bearing test data have shown that KLD index based on alpha-stable distribution model can efficiently assess the health condition of tested bearings.

Vibration signature analysis usually provides a good potential for gearbox incipient fault detection. This article presents an application of frequency analysis on vibration signatures obtained from a faulty gearbox. Experiments were carried out on an accessory gearbox of a J85 engine, which serves on several aircrafts such as Canadair CT-114 Tutor. Real operating system of the gearbox is reconstructed on a test rig located at the National Research Council of Canada. A spalling defect was artificially introduced to a flank of one of the pinions of the gearbox at the meshing section. Vibrations of the gearbox under various operating conditions are measured by an accelerometer mounted on the gearbox housing. Raw signals are first time synchronous-averaged (TSA) to reduce noise and then the averaged signals are transformed into frequency domain for analysis. Order analysis, which represents all frequencies in terms of shafts' rotating frequency, is employed instead of traditional frequency analysis in this investigation. Testing results demonstrate that the fundamental and the second gear mesh frequency (GMF) contain the major features of the gearbox health condition. Analysis results also show that at a constant operating speed, the spalling defect attenuates the power of the fundamental GMF while strengthens the power of the second GMF. Accordingly, the magnitude ratio between the fundamental and the second GMF is introduced as an indicator for spalling defect detection. The fault indicator is capable of clearly distinguishing the normal pinion from the defected one. It is also observed that the proposed fault indicator is robust and is consistent as the load on the gear is varied.

This paper presents a data-driven approach for estimating RUL using principle component and instance learning. The approach is especially suitable for situations in which abundant run-to-failure (RtF) data are available. Firstly, the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find the low-dimensional principal components (PCs) from the statistical features of the measured signals. Then, the health indicators (HI) can be obtained by using weighted Euclid distance (WED), and regressed by the data-driven methods or model-based methods. Finally, the method based on instance learning is employed to estimate the RUL of the machine under operation. The performance of the prognostics approach introduced in this paper is demonstrated by using turbofan engine degradation simulation data set, which is supplied by NASA Ames.

Model-Based Fault Diagnosis and Prognosis for Electric Power Steering Systems	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 20-22, 2016	Carleton Univ, Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Reliabil Soc	Carleton Univ	electric power steering; fault detection; fault isolation; diagnosis; prognosis; vehicle health management; least squares estimation; vehicle dynamics; self-aligning torque; extended observer; residuals; parity equations	DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS	Electric Power Steering (EPS) is an advanced steering system that consists of two subsystems: electrical and mechanical subsystems. EPS systems not only provide steering assist to drivers but they are also actuators for recently developed active safety features, such as lane keeping and lane changing assist. Failure of some component of the EPS system can lead to walk-home situations and increased warranty costs. Hence, for the improvement of reliability, safety, and efficiency of EPS systems, fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis become increasingly important. This paper provides fault detection for EPS systems through model-based techniques using parameter estimation to determine the current electric parameters of the EPS motor. In addition, by monitoring the deviation of the self-aligning torque (SAT) estimated from two different methods, changes in EPS mechanical parameters can be detected. The progression of this deviation can be fed into a health state estimator which can give an indication of state of health and remaining useful life. Computer simulations as well as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to illustrate this method. Finally, for integrated system diagnosis and fault isolation, a fault signature table is constructed based on estimations of motor parameters, calculations of road SAT, and residuals of parity equations. This table can be used to detect and isolate considered electrical, mechanical, and sensor faults in the EPS system and simulation results are shown to verify the developed ideas.

Traditional data-driven models trained on all fleet data provide only a general degradation trend, without capturing the specificity of the degradation process of the different assets. A two-step data-driven framework is here proposed to tackle this problem. A general model is trained traditionally on all fleet data and a correction model is built to estimate the deviation of the general model outcome from the degradation process of the specific asset of interest. The proposed framework is tested on a case study concerning the failure of a pneumatic valve in a nuclear power plant. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-step, data-driven framework.

Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is a very useful ensemble method in these fusion approaches because of its ability of uncertainty quantification. A fusion model based on BMA and relevance vector machine (RVM) is presented in this paper. Multi RVM models with eight different kernel functions are constructed for the degradation of training data. Then, BMA is used to integrate these RVM sub-models into one framework for the reliability of prognostic. The main advantages of this method are: 1) to solve the lack of uncertainty management of existing fusion remaining useful life (RUL) estimation methods and 2) to improve the prediction performance by ensemble multi complex nonlinear sub-models based on BMA, while most of BMA applications are to integrate some simple linear sub-models result in low prediction precision. Finally, for the low multistep-ahead off-line model prediction precision, an online iterated training strategy is introduced for BMA algorithm to realize high prediction performance. The experiments and the results with the battery data sets from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) demonstrate the effectiveness and the reliability of our proposed ensemble prognostic approach.

By their very nature, these systems pose several technical obstacles. The systems to be monitored are distributed, often at remote locations, requiring a data collection network infrastructure that is secure, robust to intermittent connectivity and scalable. Heterogeneous "leading indicator" data is collected from various sources: discrete forms of data such as status, state, mode, system error reporting and inputs from other software systems; parametric data such as environmental sensors and system sensors; and manually collected data such as operator observables and maintenance actions performed. Disparate sources and forms of data also pose a challenge for analysis. Thus, in order to implement a CBM solution for complex distributed systems, it must be based on three core pillars: smart sensors capable of collecting heterogeneous data types, scalable and generically applicable predictive analysis methodologies, and a secure network infrastructure. Mikros is currently deploying a CBM+ system for combat systems on the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). In this CBM+ system application, smart sensors are used to collect heterogeneous data from Navy combat systems. Data is collected in IEEE SIMICA standard format and transferred securely from LCS ships deployed around the world to a central server in the U.S. The Prognostics Framework (R), a model-based prognostics reasoning engine, is used to analyze all data to produce prognostic alarms, identify maintenance action needs, report Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of key components, and provide a comprehensive health management capability for the LCS fleet. In summary, heterogeneous data collection made possible through smart sensor technology, model-based prognostics, and a secure network infrastructure provide a flexible and extensible framework to implement CBM for complex distributed systems. Without these core capabilities, CBM falls short of its goals to proactively support maintenance needs, increase system readiness and reliability and reduce overall life-cycle costs of today's complex distributed systems.

Therefore accurate fault diagnosis of machine failure is vital to the operation and production departments. The majority of Machine imperfections and malfunctions have been related to bearings faults. Many researchers are still exploring to find suitable diagnosis strategies and techniques to detect incipient bearing faults. A new integrated Hilbert-Huang technique (iHT) is proposed in this paper for bearing fault detection. The iHT takes two processes; firstly: representative signatures are extracted and secondly the resulting selected features are employed to highlight defect-related impulses for incipient bearing fault detection. A novel Jarque-Bera analysis method is suggested to select most prominent characteristic feature functions and the signals are integrated to enhance the features of the condition related function. The effectiveness of the proposed iHT technique is verified by a series of experimental tests corresponding to different bearing health conditions.

In this paper, an improved method is proposed by using support vector regression-unscented particle filter (SVR-UPF), which increases the accuracy of the RUL prediction results. Firstly, an exponential model is adopted to approximately express the degeneration of battery capacity. Secondly, a novel SVR-UPF method is presented to solve the degeneracy phenomenon of the UPF algorithm, and then it is applied to predict the battery RUL. Finally, some experiments and comparisons have been done to validate the improved SVR-UPF prediction method. The results show that the proposed method is better than the standard particle filter (PF) prediction method and the standard unscented particle filter (UPF) prediction method.

This method requires the shaft rotating speed beforehand. However, a tacho is not always allowed to be installed in the industry and furthermore the signal components associated to shaft rotating speed cannot be directly extracted from vibration signals for a bearing case. As such, this paper proposes a tacho-free method for bearing fault diagnosis based on the joint application of oscillatory behaviors based signal decomposition (OBSD) and generalized demodulation (GD) to address the problems. The OBSD method, which is capable of distinguishing impulses (low-oscillation component) from sustained oscillation signal components (high-oscillation component) based on the signal oscillatory behaviors, is firstly used to extract the incipient fault-induced impulses. The extracted impulsive-signal together with the short time Fourier transform (STFT) leads to a TFR dominated by fault-revealing trend lines, from which the instantaneous fault characteristic frequency (IFCF) can be estimated. Guided by the extracted IFCF, the GD is subsequently applied to mapping the trajectory of time-frequency component of interest into a linear path parallel to the time axis. The shaft rotating frequency and IFCF as well as their harmonics can then be identified on the order spectra which assemble all spectra of generalized demodulated signals. The experimental result validates the effectiveness of the proposed method for bearing fault diagnosis.

For data-driven approach, many data analysis methods have been applied for PHM system development including digital signal processing, data mining, machine learning and pattern recognition. And three major goals for PHM system, including health assessment, fault diagnosis and remaining useful life prediction, are achieved by combining different algorithms. However, the challenges for industry are how to efficiently select appropriate tools to develop a suitable PHM solution and how to quickly demonstrate PHM concepts for different applications. The concept of a reconfigurable algorithm toolset titled the Watchdog Agent (R) for PHM was first presented in 2003 and now is a commercialized toolbox in LabVIEW. The Watchdog Agent (R) toolbox consists of selected tools/algorithms from four categories: signal processing, health assessment, fault diagnosis and remaining useful life prediction. LabVIEW, a system design software developed by National Instruments, has been used for measurement, testing, control and data analytics in various areas including wind energy, automobile manufacturing, aerospace, etc. This paper first presents an introduction about Watchdog Agent (R) (WDA) Toolkit and then provides a systematic approach for PHM solutions development in LabVIEW environment. A detailed discussion about data acquisition, data pre-processing, feature extraction, model training and result visualization are provided with case studies.

However, current studies place main focus on continuous degradation processes of systems without the consideration of randomly arriving shocks from changes in inner conditions or external environments. In this paper, we present a new prognostic model to characterize the continuous degradation and randomly arriving shocks. Specifically, we first adopt a Wiener process with a linear drift to characterize the continuous dynamics of the degradation process. In order to model randomly arriving shocks, we propose to use a compound Poisson process to model the impacts on the system's continuous degradation. Under the proposed modeling framework, the probability density function of the estimated RUL is derived and can be updated with the measured degradation data. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the results of the presented method.

The approach relies on two phases: an offline phase for the MEMS and its degradation modeling, and an online phase for its fault prognostics. The proposed approach is applied to a MEMS device consisting in an electro-thermally actuated valve. In the offline phase, an experimental platform is built to validate the obtained nominal behavior model of the targeted MEMS and to get its degradation model. This model represents the drifts in a MEMS physical parameter, which is its compliance. In the online phase, a particle filter algorithm is used to perform online parameters estimation of the derived degradation model and calculate the MEMS remaining useful life.

Statistical filter, i.e., particle filter (PF) is widely used to predict RUL with various models as well as its uncertainty representation. However, PF commonly used suffers from the lack of poor adaption of long-term prediction and iterative prediction. This disadvantage may further reduce the RUL estimation performance. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a hybrid approach with dynamic updating for lithium-ion battery RUL estimation. The estimation results based on data-driven model of long-term degradation trend estimation are used as the observation value for regularized PF (RPF) to obtain the optimal estimation. Moreover, this optimized estimation value is utilized as the update online input to dynamically train the data-driven model, to improve the iterative predicting capability. The proposed approach comprises two ideas: (i) a dynamic updating strategy to predict the capacity of Li-ion battery and (ii) a modified combination of regularized particle filter and ND-AR (Nonlinear Degradation-AutoRegressive) model for accurate and stable RUL estimation. Experiment results suggest that the proposed approach, as a dynamic updating method combined with data-driven and empirical models, achieves better performance on both estimation accuracy and uncertainty representation.

One major problem of machine fault diagnostics is that data presenting faulty behavior is significantly underrepresented resulting in poor classifier accuracy for the faulty classes. Since misclassification of faulty behavior results in unplanned machine breakdowns and thus economic loss, improved fault diagnostics classifiers handling data imbalance are of importance. This paper addresses the problem of binary and multi-class imbalanced data sets. Based on the structural KDD process for data mining, required steps for imbalanced data sets are defined. The KDD process is evaluated through a real-world industrial case including data sampling and the development of a support vector machine classifier.

However, it is very difficult to detect faults of planetary gears, especially when multi-fault happens because of structure complexity. Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) is recognized as an emerging subject in system reliability engineering, in order to identify system failure and guarantee system operational safety. This paper conducted a comprehensive literature survey on new theories and methods of planetary gear fault diagnosis with multi-fault. Topics about multi-fault detection for planetary gears techniques are summarized in two aspects: dynamics modeling of planetary gears and signal processing techniques.

To monitoring their health conditions, how to extract relevant features is extremely important. This paper proposes an integrated method for feature extraction, which utilizes Empirical Mode Decomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (EMD-SVD) to process the signals of point machines. In this method, the power supply signal is first decomposed to a number of intrinsic mode functions and a residue to form a feature matrix. Singular values of this feature matrix are obtained by SVD, at which point Mahalanobis distance (MD) is employed. This method can avoid the segemetation of signals and process them entirely without any manual intervention. Its performance and effectiveness has also been validated via a test rig.

The remaining useful life (RUL) of the system, as a whole, depends on many factors and there are often sudden changes in its progression pattern. The interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator is a filtering technique that tracks multiple models and reports the probability of each model. The information fusion ability of IMM with a built-in probabilistic metric is highly desirable in failure model tracking and higher level fusion. A general framework is proposed to describe the system health by a health index, then the RUL can be evaluated as the current health value divided by the degradation rate of the health index at that moment. Within the general framework of a health index, an IMM estimator is proposed to identify the failure models and evaluate both the values and the confidence interval of the RUL. Simulations on various health degradation models are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the IMM based RUL estimation. Specifically, the RUL sub-models can be with nearly constant degradation rate, with accelerated growing degradation rate, or some drastic break-down due to environmental changes such as a hard failure. In simulations, the truth is known, and hence the performance of the RUL estimator can be precisely assessed. This paper has not only proposed a fusion scheme to handle various failure models, but also presented the data generation procedure of health index in various situations. Such data sets can be used as benchmarks to compare various prognostics techniques.

However the development of predictive models for TTF estimation remains a challenge. To address this issue, we proposed to develop machine learning-based models for TTF estimation by using the techniques from machine learning and data mining. In the past decade, we have been working on the development of machine learning-based models for estimating TTF and applied the developed technology to various real-world applications such as train wheel prognostics, and aircraft engine prognostics. In this paper, we report two kinds of machine learning-based models for estimating TTF, including multistage classification, on-demand regression. The multistage classification improves the TTF estimation over one stage classification by dividing the time window into more small narrow time windows. A case study, APU prognostics, demonstrates the usefulness of the developed methods. The results from the case study show that the machine learning-based modeling method is an effective and feasible way to develop predictive models to estimate TTF for PHM.

It's particularly crucial to monitor the battery state of health and prognosis the battery remaining useful life (RUL). Considering the highly linear correlation between capacity and the changing rate of temperature (TR), a new RUL prediction approach is proposed which provides a better description on the capacity degradation based on the changing rate of battery temperature and cycle number N. First a binary linear regress model is proposed for battery state of health (SOH) and RUL prognosis. Then TR ratio which is extracted for TR prediction is predicted using the chosen historical data considering the similarity of different data sets. Finally, capacity is estimated sequentially based on the proposed model with the predicted TR and cycle number N. The results show that TR can not only indicate state-of-health more accurately, but also provide more precise and better robustness in RUL prediction and SOH monitoring. Furthermore, the regeneration of battery can be accurately predicted by our method.

Among data-driven approaches, one can distinguish between (i) degradation-based approaches that predict the future evolution of the equipment degradation and (ii) direct Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction approaches which directly predict the equipment RUL. In this work, we compare two direct RUL prediction approaches one based on Back Propagation-Artificial Neural Networks (BP-ANN) and the other one on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). The two approaches are compared on data from turbofan engines. We consider different prognostic metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy Index, Steadiness Index, alpha-lambda metric and the time necessary to train and execute the model. The obtained results show that the ELM-based model is performing only slightly worse than the BP-ANN-based model in terms of accuracy and stability, but it requires a considerably shorter training time.

This article presents a methodology to predict the RUL of a class of multi-component systems with hidden degradation processes. In the real industrial process, components of a system are usually in the same environment, so their degradations may be affected by a common factor which is assumed to be public noise. Here two Brownian Motions are adopted in the degradation process of every component to describe the public noise and the private noise separately. The degradation states and model unknown parameters are first identified recursively by Kalman filter and EM algorithm. Then the RUL distribution of every component can be predicted by inferring the first hitting time (FHT) with a known threshold. A numerical example is presented to verify the main results.

However, the randomness of the parameters will influence its generalization performance and precision greatly. This paper proposes a learning algorithm which is based on the differential evolution extreme learning machine (DE-ELM) for parameter optimization of ELM. It can optimize two parameters, input weights and threshold value, which are random-generated in the network. The experiment selects the elliptic filter circuit to build the fault model. We extract the information of the fault samples using the wavelet packet transformation, then compress the data with the method of principal component analysis. Finally, the DE is applied to optimize the parameters of ELM. The results verified that the proposed method significantly enhances the accuracy of the diagnosis.

This paper reports a novel capacity fade analysis method. The parameter degradation of multi-physics model is achieved, and the three main factors of capacity fade is quantitatively calculated by using the obtained parameters. The results show that the loss of active material and the loss of Li inventory is the main reason of capacity fade at high temperature and room temperature, respectively. And the proposed method can further help improving battery (pack) management, reliability and safety.

Due to working under the variable load and speed conditions, they are prone to failure and fault vibration signal generally exhibits many different characteristics from a planetary gearbox under stationary conditions. The existing fault diagnosis theories and technologies for gearboxes fail to effectively solve the difficulties in fault diagnosis of planetary gearboxes under variable conditions. The characteristics and difficulties of fault diagnosis for planetary gearboxes under variable operating conditions are analyzed, and the recent research developments are summarized from the aspect of vibration signal processing. Some key problems in current research are briefly discussed, and some suggestions are given for future research directions.

In order to ensure the safety of aircraft, it is critical to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of EMA. And the RUL prediction can be implemented by utilizing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). However, the GPR algorithm is extremely complex. Hence, a weighted bagging Gaussian Process Regression (WB-GPR) algorithm is presented in this article. To be specific, the significance of RUL prediction of EMA is analyzed, and the variable which can represent the degradation progress of EMA failure is selected. Then the framework to predict the RUL of EMA is realized, with the proposed WB-GPR. Finally the performance of RUL prediction based on WB-GPR is validated by utilizing the sensor data sets from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. Furthermore, the comparison of RUL prediction with GPR and bagging GPR has been achieved. Experimental results demonstrate that the WB-GPR is effective in the RUL prediction with low error rate and standard deviation.

For online prognosis, the fault degradation process should be well revealed. To well capture the evolution process, the proposed approach includes three components, First, the stability factor is defined to identify those significant faulty variables that show degradation process. Second, the fault variations departing from normal status are extracted by performing a modified Fisher discriminant analysis (MFDA) on the selected variables in normal and fault data. These critical variations are deemed to be evolving with time and thus responsible to the future process failure. Third, the significant variations arc captured to track the fault evolution process for fault prognosis by developing a vector auto-regression model to reveal how soon the process failure will happen. By the above modeling strategy, uninformative fault effects that do not present degradation arc excluded so that the true fault degradation process can be focused on for online fault prognosis. The proposed method is verified by both numerical and experimental data. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, C.

As an active branch of fault diagnosis, data-driven methods attract more and more attention in recent years, because they solely depend on information collected in historical databases. The support vector machine (SVM), aims at minimizing the structural risk, exhibits superior generalization ability, and succeeds in the nonlinear classification problem. This paper proposes an improved SVM based fault diagnosis framework, which consists of two primary components: (1) feature extraction; (2) classification. More specifically, multi scale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is performed to achieve multi-scale analysis and dimension reduction. Classification combines SVM classifier with parameters optimization method, which further encompasses grid search (GS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach, we perform experiments on the classical Tennessee Eastman (TE) process.

In this paper, the degradation of the electronic system is driven by a nonlinear Wiener process with a time drift, which is incorporated into the proportional hazards model to describe the hazard rate of the time to failure. Using the discretization of the degradation path and the time axis, closed-form approximations for the reliability quantities are obtained using the transition probability matrix. Unlike the conventional method which is applicable only for a small number of degradation states, the calculation of these quantities can be accomplished with just the basic manipulation of the transition matrix, which is computationally efficient and applicable to real-time conditional reliability calculation for a general number of states. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical study.

This paper proposes a new method for reliability evaluation of a degrading electronic system subject to competing risks of dependent soft and hard failures. The soft failure is described by a nonstationary Gamma process exceeding the predefined critical level. In the previous works the failure modes were considered to be independent, while in this paper the dependent relationship is facilitated using the Cox's proportional hazard model that incorporates the degradation process as a time-varying covariate. To make the evaluation feasible, an approximation technique is applied in both degradation path and time axis, thereby all the reliability quantities can be derived and calculated with basic manipulations of the transition probability matrix. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated and analyzed in a numerical study.

As an extension of testability technology, PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) provides a more sophisticated form to quantify and predict equipment health state and remaining useful life (RUL). Therefore, many researches attach importance to the prognostic validation and verification technology during the past two decades. However, there are fewer studies made in test plan and universal test method of prognostic demonstration test. From the point of statistical view, this paper analyzes the outputs of prognostics and researches on the characteristics of prognostic sample population and sample feature. This paper proposes the standardized description form of prognostics output and build a demonstrable index of prognostic capability. At last, this paper proposes the test methods of prognostic demonstration based on accelerated degradation test and depicts the test plan parameters.

Controller area network (CAN) has been widely adopted due to its electrical robustness, low price and deterministic access delay. However, there are numerous factors that can sabotage the reliability of networks. The fault at intermittent connection (IC) of the network cable is one of the major issues. When multiple IC faults occur in the network, especially on the trunk cable, the troubleshooting for these IC faults becomes very difficult. IC problems may result in delayed or deceptive information of machines and production status which can severely impede manufacturing; normal operation. To improve the network reliability and communication quality, a novel data-driven fault detection methodology is developed in this paper, which can locate multiple IC faults in the network. By analyzing IC induced network errors, the characteristics of error frames can be captured. The information extracted from the error frames is utilized to filter the network error and facilitate a two-level procedure to identify the IC faults. Case studies are performed to demonstrate the proposed method. This research provides a multiple IC faults location method which is accurate and easy to implement.

A modified Auto Associative Kernel Regression method for robust signal reconstruction in Nuclear Power Plant components	Safety and Reliability: Methodology and Applications			English	Proceedings Paper	PROCEEDINGS OF THE EUROPEAN SAFETY AND RELIABILITY CONFERENCE (ESREL)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Wroclaw, POLAND	Wroclaw Univ Technol, Polish Safety & Reliabil Assoc, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			PROCESS FAULT-DETECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; TRANSIENTS; ALGORITHMS	The application of the Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) method to the reconstruction of correlated plant signals is not satisfactory from the point of view of the robustness, i.e. the capability of reconstructing abnormal signals to the values expected in normal conditions. To overtake this limitation, we propose to modify the traditional AAKR method by defining a novel measure of the similarity between the current measurement and the historical patterns. An application of the proposed modified AAKR method to the condition monitoring of a pressurizer of a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) shows benefits with respect to the traditional AAKR method, in terms of earlier detection of abnormal conditions and correct identification of the signals responsible for triggering the detection.

The paper considers two approaches to Preventive Maintenance (PM) interval optimization, shows their advantages and disadvantages, and proposes improvements to both: 1. Traditional approach based on reliability distribution characteristics of the entire population of items (systems), 2. Innovative approach, a Prognostic Health Management (PHM) using the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of each individual item. For the traditional approach, a unique universal algorithm of "random search" is proposed. The main advantage of this algorithm is its versatility. In contrast to the classical optimization algorithms this methodology does not require complex analytical formulas. As a result, one gets an ability to analyze all possible experimental data types: exact failure times, interval data, suspended times, grouped data, etc. Optimal selection of Inspection/Replacement Interval value then can be made using parameters found as a result of data analysis. The optimization is demonstrated for a loss function of a special type of asymmetry of losses due to premature and late replacement, non-linearity of the Target Function, etc. As for an innovative PHM-based approach, an advanced Prognostic Methodology and unique Model have been developed. This Model implements Critical Zone Recognition (instead of classical Regression method) to verify whether Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a particular (individual) item exceeds a predefined critical value. Reaching this critical value serves as a trigger for item's PM performance.

During the last ten years, numerous RUL prediction models have been developed. These methods usually treat completed time-series only, i. e. full statistics before the item fails. Under actual operating conditions occasionally number of failed items is too small, and therefore application of uncompleted (suspended) time-series is necessary, and using Semi-Supervised methods instead of Supervised is required. In this paper, we propose an approach based on regression and classification models we have introduced in the past [1, 2]. These models consider monitoring data (time-series) as inputs and RUL estimation as output. Significant difference of this model is using suspended time-series to estimate optimal RUL for each suspended time-series, so they can be used for initial model training. This article describes the procedures that have been developed and applied successfully for Suspended Time-Series using. Several models based on modification of the SVR and SVC methods (Support Vector Regression and Support Vector Classification) are proposed for consideration. Number of uncompleted time-series used for training and cross-validation is proposed as additional control parameter. Suggested methodology and algorithms were verified on the NASA Aircraft Engine database. Numerical examples based on this database have been also considered. Experimental result shows that the proposed model performs significantly better estimations than pure supervised learning based model.

Fuel cell systems suffer however from insufficient durability and their lifetime may be improved. Prognostics results in the form of Remaining Useful Life are proposed to be used in a Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework to maximize the global useful life of a multi-stack fuel cell system under service constraint. Convex optimization is used to define the contribution of each stack to a global needed power output. A Mirror-Prox for Saddle Points method is proposed to cope with the assignment problem. Resolution method is detailed and promising simulation results are provided.

In our proposed health monitoring framework, the well-known particle filtering method is utilized to estimate the states as well as the health parameters of the system. Simultaneously, the system observations are predicted through an observation forecasting scheme which is developed based on artificial neural networks to construct observation profiles for future time horizons. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to predict the health condition of a gas turbine engine when it is affected by degradation damage.

The principle of this approach is based on the "similarity" between the monitored part, i.e., the sample whose the RUL has to be predicted and degradation reference trajectory patterns (or known library of a priori degradation functions). The challenge addressed in this paper concerns the RUL estimation of a test sample using degradation observations depending on acquisition time and reference dataset information, built on the knowledge of endurance degradation data. The "similarity" coefficient is estimated here using a mapping function between the aperiodic time degradation function and the known test cycle functions. Our approach is evaluated on the very classical Virkler crackgrowth measurements benchmark [14] and the experimental results show that it is efficiency and promising in the context of railways maintenance.

In the context of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM), detection and monitoring of PD are important to ensure the reliability of electrical assets and to avoid catastrophic failures. Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to discover features and patterns that correspond to different types of partial discharges [9], [11]. Recently, PD monitoring systems have being deployed for assessing the health condition of these equipments continuously so that the maintenance would require less human effort and fewer maintenance interruptions to the operation. However, such systems require labeled data to build data models for PD detection and classification. Labeled data is expensive to obtain since it requires domain expert's manual inputs. Minimizing the labeling cost is thus an important issue to solve. To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not been properly addressed in this domain. This paper proposes an active learning (AL) approach for accurate analysis of streaming PD data that aims to train an accurate PD classification model with minimum cost through selecting the most informative instances for the human experts to label. Experimental results show that our method is able to achieve the high classification accuracy of 8 6 : 9 % with only a small labeling budget of 1%.

B	Hou, WK; Yan, JF			IEEE	Hou, Wenkui; Yan, Junfeng			Fault prognostic and prediction based on the importance degree of test point	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intemational Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	JUN 22-25, 2015	Austin, TX			signal flow model; PHM; undetected rate; partial derivatives; false alarm rate; untrusted rate		Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is a technology to monitor the equipment status and predict impending faults. It is used to predict the potential fault and provide fault information and track trends of system degradation by capturing characteristics signals. So how to detect characteristics signals is very important. The select of test point plays a very important role in detecting characteristics signal. Traditionally, we use dependency model to select the test point containing the most detecting information. But, facing the large complicated system, the dependency model is not built so easily sometimes. And the greater trouble is how to calculate the matrix. Rely on this premise, the paper provide a highly effective method to select test point without dependency model. Because Signal flow model is a diagnosis model based on failure mode, which focuses on system's failure mode and the dependency relationship between the test points and faults. In the signal flow model, a fault information can flow from the beginning to the end. According to the signal flow model, we can find out location and structure information of every test point and module. We break the signal flow model up into serial and parallel parts to obtain the final relationship function between the system's testability or prediction metrics and test points. Further, through the partial derivatives operation, we can obtain every test point's importance degree in determining the testability metrics, such as undetected rate, false alarm rate, untrusted rate. This contributes to installing the test point according to the real requirement and also provides a solid foundation for the Progno (1) stics and Health Management. According to the real effect of the practical engineering application, the method is very efficient.

Ltd		Semi-Supervised Fault Diagnostics; Concept Drift; COMPOSE; Bearing	NEURAL-NETWORK; SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; ALPHA-SHAPES; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINERY; ALGORITHM	In this work, we consider the problem of developing a fault diagnostic system for an industrial component operating in an evolving environment characterized by continuous modifications of the working conditions. The main difficult to be addressed in this context is that the labeled data available to train the empirical classification model do not cover all the possible working conditions that will be experienced by the component during its life. We propose a diagnostic model based on the COMPacted Object Sample Extraction (COMPOSE) algorithm, which has been developed in the domain of streaming data learning. The key idea of this algorithm is to learn the concept drift caused by the modification of the working conditions. This is done by i) aggregating the labeled training dataset with unlabeled new data collected in a different working condition, and it) identifying the data drift trend by performing a shrinkage of the aggregated dataset. In the present work, the original COMPOSE algorithm has been modified by introducing an automatic method for dynamically setting the COMPOSE internal parameters, taking into account the characteristics of the new collected data. The overall method has been verified with respect to the Case Western Reserve University Bearing dataset, considering the classification of bearing defects in an evolving environment characterized by modification of the motor load. The obtained performance is satisfactory: bearing defects at different motor loads from that considered for training the diagnostic model are classified with good accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model overtakes that of the original COMPOSE method.

Tracking gearbox degradation is essential to remaining useful life prediction and maintenance decision. Though many degradation features such as root mean square, FM0, and FM4, have been developed, the effectiveness of these features depends on individual components or specific applications. To deploy autonomous fault diagnosis system, new degradation features are often required because a larger number of features facilitate data fusion and generate more accurate degradation paths. This paper proposes to use the parameters of stable distribution to track the degradation of gearbox systems. Two sets of gearbox run-to-failure data, one from laboratory test, and the other from field wind turbine, are used to examine whether the distribution parameters are capable of serving as degradation features. The results show that stable distribution parameters can potentially monitor the degradation trajectory based on their trending profile.

Structural health management is a vital part of IVHM as arguably structures are the biggest and most costly part of the system, thus the failure of the structure could lead to catastrophic results. The failure of a structure is usually caused by cracks or fractures, to identify the cracks and their growth would be desirable for the SHM. While detection of cracks and the prediction of crack growth is a daunting task, demarcation of the crack is essential to prevent failures. This article presents a technique for the prognostic of crack propagation through aluminium by utilising a time delay neural network algorithm. The Virkler dataset has been used and the remaining useful life has been calculated.

A Simulation-based Health Monitoring System Test-bed for an Electrical Power Distribution System	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intemational Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	JUN 22-25, 2015	Austin, TX			Fault diagnosis; Finite state machines; Power system simulation		In this paper, we describe a simulation based health monitoring system test-bed for an electrical power distribution system developed at the Integrated Vehicle Health Management Centre, Cranfield University. The purpose of the test-bed is to provide a technology neutral basis for implementing and evaluation diagnostic systems and software architecture in support the condition based maintenance process. The paper describes real-time system architecture and concept of operations for the electrical power system test-bed. The four main components in the real-time test-bed are the electrical power system simulation model, fault insertion unit, health monitoring data processing and user interface. In this paper, we adopted a component based modelling paradigm for the implementation of the virtual electrical power system. All of the fault injections are currently implemented via software. The fault insertion unit allows for the repeatable injection of faults into the system. The qualitative/discrete model-based diagnostic reasoning approach is applied to the health monitoring process of the test-bed. The finite/discrete nature of the reasoning engine allows efficient and fast execution time in the diagnostic process. The experimental results show the health monitoring system is able to produce real-time performance and correct diagnostic assessments.

Health Index and Behaviour Based Vehicle Level Reasoning System	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intemational Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	JUN 22-25, 2015	Austin, TX			Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM); Vehicle Level Reasoning System (VLRS); Condition Based Maintenance (CBM)		The diagnostics and prognostics are vital parts of the integrated vehicle health management technology. In today's aircraft the diagnostic and prognostic systems play a crucial part in aircraft safety while reducing the operating and maintenance costs. Aircraft are very complex in their design and require consistent monitoring of systems to establish the overall vehicle health status. Many diagnostic systems utilize advanced algorithms (e.g. Bayesian belief networks or neural networks) which usually operate at system or sub-system level. The subsystem reasoners collect the input from components and sensors to process the data and provide the diagnostic/detection results to the flight advisory unit. Generally, a diagnostic system processes the sensor data and provides results; however the behaviors of the machine are not accounted by the diagnostics system. This article provides a novel vehicle level reasoning system, where the health index and system behaviors are also considered with subsystem generated results. Each sub-system's health index is also calculated and passed to the VLRS.	[Khan, Faisal.; Eker, Omer.

This method consists of fault signature extraction, discriminative fault feature selection (not only to improve diagnosis but also to reduce computational overhead), and decision making using a k-nearest neighbor classifier. Although the presented method yields very accurate classification, its computational complexity limits its use in real-time applications. To address that issue, this paper introduces a single instruction, multiple data-based multi-core system including 64 low-cost processing elements to support the high computational fault diagnosis method, where the multi-core system is implemented in a Xilinx Virtex-7 field programmable gate array device, operating at 200 MHz clock frequency. In addition, this study compares the performance of the multi-core system with that of high-performance digital signal processors (DSPs) to demonstrate improvement in execution time and energy efficiency. Experimental results using one-second acoustic emission signals sampled at 1 MHz indicate that the multi-core approach achieves 82.5x and 7.9x speedups over Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320C6748 and TMS320C6671, respectively, when executing the same bearing fault diagnosis algorithm. In addition, the presented multi-core approach reduces 21.5x and 4.2x less energy than TMS320C6748 and TMS320C6671, respectively.

Previous research on the topic focuses on either luminous maintenance or color shift. However, luminous flux degradation usually takes very long time to observe in LEDs under normal operating conditions. In this paper, the impact of a VOC (volatile organic compound) contaminated luminous flux and color stability are examined. As a result, both luminous degradation and color shift had been recorded in a short time. Test samples are white, phosphor-converted, high-power LED packages. Absolute radiant flux is measured with integrating sphere system to calculate the luminous flux. Luminous flux degradation and color shift distance were plotted versus aging time to show the degradation pattern. A prognostic health management (PHM) method based on the state variables and state estimator have been proposed in this paper. In this PHM framework, unscented kalman filter (UKF) was deployed as the carrier of all states. During the estimation process, third order dynamic transfer function was used to implement the PHM framework. Both of the luminous flux and color shift distance have been used as the state variable with the same PHM framework to exam the robustness of the method. Predicted remaining useful life is calculated at every measurement point to compare with the tested remaining useful life. The result shows that state estimator can be used as the method for the PHM of LED degradation with respect to both luminous flux and color shift distance. The prediction of remaining useful life of LED package, made by the states estimator and data driven approach, falls in the acceptable error-bounds (20%) after a short training of the estimator.

Fine pitch BGAs of 0.4mm and 0.5mm pitch are finding applications in military and defense applications. Fine pitch BGA electronics in aerospace applications they may be subjected to high-g levels in the neighborhood of 10,000g of mechanical shock during normal operation. Survivability and design envelope of fine pitch semiconductor packages under high-g mechanical shock is unknown. In addition, the efficacy of the traditional supplemental restraint mechanisms such as underfills in mitigating the risk of interconnect failure under 10,000g mechanical shock, is not available. A circular board with an annular ring typical of projectile applications has been designed with fine pitch daisy chained packages. Packages studied have package interconnects in the range of 84-360 I/O. Two configurations of the test board have been studied including non-underfilled, and underfilled assemblies. Full-field strain on the board assembly has been measured and the strain histories at the corner of the component locations extracted. The change in the resistance of the second-level interconnects has been monitored during the shock event using high speed data acquisition system. Resistance spectroscopy in conjunction with Kalman Filter has been used to identify the onset of failure and prognosticate remaining useful life.

Since most mechanical equipment operates under some sorts of stress or load, it tends to degrade over time, thus possibly resultingin discrete degradation states (damage degrees), ranging from perfect functioning to complete failure. Over recent years, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been applied to model these discrete degradation states for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. However, most of the reported researches on HMMs for multi-state equipment in the literature consider only one degradation mechanism of degradation processes. The present paper proposes a novel model called Multi-Branch HMM (MB-HMM) to deal with deterioration processes modeling under multiple competing modes. To illustrate the proposed approach, a numerical study is given.

When a remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted for a subsystem in a single turbine, a predictive maintenance option is triggered. If predictive maintenance is implemented before the subsystem or turbine fails, the option is exercised; if the predictive maintenance is not implemented and the subsystem or turbine runs to failure, the option expires and the option value is zero. The time-history cost avoidance and cumulative revenue paths are simulated considering the uncertainties in wind and the RUL predictions. By valuating a series of European real options based on all possible predictive maintenance opportunities, the maintenance opportunity with the maximum value can be obtained. In a wind farm, there may be multiple turbines concurrently indicating RULs. To model multiple turbines managed via an outcome-based contract (PPA), the cumulative revenue and cost avoidance for each turbine depends on the operational state of the other turbines in the farm, the amount of energy that has been delivered and will be delivered by the whole farm. A case study is presented that determines the optimum predictive maintenance opportunity for a farm under a PPA, the optimum predictive maintenance opportunity for the same farm managed via an as-delivered contract, and the optimum predictive maintenance opportunities for individual turbines managed independently.

However, traditional PHM technique mainly concentrates on usage information which leads to the shortcomings of prediction modelling problems, especially for high-reliability and long-life products. This paper proposed an experiment-based PHM life cycle framework, aiming to integrate information from the infield development phase to provide usage-oriented life prediction model set. When the on-line monitoring data is available, model set can be updated to acquire accurate prediction results and ensure effectively maintenance activity. In this paper, the life cycle is divided into seven stages and related modelling processes are given with specific case studies.

In this paper, a natural extension of sparse coding, locality-constrained sparse coding, is introduced as a feature extraction technique for machinery fault diagnosis. Then, the vibration signals of rolling element bearings are taken as the target signals to verify the proposed scheme, and locality-constrained sparse coding is used for vibration analysis. With the purpose of diagnosing the different fault conditions of bearings, features are extracted according to the following scheme: basis functions are learned from each class of vibration signals by extracting the time-domain and frequency-domain features. A redundant dictionary is built by merging all the learned basis functions. Based on the redundant dictionary, the diagnostic information becomes explicit in the solved sparse representations of vibration signals. Sparse features are formulated in terms of atom activations. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to test the discriminability of the extracted sparse features. Experiments show that locality-constrained sparse coding is an effective feature extraction technique for machinery fault diagnosis.

The key of a failure prediction is selection of applicable failure symptom characteristic parameter as well as the prediction model. In this paper, failure features of electronic product have been analyzed and three basic performance state change behaviors have been discussed. Furthermore, the method for product states changing behaviors analysis has been suggested. With input data gathered from product constituents (e.g. electronic devices)' faults mode, performance degradation, parameter drift, and so forth, fault injection to product's EDA model to get state change track were conducted. These state changing processes, combining with the failure causes or failure mechanisms, can be classified and used as a guidance to assist in making up failure prediction or failure detection policy.

In order to avoid the unnecessary loss resulting from its sudden failure, it is necessary to timely predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion battery. In this paper, we present a novel remaining useful life estimation method for lithium-ion batteries, which depends on exemplar-based conditional particle filter (EC-PF). Differently from traditional particle filter, in the update phase, exemplar-based conditional particle filter combines historical data of multiple batteries with filtering stage of a single battery to compute the weights with respect to particles. This method can make the weights of particles more accurate, which results in improving the prediction accuracy.

Ltd		lithium-ion battery; remammg useful life; fusion approach; BMA; uncertainty management	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTION; REGRESSION	Lithium-ion battery remammg useful life (RUL) estimation has become a critical issue of intelligent battery management system (BMS). Various models and algorithms have been developed to achieve the RUL prognostics for lithium-ion batteries, to obtain high estimation performance. Generally, a single model usually requires long train time and complex train progress to reach satisfactory precision, while complex data-riven approaches sometimes result in overfitting results. Therefore, many fused and integrated methods have been proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the single method. However, few fusion approaches deal with the uncertainty management or uncertainty integration at present. In order to solve the lack of uncertainty management of existing fusion RUL estimation methods, a fusion model based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) of uncertainty integration for lithium-ion battery RUL estimation is presented in this paper. Firstly, sub-models applying Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) are created. Then, the posterior probability of these sub-models are calculated and integrated to implement the probability fusion of BMA process for RUL prediction. Experimental results with the battery data sets from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) show that compared with a single model, the BMA fusion model achieves higher accuracy and stability. In addition, uncertainty management is taken into consideration, which can be referred as a new research direction for lithium-ion battery RUL estimation.

Ltd		Rolling Bearing; Fault Diagnosis; Fault feature; FCM; FSVM		In rotating machinery equipment, bearing is one of the most common parts. Because of the complex working conditions, the bearing system is subject to get failure. The running state of bearing system, which is normal or not, will directly affect the safety of the production line, or even cause some accidents. Therefore, the technology of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing has important theoretical value and practical significance in production safety. In the light of the vibration data of rolling bearing, including the normal operation of rolling bearing, the single point fault of the inner ring, the single point fault of the outer ring and the single point fault of the ball, those four cases, time, envelope and frequency analysis were performed to extract fault features. Considering the interference of noise and outliers, support vector machine (SVM) theory combined with the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm was used to establish the fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) model. Train the samples, using the founded model of FSVM, and then the test and identification of bearing fault would be obtained.

Ltd		ball bearings; sparse representation; RUL		Prognostics and health management (PHM) play an important role in improving the reliability and safety of systems in industry. A method using sparse representation to solve the PHM questions raised in the IEEE 2012 PHM Data Challenge Competition is presented. It is discovered that the sparse representation score could be a good health indicator of ball bearings compared with traditional acceleration signal or some extracted features like energy, root mean square, maximum peak value and skewness. A group of experimental datasets from seventeen ball bearings are provided by the FEMTO-ST Institute for the competition. The data consists of six groups of bearing acceleration data for algorithm training and another eleven groups of bearing accelerated data for testing. The training data groups are used to build the full score cures model in order to estimate the remaining useful life of the truncated test data groups of the ball bearings. The result is compared with the result using a mixture of traditional features like energy, maximum peak value, root mean square and skewness. Result using the sparse representation method is relatively promising and could well reflect the states of the rotating ball bearings.

In this situation, the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has aroused more and more concerns. Although the life prediction methods are many, there are not a set of systemic of evaluation parameters to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction method. The existing parameters have different limitations. Therefore, due to the shortage of the existing parameters, this paper presents the systemic prediction evaluation parameters to evaluate the prediction ability of the method.

The methodology is based on the exploitation of historical data for knowledge extraction and representation in the form of relevant patterns. Since the technique used is non statistical, none of the usual statistical assumptions, such as the independency of failure modes, are necessary. The idea of the proposed methodology is to merge the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) approach with a set of non-parametric cause-specific survival functions. The former reflects the effect of the condition monitoring data of each failure mode, which is collected from the monitored equipment, on its failure time. The latter provides estimate of the marginal probability of each failure mode in the presence of the other competing failure modes. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is capable of describing accurately the state of each individual equipment based on the collected condition monitoring data, and to use this information in order to provide accurate prognostics.

Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Systems Subject to Multiple Degradation Mechanisms	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	JUN 22-25, 2015	Austin, TX			Battery; Monte Carlo; Multiple degradation mechanisms; Particle filter; Remaining useful life (RUL)	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; PARTICLE FILTER; PROGNOSTICS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CRITERION	Most recent studies on prognostics and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for engineering systems are based on the underlying assumption that there is only one degradation / failure mechanism inherent in the system that is being tracked. This is often an overly simplistic assumption as systems in general are complex enough to be subject to degradation by multiple mechanisms that have different intensities in different individual units being operated. The system degrades under a cumulative effect of these multiple mechanisms and the number of competing mechanisms is many a times unknown as well. In this study, we shall present a particle filter based methodological framework that can be used to track and estimate the RUL distribution of systems with more than one mechanism of degradation / failure. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is effectively used here to determine the number of inherent competing degradation mechanisms and ensure that the data is not over-fitted with many redundant degradation terms. Our methodology is illustrated here with a practical example of resistance degradation in lithium ion batteries.

Hilbert-Huang Transforms for fault detection and degradation assessment in electrical motors	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY: METHODOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	PROCEEDINGS OF THE EUROPEAN SAFETY AND RELIABILITY CONFERENCE (ESREL)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Wroclaw, POLAND	Wroclaw Univ Technol, Polish Safety & Reliabil Assoc, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS	The present work develops a methodology for the analysis of transient signals for fault detection and diagnosis in electrical motors. The objective of this work is the initial development of a Prognostic and Health Monitoring System (PHMS) for the demagnetization of the magnetic field source of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) used in electrical vehicles. The developed methodology is based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), a technique which is particularly suitable for processing oscillating transient signals, such as the stator currents typical of automotive electric traction machines. The HHT represents a time-dependent series in a two-dimensional time-frequency domain by extracting instantaneous frequency components within the signal through an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) process. The developed framework has been applied to four transients simulating different levels of demagnetization of the permanent magnet of the PMSM; the obtained results show that HHT enables us to detect and assess the degradation level for a demagnetized core of a PMSM.

This data provides a unique insight into the biochemical and immunological status of patients at the point of tumour removal along with information about tumour classification and post-operative survival. The relationship between severity of tumour, based on TNM staging, and survival is still unclear for patients with TNM stage 2 and 3 tumours. We ask whether it is possible to predict survival rate more accurately using a selection of machine learning techniques applied to subsets of data to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between a patient's biochemical markers and survival. We use a range of feature selection and single classification techniques to predict the 5 year survival rate of TNM stage 2 and 3 patients which initially produces less than ideal results. The performance of each model individually is then compared with subsets of the data where agreement is reached for multiple models. This novel method of selective ensembling demonstrates that significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved. Finally we point at a possible method to identify whether a patients prognosis can be accurately predicted or not.

Application of standards in reliability prognosis of braking system of moving walks	Safety and Reliability: Methodology and Applications			English	Proceedings Paper	PROCEEDINGS OF THE EUROPEAN SAFETY AND RELIABILITY CONFERENCE (ESREL)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Wroclaw, POLAND	Wroclaw Univ Technol, Polish Safety & Reliabil Assoc, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				The reliability of braking systems in people transportation equipment is very important. There are however only a few researchers that developed a maintenance and inspection method for such systems based on accident analysis. These methods are without correspondence to an appropriate Safety Integrity Level (SIL). The international standards IEC 61508 and ISO 22201-2 have special requirements with respect to a SIL. All systems and subsystems of moving walks should correspond to the required level of SIL. In this paper method of reliability prognosis for braking system of moving walks is presented based on the reliability degradation of system components and the requirements of related standards. This method enables the determination of a regular maintenance schedule. It also enables the development of an intelligent system for preventing failures in braking systems of moving walks. This allows keeping the required safety level from the beginning to the end of its technical lifetime.

The focus of this paper is on lifecycle prognostics for passive components using a Bayesian prognostic algorithm that provides a natural framework for incorporating different sources of variability and uncertainties inherent in the operations of AR. High-temperature creep damage, a prototypic failure mechanism in AR materials, is used as the context for this research. A Bayesian model selection approach is implemented to select the appropriate creep degradation model at any given time, using relevant sensor measurements reflecting the material degradation state. The model selection approach, based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, is integrated with Bayesian particle filter-based prognostic framework. The proposed approach is evaluated using strain measurements obtained from accelerated creep testing of stainless steel specimens. Results indicate feasibility of the proposed approach in accurately identifying the creep degradation stage from the available measurements at a given time.

The final goal is to use the diagnoser technique to diagnose their faults. This method is based firstly on a structural decomposition of the system into logical components and secondly on two abstractions of the system behavior: a logical abstraction of the relations between its inputs and its outputs and a temporal abstraction of its dynamic. The proposed method transforms the behavior of the system, initially modeled as Mealy machine, into a timed automaton that is completed by fault states in order to allow applying diagnoser technique.

This paper proposes a method of estimating the RUL in the presence of operating mode changes of the system by modeling the trend Health Index. The model does not require the knowledge of failure occurrence time and takes into account the current state of the system. Two application scenarios where the run to failure data is available and unavailable are given to show the efficiency of the developed method.

The concept of performance adaptation is implemented through a dynamic engine model that is developed in Matlab/ Simulink environment to diagnose the health of the gas turbine. The proposed method is tested under variable operating conditions at both steady state and transient operational modes for estimating and predicting the compressor degradation. Different types of mathematical representations are used to fit the diagnosis results and consequently prognose the performance behavior of the engine. The results demonstrate the promising prospect of our proposed method for predicting accurately and efficiently the performance of gas turbine compressors as they degrade over time.

On the long-life satellites, momentum wheels are often required working stably and reliably for several years or even ten years. It is necessary to evaluate the remaining life of on-orbit satellite momentum wheel. The failure mechanism of momentum wheel is very complex and it is difficult to predict its long-range performance with trend extrapolation method. Data-driven prognostic is combined with similitude method to predict the remaining life of momentum wheel. The causes of the momentum wheel failure are analyzed to select key parameters to indicate life characteristics of momentum wheel. The lifetime performance data of some other momentum wheels failed are used to train neural network models to describe the degradation process of similar momentum wheels, which is used for predicting momentum wheel on-orbit. In the case study, this method showed a good performance. It is more applicable than trend extrapolation and has much better performance.

However, sometimes in the actual application, there is only one product and it is successively used in different stress conditions, like different tests, different service environment and so on. As the stresses' type and amount are different in these conditions, the product's degradation process is complex and the data size is small in each condition, so it is hard to utilize them for reliability extrapolation with the previously modeling and evaluation method. To solve the problems above, firstly, the general log-linear model is introduced to take into the consideration of the relationship between different stress conditions and their effects on the degradation process, in which the stress variables and various conditions are all described as parameters in an entirety model. Secondly, to understand the relationship and to estimate the reliability accurately, Bayesian approach is introduced to fuse this complex and high dimensional model into the reliability extrapolation and integrate all available information to infer unknown parameters. Then, with the obtained parameters, the accumulated effects from different conditions are quantified, and the reliability of the product can be estimated or predicted. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by one example and relevant simulation analysis.

Specifically, the design of residual generation is then formulated as to solve a convex optimization problem by combining ideas from the over-parameterization and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs), and thus provides residual signals directly from process data. To solve the multiply-outputs (MOs) problem, a modified approach is proposed by means of the socalled mixed block Hankel matrices. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a parity space are established and proved. A benchmark example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Most prognostics algorithms attempt to provide a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) value for lower level components. Since the RUL prediction would allow for a replacement component to be requisitioned prior to a failure, it is anticipated the operational availability will be increased due to the reduction in system downtime attributed to logistics delay. For systems where logistics time is the major contributor to downtime, prognostics may yield large gains in operational availability. This paper provides an analysis of a hypothetical system that implements a prognostics algorithm and examines the system-level gains for different RUL prediction values. The analysis uses the BlockSim and a Monte Carlo-based simulation tool that is able to take multiple redundancies into account when calculating metrics. Finally, two metrics are proposed to help quantify the benefit of prognostics: Relative Downtime Reduction and Relative Availability Gain.

To facilitate the implementation of corrosion prognostics and health management, in paper presents a finite element approach for the simulation of stable pit growth with stress loads through a multi-physics field coupling technique. A potential drop (IR)-controlled corrosion is assumed to governing the pit evolution, whereas the potential distribution in electrolyte is solved by Laplace equation with a time-dependent solution. As the metal equilibrium potential varies with loads, a time-discrete stationary mechanical analysis was coupled with the corrosion modeling for stress distribution computing and updating. A case study of pitting corrosion growth with stress loads was used to demonstrate the proposed approach, in which the stress effects for pit depth, width and stress concentration factor were discussed.

The Dual-level approach is based on the Verhulst model, the logarithmic model and the PF. The first level prediction produces a rough capacity prediction and then the second level prediction improves the accuracy of the first prediction result. The logarithmic model has the ability to describe the accelerated degradation process more accurate. Due to it is sensitive to its parameters, in this article the result of the first prediction result based on the Verhulst model is used to initialize the parameters of the logarithmic model. The PF is used in both levels to update the state based on each model. Four case studies are conducted to validate the Dual-level approach. The experimental result shows that the Dual-level approach has efficiently improve the performance of the estimating RUL and the capacity fade trend of the lithium-ion battery compared with the prognosis method based on PF and the Verhulst model.

The FW-PHM Suite is a set of web-based diagnostic and prognostic tools and databases that serves as an integrated health monitoring architecture. The FW-PHM Suite has four main modules: (1) Diagnostic Advisor, (2) Asset Fault Signature Database, (3) Remaining Useful Life Advisor, and (4) Remaining Useful Life Database. This paper focuses on development of asset fault signatures to assess the health status of generator step-up generators and emergency diesel generators in nuclear power plants. Asset fault signatures describe distinctive features based on technical examinations that can be used to detect a specific fault type. At the most basic level, fault signatures are comprised of an asset type, a fault type, and a set of one or more fault features (symptoms) that are indicative of the specified fault. The Asset Fault Signature Database is populated with asset fault signatures via a content development exercise that is based on the results of intensive technical research and on the knowledge and experience of technical experts. The developed fault signatures capture this knowledge and implement it in a standardized approach, thereby streamlining the diagnostic and prognostic process. This will support the automation of proactive online monitoring techniques in nuclear power plants to diagnose incipient faults, perform proactive maintenance, and estimate the remaining useful life of assets.

It provides an insight into the problematic of using housekeeping information for prognosis and health monitoring. This challenge is particularly relevant in the spatial domain as it relates to operations, service removal with de-orbiting with respect to the LOS (Law on Space Operations) or the kick-off of new programs. In addition to the decision-making aspect, it relates to the diagnosis (identification of the state of the system) and prognosis (future degradation assessment and residual lifetime).

The algorithm utilizes the asset's state history to learn a prognostic model from data. The prognostic model comprises an ensemble of Auto-Regressive (AR) models, together with a state-of-the-art classifier. The AR part of the algorithm is used to predict the system's state evolution. The classifier discriminates between healthy and faulty operation, given the asset's current state. The predicted state, as computed by the AR model, is fed to the classifier. The first time when the predicted state is classified as faulty is returned as the RUL of the system. The resulting prognostic algorithm was tested on the CMAPSS dataset as provided from NASA Ames Research Center. Cases of unknown future input trajectory as well as cases with multiple faults have been investigated.

A prognostic algorithm based on probabilistic graphical models for a periodically observable system	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE HORIZON			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Delft Univ Technol, Dutch Soc Risk Management & Reliabil Anal, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				In most industrial fields, the optimization of maintenance policies has become a key issue. To address this problem, predictive maintenance seems to be one of the most effective known approaches. It consists of driving the maintenance process anticipating the evolution of the system state. A prediction process, called "prognostic" could also be introduced and it lays on the online estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) have been proved as relevant to perform reliability analysis as they can easily represent complex systems behaviors. Based on this formalism, Graphical Duration Models (GDM) were developed by R. Donat (2009) to set all kind of sojourn time distributions for each state of the system. Unlike to some Markovian modelling that imposes exponential behavior, this approach could better model the exact degradation dynamic of real industrial systems (F. V. Jensen 2007) (J. Pearl 1985). In our study, where time and states spaces are discretized, a single component degradation whom process is assumed to be monotone increasing, is considered. The real state of the system is unknown but periodically observed by monitoring devices, characterized by their good detections rates, false alarms rates and non detection rates (summarized in a confusion matrix as a conditional probability table of the considered DBN). This paper introduces an online RUL estimation algorithm based on the use of graphical duration models. The objective is both to evaluate the RUL and to adjust it, in real time, when a new observation is available. Then, the algorithm is applied to a testcase to evaluate the quality of the RUL estimations. This paper will also provide comparative results in respect of the considered degradation model (Markovian approach vs GDM). Finally, these RUL computations, and the associated estimations of the future system behavior, might be subsequently used to optimize the maintenance strategy and the diagnosis schedule.

These rules can be used to further understand degradation phenomena and also provide transparency and trust for any underlying prognostic technique employed. A case study is presented on a wind turbine gearbox, utilising historical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data in conjunction with a physics of failure model. Training is performed without failure data, with the technique accurately identifying gearbox degradation and providing prognostic signatures up to 5 months before catastrophic failure occurred. A robust derivation of the Mahalanobis distance is employed to perform outlier analysis in the bivariate domain, enabling the rapid labelling of historical SCADA data on independent wind turbines. Following this, the RIPPER rule learner was utilised to extract transparent, human-readable rules from the labelled data. A mean classification accuracy of 95.98% of the autonomously derived condition was achieved on three independent test sets, with a mean kappa statistic of 93.96% reported. In total, 12 rules were extracted, with an independent domain expert providing critical analysis, two thirds of the rules were deemed to be intuitive in modelling fundamental degradation behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox.

A robust derivative of the Mahalanobis distance is employed to accurately and precisely encapsulate varying fault behaviours, which can then be exploited for the purposes of fault detection and identification. Domain knowledge in the form of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) can be incorporated into the model, to determine potential failure modes. Seeded fault data was employed to derive the shape and location estimates to enable the use of a multivariate distance function. To reduce the computational complexity whilst simultaneously increasing sensitivity to the faults, the high frequency (48KHz) accelerometer data was pre-processed into a 4-tuple consisting of the Skewness, Kurtosis, Root mean square (RMS) and Shannon Entropy. This 4-tuple is shown to encapsulate and discriminate all fault modes identified through the FMEA, whilst reducing the data to 1Hz, allowing for the both exact, and meta-heuristic algorithms to be employed for robust analysis. Sensitivity to minimal fault development is demonstrated, with the technique accurately identifying 0.007 '' diameter inner race, outer race and roller element faults which had been seeded to the bearing through electro-discharge machining. To demonstrate the practicalities of the approach, the trained system is employed for analysis of an independent dataset, collected under different conditions. The technique is shown to accurately detect and identify the relevant fault mode pre-emptively, before catastrophic failure occurred, with 28.6% of bearing life remaining.

A Hybrid Optimization Technique for Fault Classification in Power Transformer Using Dissolved Gas Analysis	ADVANCEMENTS IN AUTOMATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Automation and Control (ICAAC)	APR 11-12, 2014	Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Transformer Fault Analysis; Improved Particle Swarm Optimization; Hybrid Optimization; Dissolved Gas Analysis; Support Vector Machine	DIAGNOSIS; BOOTSTRAP; NETWORKS	To allow utilities to fulfill self-imposed and regulative performance targets the demand for new optimized tools and techniques to Estimate the performance of modern Transformers has increased. The modern power transformers has subjected to different types of faults, which affect the continuity of power supply which in turn causes serious economic losses. To avoid the interruption of power supply, various fault diagnosis approaches are adopted to detect faults in the power transformer and has to eliminate the impacts of the faults at the initial stage. Among the fault diagnosis methods, the hybrid technique of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm is simple conceptually derived and its implementation process is faster with better scaling properties for complex problems with non linearity and load variations but performance factor related to accuracy has a declined value in case of correlations implicit. In order to obtain better fault diagnosis to improve the service of the power transformer, SVM is optimized with Improved PSO technique to achieve high interpretation accuracy for Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) of power transformer through the extracting positive features from both the techniques. Primary SVM is applied to establish classification features for faults in the transformer through DGA. The features are applied as input data to Autonomous optimized Technique for faults analysis. The proposed methodology obtains the DGA data set from diagnostic gas in oil of 500 KV main transformers of Pingguo Substation in South China Electric Power Company. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB software with an Intel core 3 processor with speed of 3 GHZ and 4 GB RAM PC. The result obtained by Autonomous optimized Technique (IPSO-SVM) is compared against PSO-SVM to estimate theperformance of the classifiers in terms of execution time and quality of classification for precision. The test results indicate that the Autonomous optimization of IPSO-SVM approach has significantly improved the classification accuracy and computational time for power transformer fault classification.

Especially, PF can provide uncertainty representation and management on estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of components and systems. However, particle degeneracy phenomenon limits its performance and application in most of the situations. Therefore, several re-sampling algorithms are proposed to alleviate this problem. Thus, different re-sampling algorithms should be focused and studied for the adaptability and applicability in RUL estimation. This work aims to compare the capabilities of different re-sampling algorithms and evaluate the performance in lithium-ion battery RUL prediction. Four re-sampling algorithms including multinomial re-sampling, residual re-sampling stratified re-sampling and systematic re-sampling are involved and analyzed. Actual battery test data sets from NASA PCoE are used to conduct experiments for evaluation and comparison. Moreover, some quantitative analysis metrics are applied to compare the results of battery RUL estimation.

Currently, routine maintenance at water treatment works are informed by an assessment of component condition based on time-based inspections. We propose a method for using performance data gathered by the utility for legislative purposes to inform maintenance decision-making. This model framework is grounded in the theory and methods of stochastic processes and elicitation of expert judgment, but aligned with the practicalities of the industrial decision-making context. After describing the asset to be modelled, the data available and the principles of the Hidden Markov Model developed, we illustrate an application to three water treatment works. The credibility of the modelling assumptions to accommodate the limitations of the real data are discussed.

Though a lot of work is currently being conducted to develop PHM systems for fuel cells, various challenges have been encountered including the self-healing effect after characterization as well as accelerated degradation due to dynamic loading, all which make RUL predictions a difficult task. In this study, a prognostic approach based on adaptive particle filter algorithm is proposed. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the introduction of a self-healing factor after each characterization and the adaption of the degradation model parameters to fit to the changing degradation trend. An ensemble of five different state models based on weighted mean is then developed. The results show that the method is effective in estimating the remaining useful life of PEM fuel cells, with majority of the predictions falling within 5% error. The method was employed in the IEEE 2014 PHM Data Challenge and led to our team emerging the winner of the RUL category of the challenge.

Thus arise the need for proper online tool condition monitoring methods, in order to minimize error and waste of work-material. In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Bayes classifier are used to develop such a system for automatic drilling operations with the help of vibration signals. The performances of models generated by these classifiers are compared with each other in order to establish the best method. As the vibration signals were acquired under different drilling parameters, this study also tries to understand the events in drilling process that help in ease of fault classification. Three different kinds of wears were studied and later compared to understand the degree or magnitude of effect of wears on the drilling process and signals.

With the time the cutting tool wear out and affects the surface quality. Hence it is very important to monitor the condition of the cutting tool to avoid the production of substandard parts. In this work the face milling cutter is made to interact with hardened steel components to manufacture the required surfaces with a specified amount of stock removal. The cutting conditions are selected and machining is done till the tool reaches its critical flank wear value. The captured surface images are analyzed using the statistical and spectral texture analysis methods. The flank wear of the cutting insert is measured at frequent intervals. The evaluated texture features are correlated with the flank wear using the multivariate correlation methods. The significant features are selected based on the correlation value and its mutual correlation value with other features. The selected texture features are plotted against machining time or the number of components. The developed regression model based on the selected parameters and the time is used to predict the flank wear.	[Kumar, K.

The increase in the gold price has motivated the industry search for alternative to the gold wire used in wire bonding and the transition to copper wire bonding technology. Potential advantages of transition to Cu-Al wire bond system includes low cost of copper wire, lower thermal resistivity, lower electrical resistivity, higher deformation strength, damage during ultrasonic squeeze, and stability compared to gold wire. However, the transition to the copper wire brings along some trade-offs including poor corrosion resistance, narrow process window, higher hardness, and potential for cratering. Formation of excessive Cu-Al intermetallics may increase electrical resistance and reduce the mechanical bonding strength. Current state-of-art for studying the Cu-Al system focuses on accumulation of statistically significant number of failures under accelerated testing. In this paper, a new approach has been developed to identify the occurrence of impending apparently-random defect fall-outs and pre-mature failures observed in the Cu-Al wirebond system. The use of intermetallic thickness, composition and corrosion as a leading indicator of failure for assessment of remaining useful life for Cu-al wirebond interconnects has been studied under exposure to high temperature and temperature-humidity. Damage in wire bonds has been studied using x-ray Micro-CT. Microstructure evolution was studied under isothermal aging conditions of 150 degrees C, 175 degrees C, and 200 degrees C till failure. Activation energy was calculated using growth rate of intermetallic at different temperatures. Effect of temperature and humidity on Cu-Al wirebond system was studied using Parr Bomb technique at different elevated temperature and humidity conditions (110 degrees C/100% RH, 120 degrees C/100% RH, 130 degrees C/100% RH) and failure mechanism was developed. The present methodology uses evolution of the IMC thickness, composition in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to identify accrued damage in wire bond subjected to thermal aging. The proposed method can be used for quick assessment of Cu-Al parts to ensure manufactured part consistency through sampling.

Second, another objective function is added to the sparse coding framework, the discrimination power of the Fisher discriminative methods with the reconstruction property, and the sparsity of the sparse representation that can deal with the fault signal which is corrupted. Finally, the feature is extracted. In rolling bearing fault classification experiments, the new method improves the accuracy of classification.

Cost of the machines and machine downtime effects like production loss, maintenance expenses and reduction in overall plant productivity are the areas of concern for modern manufacturing plants. Researchers are developing newer models and algorithms to overcome new issues and challenges in the machine health monitoring using various tools and techniques for both online and off-line machine conditions. The present paper proposes an off-line knowledge based application for machine health monitoring using MATLAB. The application has modules for intelligently addressing the machinery troubleshooting problems based on vibration standard; ISO 10816. The proposed application has three modules: machinery vibration troubleshooting, vibration severity criterion and induction motor troubleshooting. The application is simple to use and modify in which, the machine faults can be detected and analyzed quickly. This will reduce the machine down-time, maintenance costs, etc., and increase the plant productivity.

In this study, the efficiency of two data-driven techniques, Moving Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) and Robust Regression Analysis (RRA), are investigated for fault detection in mechanical components of a movable bridge. These two algorithms are improved and modified in order to be effective for long term monitoring of mechanical components. Another unique aspect of this study is that some of the critical and common damages are induced on machinery components in real life and the data are collected under both baseline and damage conditions. The simulated damage scenarios include extracting oil from gearbox as well as removing bolts from rack and pinion. The damage detectability of MPCA and RRA are tested with the data from a real-life structure. As a result, the outcomes of this study revealed that the modified MPCA and modified RRA algorithms are both effective for fault detection and diagnosis of changes in mechanical components of the movable bridge.

Progress Towards Prognostic Health Management of Passive Components in Advanced Small Modular Reactors	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Annual International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 22-25, 2014	Spokane, WA	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE		Small Modular Reactors; passive components; prognostics; particle filter; thermal creep	BARKHAUSEN NOISE; DAMAGE; FATIGUE; WAVES; POWER; NDE	Sustainable nuclear power to promote energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are two key national energy priorities. The development of deployable small modular reactors (SMRs) is expected to support these objectives by developing technologies that improve the reliability, sustain safety, and improve affordability of new reactors. Advanced SMRs (AdvSMRs) refer to a specific class of SMRs and are based on modularization of advanced reactor concepts. Prognostic health management (PHM) systems can benefit both the safety and economics of deploying AdvSMRs and can play an essential role in managing the inspection and maintenance of passive components in AdvSMR systems. This paper describes progress on development of an experimental setup for testing and validation of PHM systems for AdvSMR passive components. The experimental set-up for validation of prognostic algorithms is focused on thermal creep degradation as the prototypic degradation mechanism. The test bed enables accelerated thermal creep aging of materials relevant to AdvSMRs along with multiple nondestructive evaluation (NDE) measurements for assessment of thermal creep damage. NDE techniques include eddy current, magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN), and linear and non-linear ultrasonic measurements. Details of the test-bed design as well as initial measurements results for specimens at different levels of thermal creep damage are presented.	[Meyer, R. M.; Ramuhalli, P.; Hirt, E. H.; Pardini, A.

One of the main tasks of the Prognostics and Health Management is the Failure Prognostics, specifically to provide predictive information regarding Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of device using prognostic systems. But sometimes it is necessary to get inflexible answer for closed type question: Is current device within critical zone or not? In other words, is RUL of device less than pre-defined Critical Value or not? To solve this problem, two approaches may be considered: Regression Approach: to predict RUL value and compare results with critical value Classification Approach: to recognize directly entering the critical zone In general, Classification Approach is more preferred for recognition tasks, but some aspects of the approach prevent to get an evident answer. Two models, based on modifications of the SVM method- SVC (Support Vector Classification) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) are proposed for consideration. Suggested methodology and algorithms were verified on the NASA Aircraft Engine database (http: //ti. arc. nas a. govitech/dashipcoe/prognostic-datarepository/). Numerical examples, based on this database, have been also considered.

Operating condition is used to describe the state or environment of a system. This approach is suit for the dataset that contains sensor measurements and operational settings. Predicting RUL contains two stages: modeling stage using the training dataset and predicting stage using the result of modeling and testing dataset. This approach can increase available information in modeling stage and simulate the actual work situation of the test unit in the predicting stage. The performance of this approach was tested by the dataset from 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition where sensor measurements and operational settings were provided. The task of the competition was to estimate the RUL of an unspecified system. The results showed that this prognostic method could get accurate predictions in most situations and had a good rank in all competition results.

The theories and the results of PHM technology are still in the baby stage, and the engineering applications of PHM technology need to be verified and validated, which requires a large number of simulations and tests to make it matures. An important factor restricting the development of PHM technology is the lack of system failure data. This paper presents an identically distributed resampling technology based on a small number of failure data. Namely on the basis of failure mode database, combining with statistical principles, the approach uses sampling method such as the bootstrap to achieve the RUL(Remaining Useful Life) data simulation with identically distribution for higher-quality data. The experiment with PHM08 data shows that this method can more accurately estimate the life of the engine unit. Finally the development process of a resampling module based on a small number of failure data is introduced.

However, most of the prognostic methods of power converters are focus on the critical components of the converters. Furthermore, the methods seldom consider the effect of changes in operating conditions (e.g. power supply and load). In order to address these problems, an innovative system-level fault characteristic parameter (FCP) represents the degradation status of the entire converter is extracted, and a prognostic method of DC-DC converters based on the degradation trend prediction of the FCP is proposed. Firstly, the effect of component-level degradation on the overall performance of the DC-DC converters is studied. Then, a performance parameter of DC-DC converters which is sensitive to the degradation of all critical components is chosen, and a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model is used to convert the performance parameter to the FCP under predetermined normal condition to eliminate the influence of changes in operating conditions. Finally, the trend prediction of the FCP is performed based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to realize the prognosis of DC-DC converters. A Boost converter is taken as an illustrative example. Results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

The accurate temperature rise in the GaAs pHEMT's 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel under self-heating effect is analyzed by multi-scale multiple heat-sources thermal analysis. And the change of the model's physical parameters dependent on temperature is discussed. Then the degradation of pHEMT's DC characteristic at different gate voltage is predicted by analyzing the change of the electrical parameters dependent on temperature. By this way, the effective fault injection for the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system of active phased array radar can be achieved.

Piezoelectric film AE sensor has a potential to monitor the growth of fatigue crack, which can be used for fatigue remaining useful life prognosis. Piezoelectric film AE sensor using flexible piezoelectric paint conforms well to curved surface because of its flexibility - making it very promising for use on tubular steel structures, for which conventional sensors are ill equipped to do. This study explores the use of piezoelectric paint film AE sensor for continuous monitoring of fatigue crack growth in welded tubular joints.

Despite the progress made in the literature, challenges remain in how to assess performance related information for maintenance decision-making from large data streams. Furthermore, since roller bearings operate under various regimes (e. g., speed and load), it is not trivial to consider the effect of regime changes in the modeling in order to reduce false alarms. The paper describes a multi-model approach to monitor the condition of roller bearings under different operating regimes. Two modeling approaches for anomaly and degradation monitoring are proposed to automatically retrieve information from the data. A self-organizing map (SOM) and a support vector machines (SVM) are used comparatively for the evaluation of a bearing degradation in time (i.e., a dynamic health indicator) and for the determination of changes in the tracked features. The proposed method is validated using data from multiple bearings of the same type.

In this paper, we use the Bayesian network (BN) classifiers and data mining technology to diagnose different kinds of rotor faults in machinery fault simulator (MFS) under varied loads. First of all, three kinds of popular BN classifiers are introduced as the diagnosis model for rotor fault, and the fault diagnosis modeling methods based on BN classifiers is established by data mining. Then, a MFS is introduced and applied to generate the vibration data of system with different rotor faults under varied loads, as dataset 1, dataset 2 and dataset 3. At last, the dataset 1 generated by MFS is used to demonstrate the rotor fault diagnosis process with BN classifiers. The same procedures are also implemented for dataset 2 and dataset 3 to show the difference of diagnosis results under varied loads.

In system prognostics, fault degradation models are necessarily established to describe the fault evolution dynamics and used to extrapolate the future health conditions. However, it is very challenging to build an accurate fault degradation model considering the complex fault growth dynamics and numerous modeling uncertainties, such as unit to unit variation. Particularly, in data driven modeling methods, the variations of loading conditions, environments and usage patterns will influence greatly the fault modeling accuracy. Some research has been conducted to tackle this problem by utilizing real-time monitoring data to update the fault model in terms of model parameters and even model structures to accommodate these varying factors. But whenever new data are available, it becomes difficult to determine how to retain the prior learned model while also learning new fault degradation dynamics. That is, how to learn new knowledge without forgetting what was learned previously. In this paper, we develop a new model update and fusion method for prognostics by using incremental learning. A case study is given to validate the developed approach via the battery degradation data.

These systems require new paradigms to assure availability and quality of service. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in assuring Availability and Quality of Service in a Cloud Based Application System. We propose machine learning techniques for monitoring systems logs to assess the health of the system. A web services data set is employed to show that variety of services can be clustered to different service classes using a k-means clustering scheme. Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) logs and Job logs dataset from high performance computing system is employed to show that impending fatal errors in the system can be predicted from the logs using an SVM classifier. These approaches illustrate the feasibility of methods to monitor the systems health and performance of compute resources and hence can be used to manage these systems for high availability and quality of service for critical tasks such as health care monitoring in the cloud.

The computational algorithms are based on models that combine the methods of the theory of dynamical systems, the theory of stochastic processes, statistical physics and field theory. The organization of algorithms in the hierarchical structure based on the principles of degeneration of failure signs helped identify more early signs of failure. This, in turn, allows to calculate effective Predictive maintenance strategies. The first experimental results of the cluster operation are shown. In particular, it is show that the hierarchical approach to the RUL prognosis has the structure of one-dimensional graph. The experiment confirmed the need to integrate remote computing cluster with peripheral recognizing automata in a united network for effective organization of automata operation and their retraining.

It is based on the complementarity between a model-based approach accounting for uncertainties aimed at quantifying the degradation modes signatures and a data-driven approach aimed at recalibrating the healthy syndrome from measures. Because of the computational time costs of uncertainties propagation into the physics based model, a surrogate modeling technic called Kriging associated to Latin hypercube sampling is utilized. The hybrid approach is tested on a pumping unit of an aircraft engine and shows good results for computing the degradation modes signatures and performing their detection and identification.

Although many attempts to predict time to failure have been reported in the literature, there are still challenges related to data availability and methodology. In addition, there is significant variation from case to case due to complexity of system usage and failure modes. This paper reveals various aspects related to such challenges experienced while applying a novel predictive technology to a spindle test-bed. The goal was to evaluate the ability of the technology to predict the remaining useful life of a bearing with seeded faults. Testing has been conducted to reveal the effectiveness of signal processing, health modeling and prediction techniques. While conducting the evaluation tests, besides some well-known bearing failure modes, an unusual case was recorded. This atypical bearing failure mode created a new challenge for the predictive technology being investigated, which prompted the development of an advanced feature discovering methodology using genetic programming. This new methodology and the technology evaluation results obtained for both the well-known and the atypical failure modes will be discussed in the paper. In addition, the paper will describe the test-bed and instrumentation approach, the data acquisition system and the experimental design for testing and validation of the technology.

This paper focuses on developing a condition-based replacement policy using online inspection data, which is one of the main problems in prognostic and health management of mechanical devices. This problem is addressed for a type of mechanical device with a multistate degradation process. In addition, one of the practical challenges in failure data analysis using inspection data called interval censoring is addressed. A control-limit policy is presented through a cost-based optimization model, which can be used to determine when to replace a degraded device. The application of the proposed model is demonstrated using a case study on a bearing shell's wear process.

This paper presents the application of PHM methods as a proactive and predictive means to enable new warranty approaches. Warranty service is typically performed after the occurrence of failure. However, with the implementation of the predictive and proactive warranty strategies enabled by PHM, companies can make decisions for warranty returns up front.

Perfect maintenance actions restore completely the system to the 'as good as new' state. Their related cost are however often high. Imperfect preventive maintenance restores partially the system with reduced maintenance cost. Nevertheless, the restoration quality may depend not only on the allocated maintenance cost, the system age but also on the total number of imperfect maintenance actions executed since the last replacement time of the system. The first objective of the paper is to model imperfect maintenance actions. The second objective is to propose an adaptive maintenance policy which can help to select optimally maintenance actions (perfect or imperfect actions), if needed, at each inspection time using the remaining useful life (RUL) prognosis. To illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed maintenance policy, different sensitivity studies are analyzed and discussed through a numerical example.

The developed methodology enables inference with limited number of monitoring points optimally placed to obtain information on functional states of components, subsystems, and relevant physical parameters affecting the reliability of elements of the system. The approach integrates physics of failure modes when available with traditional reliability data (e. g., failures and demands) and is (1) capable of assessing current state of a system's health and probabilistic assessment of the remaining life of the system (prognosis), and (2) through appropriate data processing and interpretation can point to elements of the system that have caused or are likely to result in system failure or degradation (diagnosis). Continuous health assessment is made possible through the application of dynamic BBNs. The proposed methodology is designed to answer important questions such as how to infer the health of a system based on limited number of monitoring points at certain subsystems ("upward" inference); how to infer the health of a subsystem or component based on knowledge of the health of the main system ("downward" inference); and how to infer the health of a subsystem based on knowledge of the health of other subsystems ("distributed" inference). The methodology and algorithms are demonstrated through an example.

However, AE sensors have not yet been applied widely in real applications. Firstly, in comparison with other sensors such as vibration, AE sensors require much higher sampling rate. The characteristic frequency of AE signals generally falls into the range of 100 kHz to several MHz, which requires a sampling system with at least 5MHz sampling rate. Secondly, the storage and computational burden for large volume of AE data is tremendous. Thirdly, AE signal generally contains certain non-stationary behaviors which make traditional frequency analysis ineffective. In this paper, a frequency reduction technique and a modified time synchronous average (TSA) based signal processing method are proposed to identify gear fault using AE signals. Heterodyne technique commonly used in communication is employed to preprocess the AE signals before sampling. By heterodyning, the AE signal frequency is down shifted from several hundred kHz to below 50 kHz. Then a low sampling rate comparable to that of vibration sensors could be applied to sample the AE signals. After that, a modified tachometer less TSA method is adopted to further analyze the AE signal feature. Instead of performing TSA on the raw signals, the time synchronous averaging of the first order harmonic signal is obtained and analyzed. With the presented method, no tachometer or real time phase reference signal is required. The TSA reference signal is directly obtained from AE signals. By examining the smoothness of obtained wave form, a noticeable discontinuity or irregularity could be easily observed for gear fault diagnosis. AE data collected from seeded fault tests on a gearbox are used to validate the proposed method. The analysis results of the tests have shown that the proposed method could reliably and accurately detect the tooth fault.

However, its application not only spans these macro systems, but can also be effectively applied to nano-systems, as we illustrate in this work. Though initial studies have been carried out to apply PHM to high power field effect transistors [3], an in-depth investigation into its potential for nano-reliability studies is still lacking. This serves as a motivation for us to present a holistic study on the time-dependent dynamic degradation and failure prediction of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) using random telegraph noise (RTN) fluctuations that can be measured when the device leakage current is sensed with a nominal voltage during the operation of the transistor / circuit. We will first present the algorithm used to track the degradation of the transistor and highlight the use of RTN signals and their analysis in the time and frequency domains. This will be followed by an experimental case study on a very small area transistor, illustrating how the RTN signals can be used to diagnose the degradation of the device. Finally, we conclude with potential suggestions for further research into this topic in the near future.

This framework consists of a Fourier-Bessel (FB) expansion for analyzing the transient signals, a generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) for feature reduction, and a relevance vector machine (RVM) for fault classification. The start-up transient current signals are acquired from different motor operating conditions and decomposed into single components using FB expansion. Subsequently, a number of statistical features in the time domain and the frequency domain are computed for each component to represent the motor conditions. The high dimensionality of the feature set is reduced by implementing GDA. Finally, the diagnosis performance is carried out by RVM, which is an intelligent method in pattern recognition area. The framework has been applied for traction motor faults including bowed rotor, broken rotor bar, eccentricity, faulty bearing, mass unbalance, and phase unbalance in general applications. The results show that the proposed diagnosis framework is capable of improving the classification accuracy significantly in comparison other methods.

In these applications, incorporating prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques provide systems with capabilities to self assess performance, determine the advent of failure and mitigate system risks. However, the prognostics problem for electronic systems is still approached from a component-centric-view. Extending a component-centric approach to an electronic system becomes complex and is often not worth the cost of pursuit due to the imbalance between scalability and efficiency of the prognostics approach. In order to address this problem, we propose a circuit-centric approach as an alternative method for realizing prognostics at an electronic system-level. The proposed approach is developed from the idea of decomposing a system into multiple critical circuits, and exploiting the parameters specific to the system's circuitries for predicting failure. Furthermore, a method is developed for detecting the gradual degradation of an electronic system by defining a health indicator to represent the system's health state at any given time. In this paper, we provide a formulation of the electronic system-level prognostics problem and demonstrate the approach on an electronic system for filtering analog signals.

Sparse autoencoders have the ability to learn good features from the input data in an unsuperivised fashion. Sparse auto-encoders and other deep architectures are already showing very good results in text classification, speaker and speech recognition and face recognition as well. In this paper, we compare the performance of sparse autoencoders with soft max regression, fast classifier based on Mahalanobis distance and SVM in fault diagnosis of air compressors.

The time series is divided in different candidate scenarios according to modifications on exogenous variables that represent external environmental conditions. Each valid scenario is associated with a specific progression model built based on ARIMA time series analysis approach. The forecast model is determined by merging the current scenario progression model with the progression model associated with most similar past scenario. The feasibility and effectiveness of the approach proposed is demonstrated through the prediction of the degradation characteristics provided by DC machine benchmark fault simulator.

A prognostic circuit for hot carrier injection (HCI) failure of integrated circuit was proposed in the paper, and it was simulated on the base of the SMIC 0.18 um mixed-signal CMOS process model. The prognostic circuit consists of stress voltage generation module, HCI failure detecting module, two-stage comparator, offset voltage cancellation module, non-overlapping clock generation module, and output module. When the increase amount of threshold voltage for the MOSFET exceeds a preset value due to hot carrier injection, the output of the prognostic circuit designed to fail faster will jump from low voltage to high voltage. It indicates the impending failure of hosted circuit because of that the prognostic circuit experiences the same manufacturing process and operational environment as the hosted circuit. The research results are useful for the prediction of HCI degradation and failure of integrated circuit.

In this paper, we consider systems subject to competing failures, and determine the remaining useful life distribution at the end of monitoring time. Soft failures consider both the degradation and damage from a shock process to the system, whereas, the hard failures are based on shock process. Both failures are connected by the ratio constant between damages and loads. The particle filter is applied for the statement estimation and online prediction of remaining useful life based on degradation and shock failure risks in the framework of prognostics and health management (PHM).

The diagnosis of hydraulic pump is very crucial for reliability. This paper studies on a Chaotic Parallel Support Vector Machine (CPSVM) and employs it for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pump. The CPSVM combines the chaos theory and a number of SVMs connected in parallel. Phase-space reconstruction of chaos theory is utilized to determine the dimension of input vectors for each SVM. Each SVM has an output. A weighted sum of each output is considered as the output of the CPSVM. To diagnose faults of hydraulic pump, a residual error generator is designed based on the CPSVM. This residual error generator is firstly trained using data from normal state. Then, it can be used for fault clustering by analysis of the residual error. Its performance and effectiveness has also been validated via a plunger pump test-bed.

The optimization of Morlet wave shape factor was controlled by the minimum Shannon entropy. The information entropy derived from wavelet transform coefficients of multiple sources vibration data was used to reflect the different frequency range-based energy distribution variance of shock feature.

Thus, the network actively participates in creating a smart environment. Distributed Sensor Networks promise to revolutionize sensing in a wide range of application domains. This is because of their reliability, accuracy, flexibility, cost effectiveness and ease of deployment of nodes in topology of DSN. Smart sensors can offer vigilant surveillance and can detect and collect data concerning any sign of machines failure, earthquakes, floods and even a terrorist attack energy efficiency, topology control and fault-tolerance are the most important issues in the development of next-generation DSN. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to deliver a desired level of functionality in presence of faults in the topology. Topology control as a low level service governs communication among all nodes and is hence the primary target for increasing connectivity and saving energy. In this work, we have proposed two models for fault detection and fault recovery to achieve fault tolerance in topology. The proposed fault detection model is used to detect faults at node level (checking node's energy) and network level faults (link failure and packet error). The proposed fault recovery model is used to achieve fault tolerance by adjusting the topology of the randomly deployed sensor nodes. Finally, we have evaluated the performance parameters for the proposed scheme.

The aim is to detect additive faults, i.e., faults in the actuators and sensors. The inconsistency between the actual behavior of the process and the expected behavior of the model is represented by means of residuals. For the isolation of faults, a limit checking criterion based on the energy content of a residual is employed. Furthermore, the load torque acting as an external disturbance is estimated by using a reduced-order observer. A simulation analysis shows the effectiveness of the parity space approach for the detection and the isolation of additive faults in a hybrid synchronous machine.

Results on thermal overstress and electrical overstress experiments are presented. In addition, preliminary results toward the development of physics-based degradation models are presented focusing on the electrolyte evaporation failure mechanism. An empirical degradation model based on percentage capacitance loss under electrical overstress is presented and used in: (i) a Bayesian-based implementation of model-based prognostics using a discrete Kalman filter for health state estimation, and (ii) a dynamic system representation of the degradation model for forecasting and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. A leave-one-out validation methodology is used to assess the validity of the methodology under the small sample size constrain. The results observed on the RUL estimation are consistent through the validation tests comparing relative accuracy and prediction error. It has been observed that the inaccuracy of the model to represent the change in degradation behavior observed at the end of the test data is consistent throughout the validation tests, indicating the need of a more detailed degradation model or the use of an algorithm that could estimate model parameters on-line. Based on the observed degradation process under different stress intensity with rest periods, the need for more sophisticated degradation models is further supported. The current degradation model does not represent the capacitance recovery over rest periods following an accelerated aging stress period.

The methodology utilizes thermal and power cycling to accelerate the life of the devices. The major failure mechanism for the stress conditions is die-attachment degradation, typical for discrete devices with lead-free solder die attachment. It has been determined that die-attach degradation results in an increase in ON-state resistance due to its dependence on junction temperature. Increasing resistance, thus, can be used as a precursor of failure for the die-attach failure mechanism under thermal stress. A feature based on normalized ON-resistance is computed from in-situ measurements of the electro-thermal response. An Extended Kalman filter is used as a model-based prognostics techniques based on the Bayesian tracking framework. The proposed prognostics technique reports on preliminary work that serves as a case study on the prediction of remaining life of power MOSFETs and builds upon the work presented in [1]. The algorithm considered in this study had been used as prognostics algorithm in different applications and is regarded as suitable candidate for component level prognostics. This work attempts to further the validation of such algorithm by presenting it with real degradation data including measurements from real sensors, which include all the complications (noise, bias, etc.) that are regularly not captured on simulated degradation data. The algorithm is developed and tested on the accelerated aging test timescale. In real world operation, the timescale of the degradation process and therefore the RUL predictions will be considerable larger. It is hypothesized that even though the timescale will be larger, it remains constant through the degradation process and the algorithm and model would still apply under the slower degradation process. By using accelerated aging data with actual device measurements and real sensors (no simulated behavior), we are attempting to assess how such algorithm behaves under realistic conditions.

Improvements in database's technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is knowledge discovery, i.e. patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. The knowledge that becomes available through data mining enables an asset owner to make important decisions about life cycle costs in advance. In maintenance field, CMMS (Computer maintenance management system) and CM (Condition Monitoring) are the most popular software available in the industries. Since first one stores all historical data, maintenance actions, events and manufacturer recommendations, second one collects and stores all critical physical parameters (vibration, temperature..) to be monitored in a regular time basis. However, converting these data into useful information is a challenge. The degradation process of a system may be affected by many unknown factors, such as unidentified fault modes, unmeasured operational conditions, engineering variance, environmental conditions, etc. These unknown factors not only complicate the degradation behaviors of the system, but also make it difficult to collect quality data. Due to lack of knowledge and incomplete measurements, certain important context information (e. g. fault modes, operational conditions) of the collected data will be missing. Therefore, historical data of the system with a large variety of degradation patterns will be mixed together. With such data, learning a global model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction becomes extremely hard since the end user does not have enough and good-quality data to model properly the system. This has led us to look for advanced RUL prediction techniques beyond the traditional RUL prediction models. The degradation process for many engineering systems, especially mechanical systems, is irreversible unless the condition is recovered by effective maintenance actions. The irreversible degradation process does not necessarily imply that the observed features will exhibit a monotonic progression pattern during degradation. Such progression pattern is sometimes hard to model using parametric methods. Considering a degradation process involving no or limited maintenance, the process may compose of a sequence of irreversible stages (either discrete or continuous) from new to be worn out, which can be implicitly expressed by the trajectory of the measured condition data or features. Therefore, the RUL of the system can be estimated if its future degradation trend can be projected from those historical instances. In this paper, a novel RUL prediction method inspired by feature maps and SVM classifiers is proposed. The historical instances of a system with life-time condition data are used to create a classification by SVM hyper planes. For a test instance of the same system, whose RUL is going to be estimated, degradation speed is evaluated by computing the minimal distance defined based on the degradation trajectories, i.e. the approach of the system to the hyper plane that segregates good and bad condition data at a different time horizon. Therefore, the final RUL of a specific component can be estimated, and global RUL information can then be obtained by aggregating the multiple RUL estimations using a density estimation method. Proposed model develops an effective RUL prediction method that addresses multiple challenges in complex system prognostics, where many parameters are unknown. Similarities between degradation trajectories can be checked in order to enrich existing methodologies in prognostic's applications. Existing CM data for bearings will be used to verify the model.

Fault detection through physical modelling in an axial flow compressor of a combined-cycle power plant	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			QUANTITATIVE MODEL; INTELLIGENT SYSTEM	The methods that are most frequently used in fault detection are able to detect that some abnormal behaviour of a system is occurring, but are unable to explain directly its causes. The main goal of the new method proposed in this paper is to achieve the capability to explain incipient fault, detected using a physical interpretation. To this end a detailed physical model of an axial flow compressor has been developed using empirical off-design correlations and turbo machine fundamentals to determine flow conditions at the mid-span of each blade. Then the methodology has been applied using real faulty behaviour data from the compressor of a combined-cycle plant. An incipient fault could be detected using the method over a non-measurable variable of the system, the enthalpy at the outlet of first rotor cascade. These results suggest the possible improvements that the application of this methodology could bring.	[Garcia-Matos, J. A.; Sanz-Bobi, M.

Prognosis applied to an electromechanical system: A nonlinear approach based on sliding mode observer	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			DAMAGE	This paper is dedicated to model-based prognosis. More precisely, in this paper, a methodology is proposed to predict remaining useful life of a system. This methodology is applied on multiple time scale systems made up of a slow and a fast dynamic behaviors subsystems, defining damage state and state of system behaviors respectively. Here, slow dynamic subsystem behavior is supposed to be unknown, only the structure is assumed to be known a priori. Remaining useful life estimate implies to identify parameters of the structure of the slow dynamic behavior subsystem model. For that, in the fast dynamic behavior subsystem, unmeasured state are estimated based on the design of unknown input observers. Slow dynamic behavior state in the fast dynamic behavior subsystem is led back to an unknown input. Sliding mode observer is used to estimate state and unknown input. With these estimates and the dynamic unknown input estimate, the slow dynamic behavior model parameters are then identified. Finally, remaining useful life prediction is achieved. Pertinence of the proposed methodology is illustrated based on simulation results to an electromechanical oscillator.

An adaptive band pass filtering technique has been used to detect faulty pulses present in the signal emanating from a gearbox. A pulse position analysis method is used to calculate rotational speed of faulty components in the gearbox. Faulty pulse shape is further analyzed visually to estimate fault severity. Visual inspection of the gearbox is also performed to verify the results obtained through proposed methods. The proposed method is a useful input to manage maintenance personnel in an effective way and reduce maintenance costs.

Sensor Driven Prognosis Scheme Based on Extreme Value Theory	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano			PERFORMANCE PREDICTION; GENERAL-APPROACH; STEEL BRIDGES; INSPECTIONS; DAMAGE; TAIL	In this paper, an extreme value theory (EVT) based structural health prognosis scheme is presented to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of monitored structure by utilizing abundant sensor data acquired from online monitoring system. For the proposed prognosis scheme, hundreds of sensor data records are acquired within a short time period at each degradation stage. Moment Estimator from EVT is introduced to fuse the RUL information obtained from sensor data. Only a small portion of the total measurements are needed for quantile and end point estimation of the RUL. As a prerequisite, the monotonicity relation between measurements and estimated RUL are required. An example of fatigue prognosis is presented in the paper to demonstrate the proposed prognosis scheme. The results show that EVT based prognosis scheme can be more computationally efficient in performing prognosis compared to full sensor data based prognosis without loss of much accuracy.

Probabilistic prognosis of a system: Application to a pneumatic valve	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF				We propose here a global methodology for the probabilistic prognosis of a complex system. First, the prognosis problem is translated in mathematical terms: it consists in computing the distribution of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system conditionally to available online information. Considering online information allows to provide a specific prognosis for each system according to its life. Second, a global methodology is proposed when the state of the system and its degradations are modelled using a Markov process. This method is basically a two-steps technique. One one hand, it requires the computation of the conditional law of the system regarding the available observations. One the other hand, it involves the computation of the reliability of the system. Third, some reliability computation techniques are proposed when the Markov process is a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). The method is illustrated on an aeronautic example: a pneumatic valve within the BLEED air system, used to provide regulated air (pressure, temperature) in the cabin.

An adaptive learning system is employed to determine the duration of a future task based on similar prior tasks. Durations of some maintenance tasks are calculated using statistical regression where nature and specification of the task are well defined. However, for other tasks where the durations are dependent upon the condition of several other parts and subsystems, they are derived through machine learning methodologies like Neural Network and Bayesian rule. Moreover, the duration of the tasks is further refined by Prognostics Health Management assessment that predicts impending failure based on near real time condition of vehicles and its subsystems. Determining the task durations dynamically based on prior knowledge or from prognostic data will make the schedule efficient, saving money and resources required for maintenance.

Currently, the requirements of Environmental Testing and Reliability Testing can't be met that simulating environment accurately due to lacking of simulation methods and experimental equipments on non-stationary random vibration. Under the circumstances, some primary research was made in this paper on simulating cyclostationary random vibration environment which is a kind of non-stationary stochastic processes: firstly, the characteristics of Cyclic Mean and the periodic properties of Linear Periodic Time-Varying system were discussed; secondly, a Linear Periodic Time-Varying system was established to generate cyclostationary random signals with specified statistical parameters, whose structure was built based on trigonometric function and whose coefficients were determined by Least Mean Square algorithm; finally, the signals were loaded to electro-dynamic shaker and simulated cyclostationary random vibration environment successfully. This method was verified by numerical simulation and practical experiments, which could be applied in fault diagnosis and reliability assessment etc.	[Mao, C.; Jiang, Y.; Tao, J.; Chen, X.] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron Engn & Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China				MAO, Chao/0000-0002-6343-9075	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [50905181]	This research was supported by Project 50905181 from National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Fault Diagnosis for Multi-State Equipment with Multiple Failure Modes	2012 PROCEEDINGS - ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM (RAMS)			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)	JAN 23-26, 2012	Reno, NV	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEST, IIE, SAE, Soc Reliabil Engineers (SRE), SSS, AIAA, ASQ, Elect & Commun Div, ASQ, Reliabil Div		multi-state deterioration; multiple failure modes; fault diagnosis; condition monitoring		Multi-state systems have received considerable attention recently with regards to reliability and maintenance. Since most mechanical equipment operates under some sort of stress or load, it tends to deteriorate or degrade over time, thus possibly resulting in discrete degradation states (damage degrees), ranging from perfect functioning to complete failure. This multi-state deterioration is the motivation for using condition monitoring tools for the purpose of modeling, diagnosis, prognosis, and condition-based maintenance. Most mechanical equipment is subject to multiple independent failure modes and degradation processes. Rather than independently diagnosing and prognosing the health condition of the equipment for a single failure mode, it is important to investigate how multi-dimensional condition monitoring information can be used for recognition purposes of the state of the health of equipment with multiple independent failure modes. This paper focuses on a non-repairable piece of equipment with multiple independent failure modes, in which the state of the equipment for each single failure mode is not directly observable and only incomplete information is available through condition monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to develop a method to obtain an observation probability matrix which can be used as the main tool for damage degree classification of each failure mode. An observation probability matrix represents the statistical relationship between the actual health state (damage degree and failure mode) of the equipment and the condition monitoring information. This observation probability matrix is an input for such methods, as hidden Markov models, hidden Semi-Markov models, and Naive Bayes classifiers. We modify the Naive Bayes classifier to use this observation probability matrix for classification. The result of this paper is applied for damage degree classification of a planetary gearbox, which is subject to multiple failure modes.

They are used to start the aircraft propulsion engines and to provide power during electrical emergencies. As is the case with most aircraft components, batteries exhibit aging and health degradation during operation. Therefore, the correctly estimation of the battery state-of-health (SoH) and of the remaining useful life (RUL) is important to aircraft operators. Failure to do so can result in underutilization of the equipment (if it is removed before the end of its life cycle) or unpredicted failure events during operation (when the battery SoH is overestimated). The consequences can range from increased operation costs to reduced flight safety. This article first presents the life cycle of lithium-ion aeronautical batteries. Then a method is proposed to generate discharge, capacity and health monitoring models during the battery life cycle. It is shown how these models are used to estimate the battery SoH and RUL. The method is validated using data from the NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository. The models are implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and used to simulate a typical battery in different operational conditions.

An embedded supervision system is in charge of monitoring the helicopter and detecting problems which require maintenance actions. A data processing system integrating a prognostic function receives information from the supervision system and suggests component replacements before they fail and cause a system failure. In this paper we propose a hybrid component-oriented model for a heterogeneous physical system. The model describes the evolution of the health condition of the system over time from the available knowledge on behaviour and degradation of components. A generic adaptive prognostic function is developed and provides a common support for the maintenance decision of a heterogeneous multi-component system. It computes faults probabilities of components by using the parametrized Weibull model and updates these probabilities according to new data like on-line diagnostic result or new measurements. For illustration, the prognostic function is then applied on an example of a helicopter subsystem.

Since the primary goal of PHM systems is to estimate the health state of components and equipments, as well as forecasting their Remaining Useful Life (RUL), they are often closely associated with the reduction in the number of unscheduled maintenance tasks. Indeed, the avoidance of unscheduled maintenance is a very important factor, but this technology may potentially lead to considerable further savings in other fields. Scheduled maintenance planning, improved troubleshooting, inventory management optimization and intelligent aircraft allocation to routes are other examples of how the operators can benefit from PHM techniques. These benefits may lead to important competitive advantages such as reduction in operational cost and increase in fleet reliability. The purpose of this work is to enumerate and explore qualitatively some of these benefits in terms of the mentioned competitive advantages to aircraft operators. Although PHM systems can offer benefits to other members of the aeronautical sector such as aircraft manufacturers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), this work will focus on the aircraft operator's point of view.

Probabilistic performance assessment of concrete structures subjected to corrosion process	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano			REINFORCEMENT CORROSION; RELIABILITY	In general, all structures are subjected to deterioration due to environmental and traffic actions over their life time. Maintaining an adequate safety level over their entire service life is thus not only an expensive task, but also filled with some level of uncertainty. Degradation in itself is not easily quantifiable because numerous aspects reduce the load bearing capacity of a structure. Furthermore, the development of actions over the multi-decade life time as well as the effects of preventive maintenance and rehabilitation measures is difficult to predict. For concrete bridges (chloride induced) reinforcement corrosion is in many cases the governing deterioration process, especially in regions where winter salt is commonly applied for traffic safety. This paper introduces a feasible approach to analyse the effects of chloride induced deterioration on the safety level, which is validated by the application to a real highway bridge. A probabilistic prognosis of the corrosion processes during the planned service life of the structure accounts for uncertainties in the experimental investigations, material properties and actions and provides the inputs for a long term performance assessment. In particular, comprehensive probabilistic analyses reveal the time dependent reliability levels with respect to code based serviceability and ultimate limit states.

LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken. During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,, etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge. In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.

Structural health monitoring-based finite element model of Stonecutters Bridge	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano				The recently built Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong is a cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1018 m, the second-longest cable-stayed span in the world. As the bridge is located in a highly urbanized area, its serviceability and safety in long service life becomes a public concern. Therefore, a comprehensive structural health monitoring system (SHMS) has been installed on Stonecutters Bridge by Highways Department of Hong Kong S. A. R., and the sensory system is composed of totally 1,571 sensors in 15 different types, namely, anemometers, barometers, rainfall gauges, temperature sensors, hygrometers, corrosion cells, accelerometers, dynamic strain gauges, static strain gauges, global positioning systems, tiltmeters, dynamics weigh-in-motion stations, video cameras, articulation sensors and tensio-magnetic gauges. The SHMS provides very useful information for safety evaluation and regular maintenance of the bridge under in-service condition. After the instrumentation of SHMS in the bridge, Hong Kong' s Highways Department has carried out a serious of in-situ measurement, including the measurement of as-built profiles, modal frequencies, cable forces, etc. In particular, the displacement and strain influence lines were obtained by sensors at multiple locations during the road testing. It is noteworthy that the number of sensors is still very limited for such a large-scale structural system, and the locations of structural defects or degradation may not be directly monitored by sensors. In view of this fact, an accurate finite element model (FEM) that relates the bridge performance and condition to the measurement at limited locations becomes an essential tool for the effective health diagnosis and prognosis of the bridge. This paper presented the development of the SHM-oriented FEM for Stonecutters Bridge, including the modeling, updating and validation of the FEM. All the superstructures, substructures, connections and boundary conditions of the bridge were properly modeled in 3D frame FEM. The model updating was carried out according to in-situ measured results (e. g. the deck profile, cable forces and modal frequencies). A good agreement between the computed results and in-situ measurement validates that the established FEM can well serve as a basis for bridge rating system and performance prediction. Furthermore, the static influence lines due to moving highway vehicles were analyzed using the 3D FEM, and the critical locations or members were identified through the deflection influence lines. It should be noted that the 3D global FEM presented in this paper is only the first stage in the development of health prognosis tool for Stonecutters Bridge. A more sophisticated model, 3D multi-scale FEM of Stonecutters Bridge, is being developed currently.	[Zhu, S.; Xu, Y.

The standards developed by this subcommittee provide equipment customers with a known basis for the quality of the data they are receiving [Improving Used Oil Analysis Standards: Recent Efforts of ASTM D02 Subcommittee CS96, Bryan Johnson, Practicing Oil Analysis, July Aug 2006, pp 38-41]. However, test measurements have little meaning in a condition-monitoring program if they cannot be associated with a failure mechanism of the oil or the machine. Maximum reliability of in-service machine components and fluids requires that the condition-monitoring program provide timely indications of machinery and oil performance and remaining usable life. In order to address these critical aspects of condition monitoring, D02.96.4, Guidelines, initiated two task forces to develop Standard Guidelines to address Alarm Limits and Trends. Reliable alarm limits for fluid and equipment characteristics are required in order to properly interpret raw lubricant test data. However, these level alarms only state how much damage has occurred. In order to generate meaningful diagnostic and prognostic information on equipment and fluid condition, the rate of change must be trended. The predictive or forecasting nature of condition monitoring is based on trending, which determines the remaining useful life of the component and fluid. This paper presents an overview of practical alarm limit calculations using statistical analysis of equipment and fluid condition data and trend analysis of condition data in the dynamic equipment-operating environment. Various trending techniques and formulas will be presented with their associated benefits and limitations. These limit and trend calculations may be applied to all techniques that provide numerical test results and for all types of equipment (diesel, pumps, gas turbines, industrial turbines, hydraulics, etc.) whether large fleets or individual industrial machines.

In this paper, bearing prognostic has been studied in viewpoint offal lure degradation as an object of prediction. This study proposes the application of relevance vector machine (RVM), logistic regression (LR) and ARMA/GARCH in order to assess the failure degradation of run-to-failure bearing simulated data. Failure degradation is calculated using L R and then regarded as target vectors of failure probability for RVM training. ARMA/GARCH based on multi-step-ahead prediction is employed for censored data. Furthermore, RVM is selected as intelligent system then trained by using run-to-failure bearing data and target vectors of failure probability estimated by LR. After training process, RVM is employed to predict failure probability of individual unit of bearing sample. T he result shows the novelty of the proposed method which can be considered as machine degradation prognostic model.

The Gaussian functions are optimized to get the optimal parameters to show the characteristic frequencies of the Hilbert transform-based envelope of the vibration signals. The simulated signal and experimental signal are used to test the method.

At present, more than one half of the total energy consumption of data centers is for the power and cooling infrastructure. One way to save energy is an approach called "free air cooling," where ambient air is used to cool the equipment, thereby reducing the energy consumed in cooling and conditioning the air. Free air cooling is being adopted for data centers that are already in operation where the equipment used are unlikely to have been designed or qualified for free cooling regime. Traditional reliability evaluations depend on industry standards that assume pre-defined environmental conditions and generally perform set of environmental tests that relate to those conditions. Equipment level risk identification and mitigation methods are not practical to apply for the data center as a system. This paper provides an overview of the associated challenges posed by such an operating environment. This paper discusses the reason why traditional reliability methods cannot be used to assess the risks of free air cooling of data centers. Finally, as an alternative approach, prognostics and health management technique that can provide the users of data centers with the ability to identify impacts of free air cooling, estimate remaining useful life of the equipment, and help identify impending intermittent service interruptions and degradations is described.

The core idea of the proposed framework is not only utilize historical fault data of equipment operation and major repair, but also select appropriate dynamic condition monitoring signal. The feature evaluation is introduced to analyze the dynamic signals. The degradation index with accurate definition and apparent trend variation is extracted, and introduced to proportional hazards model, which effectively capture the effects of the covariates. Covariates could be dependent or independent of time and any quantity or combination of quantities that describe a system's condition can be included in reliability models. Maximum likelihood is chosen to estimate the reliability parameters in proportional hazards model. This method permits in-situ assessment of machine reliability, and the evaluation can really reflect the trend of fault occurrence and development. It is suitable for realizing individual equipment reliability assessment and prognosis based on operational condition feature and performance degradation signal. A practice example of rolling bearing test device is given to provide operational data, and the reliability size and changing trend are analyzed in detail under different operational conditions and damaged severity.

This paper presents a novel pattern classification approach for the fault diagnostics, which combines the morphological multi-scale analysis and the "one to others" support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Morphological pattern spectrum describes the shape characteristics of the inspected signal based on the morphological opening operation with multi-scale structuring elements. The pattern spectrum entropy and the barycenter scale location of the spectrum curve are extracted as the feature vectors presenting different faults of the bearings. The "one to others" SVM algorithm is adopted to distinguish six kinds of fault bearing signals which were measured in the experimental test rig running under eight different working conditions. The recognition results of the SVM are ideal even though the training sample is few. The combination of the morphological pattern spectrum parameter analysis and the "one to others" multi-class SVM algorithm is suitable for the on-line automated fault diagnosis of the rolling element bearings. This application is promising and worth well exploiting.

The product performance degradation data are treated as a time series data and stochastic process are utilized to describe the degradation process for predicting long-term trend. A degradation test is processed for miniature bulbs until they failed and the degradation data are collected for prognostics. Degradation path of a miniature bulb is predicted using time series analysis based on short time period degradation data and long time period degradation data respectively. A comparison between the predicted de gradation path and the real degradation path of the miniature bulb is processed and the results show that the degradation path prediction of the product using time series analysis is effective.

While the conservation work being carried out is "state of the art", there is no evidence at present of the effectiveness of the conservation work 50 plus years ahead. A Prognosties Framework is being developed to monitor the "health" of the ship's iron structures to help ensure a 50 year life once conservation is completed with only minor deterioration taking place over time. This paper presents the prognostics framework being developed which encompasses four approaches: Canary and Parrot devices, Physics-of-Failure (PoF) models, Precursor Monitoring and Data Trend Analysis and Bayesian Networks. "Canary" and "Parrot" devices have been designed to mimic the actual mechanisms that would lead to failure of the iron structures with canary devices failing faster to act as an indicator of forthcoming failures while parrot devices fail at the same rate as the structure under consideration. A PoF model based on decrease of corrosion rate over time is used to predict the remaining life of an iron structure. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) is used as a precursor monitoring technique to obtain a single comparison metric from multiple sensor data to represent anomalies detected in the system. Bayesian Network models integrating remaining life predictions from PoF models with information of possible anomalies from MD analysis are used to obtain more accurate predictions of remaining life. This paper describes why and how the four approaches are used for diagnostic and prognostics purposes and how they are integrated into the prognostics framework.

Maintenance is an appropriate measure to ensure machinery normal condition. So performance degradation assessment is very important for maintenance decision-making. There are two very interesting aspects when degradation assessment is performed. One is to detect early fault of machinery as early as possible. Another is to estimate remaining useful life (RUL) once early fault of machinery is detected. In this paper, wavelet lifting scheme (WLS) and hidden Markov model (HMM) are used to describe cur rent condition of gearbox and detect early gearbox faults with a dynamic threshold. After that, another model based on final failure data is pro posed to predict how much time is left before a failure occurs given the current machine condition. At last, the proposed method is validated by a set of whole life gearbox data.

With the development of sensor technology and signal processing methods, in order to precisely detect and identify faults, fault diagnosis is a typical multi-sensor fusion problem. New challenges have arisen with regard to obtaining a reliable fault diagnostic result based on multi-source information. From the viewpoint of evidence theory, information obtained from each sensor can be considered as a piece of evidence, and as such, multi-sensor based machines diagnosis can be viewed as a problem of evidence fusion. In this paper we investigate the use of Dempster-Shafer(D-S) evidence theory as a tool for modeling and fusing multi-source information from the machines. We present a preliminary review of evidence theory and explain how the multi-sensor machine diagnosis problem can be framed in the context of this theory. We propose a method for enhancing the effectiveness of basic probability assignment functions in modeling and the method combining pieces of evidence. By introducing importance index, the issues of evidence importance in the practical application of D-S evidence theory are addressed. Finally, we report a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

Based on the APSO-LSSVM fault prognostic algorithm, fuzzy reasoning algorithm and expert knowledge database, a PHM (prognostic and health management) system is established for the AEW Radar. The experiment shows that, because of using the APSO algorithm to adjust the parameters of LSSVM model, the APSO-LSSVM algorithm has a better fault prognostic ability; because of integrating the APSO-LSSVM algorithm with the fuzzy reasoning expert knowledge database, the PHM system not only can enhance the ability of health condition monitoring, but also can improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and maintenance for the AEW Radar. So, this PHM system can play a very important role in the AEW Radar's logistic support.

A set of augmented Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARRs), termed AARRs, is proposed to extend the capability of ARRs to identify degradation of components which are not represented by physical parameters. The methods utilize the unified constraint relations, named global AARRs (GAARRs), for health monitoring of hybrid systems. The mode information is provided by a mode tracker, which is based on Mode-change Signature Matrix (MChSM) and is only triggered when inconsistency between monitored system and its nominal model is detected. Once a fault is detected, a hypothesis set is generated and a multiple hybrid differential evolution algorithm is adopted to identify the degradation dynamics and the unknown mode changes. The optimization problem is efficiently solved by a hybrid differential evolution algorithm, which is able to simultaneously handle real and binary unknown parameters. Simulation results are reported to validate the proposed method.

However, it call be difficult to define and implement an adequate and efficient prognostic tool that includes the inherent uncertainty of the prognostic process. Within this frame, neuro-fuzzy systems are well suited for practical problems where it is easier to gather data (online) than to formalize the behavior of the system being studied. In this context, and according to real implementation restrictions, the paper deals with the definition of an evolutionary fuzzy prognostic system for which any assumption on its structure is necessary. The proposed approach outperform classical models and is well fitted to perform a priori reliability analysis and thereby optimize maintenance policies. An illustration of its performances is given by making a comparative study with an other neuro-fuzzy system that emerges from literature.

This fact easies fault detection, with the subsequent prevention of dramatic malfunction. In this paper the rotor of a container gantry crane is monitored to get the kurtosis of its normal operation. Then, two types of rolling bearings faults are modeled, according to the design of the rotors crane. These signals are added to the real normal operation recordings, and processed under an estimator of the SK. The experience allows the conformation of a higher-order statistical fault-pattern data base, without the need of stopping huge machinery, and with the subsequent saving, settling the basis of an automatic surveillance system.

Such prediction on the time of loss of functionality is typically done on the basis of measurements of parameters representative of the SSC condition state and degradation process. Uncertainties from two different sources affect the prediction: randomness due to inherent variability in the SSC degradation behavior (aleatory uncertainty) and imprecision due to incomplete knowledge and information on the SSC stress and strength characteristics (epistemic uncertainty). Such uncertainties must be adequately represented and propagated in order for the prognostic results to have operative significance, e.g. in terms of maintenance and renovation decisions. This work illustrates an hybrid Monte Carlo and possibilistic method for the representation and propagation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, with reference to a case study of a component which is randomly degrading in time according to a stochastic fatigue crack growth model of literature. The crack depth is assumed as representative parameter of the component condition state and its limit value beyond which failure occurs is assumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainty, as represented by a possibility distribution.

Proactive Management of Materials Degradation for Nuclear Power Plant Systems	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		materials damage prognostics; materials degradation; NPP license renewal; proactive management	PROGNOSTICS; NDT	There are approximately 440 operating reactors in the global nuclear power plant (NPP) fleet that have an average age greater than 20 years and design lives of 30 or 40 years. The United States is currently implementing license extensions of 20 years on many plants, and consideration is now being given to the concept of "life-beyond-60," a further period of license extension from 60 to 80 years and potentially longer. In almost all countries with NPPs, authorities are looking at some form of license renewal program. There is a growing urgency as a number of plants face either approvals for license renewal or shut down, which will require deployment of new power plants. In support of NPP license renewal over the past decade, various national and international programs have been initiated. This paper reports part of the work performed in support of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Proactive Management of Materials Degradation (PMMD) program. The paper concisely explains the basic principles of PMMD and its relationship to advanced diagnostics and prognostics and provides an assessment of some the technical gaps in PMMD and prognostics that need to be addressed.

During its service life a structure degrades due to deterioration and wearing down. These processes should be estimated in advance for the purpose of a provident life cycle management. With respect to the deterioration processes of reinforced concrete structures several mechanisms of concrete attack and reinforcing steel corrosion, repairing measures such as coatings included, have to be regarded. In the contribution the state and potentials of different forecasting models are presented with respect to the application in life cycle management systems. Such models can either be based on process oriented transport/reaction formulations or on constitutive engineering models, both being able to take reliability into account if the scatterings of the variables are known. As a deterioration model Markov chains can be used to predict the change of a structure or component. In any case the prognosis can be updated considerably by monitoring data.

The most basic methods model the component or system reliability using failure time data and conventional models such as the Weibull. When information pertaining to the operating condition and environmental stressors are available, stress-based techniques can be used. The third type of prognostics is termed effects-based. It is truly an individual based prognostics because it uses information as to how the individual component is affected by the usage condition. This paper presents a summary of the three prognostic types and describes the ongoing development of a MATLAB-based set of tools to facilitate prognostic model development. The application of models of each type is illustrated with the PHM Challenge data set. The paper shows the advantages of identifying a degradation parameter to provide for the use of effects-based prognostics.	[Coble, B.; Hines, J.

Early Detection of Interconnect Degradation Using RF Impedance and SPRT	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Impedance; Interconnection; Prognostics; Reliability; SPRT; Time domain analysis		Many types of electronic products are now operating at higher frequencies or digital bit rates. At high frequencies, signal propagation is concentrated at the surface of interconnects, a phenomenon known as the skin effect. Degradation of interconnects, such as cracking of the solder joints due to fatigue or shock loading, also usually initiates at the surface and propagates inward. Therefore, even a small crack at the surface of an interconnect may change RF impedance and adversely affect the performance of high speed electronic circuits. Traditional methods used to monitor interconnect reliability are based on a measurement of DC resistance. But, more accurate and sensitive alternatives are required for monitoring the reliability of current and future electronic products. RF impedance analysis offers an improved means of sensing interconnect degradation. This study demonstrates the value of RF impedance measurements as an early indicator of physical degradation of solder joints compared to DC resistance measurements. Mechanical fatigue tests have been conducted with an impedance-controlled circuit board on which a surface mount component was soldered. Simultaneous measurements were performed of DC resistance and the time domain reflection coefficient as a measure of RF impedance while the solder joints were stressed. During the test, the RF impedance provided detectable failure precursors by the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), while the DC resistance remained constant with no precursors. Failure analysis revealed that the change in RF impedance resulted from a physical crack that initiated at the surface of the solder joint and propagated only part of the way across the solder joint. These test results indicate that the combination of RF impedance and the SPRT can serve as a non-destructive early indicator of solder joint degradation.

Traditional health monitoring methodologies have relied on reactive methods of failure detection often providing little or no insight into the remaining useful life of the system. In this paper, a mathematical approach for interrogation of system state under cyclic thermo-mechanical stresses has been developed for 6-different leadfree solder alloy systems. Data has been collected for leading indicators of failure for alloy systems including, Sn3Ag0.5Cu, Sn3Ag0.7Cu, Sn1Ag0.5Cu, Sn0.3Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi, Sn0.2Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi0.1Ni, 96.5Sn3.5Ag second-level interconnects under the application of cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. Methodology presented resides in the pre-failure space of the system in which no macro-indicators such as cracks or delamination exist. Systems subjected to thermo-mechanical damage have been interrogated for system state and the computed damage state correlated with known imposed damage. The approach involves the use of condition monitoring devices which can be interrogated for damage proxies at finite time-intervals. Interrogation techniques are based on derivation of damage proxies, and system prior damage based non-linear least-squares methods including the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The system's residual life is computed based on residual-life computation algorithms.

This paper addresses this problem by integrating several machine learning algorithms. The approach proposed relies on a classification system to determine the likelihood of component failures and to provide rough indications of remaining life. It then introduces clustering and SVM-based local regression to refine the time to failure estimations provided by the classification system. The paper illustrates the applicability of the proposed approach through a real world aerospace application and discusses data pre-processing requirements. The preliminary results show that the proposed method can reduce uncertainty in time to failure estimates, which in turn helps augment the usefulness of prognostics.

Maxima-SPRT Methodology for Health Monitoring of Contact Resistance in IC Sockets	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Accelerated test; contact resistance; elastomer socket; health monitoring; physics of failure	RELIABILITY	The evaluation of integrated circuit sockets for quality, reliability, and/or prognostic applications is performed with accelerated tests and stress conditions that are defined by industry standards. These methods typically use threshold values to detect degradation and failures of the electrical interconnect. However, this approach does not consider the physics of failure of the component under test and is not sensitive enough to detect small changes in behavior. This paper presents a physics of failure based methodology that, combined with a sequential probability ratio test, overcomes the issues of the traditional approach. This new approach, called Maxima-SPRT, enables early detection of degradation and provides the information needed for the successful implementation of prognostic tools. The method is validated using an elastomer socket, a daisy chain package, and a test board assembly.

The machine vibration signals are processed using morphological operations to extract an entropy based feature characterizing the signal shape-size complexity for assessment of machine conditions. An evolutionary average entropy of the system is introduced as the 'monitoring index' for prognostics of the system condition. The progression of the 'monitoring index' is predicted using CI techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR). The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark datasets. The prognostic effectiveness of the CI techniques has been illustrated through vibration dataset of a helicopter drivetrain system gearbox. The performances of ANFIS and SVR have been found to be better than RNN for the dataset used. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of damage/degradation and their progression.

A key benefit of utilizing signal integrity parameters for PHM is that uncertainty is reduced as the very signals, their return paths, and their power and ground networks are used for monitoring deviations from expected normal behavior. Utilizing signal integrity parameters in a PHM implementation enables the health of system to be monitored from a signal point of view at the device, interconnect and transmission level. Utilizing jitter measurements, high-frequency losses are captured, and jitter (with respect to operational functions) is deterministic and bounded, thus reducing the complexity of PHM algorithms and enabling remaining useful life estimation. By selecting deterministic parameters for health monitoring, a fault signature and prognostics framework is considered to be achievable. Health monitoring of failure mechanisms, such as electromigration and electrostatic discharge, are discussed from a notional perspective.

To predict them, a predictive maintenance approach has been developed. It consists of observing the machine during a determined working time and recording the evolution of one or more physico-chemical parameters, then making a diagnosis and developing a failure prediction mathematical model. Initially, we followed a defect of unbalance on four different points of the machine by a vibrator indicator during one year period. The value of the vibrator amplitude evolves with respect to time according to a well defined law (decreasing curve). Using the statistical methods and knowing the evolution curve of each followed point, we deduce a corresponding tendency curve (theoretical model) which allows to predict the remaining time before the alarm threshold value. The reliability of the prediction model is related to an optimum exploitation of the machine under the normal terms of employment, to a qualification of the follow-up personnel and to the use of the computer tool.

With the recent advances on pervasive computing, prognostics can be easily embedded in any devices and systems. When smart machines are networked and remotely monitored, and when their data is modeled and continually analyzed with sophisticated embedded systems, it is possible to go beyond mere "predictive maintenance" to intelligent "prognostics", the process of pinpointing exactly which components of a machine are likely to fail, and when and autonomously trigger service and order spare parts. This paper addresses the paradigm shift in modern maintenance systems from traditional "fail and fix" practices to "predict and prevent" methodology. Recent advances on prognostic technologies and tools are discussed. In addition, case studies are used to validate f these developed technologies and tools.

Extraction and aggregation of information from rapid developing condition monitoring systems, process control systems, and inspection reports, has given rise to the invention of a new measure named "Technical Condition Index" (TCI). The TCI is defined as the degree of degradation relative to design condition. The TCI is calculated and aggregated to different levels in the repairable system hierarchy. The paper presents a methodology to calculate the residual life of an Export gas compressor at the Troll Kollsnes natural gas treatment plant based on an array of stored TCI values and events. This array is used to determine the TCI-dependent parameters in a Weibull PHM distribution. Knowledge about the TCI-dependent parameters in the Weibull PHM distribution, and the TCI history, will be used to calculate the probability of survival of an additional time interval of length x.

By efficient co-operation any problem areas can quickly be identified and solved as well as plant operations developed. A systematic remote performance and condition monitoring program is a valuable tool that can help the plant owners and operators meet their major objectives, i.e. high availability and efficiency with optimised operation and maintenance costs. The use of performance and condition monitoring brings total cost savings by improved machinery reliability and operation. Condition monitoring information is used to focus the maintenance to the right components at the correct time, thus reducing the risk of additional damage. The remote support makes early detection of incipient failures possible and provides decision-making support at short notice. Combination of the local site knowledge with technical and expert support ensures that the right conclusions are drawn from all the available data, and that I his is done in a well-planned and cost-effective way. Key elements of remote support include a multidisciplinary approach to cover several areas of expertise like thermal condition monitoring, vibration diagnostics and water chemistry monitoring. A Diagnostic Engine concept is being used to enable and automate the utilisation of data in both for early fault detection and trouble-shooting in the Remote Support Centre.

However, in the case of high reliability/availability-oriented industries (e.g., power systems for internet data centers have a desired availability of 0.99999 and, for semiconductor fabrication plants, have availability requirement of 0.9999999), this type of preventive maintenance scheduling is inadequate. A suitable approach in these situations is the adoption of condition-based predictive maintenance. Here the system condition is evaluated by processing the information gathered from the monitors placed at different points in the system, and maintenance is performed only when the failure/malfunction prognosis dictates. In the past, for power systems, voltages, currents, power, temperature and electromagnetic quantities had been monitored along with surface inspection and material quality tests at regular intervals. Diagnostic methods are already in place to indicate problems in industrial power systems by examining these monitored quantities. However, they lack the capability of looking into distant future. With the introduction of modem digital electronics-based smart monitors, the capability of logging power quality data at micro-second intervals, advanced signal processing tools for extracting features from collected data, and data mining techniques, a new horizon in maintenance scheduling has been unveiled. Trending techniques and techniques based on neural networks, when applied to the extracted features, enable us to predict the possible failures of individual equipment and subsystems well before they manifest. This paper considers the problem of evaluating the health indices of components of a power system by making use of the monitored power-quality data and classification techniques. Health index analysis distinguishes the healthy and risky components of the system. Results of these evaluations can be fed as inputs into a system-reliability/availability analysis tool. The reliability analysis enables analysts to decide on prioritization of the maintenance options subject to budget constraints.

In order to avoid and even counter this effect, a system was designed based on a multi-agent-architecture. This system, ComPASS, is a competence promoting decision support systems assisting machine operators in their tasks of finding and solving problems causing the standstill of CNC machine-tools. In addition, an instrument to measure this effect was developed. In this paper the system design, its scope and the competence measurement are detailed. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

This work is justified with the complex systems by the need of controlling and maintaining in dynamical way the global system performances in order to optimise the enterprise strategies. The added value of our methodology is to formalise the maintenance aid models from a priori knowledge both on the system functioning and malfunctioning by means of Bayesian Networks. The networks are built on adaptability principles and integrate uncertainties on the relationships between causes and effects. The feasibility of this methodology is tested in a manufacturing context with the maintenance aids on a lathe machine. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

This provides important information to the maintenance team and reduces the plant operational and maintenance costs. A popular tool for automated condition monitoring systems uses artificial neural networks, whose performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the input training data, which must accurately contain the main features of the signal to be classified. This work compares the usage of two feature extraction techniques (cepstrum and cepstrum reconstruction), as pre-processing tools for automated monitoring systems. Here, a neural network is used to diagnose the condition of a model drive-line, consisting of many rotating parts. Including a pair of spur gears, bearings, and an electric motor. Firstly, the model drive-line was ran in its normal condition, and later it was run with different gear faults (simulated cracks of different sizes) introduced intentionally. The real time domain vibration signatures from the drive-line under different conditions were pre-processed using the different pre-processing techniques. The pre-processed signals are used as input to neural networks that perform fault detection. It is shown here, that the cepstrum reconstruction technique does in fact outperform the basic cepstrum technique as a feature extraction tool for automated monitoring systems. Hence although more computationally expensive, cepstral reconstruction is a better choice of preprocessing technique for automated condition monitoring systems.

However, this success has not been mirrored at low rotational speeds of less than 20 rpm. At such speeds the energy generated from bearing defects might not show as an obvious change in signature and thus become undetectable using conventional vibration measuring equipment, This paper presents an investigation into the applicability of acoustic emission for detecting early stages of bearing damage at a rotational speed of 1.12 rpm. Furthermore, it reviews work undertaken in monitoring bearings rotating at speeds below 20 rpm. Investigations were centered on a bearing test-rig onto which localised surface defects were seeded by spark erosion. Analysis of acoustic emission signatures associated with bearing outer race, inner race and roller defects, showed that the uniqueness of the defect signature patterns could be utilised to provide early fault diagnosis.

Cutting is executed by an asynchronous 3-phase AC motor. The motor is controlled via PD feedback yielding disturbance rejection with simultaneous command matching, namely perfect output control. Two basic cutting irregularities in turning and milling operations are considered; progressive tool wear and chatter instability. The estimation is carried out in real time without requiring prediction or a priori knowledge of the toolpath and/or the workpiece materials properties. The estimation provides the appropriate basis for an anti-wear and chatter free strategy via adjustment of machining conditions and tool replacement. The real time characteristic of the method offers additional perspectives in CNC programming. Copyright (C) 2000 IFAC.

The former covers wide vibration causes, relating the probability of the occurrence of symptoms to an underlying cause, while the latter based on IF-THEN clauses gives relatively specified diagnosis results. Thus, the combined algorithm can guarantee high accuracy of fault diagnosis and also be easily extended by adding new causes or symptoms. Some examples using experimental data show the good feasibility of the proposed algorithm for condition monitoring and diagnosis of industrial rotating machinery.

The condition-indicating information is condensed into the network's synaptic weights which can be used for further analysis. The paper is organised as follows. Firstly basics of SOM networks are discussed with emphasis on input vector distribution approximation, Secondly, the applications of SOM networks are verified with numerical examples. Thirdly, the SOM networks are applied to approximate the distribution of machine generated acoustic signals. Spectral information is extracted from network synaptic weights and used to compare different conditions. The spectral interpretation of the SOM synaptic weights provides an efficient and novel analysis technique.

Conditions representing various speed ranges, different rates of change and different signal-to-noise ratios in the vibration signals are considered. A comparison of AR model based results with FFT based spectra is discussed. The method is also applied to vibration signals recorded from a rolling element bearing with and without an outer race fault. The results indicate that when applying the AR model based method to varying speed machines both the range of speed and the rate of change of the speed are important. Criteria and guidelines are recommended for the successful application of the AR model based method.

There is a large number of such fault classes, and their precise signatures depend on numerous parameters including variations in the motor power supply and driven load. Practical fault detection and diagnosis systems must exhibit high level of detection accuracy and acceptably low false alarm rates. They must have broad applicability, require installation of minimal extra sensors, and not require the use of detailed machine information for operation. In this paper the development and experimental demonstration of a model-based detection system for incipient electric machine faults is presented. The developed fault detection system uses recent developments in dynamic recurrent neural networks and multi-resolution signal processing. The sensors utilized are only those measuring the motor current and voltage. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated by detecting stator, rotor and bearing faults at the early stages of development. Furthermore, the ability of the system to discriminate between false alarm caused by poor power quality, variations in the driven load level, and actual incipient faults is demonstrated.

This machine is referred to as a Transverse Flux Motor (TFM) because of the unique three-dimensional flux paths created within it. This paper considers the development of flux-based condition monitoring for this new machine. Although condition monitoring based on vibration and current analysis has proved valuable to conventional induction motor fault detection and diagnosis [1-5], the design configuration of the TFM is significantly different to require new techniques to be developed. One such technique that is currently being researched and proving particularly useful is that of flux monitoring. In this paper an outline of the novel motor will be provided and then focus will be concentrated on the use of magnetic flux-based monitoring using copper search coils permanently fixed around the machine. A theoretical understanding on the use of flux monitoring is then discussed, including the transformation from the measurement to flux domains. Real data will be presented and the identification and diagnosis of a failure mode will also be examined and validated.

This paper outlines the background to the technique and describes two alternative architectures for its implementation. The development of approaches in order to implement condition monitoring are then discussed. Finally an example of the capability of Componential Coding is given using real data from an induction motor test facility. Conventional methods of condition monitoring are well established but exhibit some shortcomings [1, 2, 3] related to the requirements for prior knowledge and development of machine-specific tools. Componential Coding however is a generic technique that can be applied with little domain specific knowledge. The approach was originally developed for high dimensional data (typically for image processing) [4]. In order to apply Componential Coding to condition monitoring of rotating machinery the algorithm was developed in two forms: one for single-channel data and one for multi-channel data inputs. This paper considers the training of the network, how it may be used in condition monitoring and also both empirical and automatic optimisation of the network in order to improve the detection and diagnostic capabilities. The results obtained through the application of both real vibration and acoustic data from a conventional induction motor operating under healthy and faulty conditions are then presented and discussed.

The station consists of six 300MW Francis-type Pump-Turbines, with each 520 tonne assembly being suspended via a support bracket and a set of oil lubricated thrust bearing pads. Dinorwig performs a critical role in the UK National Grid system due to its ability to provide almost instantaneous power, Each of the machines must operate under an arduous regime in comparison with thermal base-load units, with each unit performing up to twenty-five mode change sequences per day. With such a regime the reliability of such plant is of critical importance in today's competitive electricity market. After carrying out an initial investigation into what useful information could be obtained from information currently monitored to determine the health of the plant, the authors are to continue a stage further and develop a condition monitoring and fault diagnostic system suitable for the machines at Dinorwig. In conjunction with developing the system, an assessment will be made of the improvements in the general condition of a unit which will have a new magnetic thrust bearing installed this year. The main purpose of the bearing is to reduce the load experienced by the thrust bearing at various power loads. This paper summaries the initial development work being carried out in order to identify the most appropriate monitoring parameters, analysis techniques and data acquisition systems required to achieve an effective condition monitoring and fault diagnostic system.

Maintenance can account for an extremely large proportion of the operating costs of machinery. Additionally, machine breakdowns and consequent downtime can severely affect the productivity of factories or the safety of products. Therefore, the manufacturing industries of the 21(st) century are influenced by the following major subjects of increased availability of physical resources, the improvement of product quality, and the improvement of manufacturing methods and techniques at high yearly utilization rate. Base is the effective use of available information contents from the machines in operation, like measured vibration signals and process parameters to extract significant patterns with the aim of early fault detection, the discovery of lack in the organization leadership and/or the operating condition. The presented case studies prove the success of the fault detection combining vibration measurements and process parameter analysis at different turbines,	Inst Mat Sci Agh, Dept NDT, D-30167 Hannover, Germany	Sudmersen, U (reprint author), Inst Mat Sci Agh, Dept NDT, Appelstr 11A, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.

The particular application is the hydraulic system of machinery used in the mining of Western Canada's Oil Sands. The system, analyses transducer data from the machinery and determines the machine's condition, using various signal processing techniques and a combination of a neural network and an expert system. If at any given time a decision is made by the diagnostics system that a fault is imminent, it will communicate failures and relevant information to maintenance staff via the company local area network. The system makes use of both neural network and expert rule based approaches for fault detection of a system with many different types of inputs to address the practicalities of implementation. These inputs include mechanical vibrations, slowly changing mechanical parameters and operator inputs. The combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and expert systems attempts to address some of the weaknesses of either approach being used independently. While the ANN is being trained online, the expert system will serve as the primary mechanism for failure detection. Gradually, as a database of fault and normal running data is accrued and classified, the role of the ANN will become more prevalent. All of the signal processing, computation and communications are being implemented using commercially available, low cost, PC based data acquisition and monitoring technology. Once the system has been trained unnecessary parameters and corresponding hardware and transducers can be removed, This approach addresses the practicalities of implementation of a monitoring system to a machine where little advanced knowledge exists of the machine's behaviour. The structure of the expert system and the ANN will be somewhat parallel. The reasoning for this is that what one scheme does not catch, the other will. A challenge with this type of parallel system is the avoidance of false alarms. Preliminary results indicate that this is an economical and effective approach, flexible enough to be implemented for various other types of machinery and industries.

From theoretical analysis, we know the existing demodulation methods have three limitations as following: when we demodulate two time-domain adding signals without modulating information (fault information), the subtraction of the two signals' frequencies will display as the result of demodulation; in generalized detection-filtering demodulation analysis, the effect of frequency aliasing may arise as a result of getting absolute value or detection; in several new Zoom demodulation methods, because digital low-pass filtering can not be carried out in the process of Zoom sub-sampling, it is possible to occur the phenomenon of frequency aliasing at low frequency range, which is the overlap of the higher harmonics of modulation frequency. This paper presents an optimized Hilbert Transform demodulation method based upon complex analytic band-pass filter, which can overcome the three limitations if the analytical frequency of modulation and filter's bandwidth satisfy a strict mathematics relation between themselves. Meanwhile, we can integrate band-pass filtering, Hilbert transform and sub-sampling as a whole to obtain a fast operation. It is an optimized demodulation method.

Structure faults of diesel engine usually affect exciting forces or propagation behavior of local vibration signals and induce different vibration responses on engine surface. Compared to other symptomatic parameters vibration signal possesses advantages of easy data acquisition, strong monitor directionality, high detection precision, early condition prediction and is especially sensitive to mechanical conditions of significant components such as piston-liner, valve mechanism, fuel oil injector, turbocharger bearing, main journal bearing, etc. Experimental research and theoretical analysis carried out during author's doctoral and post-doctoral research period has made more clear the excitation and propagation of superficial local vibration signals, revealed the relationship between internal exciting forces, external local vibrations, engine performance conditions and mechanical faults of diesel engine, explored a new method to get over the difficulties of present vibration analysis method in practical use of diesel engine fault diagnosis.

One of the more effective tools in predictive maintenance is condition monitoring and diagnostics. However, in many instances, condition monitoring is not taught to engineering students at Universities at the undergraduate level. The School of Mechanical, Manufacturing and Medical Engineering (MMME) of Queensland University of Technology is in tile process of introducing condition monitoring in its undergraduate curriculum as core for the Mechanical Engineering students where it is offered as part of the Mechanical Design course. This paper describes the basis for the introduction of the new subject and the resources used in its teaching.

The development of this system is based on four sequential steps: the development of simple but realistic Finite Element models based on dynamic simulations of the complete system, the monitoring of the real turbocharger, the accurate modelling of the foundations and the excitation from the main engine. In the final step possible faults of the machine are identified using the Artificial Neural Networks taking advantage of their learning capabilities for the real time diagnosis of potential faults. The application of the proposed system to a real naval turbocharger with vibration data obtained on working conditions show promising results.

In addition, wear particle analysis can give more advanced warning of an impending disaster for machine condition monitoring. However, its application in industry is, so far, limited because the current techniques require the analysts to have considerable experience and involvement in terms of time, and also due to the issue of reliability and objectivity of current techniques. To overcome the drawbacks and further to gain widespread application, a new wear particle analysis system using computer image analysis techniques is developed towards industrial application. This system is a computerised wear particle analysis assemblage which can perform a series of analyses including the study of particle size distribution, particle counting, the analysis of boundary and surface morphologies of wear debris in three dimensions and wear particle identification. As the whole system is computerised, it is an efficient and reliable system to conduct wear particle analysis. Meanwhile, the system has great commercial potential as it overcomes the limitation of visual inspection method, and furthermore, it combines the "group analysis" with individual particle morphological analysis in one system. The development is a basis for developing an expert system for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using wear debris analysis for practical application.

This paper presents different methods for diagnosing the condition of oscillating bearings in the universal joints of a roughing rolling mill. The unstable speed conditions of these roller bearings call for time-frequency analysis methods. The analysis methods applied on the oscillating bearings are the Short-Term-Fourier-Transform (STFT) and the Wavelet-Transform (WT). The results of these methods are compared to the more common statistical methods.

In particular, the paper concentrates upon what we call unwanted situations. These are problems which are time-consuming and troublesome to solve but not necessarily critical. The experience gained from solving such problems is often an unused resource. A case-based reasoning approach is suggested to store operator experience and knowledge concerning these situations. When an unwanted problem occurs, it is then related to the stored experience. In the initial phase, the approach focuses on acquiring knowledge from operators to describe the situation and later on, to include the human operator in the matching procedure.

Nevertheless, the reliable early fault detection of large and complex drive systems which are used e.g. in mining industry remains problematic. On the one hand the large size of such transmission parts requires multiple sensors and on the other hand common vibration diagnosis techniques do not work at extremely low rotating speed. This paper describes the monitoring and diagnosis of gearboxes in mining industry using a patented sensor technology called dtect which is able to cope with these problems. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

This paper describes a neural network vibration-based condition monitoring system for providing advance warnings of malfunctions in the paper machine. Spectral analysis of the raw vibration signals involves the technique of enveloping for isolating the spectral components that reflect the process defects. Feature extraction is then carried out by a suitably designed peak detection algorithm. This is followed by a neural network classifier for discriminating between the fault and the no-fault conditions. The system's performance is assessed on industrial data from a major paper manufacturer. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

Originality of this work holds in the machine model used It is a non-linear continuous time model defined in the (abc) frame, whose parameters are not dependent on rotor position. This model is well fitted for non-linear parameter identification algorithm, in order to apply a fault diagnosis method. A recursive algorithm has been derived from the off-line one, allowing to track parameter variation. Some experimental results conclude this paper. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

The envelope analysis as a part of it turned out to be a very effective method for diagnosis of antifriction bearings. Different bearing failures lead to different patterns of the envelope spectrum. Checking the amplitudes of characteristic bearing frequencies is mostly not sufficient for a reliable diagnosis. Therefore human experts compare the pattern of the spectrum with typical patterns of bearing defects. In this paper a fuzzy system is presented which imitates this action of human experts. The knowledge which is necessary for the diagnosis will be stored in the fuzzy rules. In this manner, the system is able to automatically recognize typical bearing defects as well as other kinds of machine failures. The input parameters of the fuzzy system are extracted by an extensive data preprocessing. The: presented fuzzy-system is used in different applications in mining and steel industry.

In this paper, we intend to establish discrete time models which are relevant to fault detection. Different methods are under consideration among them, we introduce a new one which leads to better results than the usual 2nd order Taylor expansion of matrix exponential and which does not require computation of matrix exponential at each iteration. In addition, we propose an approximate method which propagates additive uncertainties from differential equations to discrete time models keeping their additive nature. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

The following types of faults have been considered: sensor faults, actuator faults, and load faults in the synchronous machines. The implementation of FDI has been carried out on a TMS320-C30 based real-time multi-channel processor. Satisfactory results have been obtained and reported in this paper. Furthermore, the paper has concluded that for the purpose of fault detection, a simplified synchronous machine model is sufficient. However, in order to isolate the fault, or to obtain the detailed information about the fault, or to estimate the severity of the fault, more detailed mathematical and physical models have to be used.

Many different techniques and instruments; have been developed, and a lot of individuals has developed experiences as well as theoretical competence in how to make use of the information collected. Many attempts to develop software assistance, help for the evaluation and diagnostic work are known. Today still most systems require an experienced expert and a lot of time to carry out the analysis and conclude if it is a problem or not, what type and how serious. Next steps is to compare with previous measurements, conclude the severity, carry out the trend analysis in order to tell how long time the machinery still can operate safe, and finally advise the action required.

One of the most popular methods for monitoring is the use of vibration analysis techniques, which have quite a good performance in most of the machine types. However, this performance may be improved combining simultaneously some other monitoring technique, such as acoustic emission monitoring. The use of these two methods of monitoring has made it possible to develop an expert system for the diagnosis of a wide range of rotating machinery. This system can detect a series of defects in certain types of machines, and has the capability to be improved increasing the number of machines and defects detected.

Thus the detection of these impulses can be useful for fault diagnosis. Recently there is an increasing trend towards the use of higher order statistics for fault detection within mechanical systems based on the observation that impulsive signals tend to increase the kurtosis values. We show that the fourth order Wigner Moment Spectrum, called the Wigner Trispectrum, has superior detection performance to the second order Wigner distribution for typical impulsive signals found in a condition monitoring application. These methods are also applied to data sets measured within a car engine and industrial gearbox.

Condition monitoring by lubricant analysis is one of the basic tools of a predictive maintenance program along with vibration monitoring, performance monitoring and thermography. In today's modern power generation, manufacturing, refinery, transportation, mining, and military operations, the cost of equipment maintenance, service, and lubricants are ever increasing. Parts, labor, equipment downtime and lubricant prices and disposal costs are a primary concern in a well run maintenance management program. Machine condition monitoring based on oil analysis has become a prerequisite in most maintenance programs. Few operations can afford !lot to implement a program if they wish to remain competitive, and in some cases, profitable. This paper describes a comprehensive Machine Condition Monitoring Program based on oil analysis. Actual operational condition monitoring programs will be used to review basic components and analytical requirements. Case histories will be cited as examples of cost savings, reduced equipment downtime and increased efficiencies of maintenance programs through a well managed oil analysis program.

These unavoidable process conditions often disturb the whole setup and there is every possibility to miss important and relevant information. Standards for overall monitoring as well as for peak-amplitudes responsible for root cause identification are not always available because these machines are 'custom designed' and manufacturer's standards are of paramount importance to consider. The health of these machines cannot be assessed by simply comparing with the international standards unlike most common machines such as fans, pumps, motors etc. with minimum number of auxiliaries. There may also be limitations in the features of the instruments used for the purpose. In this paper, an attempt has been made to setup a monitoring approach for screw compressor which will help the industries initially setting base-line data to implement vibration analysis based off-line predictive maintenance programme either with the help of an analyser or with a latest software.

In a control room, it is difficult to know accidents such as fire, fuel oil leak, and unusual sound, at a moment's notice. Maintenance operators, therefore, have to patrol the plant yard to find out them. To release from the patrol, the needs for automatic monitoring system to detect those accidents are increasing. We have developed a new intelligent monitoring system using advanced ima,ae and sound analysis, which is reference to human senses, to realize the request. This system can detect oil and steam leak from burners, unusual sound from machines, and, fire and smoke in the circumference. This paper describes the system outline, features, and methods of image processing and sound analysis.
