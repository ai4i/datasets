Upgrading the existing diagnostic features in the firmware is very important to reduce the downtime of the machine. It is difficult to diagnose the mechanical faults as well as electrical faults together in the system. The various harmonic components, corresponding to different type of faults, are used to detect the faults using the Machine Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). Generally, the variables used for the diagnosis are speed, torque, vibration, current, temperature and chemical composition. Investigations on the effectiveness of the model based diagnostic techniques for the DFIG based WECS has been progressing over the last two decades. A comprehensive list of modeling methodologies for the DFIG, is discussed in this paper. These are i) qd0 transformation based method, ii) Finite Element Method (FEM), iii) Magnetic Equivalent Circuit (MEC) method, and iv) Winding Function Analysis (WFA) based method. In particular, a bird's eye view of different types of modeling techniques helps the researcher in incipient fault modeling of the DFIG. Choosing the best modeling method depends on the application. In addition, the researcher has to improve the diagnostic properties such as the accuracy and reliability with respect to parametric variation and environmental factors. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While the benefits are tremendous, there are many challenges to be faced when developing or porting services to virtualized infrastructure. Especially critical applications like Virtualized Network Functions must meet high requirements in terms of reliability and resilience. An important tool when meeting such requirements is detecting anomalous system components and recovering the anomaly before it turns into a fault and subsequently into a failure visible to the client. Anomaly detection for virtualized services relies on collecting system metrics that represent the normal operation state of every component and allow the usage of machine learning algorithms to automatically build models representing such state. This paper presents an approach for collecting service-layer metrics while treating services as black-boxes. This allows service providers to implement anomaly detection on the application layer without the need to modify third-party software. Deep Packet Inspection is used to analyse the traffic of virtual machines on the hypervisor layer, producing both generic and protocol-specific communication metrics. An evaluation shows that the resulting metrics represent the normal operation state of an example Virtualized Network Function and are therefore a valuable contribution to automatic anomaly detection in virtualized services.

On-line monitoring system of PV array based on internet of things technology	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEW ENERGY AND FUTURE ENERGY SYSTEM (NEFES 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on New Energy and Future Energy System (NEFES)	SEP 22-25, 2017	Kunming, PEOPLES R CHINA	Yunnan Normal Univ				The Internet of Things (IoT) Technology is used to inspect photovoltaic (PV) array which can greatly improve the monitoring, performance and maintenance of the PV array. In order to efficiently realize the remote monitoring of PV operating environment, an on-line monitoring system of PV array based on IoT is designed in this paper. The system includes data acquisition, data gateway and PV monitoring centre (PVMC) website. Firstly, the DSP-TMS320F28335 is applied to collect indicators of PV array using sensors, then the data are transmitted to data gateway through ZigBee network. Secondly, the data gateway receives the data from data acquisition part, obtains geographic information via GPS module, and captures the scenes around PV array via USB camera, then uploads them to PVMC website. Finally, the PVMC website based on Laravel framework receives all data from data gateway and displays them with abundant charts. Moreover, a fault diagnosis approach for PV array based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is applied in PVMC. Once fault occurs, a user alert can be sent via E-mail. The designed system enables users to browse the operating conditions of PV array on PVMC website, including electrical, environmental parameters and video. Experimental results show that the presented monitoring system can efficiently real-time monitor the PV array, and the fault diagnosis approach reaches a high accuracy of 97.5%.	[Li, Y. F.; Lin, P.

Furthermore, RUL prediction of Li-ion battery is crucial for the operation scheduling, spare parts management and maintenance decision for such kinds of systems. In recent years, performance degradation prognostics and RUL estimation approaches have become a focus of the research concerning with Li-ion battery. This paper summarizes the approaches used in Li-ion battery RUL estimation. Three categories are classified accordingly, i.e. model-based approach, data-based approach and hybrid approach. The key issues and future trends for battery RUL estimation are also discussed.	[Su, C.; Chen, H.

Vibration Fault Simulation System (VFSS) is an example of mechatronics system. The focus of this study is the prediction on the use of critical machines to detect vibration. Vibration measurement is often used as the key indicator of the state of the machine. This paper shows the choice of the appropriate strategy in the vibration of diagnostic process of the mechanical system, especially rotating machines, in recognition of the failure during the working process. In this paper, the vibration signature analysis is implemented to detect faults in rotary machining that includes imbalance, mechanical looseness, bent shaft, misalignment, missing blade bearing fault, balancing mass and critical speed. In order to perform vibration signature analysis for rotating machinery faults, studies have been made on how mechatronics technology is used as predictive maintenance methods. Vibration Faults Simulation Rig (VFSR) is designed to simulate and understand faults signatures. These techniques are based on the processing of vibrational data in frequency-domain. The LabVIEW-based spectrum analyzer software is developed to acquire and extract frequency contents of faults signals. This system is successfully tested based on the unique vibration fault signatures that always occur in a rotating machinery.	[Majid, Nurul Afiqah A.; Muthalif, Asan G.

In many cases it is difficult to directly and accurately identify the fault type and its extent under varying operating conditions. Therefore the ability to monitor and diagnose machine and structures health at early stages of fault initiation is one of the fundamental requirements of the development of online machine monitoring systems. This work demonstrates a novel procedure for crack detection and identification in an experimental set-up. Cracks of different lengths are introduced at three different locations along a cantilevered steel beam. The beam is exposed to several forms of excitation at different levels of amplitude and frequency. The excitation is introduced to the beam next to its fixed end using an electromagnetic shaker controlled by an arbitrary function generator. The vibration signals are analyzed for the beam dynamic signatures in the form of statistical moments, frequency spectra and wavelet coefficients. These are then used as features to create a data-partition using fuzzy relational clustering. The objective is to correlate crack length and crack propagation to the statistical moments, frequency spectra and wavelet coefficient data. The work will be later extended to supervise learning by training a classifier in a two-class problem to identify signal features that correlate to critical faults (C) 2017 The Authors.

Anomaly detection algorithms highlight deviations from predetermined benchmarks with the goal of detecting incipient faults. We are developing an integrated system to address three key challenges within analyzing sensor data from power-generating assets: (1) difficulty in ingesting and analyzing data from large numbers of machines; (2) prevalence of false alarms generated by anomaly detection algorithms resulting in unnecessary downtime and maintenance; and (3) lack of an integrated visualization that helps users understand and explore the flagged anomalies and relevant sensor context in the energy domain. We present preliminary results and our key findings in addressing these challenges. Our system's scalable event ingestion framework, based on OpenTSDB, ingests nearly 400,000 sensor data samples per seconds using a 30 machine cluster. To reduce false alarm rates, we leverage the False Discovery Rate (FDR) algorithm which significantly reduces the number of false alarms. Our visualization tool presents the anomalies and associated content flagged by the FDR algorithm to inform users and practitioners in their decision making process. We believe our integrated platform will help reduce maintenance costs significantly while increasing asset lifespan. We are working to extend our system on multiple fronts, such as scaling to more data and more compute nodes (70 in total).

J	Ma, J; Wu, JD; Wang, XD				Ma, Jun; Wu, Jiande; Wang, Xiaodong			Fault Diagnosis Method of Check Valve Based on Multikernel Cost-Sensitive Extreme Learning Machine	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							DECOMPOSITION; REGRESSION	Check valve is one of the most important components and most easily damaged parts in high pressure diaphragm pump, which is a typical representative of reciprocating machinery. In order to ensure the normal operation of the pump, it is necessary to monitor its running state and diagnose fault. However, in the fault diagnosis of check valve, the classification models with single kernel function can not fully interpret the classification decision function, and meanwhile unreasonable assumption of diagnostic cost equalization has a significant impact on classification results. Therefore, the multikernel function and cost-sensitive mechanism are introduced to construct the fault diagnosis model of check valve based on the multikernel cost-sensitive extreme learning machine (MKL-CS-ELM) in this paper. The comparative test results of check valve for high pressure diaphragm pump show that MKL-CS-ELM can obtain fairly or slightly better performance than ELM, CS-ELM, MKL-ELM, and multikernel cost-sensitive support vector learning machine (MKL-CS-SVM). At the same time, the presented method can obtain very high accuracy under imbalance datasets condition and effectively overcome the weakness of diagnostic cost equalization and improve the interpretability and reliability of the decision function of classification model. It, therefore, is more suitable for the practical application.

Machines unavailabilities are due to predictive maintenance interventions scheduled based on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results. Hence, we deal with the post prognostic decision making in order to improve system safety and avoid downtime and inopportune maintenance spending. For this reason, we propose a new interpretation of PHM outputs to define machines degradations corresponding to each job. Moreover, to take into account the several sources of uncertainty in the prognosis process, we choose to model PHM outputs using fuzzy logic. Motivated by the computational complexity of the problem, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) methods are developed including well designed local search procedures. Computational experiments carried out on well known benchmark sets for permutation flowshop show that the proposed algorithms seems to be efficient and effective. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Signal, control, and power electronics will heterogeneously be integrated at minimum space with sensors and actuators to form highly compact and ultra-smart systems for functions like traction, lighting, energy management, computation, and communication. Most of these systems will be highly safety relevant with the requirements in system availability exceeding today's already high automotive standards. Other than the human drivers of today, passengers in the automated car do not pay constant attention to the driving actions of the vehicle. Hence, reliability research is massively challenged by the new automotive applications. Guaranteeing the specified lifetime at statistical average is no longer sufficient. Assuring that no failure of an individual safety relevant part occurs unexpectedly, becomes most important. The paper surveys the priority actions underway to cope with the tremendous challenges. It highlights practical examples in all three directions of reliability research. i) Experimental reliability tests and physical analyses: New and highly efficient accelerated stress tests are able to cover the complex and multi-fold loading situation in the field. New analytics techniques can identify the typical failure modes and their physical root causes. ii) Virtual techniques: Schemes of validated simulations allow capturing the physics of failure proactively in the design for reliability process. iii) Prognostics health management (PHM): A new concept is introduced for adding a minimum of PHM features at the various levels of automotive electronics to provide functional safety as required for autonomous vehicles. This way, the new generation of reliability methods will continuously provide estimates of the remaining useful life (RUL) for each relevant part under the actual use conditions to allow triggering maintenance in time.

A simultaneous fault diagnosis model based on Paired Relevance Vector Machine (Paired-RVM) is proposed for the simultaneous fault of the main reducer, and each binary sub-classifier is trained with single fault samples and then fused by a pairing strategy. With F-measure as a measurement indicator of diagnosis precision, the threshold set DThreshold is used to train a threshold optimization algorithm so as to generate the optimal decision threshold, thus converting the probability output generated by the classification model into the final simultaneous fault mode. A contrast experiment is made between Paired-RVM and some commonly used supervised learning models of SVM, ELM and KELM, and the experimental results show that the performance of Paired-RVM proposed in this paper is superior to that of other models in simultaneous fault diagnosis and single fault diagnosis, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Characterized by the fulfillment of individual customer requirements, companies in special machinery have to deal with very specific and technologically complex tasks. Hence, managing information and knowledge becomes vital for a company's competitive ability, notably when it comes to expert knowledge. The characteristics of special machines leads to iterative processes for problem solving and thereby, increase lead times significantly. The more technologically complex a machine is, the more scattered the expert knowledge, meaning that many different experts need to be consulted before solving a problem. Up to now, in scientific literature, there has been little discussion about the challenges of special machinery and practical solutions regarding an implementation of technical intelligence in a special machinery environment. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to give an example of how an expert system can be applied to special machinery surroundings and thus, increases productivity. A Bayesian network forms the basis of the system as it allows efficient inference algorithms and reasoning under uncertainty, despite its ability to describe complex dependencies. The expert systems capability has been proven in industrial laser manufacturing. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Within this industry, the commissioning process represents a significant part in the product engineering process and forms the base for reliability and performance during future operation. However, there is little research focusing on this process for special machinery. In particular, there has been little discussion on methods to evaluate alternative test processes or arranging test processes along the commissioning process. Therefore, this paper develops an application-oriented simulation tool that allows an evaluation of test alternatives and an arrangement of test processes during the commissioning process in special machinery. The authors decided to use Bayesian Networks to model the commissioning process as they enable the connectivity of multiple modules and integrate the stochastic dependencies along the processes. In addition the paper reveals two concepts to deal with unknown processes and the lack of data. Applying the simulation tool in a laser system manufacturer reveals that the simulation tool allows an evaluation as well as the identification of risks and need for countermeasures.

In turn, the data related to the manufacturing processes is growing in size and in complexity. This presents new challenges for real-time monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of the processes. The challenges are addressed by new tools, methodologies, and concepts, collectively referred to as Big Data. The paper deals with the use of advanced methods for prognostics of infrequent faults on available but highly dimensional manufacturing process data. A holistic approach, which includes data generation, acquisition, storage, processing, and prognostics, is shown in a case of a plastic injection moulding process. Real industrial data acquired from five injection moulding machines and the Manufacturing Execution System within a period of six months is used. It is shown how the approach is able to tackle the high dimensionality and the large size of the data to create and evaluate prediction models for prognostics of the unplanned machine stops.

A difficulty however in fault detection in such systems is inter-class variability caused by non-uniform or unknown load conditions which decrease the classification accuracy. In this paper, a scattering transform is employed to diagnose gearbox faults using acoustic emission analysis. The results analysis and solution shows that a two layer scattering transform can diagnose four gearbox faults with an average accuracy of 97 % even if the system is not exposed to data of aIl loads in the training phase.

Nevertheless, during their function in different process, this machine types are submitted to external and internal stresses which can lead to several electrical or mechanical failures. In this paper, we proposed a reliable approach for diagnosis and detection of stator short-circuit windings and rotor broken bars faults in induction motor under varying load condition based on relative energy for each level of stator current signal using wavelet packet decomposition which will be useful as data input of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is able to identify the induction motor and it is proven to be capable of detecting broken bars and stator short-circuit fault e with high precision. The diagnostic ANFIS algorithm is applicable to a variety of industrial process based on the induction machine for detection and classified the any faults types. This approach is applied under the MATLAB software (R).

However, the SVM performance is particularly influenced byits parameter selection. This paper presents the parameter optimization of an SVM classifier using chaos-enhanced stochastic fractal search (SFS) algorithm to classify conditions of a ball bearing. The vibration data for normal and damaged conditions of the ball bearing system obtained from the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Centre. Features based on time and frequency domains were generated to characterize the ball bearing conditions. The performance of chaos-enhanced SFS algorithms in comparison to their predecessor algorithm is evaluated. In conclusion, the injection of chaotic maps into SFS algorithm improved its convergence speed and searching accuracy based on the statistical results of CEC 2015 benchmark test suites and their application to ball bearing fault diagnosis.

As a consequence, the number of possible workflows is not limited to those which were manually predefined, but limited to all possible routes in the factory (state space explosion). Accordingly, analyzing anomalies in such a huge solution space becomes more challenging. In this paper, we present a root cause analyis (RCA) approach for finding the root cause of global anomalous events which handles this state space explosion in SOIS. To do so, the dependencies between path usage and external factors like available machines and demanded tasks are subdivided into several sub-dependencies. In addition, we propose for one of these sub-dependencies a heuristical description which avoids the enormous computational effort for modeling the dependency exactly. The operating principle of our RCA method is evaluated based on simulation data of an example factory.

Each condition monitoring approach has its own strengths and weaknesses; there is not a single technique that can diagnose all types of faults. As a result, it can be a challenge to find the root cause of a problem when only a single feature is monitored. There is also a greater risk of missed- or false-alarms. It has been shown that data fusion, combining multiple features, can improve the effectiveness of fault diagnosis. In recent work, a two-stage Bayesian inference approach, in which data is fused at both a local, or component, level, as well as at a global, or system-wide level has been shown to refine the diagnostic assessment of machinery comprised of a number of interacting components. In this paper, we show that the approach may also be applied to combine information from multiple, diverse condition monitoring systems. Acoustic, electric and vibration signals were measured from healthy and faulty induction motors, operating under normal and noisy working conditions. The proposed method was shown to increase the reliability of the health assessment of the induction motors, reducing the risk of missed and false alarms.

With the development of computational and experimental methods for structural analysis, the accuracy of the structural response prediction relies on a better understanding of the material degradation process. However, a realistic estimate of corrosion is inherently a complex undertaking. Corrosion of even a single form can often involve multiple stages, each of which has different steps across several geometric scales; corrosion systems are often multi-layered and involve geometric complexities; the mechanical factors (stress/strain distributions) could affect the corrosion initiation and kinetics. These complexities have resulted in scientific barriers to the advancement of a corrosion prognosis that forecasts damage accumulation, as well as a computational realization of the corrosion-structural analysis. This paper reviews the numerical and experimental work that the authors have done, including the development of nonlinear finite element models to assess the behavior of damaged steel ship structures, full-field experimental verifications, application of the mechano-electrochemical theory and in situ tensile corrosion tests.

A recent attempt to accommodate quite a number of UAVs in the airspace requires to assure a safety level. The hardware limitations for these small vehicles point the utilization of analytical redundancy rather than the usual practice of hardware redundancy in the conventional flights. In the course of this study, fault detection and diagnosis for aircraft is reviewed. An approach of implementing machine learning practices to diagnose faults on a small fixed-wing is selected. The selection criteria behind is that, data-driven fault diagnosis enables avoiding the burden of accurate modeling needed in model-based fault diagnosis. In this study, first, a model of an aircraft is simulated. This model is not used for the design of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) algorithms, but instead utilized to generate data and test the designed algorithms. The measurements are simulated using the statistics of the hardware in the house. Simulated data is opted instead of flight data to isolate the probable effects of the controller on the diagnosis, which will complicate this preliminary study on FDD for drones. A supervised classification method, SVM (Support Vector Machines) is used to classify the faulty and nominal flight conditions. The features selected are the gyro and accelerometer measurements. The fault considered is loss of effectiveness in the control surfaces of the drone. Principle component analysis is used to investigate the data by reducing the feature space dimension. The training is held offline due to the need of labeled data. The results show that for simulated measurements, SVM gives very accurate results on the classification of loss of effectiveness fault on the control surfaces.

Based on the analysis on its SPD, a method to predict both lumen depreciation and color shift for the phosphor converted white LEDs (pc-LEDs) is proposed in this paper. First, the entire SPD of a pc-LED is predicted by superimposing two asymmetric double sigmoidal (Asym2sig) models, which represent the decomposed blue light and phosphor converted light peaks, respectively. For a better understanding of how the SPD model affects the photometric and colorimetric characteristics of a pc-LED, a sensitivity study of the SPD parameters is then performed on its luminous flux (Phi), color coordinates CIE1976(u', v') Second, the evolutionary process of the SPD is predicted for a pc-LED with the color temperature as 3000 K under degradation testing. And based on these predicted SPDs, the drift curves of Phi, u', v', and du'v' are further predicted. Finally, lifetimes of the pc-LED due to lumen depreciation and color shift are estimated simultaneously from the predicted Phi and du'v' drift curves.

Adaptive Mode Decomposition Methods and Their Applications in Signal Analysis for Machinery Fault Diagnosis: A Review With Examples	IEEE ACCESS			English	Review						Adaptive mode decomposition; mono-component; instantaneous frequency; time-frequency representation; fault diagnosis	TIME-SCALE DECOMPOSITION; FREQUENCY DEMODULATION ANALYSIS; LOCAL MEAN DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; EMPIRICAL WAVELET TRANSFORM; RUB-IMPACT FAULT; WIND TURBINE; ENERGY SEPARATION; JOINT AMPLITUDE; GEAR FAULTS	Effective signal processing methods are essential for machinery fault diagnosis. Most conventional signal processing methods lack adaptability, thus being unable to well extract the embedded meaningful information. Adaptive mode decomposition methods have excellent adaptability and high flexibility in describing arbitrary complicated signals, and are free from the limitations imposed by conventional basis expansion, thus being able to adapt to the signal characteristics, extract rich characteristic information, and therefore reveal the underlying physical nature. This paper presents a systematic and up-to-date review on adaptive mode decomposition in two major topics, i.e., mono-component decomposition algorithms (such as empirical mode composition, local mean decomposition, intrinsic time-scale decomposition, local characteristic scale decomposition, Hilbert vibration decomposition, empirical wavelet transform, variational mode decomposition, nonlinear mode decomposition, and adaptive local iterative filtering) and instantaneous frequency estimation approaches (including Hilbert-transform-based analytic signal, direct quadrature, and normalized Hilbert transform based on empirical AM-FM decomposition, as well as generalized zero crossing and energy separation) reported in more than 80 representative articles published since 1998. Their fundamental principles, advantages and disadvantages, and applications to signal analysis in machinery fault diagnosis, are examined. Examples are provided to illustrate their performance.

Although the use of data-driven fault detection techniques have gained much interest, the main deterrent in using these approaches in detecting ITSC faults is in the generalization and robustness of the diagnosis. In this paper, a data-driven on-line fault detection framework, incorporated with multi-feature extraction/selection and multi-classifier ensemble is proposed, capable of detecting ITSC faults in induction motors (IMs) that subjected to variable operating conditions. By using the synchronous time series signals collected from the machines, multiple feature extraction/selection is explored to find the sensitive faulty features, and the different types of classification strategies is used to increase the diversity of single based models. With the increased diversity of the base learners, the fault detection accuracy is expected to be enhanced and the robustness can be guaranteed. The framework was implemented and tested using real data collected from a designed test bed, with the experimental results showing the effectiveness of the framework in detecting ITSC faults in IMs.	[Xu, Zhao] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Hu, Changhua] Xian Res Inst High Technol, Xian 710025, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Feng; Kuo, Shyh-Hao] Inst High Performance Comp, Dept Comp Sci, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Goh, Chi-Keong; Gupta, Amit; Nadarajan, Sivakumar] Rolls Royce Singapore, Adv Technol Ctr, Singapore 797575, Singapore		Hu, CH (corresponding author), Xian Res Inst High Technol, Xian 710025, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.	hch_reu@sina.cn		Yang, Feng/0000-0002-7183-5756; Goh, Chi Keong/0000-0002-4250-7307	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61603303, 61401363]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [G2017KY0008]; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi [2017JQ6005]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M610650]; Innovation Development Foundation of Loving Students [ASN-IF2015-1502]	This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61603303 and Grant 61401363, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grand G2017KY0008, in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi under Grant 2017JQ6005, in part by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant 2017M610650, and in part by the Innovation Development Foundation of Loving Students under Grant ASN-IF2015-1502.

J	Yu, Y; Hu, CH; Si, XS; Zhang, JX				Yu, Yong; Hu, Changhua; Si, Xiaosheng; Zhang, Jianxun			Degradation Data-Driven Remaining Useful Life Estimation in the Absence of Prior Degradation Knowledge	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							RELIABILITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPONENTS; ALGORITHM; SIGNALS; MODEL; ECM	Recent developments in prognostic and health management have been targeted at utilizing the observed degradation signals to estimate residual life distributions. Current degradation models mainly focus on a population of "identical" devices or an individual device with population information, not a single component in the absence of prior degradation knowledge. However, the fast development of science and technology provides us with many kinds of new systems, and we just have the real-time monitoring information to analyze the reliability for them. The fusion algorithm presented herein addresses this challenge by combining the excellent modeling ability of Bayesian updating method for the multilevel data and the prominent estimation ability of ECM algorithm for incomplete data. Residual life distributions and posterior distributions are first calculated through the Bayesian updating method based on randominitial a priori distributions. Then the a priori distributions are revised and improved for future predictions by the ECM algorithm. Once a new signal is observed, we can reuse the fusion algorithm to improve the accuracy of residual life distributions. The applicability of this fusion algorithm is validated by a set of simulation experiments.

The large social and economic relevance of these constructions force the stakeholders to ensure a prolonged health/durability. Even though, inevitable malfunctioning, breaking down, and out-of-service periods arise randomly during the life cycle of the infrastructure. Predictive maintenance techniques tend to diminish the appearance of unpredicted failures and the execution of needed corrective interventions, envisaging the adequate interventions to be conducted before failures show up. This communication presents: i) A procedural approach, to be conducted, in order to collect the relevant information regarding the evolving state condition of the assets involved in all maintenance interventions; this reported and stored information constitutes a rich historical data base to train Machine Learning algorithms in order to generate reliable predictions of the interventions to be carried out in further time scenarios. ii) A schematic flow chart of the automatic learning procedure. iii) Self-learning rules from automatic learning from false positive/negatives. The description, testing, automatic learning approach and the outcomes of a pilot case are presented; finally some conclusions are outlined regarding the methodology proposed for improving the self-learning predictive capability.

Although health monitoring methodologies have been thoroughly developed for rotating machinery, low-speed conditions often pose a challenge due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. To this aim, sophisticated algorithms that reduce noise and highlight the bearing faults are necessary to accurately diagnose machines undergoing this condition. In the development phase, sensor data from a healthy and damaged bearing rotating at low-speed is required to verify the performance of such algorithms. A test rig for performing accelerated life-time testing of small rolling element bearings is designed to collect necessary sensor data. Heavy loads at high-speed conditions are applied to the test bearing to wear it out fast. Sensor data is collected in intervals during the test to capture the degeneration features. The main objective of this paper is to provide a detailed overview for the development and analysis of this test rig. A case study with experimental vibration data is also presented to illustrate the efficacy of the developed test rig.	[Klausen, A.; Folgero, R. W.; Robbersmyr, K.

The interaction among humans and computers can become much more intuitive and effective if we are able to use more senses, and create other modes of communicating between them. New machine learning technologies can make this type of interaction become a reality. In this paper, we present a framework for a holistic communication between humans and machines that uses all of the senses, and discuss how a subset of this capability can allow machines to talk to humans to indicate their health for various tasks such as predictive maintenance.

Through the time-frequency analysis of the signals, the vibration characteristics of the core loose fault were obtained, and a fault diagnosis method based on the dual tree complex wavelet (DT-CWT) and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed. The vibration signals were analyzed by DT-CWT, and the energy entropy of the vibration signals were taken as the feature vector; the support vector machine was used to train and test the feature vector, and the accurate identification of the core loose fault of the flat wave reactor was realized. Through the identification of many groups of normal and core loose fault state vibration signals, the diagnostic accuracy of the result reached 97.36%.

Vibration signal analysis is one of the methods to monitor and diagnose the running status of antifriction bearings. Therefore, using wavelet analysis for demising is of great importance in the engineering practice. This paper firstly presented the basic theory of wavelet analysis to study the transformation, decomposition and reconstruction of wavelet. In addition, edition software LabVIEW was adopted to conduct wavelet and demodulation upon the vibration signal of antifriction bearing collected. With the combination of Hilbert envelop demodulation analysis, the fault character frequencies of the demised signal were extracted to conduct fault diagnosis analysis, which serves as a reference for the wavelet and demodulation of the vibration signal in engineering practice.

Two types of materials have been used: carbon and glass fibres reinforced composites. Particularly the paper is dedicated to elastic waves propagation phenomenon, scanning laser vibrometry, electromechanical impedance and terahertz spectroscopy. It also includes a variety of techniques being related to diagnostics (damage size estimation and damage type recognition) and prognostics. Selected numerical aspects of the phenomena related to the mentioned methods are addressed. Moreover it covers the main disciplines which are related to above mentioned techniques as piezoelectric sensors and transducers, and signal processing. The signal processing approach is crucial allowing extracting damage related features from the gathered signals. Investigated damage is in the form of mechanical failures as cracks, delaminations, debonding, voids. Also methods dedicated to thermal degradation, moisture and chemical contamination are shown. Presented methods are also suitable for performance of bonded joints assessment. Problem of external factors on investigated methods is also discussed in this paper. The characteristic of each method is summarized by a critical look. The laser vibrometry is a non-contact technique that allows to measure vibrations of structure excited by shaker or piezoelectric transducer. In guided waves-based technique, the interaction of elastic waves with failures can be seen after appropriate signal processing. The electromechanical impedance method is based on electromechanical coupling of piezoelectric transducer with a host structure. Damage in structures caused frequency shift of certain resonance frequencies visible in resistance characteristic. The terahertz spectroscopy method is based on an electromagnetic radiation in the range: 0.1-3 THz. It allows for reflection and transmission measurements. Reflection mode is more feasible for real structures where access to the structure is only from one side. During current research time signals as well as sets of signals creating B-scans have been analysed. Authors address also the problem of adhesive bonding in the case of CFRP samples. Techniques for detection of weak bonds are presented together with signal processing approaches. The reported investigations concern contaminated bonds caused by both manufacturing (e.g. release agent) and in-service contaminations (e.g. de-icer). Promising combination of selected techniques should lead to an innovative approach to ensure safety operation of structures. Local and global methods have been applied and validated by experimental studies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Then multiple features extraction techniques from time, frequency and time-frequency domains are used. ReliefF and min redundancy max Relevance (mRMR) features selection techniques are used to select the optimal features and reduce the dimension of calculated data. Finally, the SOM is used for classification of the different conditions. The obtained results show that the association of feature selection techniques to SOM classifier conduct to the improvement the classification performances of the fault detection process.

Recently, SVM is also developed for survival analysis. In this study, Additive Survival Least Square SVM (A-SURLSSVM) approach is used to analyze cervical cancer dataset and its performance is compared with the Cox model as a benchmark. The comparison is evaluated based on the prognostic index produced: concordance index (c-index), log rank, and hazard ratio. The higher prognostic index represents the better performance of the corresponding methods. This work also applied feature selection to choose important features using backward elimination technique based on the c-index criterion. The cervical cancer dataset consists of 172 patients. The empirical results show that nine out of the twelve features: age at marriage, age of first getting menstruation, age, parity, type of treatment, history of family planning, stadium, long-time of menstruation, and anemia status are selected as relevant features that affect the survival time of cervical cancer patients. In addition, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated through a simulation study with the different number of features and censoring percentages. Two out of three performance measures (c-index and hazard ratio) obtained from A-SURLSSVM consistently yield better results than the ones obtained from Cox model when it is applied on both simulated and cervical cancer data. Moreover, the simulation study showed that A-SURLSSVM performs better when the percentage of censoring data is small.

J	Malik, H; Mishra, S				Malik, Hasmat; Mishra, Sukumar			Selection of Most Relevant Input Parameters Using Principle Component Analysis for Extreme Learning Machine Based Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis Model	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						DGA; fault diagnosis; ELM; PCA; power transformer	DISSOLVED-GAS ANALYSIS; IN-OIL ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; INCIPIENT FAULTS; WAVELET NETWORKS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; CODES	The dissolved gas-in-oil analysis is a prevailing methodology being extensively utilized to diagnose incipient faults in oil-immersed power transformers. However distinct approaches have been implemented to find out dissolved gas analysis (DGA) results, they may sometimes fail to diagnose precisely. The incipient fault identification accuracy of various artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodology is assorted with change of input parameters. Thus, selection of input variable to an AI model is major research area. In this paper, principle component analysis algorithm using Rapid-Miner is applied to 360 experimental datasets, imitated in lab to identify most pertinent input variables for incipient fault classification. Thereafter, multi-class Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique is implemented to classify the incipient faults of power transformer and its performance is compared with artificial neural network, gene expression programming, fuzzy-logic, and support vector machine. The compared result shows that ELM provides better diagnosis results up to 100% accuracy at proposed input variable in short of time period which is helpful in on-line condition monitoring.

In this paper, a new multi-speed fault diagnostic approach is presented by using self-adaptive wavelet transform components generated from bearing vibration signals. The proposed approach is capable of discriminating signatures from four conditions of rolling bearing, i.e., normal bearing and three different types of defected bearings on outer race, inner race, and roller separately. Particle swarm optimization and Broyden-Fletche-Goldfarb-Shanno-based quasi-Newton minimization algorithms are applied to seek optimal parameters of Impulse Modeling-based continuous wavelet transform model. Then, a 3-D feature space of the statistical parameters and a nearest neighbor classifier are, respectively, applied for fault signature extraction and fault classification. Effectiveness of this approach is then evaluated, and the results have achieved an overall accuracy of 100%. Moreover, the generated discriminatory fault signatures are suitable for multi-speed fault data sets. This technique will be further implemented and tested in a real industrial environment.

WOS-ELM, which assigns different weights to old and new data, implements weighted dealing with the input data to get more precise training models. The proposed approach contains two series of diagnosis models, that is, spatial model and time model. The application of double redundancy based on spatial and time redundancy can in real time detect the hard fault and soft fault much earlier. The trouble-free or reconstructed time redundancy model can be utilized to update the training model and make it be consistent with the practical operation mode of the aeroengine. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

The concept of feature departure degree is defined, which can be used as a measure of wavelet packet transform to obtain the fault features using different wavelet basis function, and the wavelet basis function with maximum feature departure degree is selected and used to extract the fault feature. Further, the ELM is introduced for fault classification and identification, and the diagnosis result is compared with those using three popular neural networks.

After a long period of operation, the gear fault occurs frequently, which has a great influence on the equipment. However, due to its complex structure, the fault signal is often submerged in the inherent signal of the gearbox. In order to extract the fault feature from the signal, a method based on energy of Local mean decomposition (LMD) and Back Propagation (BP) neural network is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. Original signal is decomposed by LMD into 6 product functions (PF). The energy of each PF component are calculated and defined as the input of the BP neural network. Optimal model of neural network can be obtained based on sample training. The result of experimental shows that the proposed method can achieve an overall recognition rate of 95.5%, which proves that it is an effective method for planetary gear fault diagnosis.

The proposed approach is based on mapping the triangle of Duval into Bayesian network (BN). This approach eliminates the uncertainty that exists in the decision making regarding the nature of the faults due to gases that are trapped in the transformer, and faults that results in more gas percentages simultaneously. The model accurately provides transformer fault diagnosis and prediction abilities by calculating the probabilities of released gases and further predicting the failures based on their relationships in the Bayesian network. A case study is presented at the end of the paper to show the feasibility of the method on a 15.5 / 6.6 kV 20 MVA step-down transformer.

The numerical method, presented in this work, based on the Hilbert Huang transform shows the possibility of improving the detection of faults in electrical machines. Using the Hilbert Huang transform analyses the stator current signal using intrinsic mode functions, which are extracted using the process of empirical mode decomposition. However, the use of Hilbert transform based time domain approach in Hilbert Huang transform for analysis of stator current signature leads to scope for subjective error in calculation of characteristic defect frequencies of the broken rotor bars.

A Comparative Study between the MCSA, DWT and the Vibration Analysis Methods to Diagnose the Dynamic Eccentricity Fault in Induction Motors	2017 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS AND CONTROL (ICSC' 17)	International Conference on Systems and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Systems and Control (ICSC)	MAY 07-09, 2017	Batna 2 Univ, Batna, ALGERIA	Univ Batna 2, Fac Technol, Lab Syst Propuls Induct Electromagnetiques, Lab dElectrotechnique Batna, Lab dElectronique Avancee, Lab dAutomatique Avancee danalyse Systemes, Lab dAutomatique Productique, IEEE Control Syst Soc	Batna 2 Univ		WAVELET TRANSFORM; NEURAL-NETWORK; MACHINES; SIGNAL	This paper presents three interesting methods that are widely used in the diagnosis of electrical machines. Today, many researchers use a technique to detect the faults which may cause the induction machines. The choice of one method over the other is essentially depends on its effectiveness, ease of use and speed. Early detection of faults is a valuable advantage. Our new study is to investigate the efficiency of each method under a dynamic eccentricity fault (DE) in order to detect the characteristic signatures. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) method is widely used in the diagnosis; it based on analyzing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the stator current. Another method which is opens the door to analyze signals in simultaneous time-frequency. It is called the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) which has the ability to allow for studying transient phenomena and non-stationary signals. We will calculate and analyze a particular frequency band of the stator current by DWT coefficients. Our study also treats the details and approximates by Daubechies order. We will present an important indicator of this technique; it's the energy of some details. The last technique is the vibration analysis that is widely used now in industry to detect the faults in electrical machines. The vibration is the result of several causes such as mechanical or electromagnetic. The general objective of the vibration analysis is to analyze the signals to study the content. In this study, we will compare between three methods currently used by exploiting the experimental results to analyze the induction machines faults. The efficiency of each technique was discussed in order to reach a wise decision.	[Bessous, N.; Zouzou, S.

The detection of shaft cracks defect in gears may be considered as among the most complicated detection in the diagnosis of industrial machines. The objective is to combine vibration analysis and signal processing techniques to detect the crack shaft defect in the gearbox. For early detection and condition monitoring of shaft crack fault, the Hilbert-Transforms technique is used. In order to achieve this objective, a dynamic model of a simple stage gearbox (with and without defects) is proposed. The system consists of two parameters model, involving stiffness and damping, with torsional and lateral vibration and it has 6 degrees of freedom. The pinion's vibration displacement is analyzed using this new approach. The obtained results show the high sensitivity detection of gearbox's shaft damage.

The impact of using fault data only to train the system could solve the class imbalance problem in the machine learning approach. The data sets used for fault detection contain many independent variables, where the salient ones were selected using stepwise regression and applied to various machine learning techniques. A significant test for the given regression technique was used to validate the outcome. Machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and deep learning, are applied to the given data and the results reveal that the decision tree was able to obtain more than 95% accuracy and performed better than other algorithms when considering the tradeoff between the processing time and accuracy.

However, the high complexity, automation, and flexibility of an intelligent factory bring new challenges to reliability and safety. Industrial big data generated by multisource sensors, intercommunication within the system and external-related information, and so on, might provide new solutions for predictive maintenance to improve system reliability. This paper puts forth attributes of industrial big data processing and actively explores industrial big data processing-based predictive maintenance. A novel framework is proposed for structuring multisource heterogeneous information, characterizing structured data with consideration of the spatiotemporal property, and modeling invisible factors, which would make the production process transparent and eventually implement predictive maintenance on facilities and energy saving in the industry 4.0 era.

When it was put into practice, because of cycle truncation error, it can't gain satisfactory effect. The fault vibration signals of the gear were measured in this paper and a new arithmetic of time-field average was put forward which can settle the problem of cycle truncation error affect the result of averaging in substance, and then the outcomes was decomposed and redecomposed with wavelet. The result shows that during processing the fault signals of the gear the time-average method can eliminate the influence of the background noise and can acquire obvious efforts. The each signals which reflecting the circulation state of the gearbox is repeated with periodicity following the movement of gearbox, and the frequency is the multiple circumgyrate frequency of the machinery. But there is more noise disturbs in fact engineering application. In the frequency spectrum, the cycle components can be annihilated by background noise. So, how to improve the signal-to-noise of the signals is the basic question. The time-domain average is one in common use method; the cycle component which is interested is distilled from the complex cycle signal which is mixed with noise. The signals ponderance which is irrespective with the specified frequency, such as the gyro frequency of shaft axle, is removed. The noise and the cycle signals which is irrespective can remove. The cycle signal which is correlation with the specified frequency is distilled. The signal-to-noise of signals is enhanced with the time-domain average method. But in fact, the effection is unsatisfied because the cycle truncation error [1-2]. It is dissimilarity as the usual signals collection, in the paper, not only the analysis signal is collected, but also the timing pulse of rotor is collected. So the origination of each signal segments can be locked.

However, the accuracy and reliability of any AI-based machinery fault diagnosis is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of the input data fed to the AI model..The hypothesis of this paper is that AI-based fault diagnosis can be further improved by taking into account all the available sensor inputs of the machine. In short, the more sensor inputs fed into the AI model, the more accurate and reliable the outcome of the fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an application of Dempster Shafer (DS) evidence theory for sensor fusion to improve the accuracy of decision making in machinery fault diagnosis, by fusing all the available vibration signals measured on different axes and locations of the test machine. Vibration signals from different axes and locations of a machinery faults simulator were collected by multiple accelerometers simulating various machinery health conditions, " namely healthy, unbalance, misalignment and foundation looseness. The accuracy of fault diagnosis using a different number of sensor inputs was then investigated. Analysis results showed that by combining more sensor inputs using a DS-based algorithm can improve fault detection accuracy from an average of 63% to 83%. In conclusion, the multi-sensor fusion algorithm can be applied to increase the accuracy and reliability of AI-based fault diagnosis.

Vibration analysis is undertaken on the vibration signal of the gas turbine, to obtain an insight into the health condition of the blades before any decision is made on the operation of the machine. Statistical analysis is applied to study the characteristics of the highly unstable blade pass frequency (BPF) of the gas turbine and to establish the baseline data used for blade fault assessment and diagnosis. Based on the excessive increase observed on specific BPF amplitudes in comparison to the statistical baseline data, rubbing at the compressor blade is suspected. An immediate overhaul is therefore warranted, and the results from the inspection of the machine confirm the occurrence of severe rubbing at the compressor blades and labyrinth glands of the gas turbine. In conclusion, statistical analysis of BPF amplitude is found to be a viable tool for blade fault diagnosis in industrial gas turbines.

J	Chen, XW; Feng, ZP				Chen, Xiaowang; Feng, Zhipeng			Time-Frequency Analysis of Torsional Vibration Signals in Resonance Region for Planetary Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Under Variable Speed Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; nonstationary; planetary gearbox; resonance; torsional vibration	MACHINERY; TRANSFORM	Translational vibration-based methods have been widely used for machinery fault diagnosis. However, because of the unique gear configuration and complex kinetics, planetary gearbox translational vibration signals have complex modulation features due to gear faults and time-varying vibration transmission paths. This results in complex frequency components of translational vibrations, and adds difficulty to gear fault signature extraction. Under variable speed conditions, the resultant time-variant frequency components and complex sidebands may overlap in frequency domain, thus making it more difficult to pinpoint fault features. To address this issue, torsional vibration signals are exploited, because they are free from the extra modulation effect due to time-varying transmission paths and have simpler frequency contents. Gear faults generate impacts, thus exciting resonances and leading to modulations on resonances. Therefore, torsional resonance frequency band is concentrated to extract gear fault information. The time variant but symmetric sideband characteristics in the resonance region are derived based on the explicit time varying amplitude modulation and frequency modulation signal model. Resonance frequencies are identified under variable speed conditions by virtue of their independence on running conditions. Furthermore, time frequency analysis is utilized to extract time-variant gear fault frequencies. The proposed method is validated using both numerical simulation and lab experimental data. Localized faults of the sun, planet, and ring gears are diagnosed under variable speed conditions.

The main degradation modes of the PV modules are corrosion, discoloration, glass breaks, and cracks of cells. However, corrosion and discoloration remain the predominant degradation modes that still require further investigations. In this paper, a model-based PV corrosion prognostic approach, based on an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), is introduced to identify the PV corrosion parameters and then estimate the remaining useful life (RUL). Simulations have been conducted using measured data set, and results are reported to show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Due to the stochastic forecasting degradation, scenario reduction method has been developed to improve the efficiency of CBM. However, most existing scenario reduction methods focus mainly on the input performance of the forecasting degradation without considering the significant output performance characteristic based on the model. In order to warrant the CBM optimization precision while reducing stochastic degradation scenarios efficiently, a new scenario reduction method is formulated that the scenarios with same objective function values can be reduced to one representative scenario. As a result, the reduced scenarios by the proposed method can maintain the probability distributions of objective values, while keeping optimal thresholds close to that of initial scenarios. Finally, the method is applied to select the representative degradation scenarios for CBM optimization model by utilizing vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application. Compared to the traditional scenario reduction method, the proposed method further improves accuracy and reduction efficiency of CBM optimization.

An adaptive adjustment strategy is proposed based on vibrational mode decomposition, permutation entropy, and nuclear kernel extreme learning machine to determine the tunable parameter. First, the vibration signals are measured and then decomposed into different fault feature models based on variation mode decomposition. Then, fault feature of each model is formed to a high dimensional feature vector set based on permutation entropy. Second, the ELM output function is expressed by the inner product of Gauss kernel function to adaptively determine the number of hidden layer nodes. Finally, the high dimension feature vector set is used as the input to establish the kernel ELM rolling bearing fault classification model, and the classification and identification of different fault states of rolling bearings are carried out. In comparison with the fault classification methods based on support vector machine and ELM, the experimental results show that the proposed method has higher classification accuracy and better generalization ability.

However, during the grinding process, the centre bears the gravity of the roll and alternating stress. Therefore, wear or spalling faults are easily observed on the centre, which will lead to an anomalous vibration of the roll grinder. In this study, a resonance demodulation scheme is proposed to detect the centre wear fault of roll grinder. Firstly, fast kurtogram method is employed to help select the sub-band filter parameters for optimal resonance demodulation. Further, the envelope spectrum are derived based on the filtered signal. Finally, two health indicators are designed to conduct the fault diagnosis for centre wear fault. The proposed scheme is assessed by analysing experimental data from a roll grinder of twenty-high rolling mill.

FDG PET images of 509 subjects (149 AD patients, 150 healthy controls, and 210 MCI patients) and MRI image of 462 (126 AD patients, 126 health controls, and 210 MCI patients) were obtained from the database of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Laplace Eigenmaps of images for AD patients, MCI patients and normal controls were learned. A support vector machine was used to predict the prognosis of MCI according to eigenmaps. Simple integration of heterogeneous data was also investigated in the prediction. FDG-PET image alone for prediction achieved an accuracy of 66.35% with sensitivity being 66.67% and specificity being 64.52%. With MRI data, the sensitivity and thus accuracy were both higher while the specificity was much lower. Simple integration of these two modalities did not improve the prediction. This prognostic model for predicting MCI-to-dementia progression over a one-year period has the potential to improve clinical trial design, identify patients for early treatment, as well as guide clinical and patient decision-making.

They have a major impact on all the dependent equipments or machines and adversely affect their performance. The effect of fault on the efficiency helps in the early detection of the fault, even before the severeness of the fault has reached the level that enables relays to act. This paper analyses the impact of faults like voltage unbalance, broken rotor bar and air gap eccentricity, on efficiency of a three phase squirrel cage induction motor. These faults are simulated in MATLAB Simulink by mathematical modelling of Induction Motor and drop in efficiency is estimated.

Firstly, three common PV array faults are analyzed in detailed. And then, the ELM is proposed to automatically detect the faults of PV array. Moreover, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is exploited to optimize the parameters of RBF-ELM model. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out to verify the proposed SA-RBF-ELM and the result shows that the proposed SA-RBF-ELM approach can quickly and accurately identify the typical PV faults including short circuit, aging and partial shadow.

Thus the risk of machine unavailability is transferred from the customer towards the PSS provider. In order to minimize this risk the provider needs to reduce unscheduled downtimes to enhance machine availability. Hence proactive maintenance is an important success factor for providing this PSS type [2]. In practice, manufacturing equipment providers struggle to derive the required information for providing proactive maintenance from the existing data and thus potentials remain unused. One of the problems for many companies in this context is the missing knowhow for managing and analyzing this high amount of data. This issue is discussed in research and practice under the topic "Big Data" [3]. This paper focusses on discussing different approaches for data gathering, analysis and interpretation as well as associated challenges. Drivers and hindering factors are introduced and solution approaches are provided. These aspects are analyzed in a case study in collaboration with a material handling manufacturer which was conducted in one of the transfer projects of the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 29 which addressed the dynamic interdependencies of products and services in the production area.

For this purpose, healthy and faulty induction machine models are firstly established for different operating conditions during open loop control. The faulty model show the impact of inter-turn short-circuit on inductionmachine variables. Secondly, a high order sliding mode is synthesized to design decoupled current controller for inductionmachine and a closed loop inductionmachine dynamics are analyzed. The fault detection algorithm is combined actual inductionmachine behavior given by faulty model including fault occurrence and the behavior given by high order sliding mode observer to provide sensitive residuals, which exploited such fault indicators. This theoretical research prove that high order sliding mode approach have good capabilities to ensure both decoupled current control and inter-turn short-circuit fault detection.

Electromechanical Actuators Affected by Multiple Failures: Prognostic Method based on Spectral Analysis Techniques	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (ICAMCS)	JAN 27-29, 2017	Rome, ITALY					The proposal of prognostic algorithms able to identify precursors of incipient failures of primary flight command electromechanical actuators (EMA) is beneficial for the anticipation of the incoming failure: an early and correct interpretation of the failure degradation pattern, in fact, can trig an early alert of the maintenance crew, who can properly schedule the servomechanism replacement. An innovative prognostic model-based approach, able to recognize the EMA progressive degradations before his anomalous behaviors become critical, is proposed: the Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) of the considered incipient failures is performed analyzing proper system operational parameters, able to put in evidence the corresponding degradation path, by means of a numerical algorithm based on spectral analysis techniques. Subsequently, these operational parameters will be correlated with the actual EMA health condition by means of failure maps created by a reference monitoring model-based algorithm. In this work, the proposed method has been tested in case of EMA affected by combined progressive failures: in particular, partial stator single phase turn to turn short-circuit and rotor static eccentricity are considered. In order to evaluate the prognostic method, a numerical test-bench has been conceived. Results show that the method exhibit adequate robustness and a high degree of confidence in the ability to early identify an eventual malfunctioning, minimizing the risk of fake alarms or unannounced failures.

RS theory is used to analyze the stator current fault data of mine hoist machine in order to exclude uncertain, duplicate information. For getting the optimal decision table, the equivalence relationship of positive domains of between decision attributes and different condition attributes is analyzed in the decision tables to simplify condition attributes. The optimal decision table is as the SVM input samples to establish the SVM training model. And the mapping model which reflects the relation of the characteristics between condition attribute and decision attribute is obtained by SVM training model in order to realize the fault diagnosis of the mine hoist machine. The simulation results show that the fault diagnosis method based on RS and SVM ca accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Throughout the research, two different feature extraction techniques; Wavelet Packet Energy (WPE) and Time-domain Features (TDF) are employed in association with two state-of-art classifiers Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The database is prepared by the acquisition of wayside acoustic sensor data accompanied by optical gates that detect wheelset center position while multiple passing of a single metro train set of type 81-71M is in daily operation with the contribution of a novel approach; one period analysis. Acquired database is then divided into two classes which represent the healthy and faulty states of the wheelsets referring to the ground truth information of a faulty wheelset. Since the faulty states are insufficient to demonstrate the real classification performance, an adaptive synthetic sampling technique (ADASYN) is utilized to increase the number of faulty states. Promising results are observed up to 93 % in classification of faulty wheelsets of the metro with the proposed techniques on acoustic sensor data. This study may aid to maintenance specialists by providing a cost effective monitoring of faulty condition of metro wheelsets.

Rotating machines are one of the most important actuators in the industrial applications as well as in every day applications. Rolling element bearings are very critical components of rotating machines and the presence of defects in the bearing may lead to failure of machines. Hence, early identification of such defects along with the severity of damage under operating condition of the bearing may avoid malfunctioning and breakdown of machines. Defective bearings are source of vibration and these vibration signals can be used to assess the faulty bearings. This chapter presents the brief review of recent trends in research on bearing defects, sources of vibration and vibration measurement techniques in time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain. Detailed explanation of defect detection through scalar indicators in time domain.	[Gupta, Pankaj] Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol, Bhopal, India; [Pradhan, M.

J	Zhang, R; Tao, HY; Wu, LF; Guan, Y				Zhang, Ran; Tao, Hongyang; Wu, Lifeng; Guan, Yong			Transfer Learning With Neural Networks for Bearing Fault Diagnosis in Changing Working Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; transfer learning; neural networks; machine learning	DECOMPOSITION; MODEL	Traditional machine learning algorithms have made great achievements in data-driven fault diagnosis. However, they assume that all the data must be in the same working condition and have the same distribution and feature space. They are not applicable for real-world working conditions, which often change with time, so the data are hard to obtain. In order to utilize data in different working conditions to improve the performance, this paper presents a transfer learning approach for fault diagnosis with neural networks. First, it learns characteristics from massive source data and adjusts the parameters of neural networks accordingly. Second, the structure of neural networks alters for the change of data distribution. In the same time, some parameters are transferred from source task to target task. Finally, the new model is trained by a small amount of target data in another working condition. The Case Western Reserve University bearing data set is used to validate the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach. Experimental results show that the proposed transfer learning approach can improve the classification accuracy and reduce the training time comparing with the conventional neural network method when there are only a small amount of target data.

In this paper, a similarity-based difference analysis (SbDA) approach is proposed to estimate the RUL of GaAs-based semiconductor lasers. SbDA utilizes the inherent relation between historical samples and the on-site sample in which we calculate the inherent difference to acquire a more exact performance degradation value. This method can make adequate use of the limited historical data sets to more accurately estimate the lifetime of an operating GaAs laser. In addition, we present several significant results of studies of model parameters, such as random disturbance, weight distribution factor, and similarity.

Intelligent and effective algorithms are needed for analyzing the massive amount of unstructured data created within computing networks. This has motivated research on and development of information analytics like tools, solutions, and services for network security. Processing of the vast amount of monitoring data from agents and sensors in an intrusion detection system (IDS), updating a database with this data, combining this data with this rapidly growing database, and applying a decision support database for real-time responses require the use of technologies for processing unstructured big data in agents, sensors, and management servers. The best defense against intrusion is prevention. Forensic information about intrusion attack sources can be used for blacklisting corresponding network addresses and for reconfiguring network firewalls to prevent communication from these sources. An IDS should prevent malicious communication to a network. Anomaly-based intrusion detection identifies deviations from normal and typical user activity, communication patterns, application behavior, etc. Different users can have different profiles of normal activity. Normal behavior in a network must be learned from a training dataset or from monitoring communication and activity in a network. Anomaly identification can therefore detect also previously unknown intrusion attempt types. Forensic investigations after intrusion/intrusion attempts manage at least the same dataset that was processed before an intrusion response. By capturing, recording, and analyzing network events, the attack source can be found by using big data tools and real-time analysis techniques. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a targeted attack with a low profile during a long time. The purpose is to keep a target network unaware of the ongoing intrusion. APT attackers often use stolen user credentials and/or zero-day exploits to avoid triggering IDS responses. Big data analytics tools are particularly suitable for APT detection. To detect APT attacks, collection and correlation of large quantities of diverse data including internal data sources and external shared intelligence data is a necessity. Long-term historical correlation to incorporate a posteriori attack information in the history of a network must be performed. Network security analytics uses big data software technologies like Hadoop and Apache Mahout which extend the MapReduce programming model. MapReduce decomposes data into smaller pieces, which are processed on their own network hosts instead of being moved to other network nodes for processing. Hadoop can process stored big data but cannot process data streams. The open-source, distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant real-time processing system Storm and some commercial platforms can process big data streams. Apache Mahout, implemented on the top of Hadoop, is a machine learning software library. Taxonomies have been proposed for information analytics and for intrusion detection/response systems. Our proposed security analytics taxonomy includes descriptive analytics for identification of network security threats, diagnostic analytics for forensics, predictive analytics for proactive intrusion prevention, prescriptive analytics for protection against malware, firewalls, protected network communication, recovery after security incidents, and network security visualization.

Novel Approach for Multi Class Fault Diagnosis in Induction Machine Based on Statistical Time Features and Random Forest Classifier	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATERIALS, ALLOYS AND EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS (ICMAEM-2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Materials, Alloys and Experimental Mechanics (ICMAEM)	JUL 03-04, 2017	Narsimha Reddy Engn Coll, INDIA		Narsimha Reddy Engn Coll	Fault Detection; Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN); Random Forest Classifier (RF); Statistical Time Features	SIGNATURE ANALYSIS	Fault diagnosis and detection is the important area in health monitoring of electrical machines. This paper proposes the recently developed machine learning classifier for multi class fault diagnosis in induction machine. The classification is based on random forest (RF) algorithm. Initially, stator currents are acquired from the induction machine under various conditions. After preprocessing the currents, fourteen statistical time features are estimated for each phase of the current. These parameters are considered as inputs to the classifier. The main scope of the paper is to evaluate effectiveness of RF classifier for individual and mixed fault diagnosis in induction machine. The stator, rotor and mixed faults (stator and rotor faults) are classified using the proposed classifier. The obtained performance measures are compared with the multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) classifier. The results show the much better performance measures and more accurate than MLPNN classifier. For demonstration of planned fault diagnosis algorithm, experimentally obtained results are considered to build the classifier more practical.

J	Li, YL; Li, HR; Wang, B; Gu, HQ				Li, Yaolong; Li, Hongru; Wang, Bing; Gu, Hongqiang			Rolling Element Bearing Performance Degradation Assessment Using Variational Mode Decomposition and Gath-Geva Clustering Time Series Segmentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROTATING MACHINERY			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS	By focusing on the issue of rolling element bearing (REB) performance degradation assessment (PDA), a solution based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Gath-Geva clustering time series segmentation (GGCTSS) has been proposed. VMD is a new decomposition method. Since it is different from the recursive decomposition method, for example, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), local mean decomposition (LMD), and local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD), VMD needs a priori parameters. In this paper, we will propose a method to optimize the parameters in VMD, namely, the number of decomposition modes and moderate bandwidth constraint, based on genetic algorithm. Executing VMD with the acquired parameters, the BLIMFs are obtained. By taking the envelope of the BLIMFs, the sensitive BLIMFs are selected. And then we take the amplitude of the defect frequency (ADF) as a degradative feature. To get the performance degradation assessment, we are going to use the method called Gath-Geva clustering time series segmentation. Afterwards, the method is carried out by two pieces of run-to-failure data. The results indicate that the extracted feature could depict the process of degradation precisely.

J	Wang, HL; Xu, DX				Wang, Hailun; Xu, Daxing			Parameter Selection Method for Support Vector Regression Based on Adaptive Fusion of the Mixed Kernel Function	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							GRADIENT-DESCENT; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; KALMAN FILTER; MACHINES	Support vector regression algorithm is widely used in fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. A new model parameter selection method for support vector regression based on adaptive fusion of the mixed kernel function is proposed in this paper. We choose the mixed kernel function as the kernel function of support vector regression. The mixed kernel function of the fusion coefficients, kernel function parameters, and regression parameters are combined together as the parameters of the state vector. Thus, the model selection problem is transformed into a nonlinear system state estimation problem. We use a 5th-degree cubature Kalman filter to estimate the parameters. In this way, we realize the adaptive selection of mixed kernel function weighted coefficients and the kernel parameters, the regression parameters. Compared with a single kernel function, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) support vector regression algorithms, and genetic algorithms, the decision regression function obtained by the proposed method has better generalization ability and higher prediction accuracy.

J	Mei, F; Pan, Y; Zhu, KD; Zheng, JY				Mei Fei; Pan Yi; Zhu Kedong; Zheng Jianyong			On-line hybrid fault diagnosis method for high voltage circuit breaker	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; high voltage circuit breaker; kernel fuzzy C-means; kernel principal component analysis; support vector machine	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; ENERGY ENTROPY; SUPPORT; SYSTEM; MODEL; KPCA; SVM	As an important content of smart grid's intelligentialize, high voltage circuit breaker (HVCB) can enhance security and stability of power system observably. Therefore, on-line monitoring and fault diagnosis technologies develop significantly. In order to promote diagnosis accuracy and learning ability, an on-line hybrid method is proposed for fault diagnosis of HVCB in this paper, and characteristics of control coil current are used as modeling data. The diagnosis model built by this method includes three modules: fault detection, fault learning and fault recognition. Fault detection is used to inspect monitoring data and find the fault samples using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Fault learning is used to judge whether there is new knowledge which is built by kernel fuzzy C-means (KFCM), and the new knowledge can be brought into this diagnosis model to update the fault recognition module subsequently. Fault recognition is used to realize automatic categorizing of fault data to identify the fault type using multi-classification support vector machine (SVM). The diagnosis conclusion will be obtained finally. Perfect results in diagnosing typical failure of HVCB using the proposed method have been proved by data experiment.

There are ordinal structures between different fault levels, so how to utilize the potential ordinal information is especially important for fault level diagnosis. Fault level identification can be regarded as ordinal classification in the fields of machine learning and pattern recognition. This paper first proposes an ordinal rough set model by introducing ordinal rough approximation operators based on fuzzy covering, and then designs a feature selection algorithm for ordinal classification. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the gear crack level identification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for fault level identification.

J	Yunusa-Kaltungo, A; Sinha, JK				Yunusa-Kaltungo, Akilu; Sinha, Jyoti K.			Effective vibration-based condition monitoring (eVCM) of rotating machines	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Condition-based maintenance; eMaintenance; Data combination; Maintenance optimisation; Pattern classification; Rotating machines	E-MAINTENANCE; FAULTS DIAGNOSIS; DATA FUSION; RELIABILITY; SIGNALS; PROFITABILITY; TRISPECTRUM; PROGNOSTICS; BISPECTRUM; SPECTRA	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is mainly to highlight how a simplified and streamlined approach to the condition monitoring (CM) of industrial rotating machines through the application of frequency domain data combination can effectively enhance the eMaintenance framework. Design/methodology/approach - The paper commences by providing an overview to the relevance of maintenance excellence within manufacturing industries, with particular emphasis on the roles that rotating machines CM of rotating machines plays. It then proceeds to provide details of the eMaintenance as well as its possible alignment with the introduced concept of effective vibration-based condition monitoring (eVCM) of rotating machines. The subsequent sections of the paper respectively deal with explanations of data combination approaches, experimental setups used to generate vibration data and the theory of eVCM. Findings - This paper investigates how a simplified vibration-based rotating machinery faults classification method based on frequency domain data combination can increase the feasibility and practicality of eMaintenance. Research limitations/implications - The eVCM approach is based on classifying data acquired under several experimentally simulated conditions on two different machines using combined higher order signal processing parameters so as to reduce CMdata requirements. Although the current study was solely based on the application of vibration data acquired from rotating machines, the knowledge exchange platform that currently dominates present day scientific research makes it very likely that the lessons learned from the development of eVCM concept can be easily transferred to other scientific domains that involve continuous CM such as medicine. Practical implications - The concept of eMaintenance as a cost-effective and smart means of increasing the autonomy of maintenance activities within industries is rapidly growing in maintenance-related literatures. As viable as the concept appears, the achievement of its optimum objectives and full deployment to the industry is still subjective due to the complexity and data intensiveness of conventional CM practices. In this paper, an eVCM approach is proposed so that rotating machine faults can be effectively detected and classified without the need for repetitive analysis of measured data. Social implications - The main strength of eVCM lies in the fact that it permits the sharing of historical vibration data between identical rotating machines irrespective of their foundation structures and speed differences. Since eMaintenance is concerned with driving maintenance excellence, eVCM can potentially contribute towards its optimisation as it cost-effectively streamlines faults diagnosis. This therefore implies that the simplification of vibration-based CM of rotating machines positively impacts the society with regard to the possibility of reducing how much time is actually spent on the accurate detection and classification of faults. Originality/value - Although the currently existing body of literature already contains studies that have attempted to show how the combination of measured vibration data from several industrial machines can be used to establish a universal vibration-based faults diagnosis benchmark for incorporation into eMaintenance framework, these studies are limited in the scope of faults, severity and rotational speeds considered. In the current study, the concept of multi-faults, multi-sensor, multi-speed and multi-rotating machine data combination approach using frequency domain data fusion and principal components analysis is presented so that faults diagnosis features for identical rotating machines with different foundations can be shared between industrial plants. Hence, the value of the current study particularly lies in the fact that it significantly highlights a new dimension through which the practical implementation and operation of eMaintenance can be realized using big data management and data combination approaches.

While dozens ofmethods have been proposed for real-time bearing fault diagnosis and monitoring, the fault classification accuracy of existing algorithms is still not satisfactory. This work presents a novel algorithm fusion model based on principal component analysis and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. It combines the advantages of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network model and the decision treemodel. Experiments under three different spinning bearing speeds and two different crack sizes show that our fusion model has better performance and higher accuracy than either of the base classification models for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, which is achieved via synergic prediction from both types of models.

Combined with variationalmode decomposition (VMD) and principal component analysis (PCA), sensitive features of the rotating machinery fault were obtained and constituted the imbalanced fault sample set. Next, a fast clustering algorithm was adopted to reduce the number of the majority data from the imbalanced fault sample set. Consequently, the balanced fault sample set consisted of the clustered data and the minority data from the imbalanced fault sample set. After that, SVM was trained with the balanced fault sample set and tested with the imbalanced fault sample set so the fault diagnosis model of the rotating machinery could be obtained. Finally, the gearbox fault data set and the rolling bearing fault data set were adopted to test the fault diagnosis model. The experimental results showed that the fault diagnosis model could effectively diagnose the rotating machinery fault for imbalanced data.

J	Xu, ZF; Zhang, HY; Liu, JJ; Hou, HP				Xu, Zhuofei; Zhang, Haiyan; Liu, Jinjin; Hou, Heping			A Research on Maximum Symbolic Entropy from Intrinsic Mode Function and Its Application in Fault Diagnosis	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; EMD; DECOMPOSITION	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a self-adaptive analysis method for nonlinear and nonstationary signals. It has been widely applied to machinery fault diagnosis and structural damage detection. A novel feature, maximum symbolic entropy of intrinsic mode function based on EMD, is proposed to enhance the ability of recognition of EMD in this paper. First, a signal is decomposed into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal, and then IMFs are transformed into a serious of symbolic sequence with different parameters. Second, it can be found that the entropies of symbolic IMFs are quite different. However, there is always a maximum value for a certain symbolic IMF. Third, take the maximum symbolic entropy as features to describe IMFs from a signal. Finally, the proposed features are applied to evaluate the effect of maximum symbolic entropy in fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, and then the maximum symbolic entropy is compared with other standard time analysis features in a contrast experiment.

Often times, this root cause analysis is ad-hoc with no standard representation for artifacts or terminology (i.e., no standard representation for terms used in techniques such as fishbone diagrams, 5 why's, etc.). Once a problem is diagnosed and alleviated, the results are discarded or stored locally as paper/digital text documents. When the same or similar problem reoccurs with different employees or in a different factory, the whole process has to be repeated without taking advantage of knowledge gained from previous problem(s) and corresponding solution(s). When discussing the diagnosis, personnel may miscommunicate over terms used in the root cause analysis leading to wasted time and errors. This paper presents a framework for a knowledge-based manufacturing diagnosis system that aims to alleviate these miscommunications. By learning from diagnosis methods used in manufacturing and in the medical community, this paper proposes a framework which integrates and formalizes root cause analysis by categorizing faults and failures that span multiple organizational levels. The proposed framework aims to enable manufacturing operations by leveraging machine learning and semantic technologies for the manufacturing system diagnosis. A use case for the manufacture of a bottle opener demonstrates the framework.

The proposed approach has the advantage of predicting the RUL and detecting the degradation states simultaneously. As the observation space is discretized into N segments corresponding to N hidden states, the explicit relationship between actual degradation paths and the hidden states can be depicted. The continuous observations are fitted by Gaussian, Gamma and Lognormal distribution, respectively. To select a more suitable distribution, model validation metrics are employed for evaluating the goodness-of-fit of the available models to the observed data. The unknown parameters of the SHMM can be estimated by the maximum likelihood method with the complete data. Then a recursive method is used for RUL estimation. Finally, an illustrate case is analyzed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The result also suggests that SHMM with observation probability distribution which is closer to the real data behavior may be more suitable for the prediction of RUL.

An adaptive filtering technique is applied to separate the impulsive components from the periodic components of the vibration signals. Then different features of the periodic components and impulsive components are extracted. An extreme learning machine based classifier is designed and trained by using the features extracted from simulated vibration data of wind turbine gearbox. Simulated vibration signals of wind turbines gearbox are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methodology.

Recent accuracy improvements have greatly enhanced automotive and aerospace manufacturing capabilities, including high-precision assembly, two-sided drilling and fastening, material removal, automated fiber placement, and in process inspection. The accuracy requirement of those applications is primarily a function of two main criteria: (1) The pose accuracy (position and orientation accuracy) of a robot system's tool center position (TCP), and (2) the ability of a robot system's TCP to remain in position or on-path when loads are applied. The degradation of a robot system's tool center accuracy can lead to a decrease in manufacturing quality and production efficiency. Given the high output rate of production lines, it is critical to develop technologies to verify and validate robot systems' health assessment techniques, particularly the accuracy degradation. In this paper, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NEST) effort to develop the measurement science to support the monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics (collectively known as prognostics and health management (PHM)) of robot accuracy degradation is presented.

The execution of these manufacturing operations require the integration of layers of hardware and software. The integration of monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies (collectively known as prognostics and health management (PHM)) can aid manufacturers in maintaining the performance of machine tools and robot systems by providing intelligence to enhance maintenance and control strategies. PHM can improve asset availability, product quality, and overall productivity. It is unlikely that a manufacturer has the capability to implement PHM in every element of their system. This limitation makes it imperative that the manufacturer understand the complexity of their system. For example, a typical robot systems include a robot, end-effector(s), and any equipment, devices, or sensors required for the robot to perform its task. Each of these elements is bound, both physically and functionally, to one another and thereby holds a measure of influence. This paper focuses on research to decompose a work cell into a hierarchical structure to understand the physical and functional relationships among the system's critical elements. These relationships will be leveraged to identify areas of risk, which would drive a manufacturer to implement PHM within specific areas.

Model-based or physics-based prognostics develops mathematical models based on physical laws or probability distributions, while an in-depth physical understanding of system behaviors is required. In practice, however, some of the distributional assumptions do not hold true. To overcome the limitations of model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While earlier work demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven approaches, most of these methods applied to prognostics and health management (PHM) in manufacturing are based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to explore the ability of random forests (RFs) to predict tool wear in milling operations. The performance of ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental dataset. The experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than ANNs and SVR in this experiment.

Numerical simulation and diagnostic tools are essential for cycle optimization of mGT and prediction of performance degradation. This work is focused on fault diagnostics of T100 mGT through the application of AE-T100 model, a simulation tool, which has been developed within a collaboration between the University of Genoa (Unige) and Ansaldo Energia. This model has been developed for steady-state simulation of mGT in off design conditions. Leveraging on previous efforts for model development, tuning, first phase of validation through Ansaldo Enegia test rig (AE-T100) and diagnostic application of the model, the present work deals with further utilization of the diagnostic capability of the model for mGT cycles. For this purpose, it was used in real operating conditions through the AE-T100 test rig for the diagnostic aim of some unexpected machine behavior. The model results indicated high deviation from the actual field data in terms of fuel flow and efficiency, and so justified the diagnostic capability of the AE-T100 tool. Afterwards, based on the experimental observation of some bypass leakage from the burner in the same test rig, AE-T100 model was applied to model such leakage through the variation of AS ratio, leakage from the recuperator outlet to the ambient, combustor pressure drop and turbine section modification, and carried out the sensitivity analysis of these parameters. Sensitivity analysis has verified that the accurate impact of this leakage on overall mGT performance cannot be modeled with the help of AE-T100 tool in its current capacity. Therefore, some other investigations like analysis of compressor maps must be carried out to explain such a performance deviation in case of leakage. Afterwards, the analysis of compressor maps resulted from the operating conditions of the test conducted on the same machine after leakage repair, has highlighted the change in compressor operating point and thus, more efficient compressor functioning, which results in higher net power. Hence, this analysis has provided a more comprehensible explanation of this leakage impact on the mGT performance.

Learning algorithms have pushed traditional engine health management into the realm of prognostic health management. This paper starts with a review of several common computational methods used to monitor the condition of gas turbines currently employed by both industry and academia. Sources of application of machine learning algorithms from outside the gas turbine industry are also brought in. Focus is generally placed on industrial gas turbines with an industry standard monitoring system. The authors explore beyond gas path analysis with a novel use of machine learning algorithms to engine component classification.

To achieve this target, manufacturers start taking on the responsibilities of engine condition monitoring, by embedding health monitoring systems within each engine unit and prompting maintenance actions when necessary. Several types of condition monitoring are used including oil debris monitoring, temperature monitoring and vibration monitoring. Among them, vibration monitoring is the most widely used technique. Machine vibro-acoustic signatures contain pivotal information about its state of health. The current work focuses on one part of the diagnosis stage of condition monitoring for engine bearing health monitoring as bearings are critical components in rotating machinery. A plethora of signal processing tools and methods applied at the time domain, the frequency domain, the time-frequency domain and the time scale domain have been presented in order to extract valuable information by proposing different diagnostic features. Among others, an emerging interest has been reported on modeling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary, which is a particular class of non-stationary stochastic processes. A process x(t) is said to be nth-order cyclostationary with period T if its nth-order moments exist and are periodic with period T. Several tools, such as the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) and the Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (CMS) can be used in order to extract interesting information concerning the cyclic behavior of cyclostationary signals. In order to measure the cyclostationarity from order 1 to 4, concise and global indicators have been proposed. However, in a number of applications such as aircraft engines and wind turbines the characteristic vibroacoustic signatures of rotating machinery depend on the operating conditions of the rotational speed and/or the load. During the last decades fault diagnostics of rotating machinery under variable speed/load has attracted a lot of interest. The classical cyclostationary tools can be used under the assumption that the speed of machinery is constant or nearly constant, otherwise the vibroacoustic signal becomes cyclo-non-stationary. In order to overcome this limitation a generalization of both SCD and CMS functions have been proposed displaying cyclic Order versus Frequency. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel approach for the analysis of cyclo-nonstationary signals based on the generalization of indicators of cyclostationarity in order to cover the speed varying conditions. The proposed indicators of cyclo-non-stationarity (ICNS) are expected to summarize the information at various statistical orders and at lower computational cost compared to the Order-Frequency SCD or CMS. This generalization is realized by introducing a new speed-dependent angle averaging operator. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated on an acceleration signal captured on the casing of an aircraft engine gearbox, provided by SAFRAN, in the frames of SAFRAN contest which took place at the Surveillance 8 International Conference.

Dynamic reliability assessment and prognostics with monitored data for multiple dependent degradation components	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde			MAINTENANCE; DIAGNOSTICS; FRAMEWORK	The traditional risk assessment and prognostics take into account data from a population of similar equipment, and, thus, the derived models give always a somewhat average performance of an equipment, not capturing the specific behavior of the individual equipment of interest. By taking into account the monitored data on the individual equipment, the risk assessment and prognostics can be made dynamic and the results improved. In this paper, we consider the dynamic risk assessment and prognostics of multiple, dependent, degrading components. As practical reference, the system considered is composed of two dependent components: a pump, whose degradation is modelled by a multi-state piecewise deterministic Markov process and a valve, whose continuous degradation process is described by a physical model. The monitored data are supposed to be noisy. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that the continuous degradation process, dependencies among components and observation noise are considered in a dynamic risk assessment and prognostics framework. The results on a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Prognostics techniques enable the implementation of these strategies through up-to-date remaining useful life estimations. However, a cost-benefit assessment is necessary to verify the scale of potential benefits of condition-based maintenance strategies and prognostics for a given application. The majority of prognostics applications focus on the evaluation of a specific failure mode of an asset. However, industrial systems are comprised of different assets with multiple failure modes, which in turn, work in cooperation to perform a system level function. Besides, these systems include time-dependent events and conditional triggering events which cause further effects on the system. In this context not only are the system-level prognostics predictions challenging, but also the cost-benefit analysis of condition-based maintenance policies. In this work we combine asset prognostics predictions with temporal logic so as to obtain an up-to-date system level health estimation. We use asset level and system level prognostics estimations to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative maintenance policies. The application of the proposed approach enables the adoption of conscious trade-off decisions between alternative maintenance strategies for complex systems. The benefits of the proposed approach are discussed with a case study from the power industry.

In order to detect incipient failures due to a progressive wear of a primary flight command EMA, prognostics could employ several approaches; the choice of the best ones is driven by the efficacy shown in failure detection, since not all the algorithms might be useful for the proposed purpose. In other words, some of them could be suitable only for certain applicationswhile they could not give useful results for others. Developing a prognostic algorithm able to identify the precursors of the above mentioned EMAs faults and their degradation pattern is thus beneficial for anticipating the incoming failure and alerting the maintenance crew such to properly schedule the servomechanism replacement. The goal of this paper is to propose an innovative model-based fault detection and identification (FDI) method, based on Simulated Annealing (SA) Algorithms, investigating its ability to timely identify symptoms alerting that an EMA component is degrading and will eventually exhibit an anomalous behavior. In particular, this work is focused on the analysis of progressive faults typically affecting the electrical components of the EMAs (e.g. electronic control, BLDC motor windings) and proposes a robust algorithm able to deal multiple faults. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed FDI technique, an appropriate simulation test environment was developed: two MATLAB Simulink models representing the real EMA and the corresponding monitor have been respectively used to simulate progressive failures and to evaluate the accuracy of this prognostic algorithm. The results showed an adequate robustness of the FDI technique and a satisfying confidence was gained about its ability to early identify an eventual EMA malfunctioning with low risk of false alarms or missed failures. This paper aims to be a starting point to future works based on this method for PHM applications.	[Vedova, Matteo D. L.

An intelligent fault diagnosis system on ship machinery systems based on support vector machine principles	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde				This study proposes an intelligent system to perform fault diagnosis actions in ship machinery systems. Considering the cost limitations, the main goal is to optimize the machinery system availability. The model takes the advantage of a classification tool based on support vector machines principles. Statistical assumptions are also considered for validity of the analysis. The test and statistical demonstration phases are also supported with the data, gathered from the specifically created operational scenarios in ship engine room simulator. The results of the study can be adopted to conceptualize a continuous monitoring tool on ship system reliability. Furthermore, real case application potential of the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis system is comprehensively discussed.

C	Moedden, H		Walls, L; Revie, M; Bedford, T		Moedden, Heinrich			Probabilities in safety of machinery-risk reduction effects by combination of full enclosure and fault detection in the process	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde				The issues risk assessment and tolerable risk are causing conflicting reactions not only among Health and Safety experts. Experienced designers are sometimes unsettled, too. The controversies are mainly about numerical probabilistic representations. These were recently introduced in the field of general machinery safety. The probabilistic methods encounter a well-proven practical state-of-the-art, which is merely based on qualitatively defined requirements. From this non-quantitative descriptive background, the advantage of the probabilistic theory is clearly visible: the entire risk reduction process can be detailed in single quantitative factors showing the proportions to enable a more effective engineering. Surprisingly, the key term "probability" turned out to be ambiguous. It is obvious that verifiably founded probabilities, such as e.g. real findings in the operational field and logically deduced probability estimations are better than not scalable subjective gut feeling, speculation and pure hypothetical assumption. That is to say, objective probabilities are always more reliable than subjective probabilities. It is hard to believe, but for the time being, the normative frame for machinery safety does not contain a numerical risk model, which summarizes the single factors plausibly to an overall risk, in order to e.g. compare theoretical results with empirical field data. As a consequence, fictitious hazards and the actual risks are being mashed up again and again, so that in controversial discussions in the world of safety standardi-zation (ISO 12100, ISO 13849-1 etc.), mostly the strongest gut feeling overtrumps logical considerations. As regards the high safety level of German machine tools, it is frustrating that the "secret of our success" in reducing accident data still cannot be explained plausibly on the background of existing safety standards: it is the massive risk reduction effects due to the combination of a) moveable and fixed guards of the full machine enclosure, and b) the implicit and explicit fault detection in the process. It brings about a kind of "systematic safety integrity" on the machine level, on the background of very high availabilities (which is equivalent to high inherent safety). It can only be incorporated in the risk parameter "O" (reducing the occurrence probability of a hazard). Unfortunately, the recently amended functional safety standard ISO 13849-1 does not at all provide a consideration of this very important risk reduction principle, despite it has a long and successful history in standardization and in the operational practice of automatic production. And it even is a key element of the proven-in-use findings, which VDW presented at the ESREL symposiums every year since 2013. And in 2016, another paper of IMA and VDW is going to illustrate the most recent empirical results out of a two decades long data base.

Data driven RUL estimation of rolling stock using intelligent functional test	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Annual International Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc	Univ Strathclyde		PROGNOSTICS; MODELS	The rolling stock health condition is important for both passenger and freight trains in terms of safety, availability, punctuality and efficiency. Various inspection and maintenance methodologies are performed on rolling stock equipment to fulfill the above performance measures. This paper suggests a new approach, namely, intelligent functional test (IFTest) to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the equipment, subsystems and systems of rolling stock dynamically by data driven methods. IFTest generates a baseline of the current operational abilities in contrast to the required abilities. The test integrates the historical and new set of data to track the trend of degradation of equipment. With this approach, the operation and maintenance personnel have ample time to make decisions for the maintenance and failure consequences. In addition, it is supposed that by using such data we are achieving a more accurate result for the estimation of reliability and RUL of critical rolling stock equipment.	[Garmabaki, A. H.

Two data-driven prognostics models are considered, an Homogeneous Discrete-Time Finite-State Semi-Markov Model (HDTFSSMM) and a Fuzzy Similarity-Based (FSB) model. The predictions from the two models are ensembled with a switching approach that selects the most accurate model at each stage of the equipment life to guarantee the best performance throughout the degradation progression. Areal case study isworked out, regarding a fleet of aluminum electrolytic capacitors used in electric vehicles powertrains. In this specific case, the HDTFSSMM is selected at the early stages of the equipment degradation and the FSB model at the last stages of life. Results are compared with those achieved by each individual model, showing that the proposed ensemble approach is able to provide more accurate RUL predictions throughout the entire equipment life.

In largely interconnected systems, not only the individual performance of one channel, but also its interaction with other components, must be considered. In this conceptual paper, we outline a newmaintenance concept for the detection of software faults in control systems. The concept includes two approaches, morning gymnastics test and envelope analysis. The morning gymnastics test generates data for a baseline of the current operational abilities in contrast to the specified abilities and should be applied when feasible in continuous production systems. The test integrates historical and new sets of data to track degradation trends. Envelope analysis can be performed to detect operational anomalies and is based on subsequent deep analysis to distinguish software and hardware faults from each other. By using the envelope analysis it is possible to identify failures and disturbances affecting the control system.

Reliability analysis of product fleets based on operating data: Separation of risky fleet parts and partial risk prognosis	RISK, RELIABILITY AND SAFETY: INNOVATING THEORY AND PRACTICE			English	Proceedings Paper	26th Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 25-29, 2016	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, UK Safety & Reliabil Soc, Univ Strathclyde				The increasing complexity of product functionality and manufacturing process parameters often leads to complex failure modes and reliability problems within the product life cycle. Especially in the case of mass production of consumer goods - e.g. automobiles, washing machines, personal computers - an increasing percentage of damaged products within the product fleet can lead to garage or recall actions. If the manufacturer receives knowledge about the first damage claims based on a field observation, a risk probability prognosis is the base of operations regarding further actions. This paper outlines an approach to determine the risk probability in product fleets based on a combined multi-variate analysis of the product failure behaviour and the customer product usage profile. It shows a possibility to implement different lifespan variables into one risk prognosis. Using a multivariate cluster analysis gives high detailed information about the fleet, the failure mode and the field actions based on the results of the risk prognosis than the classical way. Additionally the influence of using different multivariate cluster analysis methods regarding to the risk prognosis will be shown and compared. This paper demonstrates the theoretical background and describes the application of this approach. Additionally the primary focus of this paper is on the comparison of the result using different clustering methods and the impact on the risk prognosis after clustering. The paper shows only a little extraction of a bigger case study to give an impression of the requirements choosing the right cluster criteria. The demonstrated case study is based on a synthetic field data set from the automotive industry and includes e.g. field operating times, kilometrage and switching cycles on the car and component level.

J	Wu, B; Li, W; Qiu, MQ				Wu, Bo; Li, Wei; Qiu, Ming-Quan			Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearing with Vibration Signals Based on a Novel Indicator	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT; RESIDUAL LIFE; PROGNOSTICS; CLASSIFICATION	Aiming at reducing the production downtime and maintenance cost, prognostics and health management (PHM) of rotating machinery often includes the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of bearings. In this paper, a method combining the generalized Weibull failure rate function (WFRF) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network is developed to deal with the RUL prediction of bearings. A novel indicator, namely, the power value on the sensitive frequency band (SFB), is proposed to track bearing degradation process. Generalized WFRF is used to fit the degradation indicator series to reduce the effect of noise and avoid areas of fluctuation in the time domain. RBF neural network is employed to predict the RUL of bearings with times and fitted power values at present and previous inspections as input. Meanwhile, the life percentage is selected as output. The performance of the proposed method is validated by an accelerated bearing run-to-failure experiment, and the results demonstrate the advantage of this method in achieving more accurate RUL prediction.

Clinicians and health authorities for many years have expressed interest in identifying individuals at increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Our main objective is to develop a prognostic workflow of CHD in T2D patients using a Holter dataset.. This workflow development will be based on machine learning techniques by testing a variety of classifiers and subsequent selection of the best performing system. It will also assess the impact of feature selection and bootstrapping techniques over these systems. Among a variety of classifiers such as Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT), Random Tree (RT) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), the best performing classifier is NB. We achieved an area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 68,06% and 74,33% for a prognosis of 3 and 4 years, respectively.

J	Cho, MY; Hoang, TT				Cho, Ming Yuan; Hoang, Thi Thom			A Differential Particle Swarm Optimization-based Support Vector Machine Classifier for Fault Diagnosis in Power Distribution Systems	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; particle swarm optimization; power distribution lines; reflectometry; support vector machines	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOCATION; ALGORITHM; WAVELETS; SPACE	This paper proposes a new differential particle swarm optimization (DPSO) method for obtaining optimum support vector machine (SVM) parameters used for electrical fault diagnosis in radial distribution systems. Further, a multiple-stage DPSO-SVM classifier is developed to enhance classification accuracy in the fault diagnosis. Also, time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method with pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) excitation is utilized for generating the dataset required for validating this proposed approach. According to the characteristic of echo responses found in different types of faults, 12 features are extracted as input vectors for purposes of classification. The proposed fault diagnosis approach is tested on a typical radial distribution system to classify ten types of short-circuit faults accurately. Further, to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DPSO algorithm, comparative studies of fault diagnosis are performed using SVM having parameters selected using cross-validation, GA and PSO. The overall classification accuracy obtained for fault diagnosis is 98.5%, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	Yang, FY; Jin, S; Li, ZM				Yang, Fuyong; Jin, Sun; Li, Zhimin			A modification of DMVs based state space model of variation propagation for multistage machining processes	ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION			English	Article						Differential motion vectors; Multistage machining processes; Six independent datum features; Variation propagation	DIMENSIONAL VARIATION PROPAGATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ROBUST-CONTROL; MEAN SHIFTS; STREAM; SYSTEMS; WORKPIECES	Purpose - Complicated workpiece, such as an engine block, has special rough locating datum features (i.e. six independent datum features) due to its complex structure. This locating datum error cannot be handled by current variation propagation model based on differential motion vectors. To extend variation prediction fields, this paper aims to solve the unaddressed variation sources to modify current model for multistage machining processes. Design/methodology/approach - To overcome the limitation of current variation propagation model based on differential motion vectors caused by the unaddressed variation sources, this paper will extend the current model by handling the unaddressed datum-induced variation and its corresponding fixture variation. Findings - The measurement results of the rear face with respect to the rough datum W and the pan face with respect to the hole Q by coordinate measuring machine (CMM) are -0.006 mm and 0.031 mm. The variation results for rear face and pan face predicted by the modified model are -0.009 mm and 0.025 mm, respectively. The discrepancy of model prediction and measurement is very small. Originality/value - This paper modifies the variation propagation model based on differential motion vectors by solving the unaddressed variation sources, which can extend the variation prediction fields for some complicated workpiece and is useful in the future work for many fields, such as process monitoring, fault diagnosis, quality-assured setup planning and process-oriented tolerancing.

Findings - Although the achieved prediction results were acceptable, there is need for more work to apply and test these results in real environment.

Faults in gears result in loss of energy and money. The monitoring and fault diagnosis are done by analysis of the acoustic and vibrational signals which are generally considered to be unwanted by products. This study proposes the usage of machine learning algorithm for condition monitoring of a helical gearbox by using the sound signals produced by the gearbox. Artificial faults were created and subsequently signals were captured by a microphone. An extensive study using different wavelet transformations for feature extraction from the acoustic signals was done, followed by waveletselection and feature selection using J48 decision tree and feature classification was performed using K star algorithm.

J	Xu, XY; Hua, QS				Xu, Xiaoya; Hua, Qingsong			Industrial Big Data Analysis in Smart Factory: Current Status and Research Strategies	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Industrial big data; smart factory; data analysis; cyber-physical systems	MANUFACTURING SYSTEM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; FRAMEWORK; MACHINES; NETWORKS; MODELS	Under the background of cyber-physical systems and Industry 4.0, intelligent manufacturing has become an orientation and produced a revolutionary change. Compared with the traditional manufacturing environments, the intelligent manufacturing has the characteristics as highly correlated, deep integration, dynamic integration, and huge volume of data. Accordingly, it still faces various challenges. In this paper, we summarize and analyze the current research status in both domestic and aboard, including industrial big data collection, modeling of the intelligent product lines based on ontology, the predictive diagnosis based on industrial big data, group learning of product line equipment and the product line reconfiguration of intelligent manufacturing. Based on the research status and the problems, we propose the research strategies, including acquisition schemes of industrial big data under the environment of intelligent, ontology modeling and deduction method based intelligent product lines, predictive diagnostic methods on production lines based on deep neural network, deep learning among devices based on cloud supplements and 3-D selforganized reconfiguration mechanism based on the supplements of cloud. In our view, this paper will accelerate the implementation of smart factory.

J	Abdellatif, S; Tahar, S; Boubakeur, Z				Abdellatif, Seghiour; Tahar, Seghier; Boubakeur, Zegnini			Dynamic Analysis of the Simultaneous Mixed Eccentricity and Broken Rotor Bars in Induction Machine Based on Magnetic Field Diagnosis	RECENT ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Air-gap magnetic flux density spectrum; eccentricity fault; fault detection and diagnosis; finite element method; induction machine; rotor bar fault	FAULT-DETECTION; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; MOTORS	Background: Several approaches have been proposed for monitoring and diagnosis of the induction machine. Although, most of them focus on a single fault, but in a real rotator machine, two or more defects can be present simultaneously. Furthermore, one faulty condition could impair the detection of a differing fault and a wrong decision about the operational status of the machine. Method: In addition, there are several types of rotor faults as broken rotor bars and eccentricities. Different types of eccentricities (static, dynamic and mixed) at different degrees were studied in the presence of the broken rotor bars. Eccentricities of both the natures usually exist together due to necessary tolerances in the manufacturing process. This study sets out to examine the faults possibilities which can occur in the machine using the finite element method. The air-gap magnetic flux density is used to investigate rotor faults. At first, the isolated fault such as broken rotor bars, static and dynamic eccentricities are analysed. Then, combined faults (mixed eccentricity) and multiple-combined faults (both mixed eccentricity and the broken rotor bars) are treated. The finite elements method is used to create these faults. Result: These faults are monitored by internal magnetic field signature, which is used for examining the effect of the increases of static eccentricity in dynamic eccentricity and vice versa. Furthermore, the same value of ME with different rates of static and dynamic is analysed. Conclusion: The multiple-combined faults are investigated considering the effect of broken rotor bars in mixed eccentricity.

Proposed method allows performing data-driven reduction of the deterministic, high energy, and low frequency components. Furthermore, it provides a way to enhance signal of interest. Procedure incorporates application of the time- frequency decomposition, alpha-stable distribution based signal modeling, and stability parameter in the time domain as a stoppage criterion for iterative part of the procedure. An advantage of the proposed algorithmis data-driven, automative detection of the informative frequency band as well as band with high energy due to the properties of the used distribution. Furthermore, there is no need to have knowledge regarding kinematics, speed, and so on. The proposed algorithmis applied towards real data acquired from the belt conveyor pulley drive's gearbox.

The majority of machine learning methods for event detection require the labeled data sets or examples of previous events. However, the recorded event data happen in different locations, time and system conditions. Therefore, they are not aligned time-series which introduce more challenges for feature selection and signal processing. To perform better feature selection for time-series measurements, shape-based methods along with time alignment (also called registration) are needed. This paper presents the Fisher-Rao Registration Method (FRMM) as a solution for the alignment of different time signals. Amplitude and phase components resulting from the Fisher-Rao registration method provide a means for implementing a hierarchical clustering analysis classifying different fault events by type. The algorithm was tested with the IEEE 13-nodes test feeder simulated in RSCAD environment with over 1500 different fault events presenting an average prediction rate of 98%.

Hence, lithium-ion battery capacity prognostic is significantly important, and it is yet very hard for the measured battery data that are regularly polluted by miscellaneous noises. In this paper, a battery capacity prognostic approach using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) denoising method and multiple kernel relevance vector machine (MKRVM) approach is presented. The EMD denoising method is employed to process the measured capacity data to produce noise-free capacity data. The battery capacity prediction model using MKRVM is constructed based on the denoised capacity data. The MKRVM's kernel keeps diversity by using multiple heterogeneous kernel learning method. Meanwhile, sparse weights of basic kernel functions are yielded by using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The measured battery capacity data are used to demonstrate the effect of EMD denoising method, and battery capacity prediction experiments reveal that the proposed MKRVM approach can predict the battery's future capacity precisely.

While it is true that time-based maintenance dominates the industry today, it is believed that condition monitoring could yield promising results with a better compromise on cost over effectiveness in the long run. The aim of condition-based monitoring in aeronautics is, based on the available system data (e.g., flight, event and maintenance data), to evaluate the current health state of an aircraft component and to estimate its remaining useful life. Several approaches have been studied in condition-based maintenance with the most promising being data-driven modeling. This paper proposes a comparison of a set of data-driven modeling techniques to perform prognostics on a critical component of the jet engine bleed system. The novelty of our work is twofold. First, we perform this comparative study on a real case study of a critical valve of the aircraft bleed system. Fielded data from different data sources are used in the models. To our knowledge, this is the first case study that merges data from the computer central maintenance system (fault messages), maintenance data, and flight data on a prognostics system. Second, a variety of data-driven techniques are compared from neural nets to regression support machines. The models are compared using the standard metrics of absolute, mean, and squared errors. A regressive accuracy curve is also used to compare the models along different prediction window sizes. The results show the best model comprised information from all data sources. The data that most contributed to the performance improvement was the maintenance, flight and fault data, in this order. This result comes to reinforce the notion that it is more difficult to extract quantitative information from fault events than flight data with data-driven regressive methods.

C	Maity, NG; Das, S			IEEE	Maity, Niharika G.; Das, Sreerupa			Machine Learning for Improved Diagnosis and Prognosis in Healthcare	2017 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2017	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, PHM Soc, AESS, Cornell Tech Serv, Adv Cloud Comp, Sierra Navada Corp, STAR Dundee, AEROSPACE				Machine learning has gained tremendous interest in the last decade fueled by cheaper computing power and inexpensive memory - making it efficient to store, process and analyze growing volumes of data. Enhanced algorithms are being designed and applied on large datasets to help discover hidden insights and correlations amongst data elements not obvious to human. These insights help businesses take better decisions and optimize key indicators of interest. The growing popularity of machine learning also stems from the fact that learning algorithms are agnostic to the domain of application. Classification algorithms, for example, that could be applied to categorize faults in windmill blades can also be used for categorizing TV viewers in a survey. The actual value of machine learning however depends on the ability to adapt and apply these algorithms to solve specific real world problems. In this paper we discuss two such applications for interpreting medical data for automated analysis. Our first case study demonstrates the use of Bayesian Inference, a paradigm of machine learning, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on cognitive test results and demographic data. In the second case study we focus on automated classification of cell images to determine the advancement and severity of breast cancer using artificial neural networks. Although these research are still preliminary, they demonstrate the value of machine learning techniques in providing quick, efficient and automated data analysis. Machine learning offers hope with early diagnosis of diseases, help patients in making informed decisions on treatment options and can help in improving overall quality of their lives.

Hence, early identification of such defects along with the severity of damage under operating condition of the bearing may avoid malfunctioning and breakdown of machines. Defective bearings are source of vibration and these vibration signals can be used to assess the faulty bearings. This article presents the brief review of recent trends in research on bearing defects, sources of vibration and vibration measurement techniques in time domain, frequency domain and time frequency domain.

Detection of Winding Faults in Wound Rotor Induction Motor Using Loci of Direct and Quadrature Axes of Rotor Currents	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						wound rotor induction motor; winding fault; rotor currents	PARKS VECTOR APPROACH; INTER-TURN INSULATION; SHORT-CIRCUIT; BEARING WEAR; STATOR; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; MACHINES	In this paper, loci of direct and quadrature axis of rotor currents are used for online detection of winding fault on stator side as well as rotor side in three-phase wound rotor induction motor. The proposed technique is used for detecting load on induction motor and open circuit fault condition on stator side as well as rotor side. Detection of winding fault is affected by unbalanced supply voltage. In order to overcome this problem, FFT of modulus of direct and quadrature axis is used. The experimental results of rotor current analysis are validated with stator current analysis. Research works reported in the literature are based on stator currents analysis. The proposed technique of detecting winding faults and distinguishing between stator winding faults and unbalanced supply voltage using rotor current is not reported in the literature.

Study on fault diagnosis method for nuclear power plant based on hadamard error-correcting output code	2017 2ND ASIA CONFERENCE ON POWER AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (ACPEE 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Asia Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering (ACPEE)	MAR 24-26, 2017	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Soc Mech Engineers				The technology of real-time fault diagnosis for nuclear power plants(NPP) has great significance to improve the safety and economy of reactor. The failure samples of nuclear power plants are difficult to obtain, and support vector machine is an effective algorithm for small sample problem. NPP is a very complex system, so in fact the type of NPP failure may occur very much. ECOC is constructed by the Hadamard error correction code, and the decoding method is Hamming distance method. The base models are established by lib-SVM algorithm. The result shows that this method can diagnose the faults of the NPP effectively.	[Sun, P.

Wind turbine generators based on Wound Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM) is actually the preferred technology mainly because of the lower rating of the power converter connected to the rotor side. With the association of a back-to back converter on the rotor side a Stator-Flux-Oriented-Control (SFOC) system can be used to obtain a decoupled control of the active and reactive power on the stator side with high efficiency. In this context, the influence of the Closed-Loop (CL) control scheme must be considered when the diagnosis of stator asymmetry is derived from the signature analysis of electrical quantities. Therefore, an examination of the spectral content of the investigated quantities for different bandwidths of CL regulators is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the derived fault indexes. In this paper, the performances of three different techniques based on rotor electrical quantities, for detecting stator asymmetry are investigated. Results with numerical simulations and experimental tests are here presented showing the validity of the established comparative study.

More aspects need to be addressed nowadays in terms of condition monitoring. It is necessary to extract as much information as possible related to the overall motor condition and health. Also, different levels of diagnosis are required, as well necessity of detecting the fault level severity and avoiding false positive/negative alarms. This paper presents a new method to detect stator inter- turn faults in induction motors using a new space vector approach. This new vector is based on the higher harmonic index of the Park's Vector. It is revealed that the time- representation of this vector offers a reliable diagnostic alarm. Moreover, the frequency spectrum of the proposed vector's modulus can be studied and analyzed to extract more information regarding the fault level severity.	[Gyftakis, K.

The proposed approaches rely mainly on the implementation of fault diagnosis algorithms in digital signal processors and field programmable gate arrays as well as usage of real-time simulators applied formerly in the context of hardware-in-the-loop for prompt and reliable fault diagnosis of electromechanical systems. This covers three groups of fault diagnosis namely, signal-based, modelbased and data-based methods. The main challenge is to optimize both the utilization of hardware resources and computation time in addition to having a prompt and reliable fault diagnosis. A single processing unit for both fault detection and control algorithms will be the ultimate aim which leads to a fault tolerant configuration ensuring continuous operation of any electromechanical system and its related electrical drive.

Early Detection and Classification of Bearing Faults using Support Vector Machine Algorithm	2017 IEEE WORKSHOP ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES DESIGN, CONTROL AND DIAGNOSIS (WEMDCD)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Workshop on Electrical Machines Design, Control and Diagnosis (WEMDCD)	APR 20-21, 2017	Nottingham, ENGLAND	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Fault diagnosis; Fault detection; Support vector machines; Ball bearings	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; ROTATING MACHINERY; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS	Bearings are one of the most critical elements in rotating machinery systems. Bearing faults are the main reason for failures in electrical motors and generators. Therefore, early bearing fault detection is very important to prevent critical system failures in the industry. In this paper, the support vector machine algorithm is used for early detection and classification of bearing faults. Both time and frequency domain features are used for training the support vector machine learning algorithm. The trained classier can be employed for real-time bearing fault detection and classification. By using the proposed method, the bearing faults can be detected at early stages, and the machine operators have time to take preventive action before a large-scale failure. The usefulness of the algorithm is validated by using a runto- failure experimental test data.

Information and communication technologies play an important role for implementing efficient maintenance software; therefore, the development of FDDS is posed as an industrial necessity. In case of industrial rotating machinery, data-driven FDDS using available vibration signals, or other related signals monitored from sensors, is currently viewed as an industrial informatics requirement. This paper proposes the application of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to implement an integrated tool for automatically developing and testing machine learning based fault diagnosis models in rotating machinery. As a result, a generic architecture is obtained which is able to build and implement diagnosis models in similar devices or processes. A condition monitoring software application, using the proposed SOA, was implemented in Java and deployed on a computational environment to test its performance in a experimental test bed, under realistic fault mechanical conditions in a gearbox.

Existing methods mostly rely on hand-crafted time-consuming preprocessing of data to acquire suitable features. In this paper, we use an easy and effective method to transform the 1-D temporal vibration signal into a 2-D image. With the signal image, convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to train the raw vibration data. As powerful feature extractor and classifier for image recognition, CNN can learn to acquire features most suitable for the classification task by being trained. With the image format of vibration signals, the neuron in fully-connected layer of CNN can see farther and capture the periodic feature of signals. According to the results of the experiments, when fed in enough training samples, the proposed method outperforms other common methods. The proposed method can also be applied to solve intelligent diagnosis problems of other machine systems.

Therefore, effective extraction of vibration signal characteristics is the key to diagnose the faults of rotating machinery. Mode mixing and illusive components existed in some conventional methods, such as EMD and EEMD, which leads to misdiagnosis in extracting signals. Given these reasons, a new fault diagnosis method, namely, variation mode decomposition (VMD), was proposed in this paper. VMD is a newly developed technique for adaptive signal decomposition, which can decompose a multicomponent signal into a series of quasi-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) simultaneously, corresponding to the components of signal clearly. To further research on VMD method, the advantages and characteristics of VMD are investigated via numerical simulations. VMD is then applied to detect oil whirl and oil whip for rotor systems fault diagnosis via practical vibration signal. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VMD method.

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the potential of a physics-based model (PbM) for prognostics with a real case study, based on the detection of incipient faults and estimate the remaining useful life of a planetary transmission of an aircraft system. Design/methodology/approach - Most of the research in the area of health assessment algorithms has been focused on data-driven approaches that are not based on the knowledge of the physics of the system, while PbM approaches rely on the understanding of the system and the degradation mechanisms. A physics-based modelling approach to represent metal-metal contact and fatigue in the gears of the planetary transmission of an aircraft system is applied. Findings - Both the failure mode caused by metal-metal contact as caused by fatigue in the gears is described. Furthermore, the real-time application that retrieves the results from the simulations to assess the health of the system is described. Finally the decision making that can be executed during flight in the aircraft is incorporated. Originality/value - The paper proposes an innovative prognostics health management system that assesses two important failure modes of the planetary transmission that regulates the speed of the generators of an aircraft. The results from the models have been integrated in an application that emulates a real system in the aircraft and computes the remaining useful life in real time.

J	Niu, G; Huang, XF				Niu, Gang; Huang, Xiaofan			Failure Prognostics of Locomotive Electro-Pneumatic Brake Based on Bond Graph Modeling	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Failure prognostics; bond graph; degradation indicator; performance threshold	FAULT-DETECTION	This paper proposes a novel analysis methodology applying bond graph (BG) theory for dynamic systems prognostics, which is realized through the derivation of a mathematical model from physical knowledge using the BG formalism. The graphical formalism allows generating residuals to derive the system degradation model. Moreover, the performance threshold can be determined by stability analysis to predict remain useful life of degraded components. The efficiency of the proposed methodology was demonstrated through a simulation experiment for locomotive electronically controlled pneumatic brake. A leakage fault of relay valve is injected and then predicted. The experimental results show that well performance can be obtained with lower uncertainty, which make the prognostics analysis suitable for engineering application in short of sufficient historic data.

One of the most important aspects in measuring the extracted features is whether they can explore more information of the inputs and avoid redundancy to be representative. Thus, a stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based machine fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. The penalty term of the SAE can help mine essential information and avoid redundancy. To help the constructed diagnosis network further mine more abstract and representative high-level features, the collected non-stationary and transient signals are preprocessed with ensemble empirical mode decomposition and autoregressive (AR) models to obtain AR parameters, which are extracted based on the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and regarded as the low-level features for the inputs of the proposed diagnosis network. Only the first four IMFs are considered, because fault information is mainly refiected in high-frequency IMFs. Experiments and comparisons are complemented to validate the superiority of the presented diagnosis network. Results fully demonstrate that the stacked SAE-based diagnosis method can extract more discriminative high-level features and has a better performance in rotating machinery fault diagnosis compared with the traditional machine learning methods with shallow architectures.

In order to guarantee stable electricity production predictability of the wind farm operational behaviour is essential. Big data approaches have the potential for a significant role in realizing this goal. In order to gain insights in turbine operational behaviour it is necessary to obtain a farm wide dataset, containing the operational sensor data of the different machines and context information such as maintenance data. Advanced analytics can use this data for understanding normal and deviating turbine operational behaviour. These insights will help in optimizing the operation and maintenance strategy of the farm. This paper gives an overview of our big data approach for data-storage and illustrates some of our data-analytics research tracks for gaining insights in the underlying failure mechanisms of turbines.

When this damaged part was changed, a detection of the machine dynamic response by vibration measurements was also performed. An inacceptable level of vibrations was detected which negatively influences the machining quality. Although it was initially suspected that the higher level of vibrations was solely due to a combination of mechanical causes, an additional analysis performed on frequencies, showing more complex vibrational spectra, suggested a deep interaction between electronical and mechanical criticalities.

In order to predict the potential fault of power transformer and identify the fault types correctly, we proposed a transformer fault intelligent diagnosis model based on chemical reaction optimization (CRO) algorithm and relevance vector machine(RVM). RVM is a powerful machine learning method, which can solve nonlinear, high-dimensional classification problems with a limited number of samples. CRO algorithm has well global optimization and simple calculation, so it is suitable to solve parameter optimization problems. In this paper, firstly, a multi-layer RVM classification model was built by binary tree recognition strategy. Secondly, CRO algorithm was adopted to optimize the kernel function parameters which could enhance the performance of RVM classifiers. Compared with IEC three-ratio method and the RVM model, the CRO-RVM model not only overcomes the coding defect problem of IEC three-ratio method, but also has higher classification accuracy than the RVM model. Finally, the new method was applied to analyze a transformer fault case, Its predicted result accord well with the real situation. The research provides a practical method for transformer fault intelligent diagnosis and prediction.

Sometimes, only a few parts per million are defective because of a faulty process. For this reason, fault diagnostics is faced with extremely imbalanced data sets and requires large volumes of data to achieve a reasonable performance. This paper explores whether a machine-to-machine approach can be used, in which several work systems share the process data to improve the accuracy of the fault-detection model. The model is based on machine learning and is applied to industrial data from approximately two million process cycles performed on several injection moulding work systems.

Due to increasing complexity, traditional maintenance strategies lack in fulfilling present-day production requirements. This paper proposes a novel procedural approach for prescriptive maintenance planning in manufacturing companies. Multivariate data analysis and simulation tools are utilized to analyse historical data (product quality data, machine failure data and production program data). Based on identified data correlations and incoming real-time machine data, system failures are predicted and prescriptive maintenance measures are proposed. Results from real implementations in the automotive manufacturing industry are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

J	Yuan, HD; Chen, J; Dong, GM				Yuan, Haodong; Chen, Jin; Dong, Guangming			Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Improved Locality-Constrained Linear Coding and Adaptive PSO-Optimized SVM	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							SPARSE REPRESENTATION; ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; VIBRATION SIGNALS; K-SVD; COMPRESSION; TRANSFORM; IMAGE; CLASSIFICATION; DICTIONARY	A novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on improved locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) and adaptive PSO-optimized support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. In traditional LLC, each feature is encoded by using a fixed number of bases without considering the distribution of the features and the weight of the bases. To address these problems, an improved LLC algorithm based on adaptive and weighted bases is proposed. Firstly, preliminary features are obtained by wavelet packet node energy. Then, dictionary learning with class-wise K-SVD algorithm is implemented. Subsequently, based on the learned dictionary the LLC codes can be solved using the improved LLC algorithm. Finally, SVM optimized by adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) is utilized to classify the discriminative LLC codes and thus bearing fault diagnosis is realized. In the dictionary leaning stage, other methods such as selecting the samples themselves as dictionary and K-means are also conducted for comparison. The experiment results show that the LLC codes can effectively extract the bearing fault characteristics and the improved LLC outperforms traditional LLC. The dictionary learned by class-wise K-SVD achieves the best performance. Additionally, adaptive PSO-optimized SVM can greatly enhance the classification accuracy comparing with SVM using default parameters and linear SVM.

Motor current signatures and their envelopes as tools for fault diagnosis	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT); Energy; Inter-turn short circuit fault; Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA); Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA); Power Spectral Density (PSD); Stator fault	FREQUENCY RESOLUTION; ELECTRICAL MACHINES; INDUCTION; VIBRATION; DRIVES	Induction motor inter-turn short circuit stator fault is identified using motor current signals with the help of Discrete Wavelet Transform along with Power Spectral Density. This methodology is adopted for motor current signals and their envelopes in order to identify a better tool for fault diagnosis. First, the analysis is performed using the original stator current signal, which has the fundamental frequency components along with the slip frequency and other harmonic/fault components. The fundamental component in the stator current can be eliminated by using the envelope of the signal. The transient in the wavelet decomposition can be suppressed by modifying the current envelope. This is done by pre-multiplying the original envelope with the Tukey window. The Power Spectral Density is calculated for both the signatures. Comparison of these two methods show that the proposed analysis based on modified envelope using Discrete Wavelet Transform along with Power Spectral Density offers better results compared to the original signal analysis.

J	Dang, J; Jia, R; Wu, H; Luo, XQ; Chen, DY				Dang, Jian; Jia, Rong; Wu, Hua; Luo, Xingqi; Chen, Diyi			Probabilistic Entropy EMD Thresholding for Periodic Fault Signal Enhancement in Rotating Machine	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; SIMILARITY MEASURE; DIAGNOSIS	Since the slight fault feature of incipient fault is usually polluted by heavy background noise, it is difficult to extract the weak feature signal in rotating machine. As an adaptive decomposing technique, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based denoising methods have a good effect on the feature separation and noise elimination. However, for rotating machine with poor working environment, the components attributed to noise might have higher amplitudes, which restrict the efficiency of noise reduction in current EMD-based denoising methods. Therefore, a probabilistic entropy EMD thresholding algorithm for periodic fault signal enhancement in rotating machine is proposed in this paper. In this method, the entropy threshold of each IMF is constructed instead of the threshold applied to N sampling points of each IMF directly, which overcomes the shortcoming of the denoising effect limited by larger amplitude noise reservation and smaller amplitude feature signal reduction in the current denoising methods. Meanwhile, in order to make the amplitudes of all the IMF reduce in a smooth way, a multiscale thresholding algorithm based on quantile statistics to provide probability indexes is presented. Engineering application demonstrates that the proposed method is effective in the noise reduction and fault feature enhancement in the rotating machine.

Prognostic investigation of galvanic corrosion precursors in aircraft structures and their detection strategy	NONDESTRUCTIVE CHARACTERIZATION AND MONITORING OF ADVANCED MATERIALS, AEROSPACE, AND CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE 2017	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Nondestructive Characterization and Monitoring of Advanced Materials, Aerospace, and Civil Infrastructure	MAR 26-29, 2017	Portland, OR	SPIE, OZ Opt Ltd, Polytec Inc, Fiberguide Ind, Frontiers Media		Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP); Galvanic Corrosion; Microwave; Non-Destructive Testing (NDT); Radar; Millimeter Wave	LAP-JOINT MIMICS; FAILURE ASSESSMENT; COMPOSITE; MICROWAVE; FUSION; PAINT	Aluminum alloys have been the dominant materials for aerospace construction in the past fifty years due to their light weight, forming and alloying, and relative low cost in comparison to titanium and composites. However, in recent years, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) and honeycomb materials have been used in aircrafts in the quest to attain lower weight, high temperature resistance, and better fuel efficiency. When these two materials are coupled together, the structural strength of the aircraft is unparalleled, but this comes at a price, namely galvanic corrosion. Previous experimental results have shown that when CFRP composite materials are joined with high strength aluminum alloys (AA7075-T6 or AA2024-T3), galvanic corrosion occurs at the material interfaces, and the aluminum is in greater danger of corroding, particularly since carbon and aluminum are on the opposite ends of the galvanic series. In this paper, we explore the occurrence of the recognizable precursors of galvanic corrosion when CFRP plate is coupled to an aluminum alloy using SS-304 bolts and exposed to environmental degradation, which creates significant concerns for aircraft structural reliability. The galvanic corrosion software package, BEASY, is used to simulate the growth of corrosion in the designed specimen after which a microwave non-destructive testing (NDT) technique is explored to detect corrosion defects that appear at the interface of this galvanic couple. This paper also explores a loaded waveguide technique to determine the dielectric constant of the final corrosion product at the Q-band millimeter-wave frequency range (33-50 GHz), as this can be an invaluable asset in developing early detection strategies.

A condition monitoring approach for real-time monitoring of degrading systems using Kalman filter and logistic regression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Kalman filter; logistic regression; Bayesian filtering; classification; reliability analysis; condition-based maintenance; dynamic decision-making	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; REMAINING-USEFUL-LIFE; OPPORTUNISTIC MAINTENANCE; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; PROGNOSTICS; MODELS	We present a new model for reliability analysis that is able to employ condition monitoring data in order to simultaneously monitor the latent degradation level and track failure progress over time. The method presented in this paper is a bridge between Bayesian filtering and classical binary classification, both of which have been employed successfully in various application domains. The Kalman filter is used to model a discrete-time continuous-state degradation process that is hidden and for which only indirect information is available through a multi-dimensional observation process. Logistic regression is then used to connect the latent degradation state with the failure process that is itself a discrete-space stochastic process. We present a closed-form solution for the marginal log-likelihood function and provide formulas for few important reliability measures. A dynamic cost-effective maintenance policy is finally introduced that can employ sensor signals for real-time decision-making.

Therefore, an integrated PdM strategy considering product quality level and mission reliability state is proposed regarding the intelligent manufacturing philosophy of prediction and manufacturing'. First, the key process variables are identified and integrated into the evaluation of the equipment degradation state. Second, the quality deviation index is defined to describe the quality of the product quantitatively according to the co-effect of manufacturing system component reliability and product quality in the quality-reliability chain. Third, to achieve changeable production task demands, mission reliability is defined to characterise the equipment production states comprehensively. The optimal integrated PdM strategy, which combines quality control and mission reliability analysis, is obtained by minimising the total cost. Finally, a case study on decision-making with the integrated PdM strategy for a cylinder head manufacturing system is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The final results shows that proposed method achieves approximately 26.02 and 20.54% cost improvement over periodic preventive maintenance and conventional condition-based maintenance respectively.

Fine-Tuning Convolutional Deep Features For MRI Based Brain Tumor Classification	MEDICAL IMAGING 2017: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis	FEB 13-16, 2017	Orlando, FL	SPIE, Alpin Med Syst		fine-tuning; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; magnetic resonance imaging; machine learning; Radiomics	RADIOMICS	Prediction of survival time from brain tumor magnetic resonance images (MRI) is not commonly performed and would ordinarily be a time consuming process. However, current cross-sectional imaging techniques, particularly MRI, can be used to generate many features that may provide information on the patient's prognosis, including survival. This information can potentially be used to identify individuals who would benefit from more aggressive therapy. Rather than using pre-defined and hand-engineered features as with current radiomics methods, we investigated the use of deep features extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting survival time. We also provide evidence for the power of domain specific fine-tuning in improving the performance of a pre-trained CNN's, even though our data set is small. We fine-tuned a CNN initially trained on a large natural image recognition dataset (Imagenet ILSVRC) and transferred the learned feature representations to the survival time prediction task, obtaining over 81% accuracy in a leave one out cross validation.

Some examples include time series regression and prediction, optical character recognition, signal detection in communications or biomedical applications for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper deals with the topic of learning from biomedical image data in the classification problem. In a typical scenario we have a training set that is employed to fit a prediction model or learner and a testing set on which the learner is applied to in order to predict the outcome for new unseen patterns. Both processes are usually completely separated to avoid over-fitting and due to the fact that, in practice, the unseen new objects (testing set) have unknown outcomes. However, the outcome yields one of a discrete set of values, i.e. the binary diagnosis problem. Thus, assumptions on these outcome values could be established to obtain the most likely prediction model at the training stage, that could improve the overall classification accuracy on the testing set, or keep its performance at least at the level of the selected statistical classifier. In this sense, a novel case-based learning (c-learning) procedure is proposed which combines hypothesis testing from a discrete set of expected outcomes and a cross-validated classification stage	[Gorriz, Juan M.; Ramirez, Javier; Illan, I.

Bearing frequently fall out of service for various reasons: heavy loads, unsuitable lubrications, ineffective sealing. Bearing faults may cause a decrease in performance. Analysis of bearing vibration signals has attracted attention in the field of monitoring and fault diagnosis. Bearing vibration signals give rich information for early detection of bearing failures. Spectral kurtosis, SK, is a parameter in frequency domain indicating how the impulsiveness of a signal varies with frequency. Faults in rolling bearings give rise to a series of short impulse responses as the rolling elements strike faults, SK potentially useful for determining frequency bands dominated by bearing fault signals. SK can provide a measure of the distance of the analyzed bearings from a healthy one. SK provides additional information given by the power spectral density (psd). This paper aims to explore the estimation of spectral kurtosis using short time Fourier transform known as spectrogram. The estimation of SK is similar to the estimation of psd. The estimation falls in model-free estimation and plug-in estimator. Some numerical studies using simulations are discussed to support the methodology. Spectral kurtosis of some stationary signals are analytically obtained and used in simulation study. Kurtosis of time domain has been a popular tool for detecting non-normality. Spectral kurtosis is an extension of kurtosis in frequency domain. The relationship between time domain and frequency domain analysis is establish through power spectrum-autocovariance Fourier transform. Fourier transform is the main tool for estimation in frequency domain. The power spectral density is estimated through periodogram. In this paper, the short time Fourier transform of the spectral kurtosis is reviewed, a bearing fault (inner ring and outer ring) is simulated. The bearing response, power spectrum, and spectral kurtosis are plotted to visualize the pattern of each fault.

Although there are many commercial high availability (HA) solutions, they are expensive and do not support intelligent platform management interface (IPMI) that can improves failure detection efficiency. We present NCU-HA, a HA solution based on the open source project KVM(Kernel-based Virtual Machine). NCU-HA can be run on both low-cost personal computers (PCs) and IPMI-based servers. Moreover, to prevent single point of failure, we classify the nodes of the cluster into three roles: Primary node, Backup node, and General nodes. HA agent on those nodes will provide the functions depending on its role. We also define failure models and describe the recovery methods implemented in NCU-HA. Evaluation results show that our system can reach four nines (> 99.99 %) availability on low cost PCs.

Self-Organising Symbolic Aggregate Approximation for Real-Time Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Transient Dynamic Systems	2017 IEEE 15TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON APPLIED MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATICS (SAMI)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Symposium on Applied Machine Intelligence and Informatics (SAMI)	JAN 26-28, 2017	Herlany, SLOVAKIA	IEEE		Similarity search; data reduction; fault detection; Symbolic Aggregate Approximation		The development of accurate fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques are an important aspect of monitoring system health, whether it be an industrial machine or human system. In FDD systems where real-time or mobile monitoring is required there is a need to minimise computational overhead whilst maintaining detection and diagnosis accuracy. Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) is one such method, whereby reduced representations of signals are used to create symbolic representations for similarity search. Data reduction is achieved through application of the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) algorithm. However, this can often lead to the loss of key information characteristics resulting in misclassification of signal types and a high risk of false alarms. This paper proposes a novel methodology based on SAX for generating more accurate symbolic representations, called SelfOrganising Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SOSAX). Data reduction is achieved through the application of an optimised PAA algorithm, Self-Organising Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (SOPAA). The approach is validated through the classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals where it is shown to outperform standard SAX in terms of inter-class separation and intra-class distance of signal types.

As a result, degradation signal data used for prognosis are often imbalanced as most units are reliable and only few tend to fail at early stages of their life cycle. Such imbalanced data may hinder accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction especially in terms of detecting premature failures as early as possible. This aspect is detrimental for developing cost-effective condition-based maintenance strategies. In this article, we propose a degradation signal-based RUL prediction method to address the imbalance issue in the data. The proposed method introduces a mixture prior distribution to capture the characteristics of different groups within the same population and provides an efficient and effective online prediction method for the in-service unit under monitoring. The advantageous features of the proposed method are demonstrated through a numerical study as well as a case study with real-world data in the application to the RUL prediction of automotive lead-acid batteries.

Capturing physical and performance degradation entails the use of various types of sensors that generate massive amounts of multivariate data. Building a prognostic model for such large-scale datasets, however, often presents two key challenges: how to effectively fuse the degradation signals from a large number of sensors and how to make the model scalable to the large data size. To address the two challenges, this article presents a scalable semi-parametric statistical framework specifically designed for synthesizing and combining multistream sensor signals using two signal fusion algorithms developed from functional principal component analysis. Using the algorithms, we identify fused signal features and predict (in near real-time) the remaining lifetime of partially degraded systems using an adaptive functional (log)-location-scale regression modeling framework. We validate the proposed multi-sensor prognostic methodology using numerical and data-driven case studies.

Hence, continuous health monitoring, precise fault detection and advance failure warning for motors are pivotal and cost-effective. The identification of motor faults requires sophisticated signal processing techniques for quick fault detection and isolation. This paper presents a real time health monitoring technique for induction motor using pattern recognition method. The proposed fault detection and isolation scheme comprises three stages: data acquisition, feature extraction and multiclass support vector machine classifier. This paper investigates single and multiple faults in single-phase induction motor including bearing fault, load fault and their combination. The testbed consists of 1/2 hp, 220V squirrel cage induction motor with load, vibration sensor, current sensor, data acquisition system and controller. Two features standard deviation and average value are computed for each sensor's data. Multiclass support vector machine classifier is implemented using a low-cost arduino controller for fault detection and isolation. The performance analysis of the classifier with real time sensor's data is presented which shows superior capabilities of developed method.

Firstly, the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) can be obtained by using EMD on the track vibration signals generated by the SIMPACK, and features of each IMFs were extracted. Afterwards, LSSVM was adopted to estimate safety region of wheels service status. Finally, PNN was used to recognize the three states of wheel including normal wheel, wheel flat, out of round wheel. Experimental results show that the proposed method can identify wheel working state and fault type accurately and effectively.

Piezoelectric transducers are used as sensors and actuators to damage detection. Such approach monitors changes in the electric impedance of piezoelectric transducers that are bonded to the host structure. Normally the evaluation of the impedance responses is performed by using damage metrics, which permit to quantify the influence of damage. This is possible since the sensor electrical impedance is directly related to the mechanical impedance of the structure. However, the frequency response functions (FRFs) resulting from this method are susceptible to environmental and operational conditions that must be accounted for in order to avoid false diagnostics. Thus, the aim of this paper relies on the correct detection of incipient faults in rotating shafts under operating condition by using a real-time Impedance-based Structural Health Monitoring (ISHM) method. For this purpose, a data normalization procedure for compensation of changes in environmental and operating conditions is used to minimize changes in impedance signatures resulting from these external influences. Changes on dynamic load result from altering the rotation speed and unbalance level, while temperature changes stem from daily room temperature variations. The compensation technique is based on a hybrid optimization method associated with a given damage metrics. Additionally, a statistical model is used for threshold determination based on the Statistical Process Control (SPC) method. Experimental results show that an incipient damage associated with temperature and dynamic loads effects could be successfully detected with a probability of detection above 95 % confidence for the majority of the sensors used.

The machining quality requirement of thin wall parts is so high, and the health condition of the cutter is closely related to the quality of processing. Predicting the change of tool health condition is very important to a controllable processing quality. In this paper, a data model of machine and tool, communication framework and access strategy based on the OPC UA was developed to predict tool healthy condition. A prognostics and health management (PHM) technology was applied to deal with related machine data. A BP neural network model was built to reflect the relationship between machine condition and the parameters of the tools. The tool healthy condition parameters, dimensions errors, surface roughness and surface texture of the workpiece were inspected to revise the prediction model, which developed the accuracy of the model and make it to be more valuable. The model realized the monitoring and predicting of important information of tool healthy condition and made the intelligent judgment to machining quality. The technical level of intelligent monitoring of tool management and processing cycle was improved while the efficiency and quality of machining titanium were increased. (C) 2017 The Authors.

More often, such systems operate accordingly to the IoT or Industry 4.0 concept. However, large number of end modules operating in the system leads to a significant load and consequently, to an overload of the communication interfaces. The CloudBus protocol is one of the methods which is used for data exchange and concurrent process synchronization in the distributed systems. It allows the significant savings in the amount of transmitted data between end modules, especially when compared with the other protocols used in the industry. Nevertheless, basic version of the protocol does not protect against the system failure in the event of failure of one of the nodes. This paper proposes four novel variants of the CloudBus protocol, which allow the fault detection. The comparison and performance analysis was executed for all proposed CloudBus variants. The verification and behavior analysis of the distributed systems were performed on SoC hardware research platform. Furthermore, a simple test application was proposed.

According to output of loT sensors, companies can build systems to predict the conditions of components. Practically the components are required to be maintained or replaced before the end of life in performing their assigned task. Predicting the life condition of a component is so crucial for industries that have intent to grow in a fast paced technological environment. Recent studies on predictive maintenance help industries to create an alert before the components are corrupted. Thanks to prediction of component failures, companies have a chance to sustain their operations efficiently while reducing their maintenance cost by repairing components in advance. Since maintenance affects production capacity and the service quality directly, optimized maintenance is the key factor for organizations to have more revenue and stay competitive in developing industrialized world. With the aid of well-designed prediction system for understanding current situation of an engine, components could be taken out of active service before malfunction occurs. With the help of inspection, effective maintenance extends component life, improves equipment availability and keeps components in a proper condition while reducing costs. Real time data collected from sensors is a great source to model component deteriorations. Markov Chain models, Survival Analysis, Optimization algorithms and several machine learning approaches have been implemented in order to model predictive maintenance. In this paper Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks has been performed to predict the current situation of an engine. LSTM model deals with a sequential input data. Training process of LSTM networks has been performed on large-scale data processing engine with high performance. Since huge amount of data is flowing into the predictive model, Apache Spark which is offering a distributed clustering environment has been used. The output of the LSTM network is deciding the current life condition of components and offering the alerts for components before the end of their life. The proposed model also trained and tested on an open source data that is about an engine degradation simulation provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.

However, the bandwidth of transmission channels imposes the limit on the amount of sensor data to be used in remote condition monitoring systems in real-time applications. In this paper, a remote health condition monitoring (RHCM) method based on compressed sensing (CS) is proposed for machine state classification and signal reconstruction. Compressed sensor signals can be directly used to identify different machine states based on a pre-constructed dictionary without the need of traditional feature extraction process. Alternatively, the complete signals can also be reconstructed from the compressed signals and traditional classification approaches can be applied. A case study based on rolling bearing is used to show that the proposed RHCM method can effectively recognize and classify the machine states under different operation conditions using low-volume sensor signals, and the reconstructed signals are accurate enough for post-evaluation or quality assessment of on-site machine process.

The global characteristics and pressure fluctuations are analysed as the pump-turbine runs through the turbine mode, into the turbine braking mode, and finally into the reversed pump mode. As the guide vanes close, flow rate and runner torque both decrease while the rotational speed drops in response to the negative torque on the runner. The proposed approach accurately predicts the transient characteristics during the shutdown process and provides insight into the inner flow behaviour of a pump-turbine. Thus, this study has the potential to facilitate both exploration and diagnostics of faults of turbo machines during transient operation.

About 65% of electricity is generated by using thermal power plant. The equipment of TPP runs for 24x7 days through the year. The fault of TPP equipment needs to identify at early stage before the breakdown of system or unit. The maintenance functions of TPP should be optimized carefully by selecting suitable maintenance strategy at least cost. Identification and confirmation of fault in TPP equipment is very important step for decision making. It helps to optimize the maintenance activity. This paper proposes an algorithm for use of co-ordinated condition monitoring approach for identification and confirmation of fault.

The problem of detecting shorted-turn faults in stator windings has been difficult. Although, from the supply currents, major winding faults can easily be detected, minor faults with less than five per cent of winding turns are not easily detectable. If not detected early, such faults can lead to major winding faults which may further lead to the disruption of the machine and causes production shutdowns. This paper describes the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based diagnosis technique that analyses stator currents under faulty (stator shorted-turn) and healthy conditions. The developed technique depends on the band pass filtering carried out by the DWT, facilitating the extraction of the harmonic components produced by the shorted-turn faults. The discrepancies energy spectrum for three frequencies from the residual of de-noising analysis enables us to classify the fault index. From 38 seconds, the shorted turn begins to show significant difference in the energy spectrum, and if this is not detected in time, it may lead to a more serious fault.	[Imoru, OdunAyo; Bhaskar, M.

J	Fabianski, B; Zawirski, K				Fabianski, Bogdan; Zawirski, Krzysztof			Parameter adaptation of simplified switched reluctance motor model using Newton and Gauss-Newton signal fitting methods	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Modeling; Switched reluctance motor; Control system; Electric drive; Newton method; Nonlinear approximation	SRM	Purpose - The paper is concerned about parameter adaptation of a novel, simplified and nonlinear switched reluctance motor(SRM) model. The purpose of the presented on-line procedure is to give an opportunity to set the model parameters' values to obtain a relatively good convergence with the real control object. This is important when a reference model is used for control (e.g. optimal) or object state classification (e.g. fault detection) purposes. The more convergent the real object model is, the better operation quality may be expected. Design/methodology/approach - In the paper, a 12/8 pole's SRM as a control object is analyzed. The model equations were verified experimentally by comparing phase current model estimations with reference (measured) ones at different operational points. Differential equations of motor winding currents were chosen as an approximation function in the fitting (parameter adaptation) process using the Newton and GaussNewton methods. The structure of the adaptation system is presented along with the implementation in simulation environment. Findings - It was confirmed in the simulation tests that Newton and Gauss-Newton methods of nonlinear model parameters' adaptation may be used for the SRM. The introduced fitting structure is well suited for implementation in real-time, embedded systems. The proposed approximation function could be used in process as an expansion to Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The x(2) (chi2) coefficient (commonly used to measure the quality of the signal fitting) reduced to a low value during the adaptation process. Another introduced quality coefficient shows that the Newton method is slightly better in scope of the entire adaptation process time; however, it needs more computational power. Research limitations/implications - The proposed structure and approximation function formula in the parameters' adaptation system is appropriate for sinusoidal distribution of the motor phase inductance value along the rotor angle position. The inductance angular shape is an implication of the mechanical construction -with appropriate dimensions and materials used. In the presented case, the referenced model is a three-phase SRM in 12/8 poles configuration used as a main drive part of Maytag Neptune washing machine produced by Emerson Motors. Practical implications -The presented method of parameter adaptation for novel, simplified and nonlinear SRM model provides an opportunity for its use in embedded, real-time control systems. The convergent motor model, after the fitting procedure (when the estimations are close to the measurements from real object), may be used for solving many well-known control challenges such as detection of initial rotor position, sensorless control, optimal control, fault-tolerant control end in fault detection (FD) systems. The reference model may be used in FD in the way of deducing signals from the difference between the estimated and measured ones. Originality/value -The paper proposed a new system of parameter adaptation for the evaluated nonlinear, simplified 12/8 poles SRM model. The relative simplicity of the proposed model equations provides the possibility of implementing an adaptation system in an embedded system that works in a real-time regime. A Two adaptation methods - Newton and Gauss-Newton - have been compared. The obtained results shown that the Newton fitting method is better in the way of the used quality indicator, but it consumes more computational power.

Design/methodology/approach - Two models are developed in the paper to analyse, for different supply voltage values, the influence of the variations of the magnetizing voltage for which there is a link with the tangential component of the external flux. The first is an analytical model based on the IM single-phaseequivalent circuit with variable magnetizing reactance to take into account the saturation of the magnetic circuit. The second is a numerical finite element simulation to model the same phenomenon. Results of both models are analysed with experimental measures of the external flux. Findings - The study shows that the amplitude of the external field strongly depends on supply voltage values. Research limitations/implications - The investigation is mainly focused on the tangential component of the external magnetic field which is of high importance concerning the applicability of non-invasive methods of diagnosis, as electromagnetic torque estimation developed by the authors or internal fault determination. Originality/value - The originality of the paper concerns the characterization of the external flux with the supply voltage for IMs. It is shown that the magnetic circuit radiates external flux differently with the load and with the supply voltage.

Even though there are various main components available in the induction motor, bearing is something crucial where we need to concentrate. Hence the fault occurs in the bearing has to be paid more intention. In most of the cases, holes had been formed in the bearing of the induction motor for fault analysis. Whereas considering the industrial environment, the chance of occurrence of scratch is considerably higher than the possibilities of holes. Hence in this paper, scratch has been considered as a factor for fault analysis. Thus by considering the two types of scratches on the outer raceway of bearing, experimental results were obtained at the different load condition. Following that, the detection of the bearing fault is achieved by the Fast Fourier Transform. Finally, the diagnosis was performed with the help of Support Vector Machine.

Intelligent Flux Predictive Control through Online Stator Inter-turn Fault Detection for Fault-tolerant Control of Induction Motor	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	MAR 22-25, 2017	Toronto, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Magnetic flux density; Search coil; Stator inter-turn fault; Space harmonics; Time harmonics; Unbalanced induction motor	MACHINES	Inter-turn insulation failure in induction motor results in complete or developing winding short circuit. Stator winding fault leads to an unbalance in the three phases of the motor leading to a faulty induction motor with increased time and space harmonics of flux. This can lead to uneven distribution of air gap flux and increase in torque ripple. The condition is worsened due to an unbalance in the voltage supply depreciating the optimal performance of the drive-based It is of primary importance that the aforementioned discrepancies are taken care of while modelling a more fault tolerant motor drive system with faster processing and lower response time. This paper proposes a novel control technique to reduce the unbalance in the motor due to stator fault by taking into account the air-gap flux developed in the motor and harmonics generated. An improved swarm optimization algorithm has been used in order to efficiently predict the flux reference for the stator-flux controlled motor drive. The proposed detection scheme has been implemented on an aluminum-rotor induction motor with incipient stator inter-fault with the help of online monitoring of unhealthy conditions and using it as a feedback for the drive system, thereby a robust online detection of fault and a stable fault control system.

However, due to the fatigue under continuous loading, the uncertain in structural integrity still remains an unsolved problem. The assessment of structural damage in composite laminates can be achieved by damage location, classification, and quantification. The growth trend of delamination area is one of the most important factors. In order to predict the delamination size efficiently and accurately, this paper proposes a prognostic method based on machine learning techniques. Prediction models, including linear model, support vector machines, and random forests were investigated. An optimal solution was identified by comparing the test results of different models. In this study, the length of the path across delamination area was selected as the objective value to train the models. The path length measurements augmented the training data sets and avoid the overfitting problem for the models. Moreover, the path length can be used to measure the size of delamination area. The interrogation frequency collected on several composite coupons was adopted as an input variable for the predict model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Unexpected bearing failures in such machines during field operation can lead to machine breakdown, which may have some pretty severe implications. However, the insufficiency of labeled samples is major problem for handling fault diagnosis problem. To address such concern, we propose a semi-supervised method for diagnosing faulty bearings by utilizing unlabeled samples. The superiority of our algorithm has been validated by comparison with other state-of art methods based on a rolling element bearing data. The two-dimensional visualization and classification accuracy of bearing data show that our algorithm is able to recognize different bearing fault categories effectively. Thus, it can be considered as a promising method for fault diagnosis.	[Zhao, Mingbo] Donghua Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Chow, Tommy W.

However, developing an accurate and interpretable data-driven decision support system is challenging: 1) the scoliosis data collected from clinical environments is heterogeneous, unstructured, and incomplete; 2) the cause of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is still unknown, and the effects of some measured indicators are not clear; and 3) some treatments like wearing a brace will affect the progression of scoliosis. The main contributions of the paper include: 1) propose and incorporate different imputation methods like Local Linear Interpolation (LLI) and Global Statistic Approximation (GSA) to deal with complicated types of incomplete data in clinical environments; 2) identify important features that are relevant to the severity of scoliosis with embedded method; and 3) establish and compare the scoliosis prediction models with multiple linear regression, k nearest neighbor, tree, support vector machine, and random forest algorithms. The prediction performance is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and the Pearson correlation coefficient. With only a few critical features, the prediction models can achieve satisfactory performance. Experiments show that the models are highly interpretable and viable to support the decision-making in clinical environments.

The data set containing samples of the abovementioned fault signals was acquired as follows: normal data signals were obtained from a temperature-to-voltage converter by using an Arduino Uno microcontroller board and MATLAB. Then, faults were simulated in normal data to get 100 samples of each fault, in which one sample is composed of 1000 data elements. A support vector machine (SVM) was used for data classification in a one-versus-rest manner. The statistical time-domain features, extracted from a sample, were used as a single observation for training and testing SVM. The number of features varied from 5 to 10 to examine the effect on accuracy of SVM. Three different kernel functions used to train SVM include linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function kernels. The fault occurrence event in fault samples was chosen randomly in some cases to replicate a practical scenario in industrial systems. The results show that an increase in the number of features from 5 to 10 hardly increases the total accuracy of the classifier. However, using ten features gives the highest accuracy for fault classification in an SVM. An increase in the number of training samples from 40 to 60 caused an overfitting problem. The k -fold cross-validation technique was adopted to overcome this issue. The increase in number of data elements per sample to 2500 increases the efficiency of the classifier. However, an increase in the number of training samples to 400 reduces the capability of SVM to classify stuck fault. The receiver operating characteristics curve comparison shows the efficiency of SVM over a neural network.

Compared to particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based PF, QPSO-based PF is proved to have a better performance in global searching and has fewer parameters to control, which makes QPSO-PF easier for applications. Moreover, fewer particles are required by QPSO-PF to accurately track the battery's health status, leading to a reduction of computation complexity. RUL prediction results using real data provided by NASA and compared with benchmark approaches demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.

A Comparative Study of Adaptive Order Tracking Techniques for Rotating Machinery Analysis: Computer Experiments and Practical Implementations	ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE AND ADAPTIVE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Order tracking; LMS algorithm; RLS algorithm; the Vold-Kalman filters; fault diagnosis	SHAFT-SPEED INFORMATION; EXPLORATION	This paper presents and investigates recursive order tracking (OT) techniques based on the least mean-square (LMS) method and the Vold-Kalman (VK) algorithm with a one pole structural equation, both of which could be realized as real-time applications. Additionally, for comparisons, two common adaptive OT filters are considered: the recursive least-squares (RLS) method and the VK algorithm with a two pole structural equation. The numerical implementations of the considered methods, through simulations on a representative noisy synthetic signal, including both close and crossing orders spectral components, are performed. The results indicate a possible degradation in the tracking performance of the RLS algorithm and the effectiveness of the simple LMS method, as well as both considered VK algorithms, for OT and distinguishing. The influence of the sampling frequency on the choosing of a weighting factor for the VK recursive OT filters is further investigated to extend the guidelines from the literature for using these methods. Two examples of practical implementations of the considered recursive OT methods are given: (i) the separation of the crossing orders arising in the laboratory test bench of the two unbalanced rotors rotating at independent frequencies and (ii) the one engineering application of fault diagnosis in the massive reduction gear on an excavator with a cable crowd, based on the distinguishing and separation of close orders. The experimental results justify the implementation of the proposed techniques as OT tools in industrial applications.	[Veljkovic, Dejan .

In this study, using feature extraction based on wavelet transformation, sound signals emitted from automobile engines under both faulty and healthy conditions are analyzed. The intention is to categorize sound signals into both healthy and faulty classes. Sound signals are generated from 4 different automobile engines in both healthy and faulty conditions. The investigated fault is within the ignition system of the engines. In addition, there are other possible problems that may also affect the generated sound signals. In the reported study, a set of features is initially extracted from the recorded signals.

J	Abdulraheem, KF; Al-Kindi, G				Abdulraheem, Khalid F.; Al-Kindi, Ghassan			A Simplified Wind Turbine Blade Crack Identification Using Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Experimental Modal Analysis; Impact hammer test; Wind turbine blade fault identification; Vibration based modal Analysis; Frequency Response Function (FRF)	CANTILEVER BEAM; NATURAL FREQUENCIES	Wind turbines blades rotate and flutter in extreme weather and fatigue loading conditions while subjected to random wind speeds. Furthermore, the wind turbines are usually located in remote areas with elevated heights thus difficult to be reached, examined, and assessed. Therefore, performing maintenance and repair is very challenging process due to the difficult and limited machine accessibility. The wind turbine blades conditions have significant contribution to turbine durability, reliability and performance issues, practically for offshore and megawatt-class wind turbines. Hence, to ensure their proper functioning, a robust condition monitoring system (CMS) for early detection of blade deterioration to be developed and implemented. Experimental modal analysis investigates the effect of structure dynamics variations, which may result from the presence and propagation of cracks, on the behaviour of the vibrational modal parameters including modal frequencies, modal shapes and damping. To enable the emulation of wind turbine blades, a stepped beam is used in this paper to examine the application of experimental Modal Analysis technique in identification of blade fault. The aim is to assess the applicability of using the experimental modal analysis as a structural health monitoring (SHM) approach for wind turbine blades. An impact hammer test has been performed for the stepped beam with different crack sizes located at predetermined places. The Frequency Response Function (FRF) has been obtained experimentally as the frequency response ratio of the structure output to the input excitation force, H (omega) = X (omega)/F (omega). The stepped beam FRF has been calculated at different impact location and 3D plots are generated to define the structure modal shape. The results proved that the use of modal parameters allow for the detection and estimation of crack size in the stepped beam, hence motivate and provide a reference to investigate its implementation to wind turbine blades.

The MAED and SVM for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Wind turbine; Data-based diagnosis; MAED algorithm; NPE algorithm; SVM classifier	MACHINES	Fault diagnosis is the best discipline to control the operation and maintenance costs of the wind turbine system. However, the fault diagnosis of wind turbine finds difficulties with the variation of wind speed and electrical energy (generator torque). In this work, the proposed fault diagnosis approach is based on the Feature set algorithm, manifold learning and the Support Vector Machine classifier. First, the construction of the feature set is very important step, with the high dimension after application the MAED (Manifold Adaptive Experimental Design) algorithm on the data set. Moreover, the NPE (Neighborhood Preserving Embedding) manifold learning algorithm is applied for directional reduction of feature set by the eigenvectors; it is easy to use as the input for the last step. Finally, the low dimensions of eigenvectors are exploited by the (SVM) Support Vector Machine classifier for recognition fault and making the maintenance decision. This approach is implanted on the faults of the benchmark wind turbine and gives the best performance.	[Soussa, A.; Mouss, M.

Coherence function along with other methods of spectral analysis is commonly used for vibration diagnosis of rotating machinery and its particular nodes. An algorithm is given for the function evaluation for signals represented with digital samples. The algorithm is analyzed for its software implementation and computational problems. Optimization measures are described, including algorithmic, architecture and compiler optimization, their results are assessed for multi-core processors from different manufacturers. Thus, speeding-up of the parallel execution with respect to sequential execution was studied and results are presented for Intel Core i7-4720HQ. AMD FX-9590 processors. The results show comparatively high efficiency of the optimization measures taken. In particular, acceleration indicators and average CPU utilization have been significantly improved, showing high degree of parallelism of the constructed calculating functions. The developed software underwent state registration and will be used as a part of a software and hardware solution for rotating machinery fault diagnosis and pipeline leak location with acoustic correlation method.

In view of the inherent polymorphism of manufacturing systems (i.e., dynamic production scheduling and performance degradation), the connotation of mission reliability of equipment is defined and modeled based on the processing capacity distribution which integrates multiple fault data. Further, the relationship between mission reliability and performance of equipment is established by using the unavailability as the intermediary. The optimal predictive maintenance policy, the best mission reliability threshold for performing predictive maintenance action, is obtained by minimizing the comprehensive cost which includes processing capacity loss, corrective maintenance cost, predictive maintenance cost and indirect loss caused by failing to meet due dates over the planning period. This paper will also evaluate a manufacturing system of the cylinder head of an automotive engine as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The final result shows that a more significant economic benefit can be achieved by the proposed approach, which considers the mission reliability and comprehensive cost relative to the periodic preventive maintenance policy.

Since early detection and measurement of an observable damage marker in composite is very difficult, the proposed framework is established based on identifying and then monitoring "indirect damage indicators". Dynamic Bayesian Network is utilized to integrate relevant damage models with any available monitoring data as well as other influential parameters. As the damage evolution process in composites is not fully explored, a technique consisting of extended Particle Filtering and Support Vector Regression is implemented to simultaneously estimate the damage model parameters as well as damage states in the presence of multiple measurements. The method is then applied to predict the time to failure of the component.

The approach is demonstrated using simulated data from the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), as a challenging benchmark problem. The TEP is a plant-wide industrial process that is commonly used to study and evaluate a variety of topics, including the design of process monitoring and control techniques. The proposed approach is called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a machine learning approach that is used to discover the hidden knowledge in historical data. The discovered knowledge in the form of extracted patterns is employed to construct a classification rule that is capable of characterizing the physical phenomena in the TEP, wherein one can detect and identify a fault and relate it to the causes that contribute to its occurrence. To evaluate our approach, the LAD is trained on a set of observations collected from different faults, and tested against an independent set of observations. The results in this paper show that the LAD approach achieves the highest accuracy compared to two common machine learning classification techniques; Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.

Fault Tolerance Considerations for Long Endurance AUVs	2017 ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)	JAN 23-26, 2017	Orlando, FL			autonomous underwater vehicles; fault tolerance; fault recovery; FDIR; technology refresh; safety		Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) work in a harsh and uncertain environment which imposes challenges on their energy, navigation, and communications. Given the environment, there is little bandwidth to communicate solutions to an on-board fault or failure. The AUV application discussed is for Naval Mine Countermeasures (NMCM) survey and minehunting missions. For such missions, operational availability, reliability demands, and system safety are of high importance. To address this, an on-board Fault Detection, Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) system is provided by the manufacturer for basic faults like slow leaks, overdepth, and time-outs due to unreceived operator commands. With that, most AUVs can implement a scripted mission but are generally unable to recover from more complex failures like low energy, or reduced functionality in hydroplanes. These two cases are presented here as implemented examples. The examples show that an autonomous on-board recovery system could be devised and implemented for timely recovery from these types of failures. With such measures, the AUV can be adaptive and as fault tolerant as possible to unexpected changes in itself, the environment and the mission. The recovery employed machine learning to gain insight into the best solution for a specific failure and the reason for failure from observations on faults/failures. Further, dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) are proposed as a novel FDIR approach towards AUV reliability for long endurance NMCM missions. DBN are suited to address partial observability, uncertainties inherent in the AUV subsystems' evolution, and the subsystems' interaction with the harsh and uncertain environment. This makes advanced reactive and preventive fault/failure recovery possible.	[Seto, Mae.

The reason for using inductance for fault detection and its severity estimation is the obvious impact of the fault on the inductances. This fault reduces the effective number of turns and therefore inductances. The PMSM is modeled using magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC). This method takes into account the impacts of stator teeth, rotor yoke, and stator winding distribution precisely. So, it is shown that the MEC method is superior to other analytical methods such as winding function. The governing equations in different parts of the machine are proposed, and the MEC equations of the PMSM are developed. First, healthy and faulty PMSM is simulated using MEC for different severities of the fault. In the 2nd stage, the required analytical equations for self-inductance and mutual inductance estimation are extracted, and the impact of the fault severity upon these inductances is determined. Finally, inter-turn short-circuit fault is detected, and its severity is determined using the amplitude of the inductance of the faulty phase.

Signal processing converts the raw data into useful features to make the diagnostic operations. These features should be independent from the normal working conditions of the machine and the external noise. They should be sensitive only to faults in the machine. Therefore, providing more efficient processing techniques in order to achieve more useful features of the signal and faster and more accurate fault detection have been considered by researchers. This project applies the improved Hilbert-Huang Transform to decompose the signal into narrow frequency bands and extract instantaneous frequency and wavelet packet transform to remove the initial signal noise in vibration signal due to the broken rotor bars fault to achieve more useful features of vibration signals for the next stages of diagnosis. Comparison of Hilbert transform amplitude spectrum and detected instantaneous frequency by the Hilbert Huang Transform and the improved Hilbert-Huang transform techniques and combining the improved Hilbert-Huang transform and wavelet packet transform indicate the superiority of the combined technique to detect frequencies of the fault.

There have been prior attempts using just traditional prediction techniques. In this paper, we propose a two-stage model that employs a technique from time series analysis to predict when the machine tends to be failed for one day in advance. The first stage focuses on forecasting trends of each sensor using "Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)." Then, the second stage aims to classify failure mode using the predicted sensor values. The experiment was conducted on data collected from eight sensors within one year. The result is shown that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms an existing technique, Regression Artificial Neural Network.

An adaptive self-recurrent wavelet neural network as a nonlinear system identifier provides estimate of a nonlinear model to generate appropriate fault symptoms based on the gate signals and actual motor currents. The significant contribution of this work is combining componentbased and system-based fault diagnosis methods. A componentbased signal is defined as the input of the identifier, while a systembased signal is used as the output. Advantage of the proposed method is the ability of detecting inverter faults in less than one millisecond without deploying extra hardware. This method is applicable in current controlled, speed controlled, and speed sensorless systems. The fault detection scenario is followed by a classifier to locate the fault. Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machines have been implemented to identify the fault location. The evaluations are supported by a laboratory setup.

The MOSFET is subject to the multiple electro-mechanical stresses simultaneously during its operation. The degradation in MOSFET is random in nature due to these stresses along with manufacturing imperfection. The noise in the fault precursor measurement system results in large variation in the remaining useful life (RUL). In this paper, a continuous time (CT) framework based RUL estimation technique is proposed using the drain to source on-time resistance (R-DS,R-ON) as the fault precursor. The CT framework is utilized to capture the dynamics of the system. The CT Markov Process (CTMP) in conjunction with Continuous time (CT) Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) Particle Filter (PF) is used to simulate the trajectory of the R-DS,R-ON considering noise in measurement system. This simulated trajectory is then used to estimate the RUL of the MOSFET. The RUL estimation of the proposed method is compared with the RUL estimation of Kalman filter (KF) and Discrete Time Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) PF using the experimental data of the R-DS,R-ON of the MOSFET.

J	Warriach, EU; Tei, K				Warriach, Ehsan Ullah; Tei, Kenji			A comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for faults detection in wireless sensor networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						WSNs; wireless sensor networks; data and system faults; fault detection; machine learning; data analysis; internet of things; reliability		Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployment experiences show that collected data is prone to be faulty. Faults are due to internal and external influences, such as calibration, low battery, environmental interference and sensor aging. In this paper, we focus on faults occurred due to low battery and calibration in WSNs. Machine learning algorithms have been successfully used to identify and classify various types of faults. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the performance of k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms by using the real-world datasets to identify and classify the faults. We present here a comparative study of the above mentioned approaches on experimental datasets. The approach is validated using real data obtained from over one month of samples from motes deployed in an actual living lab. The results show that the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) algorithm obtained a better fault detection rate than other algorithms based on given performance metrics.

RUL knowledge enables aircraft maintenance managers to plan repair/replacement actions weil in time thereby making flight operation safe with reduced downtimes. Different Model-based, Stochastic-based and Data-based models are used for prognostics and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction [I]. In the aircraft lifespan, stresses are mainly originated during landing and take-off phases. Due to these stresses, the surface of an aircraft structure undergoes deformation, which leads to crack initiation and subsequent crack growth [2]. The objective of the proposed research work is to predict the remaining useful life of A310 wing using linear elastic fracture mechanics based technique known as Paris Law. Paris Law offers the rate of damage growth with respect to number of loading cycles as each loading cycle comprises of takeoff, cruise and landing phases. Stresses subjected to aircraft wings during each loading cycle are required for RUL prediction using Paris law. These stresses are evaluated using finite element analysis of A310 aircraft wing. Actual historical NDT data of crack growth on counter-sunk rivet holes on A310 wing acquired from PIA NDT center is used to show the efficacy of the proposed RUL prediction methodology. The details of modeling and results will be presented in the conference.

In general, when new SPL products are developed, more tests are generated to cover new or modified features. A dominant source of extra effort for such tests is the concretization of newly generated tests. Thus, minimizing the amount of new non-concretized tests required to perform conformance testing on new products reduces the overall test effort. In this paper, we propose a test reuse strategy for conformance testing of SPL products that aims at reducing test effort. We use incremental test generation methods based on finite state machines (FSMs) to maximize test reuse. We combine these methods with a selection algorithm used to identify non-redundant concretized tests. We illustrate our strategy using examples and a case study with an embedded mobile SPL. The results indicate that our strategy can save up to 36% of test effort in comparison to current test reuse strategies for the same fault detection capability.

Over time, aging of structural systems constructed with concrete and steel will occur. This deterioration may reduce service life of nuclear facilities and/or lead to unnecessary or untimely repairs. Therefore, online monitoring of structures in nuclear power plants and waste storage has drawn significant attention in recent years. Of many existing non-destructive evaluation and structural monitoring approaches, acoustic emission is promising for assessment of structural damage because it is non-intrusive and is sensitive to corrosion and crack growth in reinforced concrete elements. To provide a rapid, actionable, and graphical means for interpretation Intensity Analysis plots have been developed. This approach provides a means for classification of damage. Since the acoustic emission measurement is only an indirect indicator of structural damage, potentially corrupted by non genuine data, it is more suitable to estimate the states of corrosion and cracking in a Bayesian estimation framework. In this paper, we will utilize the accelerated corrosion data from a specimen at the University of South Carolina to develop a particle filtering-based diagnosis and prognosis algorithm. Promising features of the proposed algorithm are described in terms of corrosion state estimation and prediction of degradation over time to a predefined threshold.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Healthcare analytics; Optimization algorithms; Heart diseases classification		With the advent of voluminous medical database, healthcare analytics in big data have become a major research area. Healthcare analytics are playing an important role in big data analysis issues by predicting valuable information through data mining and machine learning techniques. This prediction helps physicians in making right decisions for successful diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. In this paper, an evolution based hybrid methodology is used to develop a healthcare analytic model exploiting data mining and machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed model may assist physicians to diagnose various types of heart diseases and to identify the associated risk factors with high accuracy. The developed model is evaluated with the results reported by the literature algorithms in diagnosing heart diseases by taking the case study of Cleveland heart disease database. A great prospective of conducting this research is to diagnose any disease in less time with less number of factors or symptoms. The proposed healthcare analytic model is capable of reducing the search space significantly while analyzing the big data, therefore less number of computing resources will be consumed.

Based on an innovative architecture, the Holder-type system contributes to machine equipment diagnosis and to early warnings on potential flaws in the functioning of the machine. The system is able to determine, in real time, the causes of the warnings and of the emergency stops of the machine, in order to avoid any potential failures, or the rendering inoperative of the machine. These causes can be established by monitoring the critical parameters of the machine: vibrations, temperature, and quality of the lubricating oil. Setting up the HolderCPS system, next to the rotary bladed machines, increases machine reliability by means of reliability-centered maintenance. As such, data collected and processed on the basis of algorithms relating to high speed mechanical systems, allow local diagnosis of the current state of the machine, or data transfer, by remote connection, to a laboratory where an off-line analysis can be performed.

Extracting the intrinsic fault signature in very early stage is important. In this point of view, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model of industrial bearing including efficient fault signature extraction technique based on narrow band frequency domain analysis of acoustic emission (AE) signal using envelope power spectrum. To do that, AE signals are collected from defective and non-defective bearings under different rotational speeds from industrial-like experimental environment. Envelope power spectrum is calculated from the AE signal and narrow band root mean square (NBRMS) fault features are extracted from defect frequency ranges of the envelope power spectrum. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification algorithm is used for identifying the fault of unknown signal and validating the efficiency of the proposed feature extraction model. The experimental result shows that the proposed model outperforms state-of-art algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.	[Islam, Md.

A NILM system installed on an engine room subpanel of U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Cutter SPENCER collected aggregated power consumption data for ten automated systems. A correlation-based transient identifier is used to disaggregate this data, identifying specific automated load events, including on/off events of the gray water disposal pump. A two-parameter model is calculated from these events and used for fault detection. Data collected during two operational periods of the SPENCER demonstrate the effectiveness of this model in identifying a pump sensor fault previously undetected by the crew. Early identification of such malfunctions prevents costly wear on the gray water disposal system pumps and avoids eventual catastrophic failure.

The approach is based on a decision making supervisory loop for situation awareness and control combined with a machine learning technique that is especially well suited to this control problem. The goal is to achieve a number of functional requirements: (1) ultra-low false alarm probabilities for all monitored transducers, components, machines, systems, and processes; (2) fastest mathematically possible decisions regarding the incipience or onset of anomalies in noisy process metrics; and (3) the ability to unambiguously differentiate between sensor degradation events and degradation in the systems/processes under surveillance. The novel approach that is presented here does not replace the role of the human in operation of complex engineering systems and processes, but rather augments that role in a manner that minimizes cognitive overload by very rapidly processing, interpreting, and displaying final diagnostic and prognostic information to the human operator in a prioritized format that is readily perceived and comprehended.

It is important to optimize the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of assets, in this case, passenger bus fleets. The paper presents a predictive condition monitoring maintenance approach based on engine oil analysis, to assess the potential impact of this variable on the availability of buses. The approach has implications on maintenance costs during the life of a bus and, consequently, on the determination of the best time for bus replacement. The paper provides an overview of economic replacement models through a global model, with an emphasis on availability and its dependence on maintenance and maintenance costs. These factors help to determine the size of the reserve fleet and guarantee availability.

Existing methods mostly rely on hand-crafted time-consuming preprocessing of data to acquire suitable features. In contrast, the proposed method automatically mines features from the RAW temporal signals without any preprocessing. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in our method to train the raw vibration data. As powerful feature exactor and classifier, CNN can learn to acquire features most suitable for the classification task by being trained. According to the results of the experiments, when fed in enough training samples, CNN outperforms the exist methods. The proposed method can also be applied to solve intelligent diagnosis problems of other machine systems..

Variable response to warming and ocean acidification by bacterial processes in different plankton communities	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Interactive effects; Extracellular enzyme activity; Bacterial production; Bacterial diversity; Southwest Pacific	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL FOOD-WEB; BACTERIOPLANKTON ACTIVITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; TEMPERATURE; CARBON; CO2; PH; SYSTEM; SEA	Extracellular bacterial enzymes play an important role in the degradation of organic matter in the surface ocean but are sensitive to changes in pH and temperature. This study tested the individual and combined effects of lower pH (-0.3) and warming (+3 degrees C) projected for the year 2100 on bacterial abundance, process rates and diversity in plankton communities of differing composition from 4 locations east of New Zealand. Variation was observed in magnitude and temporal response between the different communities during 5 to 6 day incubations. Leucine aminopeptidase activity showed the strongest response, with an increase in potential activity under low pH alone and in combination with elevated temperature in 3 of 4 incubations. Temperature had a greater effect on bacterial cell numbers and protein synthesis, with stronger responses in the elevated temperature and combined treatments. However, the most common interactive effect between temperature and pH was antagonistic, with lower bacterial secondary production in the combined treatment relative to elevated temperature, and lower leucine aminopeptidase activity in the combined treatment relative to low pH. These results highlight the variability of responses to and interactions of environmental drivers, and the importance of considering these in experimental studies and prognostic models of microbial responses to climate change.

J	Wu, J; Wu, CY; Lv, YQ; Deng, C; Shao, XY				Wu, Jun; Wu, Chaoyong; Lv, Yaqiong; Deng, Chao; Shao, Xinyu			Design a degradation condition monitoring system scheme for rolling bearing using EMD and PCA	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Performance degradation; Rolling bearing; Signal processing	USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATION; FAULT-DETECTION	Purpose - Rolling bearings based on rotating machinery are one of the most widely used in industrial applications because of their low cost, high performance and robustness. The purpose of this paper is to describe how to identify degradation condition of rolling bearing and predict its fault time in big data environment in order to achieve zero downtime performance and preventive maintenance for the rolling bearing. Design/methodology/approach - The degradation characteristic parameters of rolling bearings including intrinsic mode energy and failure frequency were, respectively, extracted from the pre-processed original vibration signals using EMD and Hilbert transform. Then, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and PCA were used to obtain the health index of the rolling bearing so as to detect the appearance of degradations. Furthermore, the degradation condition of the rolling bearings might be identified through implementing the monotonicity analysis, robustness analysis and degradation analysis of the health index. Findings - The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a case study. The result shows that the proposed method can be applied to monitor the degradation condition of the rolling bearings in industrial application. Research limitations/implications - Further experiment remains to be done so as to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using Apache Hadoop when massive sensor data are available. Practical implications - The paper proposes a methodology for rolling bearing condition monitoring representing the steps that need to be followed. Real-time sensor data are utilized to find the degradation characteristics. Originality/value - The result of the work presented in this paper form the basis for the software development and implementation of condition monitoring system for rolling bearings based on Hadoop.

Design/methodology/approach - In the present paper the authors describe a new method of prognosis to improve the accuracy of forecasting the system state. This framework of forecasting integrates the model-based information and the hybrid approach, which employs the structured residuals in the first part and the particle filter in the second part. Findings - The performance of the suggested fusion framework is employed to predict the RUL of battery pack in hybrid electric vehicle. The results show that the proposed method is plausible due to the good prediction of RUL, and can be effectively applied to many systems for prognosis. Originality/value - In this study the authors illustrate how the suggested method can provide an accurate prediction of the RUL over conventional data-driven methods without physical model and classical particle filter with a single damage model.

J	Islam, MS; Cho, S; Chong, U				Islam, Md Saiful; Cho, Sangjin; Chong, Uipil			Maximizing Incipient Fault Signatures of Rotating Machines Using Wavelet Entropy and Cyclic Logarithmic Envelope Spectrum	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article						Adaptive filter; Computed order tracking; Cyclic logarithmic envelope spectrum; Tacho signal; Vibration signal; Wavelet entropy	UNSUPERVISED NOISE CANCELLATION; COMPUTED ORDER TRACKING; VIBRATION SIGNALS; LMS ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS; REGULARIZATION; FILTER	This paper presents a constant speed rotating machines fault analysis method to maximize incipient fault signatures based on computed order tracking with adaptive filter and cyclic logarithmic envelope spectrum (CLES) tools. First, adaptive filter reduces not-concerned harmonic components and measurement artefacts from a vibration signal. To accurately and precisely select the step size in the process of the LMS-type adaptive filter, a new method is proposed based on wavelet entropy (WE). Then, a tacho signal is generated from vibration signal and computed order tracking is performed using this tacho signal. Finally, to reduce the effect of second-order cyclostationarity, CLES tool is used to analyze the incipient fault features. Simulations are carried out and the performances of WE and CLES are compared with traditional method. Furthermore, vibration signals of real experimental data are used to verify the robustness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively maximize the incipient fault signatures of rotating machines.

Formal regulations suggest using manual inspection of the ship rotation and the work effectiveness of the engine during manoeuvring in ports and in the open sea regions. The accuracy of this procedure is very low and depends on the personnel of the deck. Therefore, automation and computer control systems are constantly required to assist the human eye. This problem becomes clearly visible when dealing with full ship autonomy in the open sea in the short-sea shipping regions. The trend of maritime technology development will only increase in the area of human interaction decrease with the physical operations and the shipping procedures, which will lead to the future full ship autonomy in the open sea regions around the globe. With the growing automation technologies, predictive control can prove to be a better approach than the traditionally applied visual inspection policy and linear control models. Ship full autonomy is also linked to the ship's machinery regular repair and maintenance that has to be carried out for delivering satisfactory performance and minimizing downtime during transportation operations. In this paper, current stages of development of the intelligent transportation system concept are discussed for the ship autonomy in manoeuvring control and a robust ships' systems integration and communication system concept is presented for several normal and abnormal situations: high-traffic, potentially dangerous situations or port approaching or ship maintenance, with the capability to solve problems with the limited human interface and with a remote control possibility. Then, simplified ship steering motor system for the main pump is analysed for rotation control using control voltage from the converters. Retrieved data from a small experimental control motor is used for the predictive control approach using two different methods: a neural network trained with Basic Levenberg- Marquardt Method and a Linear Model.

An SVMANN Hybrid Classifier for Diagnosis of Gear Fault	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINE; DWT	A hybrid classifier obtained by hybridizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers is presented here for diagnosis of gear faults. The distinctive features obtained from vibration signals of a running gearbox, which was operated in normal and fault-induced conditions, were used to feed the SVM-ANN hybrid classifier. Time-domain vibration signals were divided in segments. Features such as peaks in time domain and in spectrum, central moments, and standard deviations were obtained from signal segments. Based on the experimental results, it was shown that SVM-ANN hybrid classifier can successfully identify gear condition and that the hybrid SVM-ANN classifier performs much better than standard versions of ANNs and SVM. The effectiveness of the hybrid classifier under noise was also investigated. It was shown that if vibration signals are preprocessed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), efficacy of the SVM-ANN hybrid is significantly enhanced.	[Tyagi, Sunil; Panigrahi, S.

An event-based analysis of condition-based maintenance decision-making in multistage production systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						production system analysis; event-based modelling; condition-based maintenance decision-making; permanent production loss; maintenance opportunity window	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; PROGNOSTICS; WORKFORCE; POLICIES	Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is becoming increasingly prevalent because of its capability to continuously track equipment health degradation and accurately predict unscheduled equipment failure. CBM helps to improve the business bottom line by preventing costly station failure. However, it is not uncommon that CBM needs to stop stations for maintenance during operation, which can severely impede the normal production. The objective of this paper is to develop a systematic method to predict the negative impact of CBM stoppage events on production in a multistage manufacturing system. The research helps to predict the real expense of applying CBM, which is the foundation to establish a comprehensive real-time CBM decision-making model. We start from the event-based analysis of system dynamics and develop a stochastic estimation method to predict the permanent production loss caused by a CBM stoppage event. The monotonicity property of permanent production loss is investigated. Simulation case studies are performed to illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate their potential in facilitating CBM decision-making.

J	Lee, D; Pan, R				Lee, Dongjin; Pan, Rong			Predictive maintenance of complex system with multi-level reliability structure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Reliability evaluation; Markov modelling; maintenance planning; Bayesian network; predictive maintenance	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; DEGRADATION; PROGNOSTICS	Onboard sensors, which constantly monitor the states of a system and its components, have made the predictive maintenance (PdM) of a complex system possible. To date, system reliability has been extensively studied with the assumption that systems are either single-component systems or they have a deterministic reliability structure. However, in many realistic problems, there are complex multi-component systems with uncertainties in the system reliability structure. This paper presents a PdM scheme for complex systems by employing discrete time Markov chain models for modelling multiple degradation processes of components and a Bayesian network (BN) model for predicting system reliability. The proposed method can be considered as a special type of dynamic Bayesian network because the same BN is repeatedly used over time for evaluating system reliability and the inter-time-slice connection of the same node is monitored by a sensor. This PdM scheme is able to make probabilistic inference at any system level, so PdM can be scheduled accordingly.

The decomposition products of SF6 under PD and POT can be used to detect and recognize PD and POT, but feature parameters must be selected first. In this paper, three kinds of PD defect models and a gas chamber were designed to simulate PD. A heating rod and a real disconnector chamber were used to simulate POT. By reviewing the decomposition mechanism of SF6 and analyzing the experiment results, three concentration ratios were chosen as feature parameters, that is, c(SO2F2+SOF2+SO2)/c(CO2), c(SOF2)/c(SO2) and c(SOF2+SO2)/c(SO2F2). The physical significance of the proposed three concentration ratios was also analyzed. Finally, fuzzy c-means clustering was employed to test the effectiveness of using these three concentration ratios as feature parameters to expose the difference between PDs and POT. Results showed that the proposed feature parameters performed well and could successfully recognize different kinds of PD and POT.

J	Sun, AX; Che, Y				Sun, Anxin; Che, Ying			A novel compound data classification method and its application in fault diagnosis of rolling bearings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Support vector machine; Fault diagnosis; Data classification; Discrete wavelet transform; Rolling bearing	MACHINE; TOOL	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings. Rolling bearings are widely used in industrial appliances, and their fault diagnosis is of great importance and has drawn more and more attention. Based on the common failure mechanism of failure modes of rolling bearings, this paper proposes a novel compound data classification method based on the discrete wavelet transform and the support vector machine (SVM) and applies it in the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. Design/methodology/approach - Vibration signal contains large quantity of information of bearing status and this paper uses various types of wavelet base functions to perform discrete wavelet transform of vibration and denoise. Feature vectors are constructed based on several time-domain indices of the denoised signal. SVM is then used to perform classification and fault diagnosis. Then the optimal wavelet base function is determined based on the diagnosis accuracy. Findings - Experiments of fault diagnosis of rolling bearings are carried out and wavelet functions in several wavelet families were tested. The results show that the SVM classifier with the db4 wavelet base function in the db wavelet family has the best fault diagnosis accuracy. Originality/value - This method provides a practical candidate for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings in the industrial applications.

Training and education play an important role in the successful implementation of a maintenance strategy. The Center for Predictive Maintenance (CPM) at the University of South Carolina has developed a demonstration methodology and tool that can be used to educate and train users extending from maintainers to leadership on the maintenance process from fault to maintenance action. This overall methodology has been developed so that it can be applied to a variety of industries including general machinery, petroleum and petro chemicals, and water treatment. All of these industries have a need for successful implementation of predictive maintenance programs and this demonstration methodology can be used to train and educate users. This demonstration tool will walk an audience through the maintenance process starting with the collection of sensor and historical data. Then it will show the analysis of the data through modeling and statistical analysis techniques. Finally, the data and results are displayed in unique dashboards that provide personnel with the information needed to make educated decisions on the condition and maintenance of their system.

Mechanical fault detection and classification using pattern recognition based on bispectrum algorithm	ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable Vital Technologies in Engineering and Informatics	NOV 07-09, 2016	Cairo, EGYPT	British Univ Egypt		Vibration Analysis; Bispectrum; Condition Based Maintenance; Machine Learning; Principle Component Analysis; Logistic Regression; Rotating Machinery Fault Detection	DIAGNOSTICS; VIBRATION	Higher order spectral analysis of vibration signals is an efficient tool in condition monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis of rotating machinery. In this paper, features extracted from vibration bispectrum are used in fault classification of critical rotating components in the AH-64D helicopter tail rotor drive train system. Different classifiers are used to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm based on bispectrum to the traditional algorithms based on linear auto-and cross-power spectral analysis techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the size of features extracted from vibration bispectrum and linear spectral analysis, then the reduced set is used to train different classifiers. Using different criteria such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F score, true alarm, and error classification accuracy (ECA), the performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared against similar classification algorithms. The proposed method is verified using realworld data collected from a dedicated AH-64D helicopter drive-train research test bed at the CPM center, University of South Carolina. The proposed algorithm increases the accuracy of fault detection to 96.88%, precession to 95.83%, sensitivity to 95.83%.

Internet of Things - A Complete Solution for Aviation's Predictive Maintenance	ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable Vital Technologies in Engineering and Informatics	NOV 07-09, 2016	Cairo, EGYPT	British Univ Egypt		Predictive Maintenance; Aerospace; Internet of Things; Asset Management; Prediction Algorithms; Natural Language Processing; Data Mining MSG-3; Aviation; Co ndition-Based Maintenance		The University of South Carolina has been involved in research for the US military for helicopters and rotary aircraft for over 18 years. Majority of this work has been focused on optimizing aircraft uptime and flight readiness by leveraging condition-based maintenance (CBM), more commonly known as predictive maintenance (PM). This type of maintenance differs from other classical styles (reactive and preventive) in that it has a high reliability and a low cost. The foundation of PM in any application is data collection and storage. It begins with applying tools such as natural language processing (NLP) to historical maintenance records to determine the most critical components on the aircraft. Data mining of previously collected sensor data is then used to establish the most reliable types of condition indicators (CIs) that monitor the critical components. These thresholds from the CIs can be modified over time as more data is collected. Once a data collection scheme is in place, prognostics can be used to determine the remaining useful life of a component. Using this process, along with an optimized maintenance schedule through the maintenance steering group (MSG-3) program, helps to eliminate unnecessary maintenance actions on the aircraft, as well as, reduce the inventory of components needed for the aircraft to operate. After this maintenance scheme has been set up, the Internet of Things (IoT) can be leveraged to allow the entire process to operate within a single environment. This further develops the solution, and allows actions to be executed more quickly than if they were performed individually. The expected benefits and future development of these practices will never come to fruition unless personnel are properly educated and trained. Developing a culture of predictive maintenance practices in an aviation environment is necessary to ensure success of this solution.	[Edwards, Travis; Bayoumi, Abdel; Eisner, Lester M.

However, one inevitable problem that hinders AE of being practically applied in rotating machine fault detection is the transmission of AE signal inside the machine, as AE signal generally comprises high frequency components of typically 100kHz to 1MHz which will require transmission system to have extremely high data-rate for real-time monitoring. Traditional digital wireless system, for instance, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, cannot satisfy the requirement. This paper addresses the issue of wireless AE transmission for rotating machine, with a modified analogue AE wireless transmission system. Piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS), a labcrafted miniature sensor was adopted to fulfill the need of small system.

This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that detects bearing faults and monitors the operating status of rolling element bearings in modern rotating machineries. Based on redundant second-generation wavelet packet transform and local characteristic-scale decomposition, this method is implemented to extract the fault features, the vibration signal is adaptively decomposed into a number of desired intrinsic scale components by two-step screening processes based on the energy ratio, and reduce random noises and eliminate the pseudofrequency components. The fault features are then used to implement the identification classification of faults using singular value decomposition and extreme learning machine. The approach is evaluated by simulation and practical bearing vibration signals under different conditions.

The DGA data of transformer in smart grid have the characteristics of large quantity, multiple types, and low value density. In view of DGA big data's characteristics, the paper first proposes a new combined fault diagnosis method for transformer, in which a variety of fault diagnosis models are used to make a preliminary diagnosis, and then the support vector machine is used to make the second diagnosis. The method adopts the intelligent complementary and blending thought, which overcomes the shortcomings of single diagnosis model in transformer fault diagnosis, and improves the diagnostic accuracy and the scope of application of the model. Then, the training and deployment strategy of the combined diagnosis model is designed based on Storm and Spark platform, which provides a solution for the transformer fault diagnosis in big data environment.

Health monitoring is the continuous measurement of the loading environment and the critical responses of systems or its components. The present work deals with mainly the application of EMI technique to assess damage in RC Column using concrete embedded PZT sensors. Two vertical RC Columns of different characteristics with embedded CVS are tested under fatigue loading conditions through shake table and their peak voltages were observed with time history till failure. The scope of the project is to full fledge damage prognosis of RC Column under fatigue load with an attempt to forecast system performance assessing the current damage state of the system (i.e. Structural Health Monitoring) and ultimately predict through simulation and past experience the remaining useful life of the system. Through this experiment it is concluded that in SHM, the CVS are effective to quantify local damage in RC structure. Natural frequency of column is a direct measure for stiffness and is observed decreasing with increasing damage & remaining life of RC Column specimen under fatigue loads is estimated. A formula has been devised for this purpose. The future objective of this project includes quantification of damage by modelling the structure as a combination of mass, spring and damper components and comparing both the experimental and analytical values to derive empirical relation to estimate remaining life of structure under fatigue.

The fault on the gear tooth may be identified with this technique. In this work, the AE is assessed to identify the presence of the crack at the root of gear tooth. Experimental investigation was performed on the IAE gear lubrication testing machine. Results obtained from these testing shows the parameter of the AE event, AE rms, changes at the different load condition for healthy as well as cracked gear. It was postulated that AE technique is capable to diagnosis the crack in the gear tooth at different load condition. Hence, AE technique has significant potential for the evaluation of condition of gearbox. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Expanding traffic network capacities by building more roads is both extremely costly and harmful to the environment. By far the best way to accommodate growing travel demand is to make more efficient use of existing networks. Portugal has a good but underused toll highway network that runs near to an urban/national road network that is free to use but congested. In choosing not to pay a toll, many Portuguese drivers are apparently accepting greater risk to their safety and longer travel times. As a result, the urban/national road network is used far more intensively than projections anticipated, which raises maintenance costs while increasing levels of risk and inconvenience. The main idea behind the work presented here, is to motivate a shift of traffic from the overused network to the underused network. To this end, a model for calculating variable toll fees needs to be developed. In order to support the model, there is the need to accurately predict the status of road networks for real-time, short and medium term horizons, by using machine learning algorithms. Such algorithms will be used to feed the dynamic toll pricing model, reflecting the present and future traffic situations on the network. Since traffic data quantity and quality are crucial to the prediction accuracy of road networks' statuses, the real-time and predictive analytics methods will use a panoply of data sources. The approach presented here, is being developed under the scope of the H2020 OPTIMUM, a European R&D project on ITS.

TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION BASED ON ROBUST LOCAL MEAN DECOMPOSITION	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2016, VOL. 14			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE2016)	NOV 11-17, 2016	Phoenix, AZ	Amer Soc Mech Engineers			MACHINERY FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROTATING MACHINERY	Fourier transform based frequency representation makes an underlying assumption of stationarity and linearity for the target signal whose spectrum is to be computed, and thus it is unable to track time varying characteristics of non-stationary signals that also widely exist in the physical world. Time-frequency representation (TFR) is a technique to reveal useful information included in the signals, and thus the TFR methods are very attractive to the scientific and engineering world. Local mean decomposition (LMD) is a TFR technique used in many fields, e.g. machinery fault diagnosis. Similar to Hilbert-Huang transform, it is an alternative approach to demodulate amplitude-modulation (AM) and frequency-modulation (FM) signals into a set of components, each of which is the product of an instantaneous envelope signal and a pure FM signal. TFR can then be derived by the instantaneous envelope signal and the pure FM signal. However, LMD based TFR technique still has two limitations, i.e. the end effect and the mode mixing problems. Solutions for the two limitations greatly depend on three critical parameters of LMD that are boundary condition, envelope estimation, and sifting stopping criterion. Most reported studies aiming to improve performance of LMD have focused on only one parameter a time, and thus they ignore the fact that the three parameters are not independent to each other, and all of them are needed to address the end effect and the mode mixing problems in LMD. In this paper, a robust optimization approach is proposed to improve performance of LMD through an integrated framework of parameter selection in terms of boundary condition, envelope estimation, and sifting stopping criterion. The proposed optimization approach includes three components. First, the mirror extending method is employed to deal with the boundary condition problem. Second, moving average is used as the smooth algorithm for envelope estimation of local mean and local magnitude in LMD. The fixed subset size is the only parameter that usually needs to be predefined with a prior knowledge. In this step, a self-adaptive method based on the statistics theory is proposed to automatically determine a fixed subset size of moving average for accurate envelope estimation. Third, based on the first and the second steps, a soft sifting stopping criterion is proposed to enable LMD to achieve a self-adaptive stop for each sifting process. In this last step, we define an objective function that considers both global and local characteristics of a target signal. Based on the objective function, a heuristic mechanism is proposed to automatically determine the optimal number of sifting iterations in the sifting process. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the robust LMD in terms of mining time-frequency representation information.

Faults are usually associated with wear and leakage processes, which cause significant decreases in performance. This paper discusses about the advantages to implement a Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) and the use of techniques of fault diagnosis in axial variable displacement piston pumps (VDAP), as they are: Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) and other hybrid models. The results of this investigation provide guidelines for the selection of the most suitable technique to prevent faults in VDAP in order to help reducing down time, increase productivity and competitiveness of companies that requires the use of fluid power systems by enabling the implementation of a non-intrusive fault diagnosis management system, which must be reliable, economical and easily accessible to the industry.

Therefore, prognostics is essential to predict the RUL of systems and components. However, a big issue of uncertainty prevails in prognostics due to the fact that prognostics pertains to prediction of future state, which is affected by uncertainty. While various researches have been done in areas of prognostics and health management, they lack to perform RUL predictions efficiently. There is a need for an efficient comprehensive framework for quantifying uncertainty in prognostics. The research question to this study is: can meshfree modeling be used in probabilistic prognostics to efficiently predict RUL? The specific aims developed to answer the research question are (1) develop a computational framework for probabilistic prognostics of a fatigue life of a component using meshfree modeling, and (2) perform case study analyses on fatigue life of a cantilever beam. A probabilistic framework was developed that efficiently predicts the RUL of a component using a combination of the meshfree method known as local radial point interpolation method and a fatigue degradation model. Loading uncertainty is quantified and employed in the framework. The computational framework is easily customizable and computationally efficient and, hence, aids in decision making and fault mitigation. As a case study, the RUL of a cantilever beam under plane stress subjected to fatigue loadings was analyzed. Uncertainties in the RUL were quantified in terms of probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, and 98% bounds of confidence interval. Sensitivity analysis was studied and computational efficiency of the framework was also investigated using first order reliability method and Monte Carlo method. When compared to the Monte Carlo method, first order reliability method provides reasonably good results and is found to be computationally more efficient.

Consequently, rub impact fault is more likely to occur. It has become one of the most common and serious malfunctions for rotor system in practical engineering. Because the rub-impact severely induces the rotor dynamic instability, it will finally result in catastrophic failures and great economic loss if undetected in time. The occurrence of the rub-impact leads to a contact force between rotating shaft and stator which can be regarded as an additional support on the rotor system. The contact force will further result in the stiffening effect. As a result, some fast time varying phenomena of vibration responses including the fast time-varying transient stiffness and the fast oscillated instantaneous frequency (IF) may appear. These phenomena may offer abundant characteristics to diagnose the rub-impact fault of rotor system. In this paper, an effective method based on the fast oscillated characteristics of IF for vibration responses is proposed to detect rub-impact fault of rotor bearing system. First of all, the fast time-varying transient stiffness of rub-impact rotor system is qualitatively formulated based on the Jeffcott rotor model and the fast oscillated characteristics of IF is presented and theoretically analyzed. Second, a time-frequency technique called nonlinear squeezing time-frequency transform (NSTFT) is introduced to extract the fast oscillated IF resulting from the rub-impact fault of rotor systems. Numerical simulations are respectively conducted on the Jeffcott rotor system with linear stiffness and oil film bearings. And then the oscillated characteristics of the IF are analyzed. The analysis results suggest that the IF of the vibration responses remains constant at the rotating frequency if there is no rub-impact fault. However, if rub-impact fault occurs, the IF of the vibration responses will oscillate periodically around the basic harmonic frequency. Furthermore, the oscillation law of the IF of vibration responses for rub impact rotor systems is also numerically investigated. It is found that the oscillation frequency is the 1/k (k = 1,2,3,...) of the rotating frequency if the rotor system operates at periodic-k motion. Finally, rub-impact fault experiments are performed under different operating regimes. The experimental results are consistent with the numerical results, thus demonstrating the validity and the practicability of the proposed method.

At the same time, data deluge about the conditions of machines come into being with the development of sensor technology and information technology. It provides opportunities and challenges to solve the fault problems of mechanical equipment. Information fusion seems to be a useful solution, which is the process of integration of multiple data and knowledge representing the same object into a consistent, accurate, and useful representation. A novel information fusion model, with hybrid-type fusion architecture, is built in this paper. This model consists of data layer, feature layer and decision layer, based on a new Dempster/Shafer (D-S) evidence algorithm. After the data preprocessing based on event reasoning in data layer and feature layer, the information will be fused based on the new algorithm in feature layer and decision layer. Application of this information fusion model in fault diagnosis is beneficial in two aspects, diagnostic applicability and diagnostic accuracy. An effect can be caused by different faults. This information fusion model can solve this problem and increase the number of recognizable faults, to expand the range of fault diagnosis. Additionally, this model can overcome the uncertainty of information and equipment to increase diagnostic accuracy. Two case studies are implemented by this information fusion model to evaluate it. In the first case, fault probabilities calculated by different methods are adopted as inputs to diagnose a fault, which is quite different to be detected based on the information from a single system. The second case is about sensor fault diagnosis. Fault signals are planted into the measured parameters for the diagnostic system, to test the ability to consider the uncertainty of measured parameters. The case study result shows that the model can identify the fault more effectively and accurately. Meanwhile, it has good expansibility, which may be used in more fields.

However, the complex damage mechanisms and failure modes are still not well-understood and limit their wide-spread applications. It is critical to monitor the structural heath for improved understanding of damage evolution and accurate life estimation. Ultrasonic wave based structure health monitoring (SHM) technique is a promising approach and has been investigated by many researchers. However, for the techniques to be reliable, it is necessary to understand the wave propagation behavior in composites. A fully coupled numerical simulation model has been developed to understand wave propagation and dissipation in composites under different excitation frequencies. The model is based on the local interaction simulation approaches/sharp interface model (LISA/SIM), and is computationally efficient compared to traditional finite element methods. This model is used to emulate wave behavior in composites in the current work. The output sensor signals are processed using matching pursuit decomposition algorithm to study the zero-order anti-symmetric and symmetric Lamb wave modes, including attenuation effects and dispersion. The results show good agreement with published experiments. Sensitivity studies show that wave velocities and amplitudes vary significantly with changes in the material properties and stiffness.

However, existing nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and/or structural health monitoring (SHM) system are not efficient to detect such damages and often demand transformative approach over the existing techniques. Here, we present a novel ultrasonic method for identification of the distribution of the probable damage sites as an indication of the percentage of degradation of the material properties on a typical representative volume element (RVE). An American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard unidirectional (UD) carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP) specimen was tested under 250,000 cycles mechanical loading and 500 cycles thermal loading. Scanning Acoustic Microcopy (SAM) was used to perform Z-scan of the specimen on a particular area (6mmx6mm) of the specimen. Surface skimming ultrasonic wave velocity (SAW) profile on a representative volume element (RVE) was calculated before and after loading the specimen. A 2D map of decreased SAW regions were calculated after the loading. Statistical analysis of the SAW profile was performed to study the distributed damage evolution in the material. It is found that the damaged regions often coalesce as loading cycle increases and such sites can be predicted from the SAW profile. In addition, we also presented a nonlocal mechanics based ultrasonic technique to study damage evolution with thermomechanical loading. Nonlocal parameters were also calculated on the selected RVE by using Quasi longitudinal wave velocity along the thickness direction. Using micro-morphic wave dispersion curve, for a selected frequency at 50 MHz. Damage Entropy (DE) was calculated from the distribution of the nonlocal parameter. We also performed optical microcopy (OM) of the selected area to investigate the development of the damages and to validate the SAW results. This work has potential to estimate the remaining useful life of the structure and provide useful information about the distributed damages states, which in turn will help Condition Based Maintenance (CBM+) of the critical locations of the structure while maintaining the aircrafts and the defense equipment.

Among the available techniques, vision-based on-line monitoring of wear particles in the lubricant circuit is preferred, where three-dimensional particle characterizations can be obtained for wear mode analysis. This article presents the application of an imaging system that captures wear particles in lubricant flow and the development of image processing procedures for multiview feature extraction. In particular, a framework including background subtraction, object segmentation, and debris tracking was adopted. Particle features were then used in a comprehensive morphological description of wear debris. Experiments showed that the system is able to produce a feasible and reliable indication of wear debris characteristics for machine condition monitoring.

J	Brito, GC; Machado, RD; Neto, AC				Brito Junior, Geraldo Carvalho; Machado, Roberto Dalledone; Neto, Anselmo Chaves			Using Simplified Models to Assist Fault Detection and Diagnosis in Large Hydrogenerators	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROTATING MACHINERY			English	Article								Based on experimental evidence collected in a set of twenty 700 MW hydrogenerators, this article shows that the operating conditions of large hydrogenerators journal bearings may have unpredictable and significant changes, without apparent reasons. These changes prevent the accurate determination of bearing dynamic coefficients and make the prediction of these machines dynamic behavior unfeasible, even using refined models. This makes it difficult to differentiate the normal changes in hydrogenerators dynamics from the changes created by a fault event. To overcome such difficulty, this article proposes a back-to-basics step, the using of simplified mathematical models to assist hydrogenerators vibration monitoring and exemplifies this proposal by modeling a 700 MW hydrogenerator. A first model estimates the influence of changes in bearing operating conditions in the bearing stiffnesses, considering only the hydrodynamic effects of an isoviscous oil film with linear thickness distribution. A second model simulates hydrogenerators dynamics using only 10 degrees of freedom, giving the monitored vibrations as outputs, under normal operating conditions or in the presence of a fault. This article shows that simplified models may give satisfactory results when bearing operating conditions are properly determined, results comparable to those obtained by more refined models or by measurements in the modeled hydrogenerator.

The developed approach employs a statistical learning framework for adaptively learning of time-series degradation performance, and then a Bayesian technique for self-updating of data-driven models to adapt the operational or environmental changes. With the developed approach, the prognosis technique can eliminate the dependence to system specific models and be adaptive to system performance changes due to degradation or variation of system operational conditions, thereby yielding accurate remaining useful life predictions. The developed methodology is demonstrated by an engineering case study.

Detection of sources of vibration will be made based on the amplitude spectra and phase relationships of vibrations of individual machine parts, using the envelope of technology in detecting recurring events with low levels of the measured signal and processing of high-frequency signal in the range of acoustic emission. Because the display of a set of symptoms to the space of fault conditions for these methods is not simple, it is advisable to use a multi-parameter approach which means that important decisions are made on the basis of different types of measurements, for example, with using techniques of modal analysis and operational modal analysis.

In the following study, the internal resistance growth of a battery have been considered as the ageing parameter in terms of an empirical model developed based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test data. The obtained model is used in a particle filtering (PF) framework to make end of life (EOL) predictions at various stages of its lifecycle. Finally, the predictions were validated with experimental results using coin cell data and quite good matches were obtained.	[Guha, Arijit; Patra, Amit; Vaisakh, K.

It is emerging as a critical cyber-physical system (CPS) infrastructure. CPS comes across as systems with a tight integration between the physical and the cyber layers in addition to the communication network. This exposes it to a risk of mis-operation when subjected to false or malicious data injection from intruders or adversaries. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a data analytics based cyber defense strategy of a substation automation system (SAS) by developing an intelligent module which uses Support vector machine (SVM) along with Principal component analysis (PCA). We propose a two stage approach for detecting the false data injection by an intruder into the system. First stage reduces the high dimensional dataset to a lower dimension using PCA and the second stage uses SVM on the reduced dataset for detecting the malicious attempts of introducing false data into the system. The proposed module uses the measurement values received from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Upon receiving a fault signal, the protection system initiates checks on incoming data patterns and compares it with the behavior of system dynamics. Using data analytics tools the fault condition signaling is classified as actual (real) fault or false (fake) fault with malicious intentions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on three bus power network.

Application and Evaluation of Random Forest Classifier Technique for Fault Detection in Bioreactor Operation	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Bioreactor; Fault detection; Neural network; Random forest; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; BATCH; PENICILLIN	Bioreactors and associated bioprocesses are quite complex and nonlinear in nature. A small change in initial condition can greatly alter the output product quality. It is pretty difficult at times to model the system mathematically. In this work, the fault detection problem is studied in the context of bioreactors, mainly, a reactor from the penicillin production process. It is very important to identify the faults in a live process to avoid product quality deterioration. We have focused on the process history-based methods to identify the faults in a bioreactor. We want to introduce random forest (RF), a powerful machine learning algorithm, to identify several types of faults in a bioreactor. The algorithm is simple, easy to use, shows very good generalization ability without compromising much on the classification accuracies, and also has an ability to give variable importance as a part of the algorithm output. We compared its performance with two popular methods, namely support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN), and found that the overall performance is superior in terms of classification accuracies and generalization ability.

Bearing failure can result in serious damage of the machine. This paper aims to develop a bearing fault diagnosis method using parameter evaluation technique to improve the diagnosis accuracy. The parameter evaluation technique is used to select five features that are used as predictors in multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification. The purpose of this feature reduction was to avoid the curse of dimensionality and to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. The diagnosis process was performed by classification of bearing states using one-against-one method multi-class SVM. Three types of kernel functions i. e., linear, polynomial, and Gaussian RBF were used in the SVM classification. The bearing conditions which is diagnosed in this paper were normal bearing, inner race fault, and outer race fault conditions. As a result, the classification performance of multiclass SVM using five selected features as the parameter have excellent performance in predict the bearing conditions data for all types of kernel functions.

AFPMmachines (AFPMMs) have various advantages but they are sensitive to geometrical imperfections for manufacturing aspect. The main aim of this paper is to propose a general analytical model to analyze the AFPMMs with various types of eccentricities. The radial and tangential magnetic flux densities in the air gap under healthy condition are obtained via combination of Maxwell's equations and Schwarz-Christoffel (SC) mapping firstly. Next, in order to investigate the eccentricities, equations for air gap length and radii are deduced. The back electromotive force (EMF) is calculated and compared with those from healthy condition and finite element (FE) analysis, respectively. The results show that the analytical predictions agree well with the FE results. Moreover, using this method has a significantly less time consuming than the 3D FM simulation process, which is a great advantage of this method. Finally, the analytical model is verified via experimental results.

Focusing on the returnless type fuel delivery. systems, our approach is based on estimating the fuel pump workload based on the model learned from the past driving history. Statistical reliability models are then exploited to estimate failure probability. These models are formulated in terms of the workload and updated from data available from vehicles in the field. Numerical examples which illustrate the proposed methodology are reported. Compared to alternative approaches, which are based on detailed physics-based degradation modeling and/or electrical signal analysis, our approach is data-driven, exploits connected vehicle analytics and reliability based modeling, and has a potential to lead to simpler implementations.

Sensitivity analysis is done on this model to identify the effect of parameter variations on the State of Health (SOH) prediction. The sensitivity analysis shows that the aging model alone is not robust enough to perform long term predictions, hence we propose to use online parameter estimation algorithms to adapt the model parameters. Four different estimation methods are compared using aging campaign. It is demonstrated that the estimation algorithms improve aging model leading to significant improvement in Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction.

In the system, rotation speed sensors were used to gather these signals of forward speed and rotation speeds of intermediate shaft, conveying trough, tangential and longitudinal flow threshing rotors, grain conveying auger. Using C8051 single chip microcomputer (SCM) as processor for main control unit, faults diagnosis and forward speed control were carried through by rotation speed ratio analysis of each channel rotation speed and intermediate shaft rotation speed by use of multi-sensor fused fuzzy control algorithm, and these processing results would be sent to touch screen and display work status of combine harvester. Field trials manifest that fault monitoring and load feedback control system has good man-machine interaction and the fault diagnosis method based on rotation speed ratios has low false alarm rate, and the system can realize automation control of forward speed for combine harvester.

In this regard, a sample of a power system is simulated via MATLAB/Simulink, and by reading the voltage of the point of common coupling and using the wavelet transform, the differences of the outputs of the wavelet transform are investigated. The SVM approach is employed to distinguish the type of the transient (capacitor switching, fault, and/or load switching) in use for the high level outputs of the wavelet transform. Similar to neural networks, this method, which is based on learning, is considered as a proper tool for data classification. The results of simulations demonstrate that the combination of wavelet transform and SVM recognizes the type of the transient correctly and effectively as well as distinguishes capacitor switching and load switching events from all kinds of faults such as three-phase-to-earth fault, phase-to-phase fault, two-phase-to-earth fault, and single-phase-to-earth fault. In the end, the accuracy of the presented approach is evaluated and the simulation results are proposed for different attributes of transients in the power system network.

J	Jannati, M; Idris, NRN				Jannati, Mohammad; Idris, Nik Rumzi Nik			Vector control of unbalanced 3-phase IM using forward and backward components	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Electromagnetic torque pulsations reduction; field-oriented control; forward and backward components; open-phase fault; 3-phase induction motor; vector control	PHASE INDUCTION-MOTOR; FAULT-DETECTION; DRIVE; DIAGNOSIS; MODEL	In some industries, continuous operation of 3-phase induction motors (IMs) even under faults until the scheduled maintenance time is essential. Conventional control techniques such as field-oriented control (FOC) cannot be used to control faulty IMs since this will result in significant oscillations in the speed and torque. Consequently, a new control approach must be developed for improving IM performance during fault conditions. This paper presents a method for vector control of 3-phase IMs under open-phase faults. The main advantage of this control scheme is its ability to handle not only one phase but also two phases of open-phase fault conditions. When applying this control technique to a faulty machine, only minor changes to the parameters used in the equations are needed and the conventional FOC algorithm used for healthy 3-phase IMs can still be used. In this paper, simulation and experimental results are presented to study the effectiveness of the proposed technique to control both healthy and faulty 3-phase IMs. The results show that the proposed technique reduces electromagnetic torque pulsations during open-phase fault conditions.

In this paper, the modelling of predictive maintenance is conducted. It is assumed that the system is periodically checked by using imperfect measuring equipment. The decision rule for the predictive checking is formulated and the probabilities of correct and incorrect decisions are derived. The effectiveness of the predictive maintenance is evaluated by the average availability and downtime cost per unit time. The mathematical models are proposed to calculate the maintenance indicators for an arbitrary distribution of time to failure.

Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems are a critical part of CBM and are perceived as a breakthrough technology to effectively respond to an urgent and critical need to improve the readiness, availability, reliability, safety and maintainability of aerospace vehicles. This paper presents the results of an ongoing research activity focused on the development of a PHM system for fly-by-wire Electro-Hydraulic Servo Actuators (EHSA) without adding new sensors. The PHM system is being developed with the objective of detecting the most common faults, according to a failure mode effects and criticality analysis (FMECA). The paper describes in particular the tools used for detection and tracking of internal leakage faults of the hydraulic actuator, which is one of the most common faults of hydraulic servo-actuators in service, and for predicting its remaining useful life (RUL). The research work has been supported by the development of a nonlinear model for a reference EHSA, that has been implemented using physical equations and system parameters, taking into account environmental condition and disturbances. The model was validated through tests runs on a flight control actuator of a civil aircraft. Simulations are performed in nominal conditions and with progressive injection of degradation to verify the PHM algorithm. The performances of the PHM algorithms are evaluated by means of proper metrics. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite the recent advances in technology and information systems and the variety of methods for prognosis, decision models for joint maintenance and inventory optimization on the basis of real-time prognostic information have not been explored. We propose a proactive event-driven decision model for joint predictive maintenance and spare parts inventory optimization which addresses the Decide phase of the "Detect- Predict- Decide- Act" model and can be embedded to an Event Driven Architecture (EDA) for real-time processing in the frame of e-maintenance concept. The proposed approach was tested in a real manufacturing scenario in automotive lighting equipment industry and proved that maintenance and inventory costs can be significantly reduced by transforming the company's maintenance strategy from time-based to Condition Based Maintenance (CBM).

In healthcare, prediction has been applied to foretell when and how to administer medication to improve the health condition of the patient. The same is true for maintenance where the application of prognostics can help make better decisions. In this paper, an overview of prognostic maintenance strategies is presented. The proposed data-driven prognostics approach employs a statistical technique of (i) the parameter estimation methods of the time-to failure data to predict the relevant statistical model parameters and (ii) prognostics modelling incorporating the reliability Weibull Cumulative Distribution Function to predict part rejection, replacement, and reuse. The analysis of the modelling uses synthetic data validated by industry domain experts. The outcome of the prediction can further proffer solution to designers, manufacturers and operators of industrial product-service systems. The novelty in this paper is the development of the through life performance approach. The approach ascertains when the system needs to undergo maintenance, repair and overhaul before failure occurs.

Power convertors play an important role in adjusting the output voltage or current of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Using efficient and reliable switches for power converters and inverters is crucial for enhancing the safety and reliability of a platform. Generally, power converters suffer from failure mechanisms, such as wire bond fatigue, wire bond lift up, solder fatigue and loose gate control voltage, which mainly occur in power switches. In this paper, the junction temperature of the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) acting as a power switch used in the Impedance-Source DC-DC converter is estimated using an electro-thermal model in order to develop an adaptive thermal stress control (ATSC). The proposed stress control adjusts reference input of the PI control to extend the life expectancy of the device under the mission. The accuracy of results present using The Modified Coffin-Manson Law has been used to determine the life of IGBT and the lifetime has been successfully increased base on implementing imperative ATSC and comparing the result with the constant reference input of the PI controller.

Among the existing methods for RUL prediction, the Wiener-process-based method has attracted great attention owing to its favorable properties and flexibility in degradation modeling. However, shortcomings exist in methods of this type; for example, the degradation indicator and the first predicting time (FPT) are selected subjectively, which reduces the prediction accuracy. Toward this end, this paper proposes a new approach for predicting the RUL of rotating machinery based on an optimal degradation indictor. First, a genetic programming algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal degradation indicator using the concept of FPT. Then, a Wiener model based on the obtained optimal degradation indicator is proposed, in which the sensitivities of the dimensionless parameters are utilized to determine the FPT. Finally, the expectation of the predicted RUL is calculated based on the proposed model, and the estimated mean degradation path is explicitly derived. To demonstrate the validity of this model, several experiments on RUL prediction are conducted on rotating machinery. The experimental results indicate that the method can effectively improve the accuracy of RUL prediction.

J	Yang, YZ; Jiang, DX				Yang, Yizhou; Jiang, Dongxiang			Casing Vibration Fault Diagnosis Based on Variational Mode Decomposition, Local Linear Embedding, and Support Vector Machine	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article								To diagnose mechanical faults of rotor-bearing-casing system by analyzing its casing vibration signal, this paper proposes a training procedure of a fault classifier based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), local linear embedding (LLE), and support vector machine (SVM). VMD is used first to decompose the casing signal into several modes, which are subsignals usually modulated by fault frequencies. Vibrational features are extracted from both VMD subsignals and the original one. LLE is employed here to reduce the dimensionality of these extracted features and make the samples more separable. Then low-dimensional data sets are used to train the multiclass SVM whose accuracy is tested by classifying the test samples. When the parameters of LLE and SVM are well optimized, this proposed method performs well on experimental data, showing its capacity of diagnosing casing vibration faults.

The current spectrum analysis is an easy and popular method for the monitoring and detection of bearing faults. After a presentation of the existing fault models, this paper illustrates an analytical approach to evaluate the effects of the slot harmonics on the stator current in an induction motor with bearing fault. Simple and clear theoretical analysis results in some new current characteristic frequencies. Experimental tests with artificial bearing outer raceway fault are carried out by measuring stator current signals.

Firstly, the impulse response signals of pipeline extracted in different operating conditions were decomposed with LMD method into a series of product functions (PFs). Secondly, based on the information entropy theory, the appropriate energy entropy, singular spectrum entropy, power spectrum entropy, and Hilbert spectrum entropy were extracted as the input feature vectors. Finally, ELM was introduced for classification of pipeline blockage. Through the analysis of acoustic impulse response signal collected under the condition of health and different degrees of blockages in pipeline, the results show that the proposed method can well characterize the state information. Also, it has a great advantage in terms of accuracy and it is time consuming when compared with the support vector machine (SVM) and BP (backpropagation) model.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. In the field of rotor fault pattern recognition, most of classical pattern recognition methods generally operate in feature vector spaces where different feature values are stacked into one-dimensional (1D) vector and then processed by the classifiers. In this paper, time frequency image of rotor vibration signal is represented as a texture feature tensor for the pattern recognition of rotor fault states with the linear support higher-tensor machine (SHTM). Firstly, the adaptive optimal-kernel time-frequency spectrogram visualizes the unique characteristics of rotor fault vibration signal; thus the rotor fault identification is converted into the corresponding time frequency image (TFI) pattern recognition. Secondly, in order to highlight and preserve the TFI local features, the TFI is divided into some TFI subzones for extracting the hierarchical texture features. Afterwards, to avoid the information loss and distortion caused by stacking multidimensional features into vector, the multidimensional features from the subzones are transformed into a feature tensor which preserves the inherent structure characteristic of TFI. Finally, the feature tensor is input into the SHTM for rotor fault pattern recognition and the corresponding recognition performance is evaluated. The experimental results showed that the method of classifying time-frequency texture feature tensor can achieve higher recognition rate and better robustness compared to the conventional vector-based classifiers, especially in the case of small sample size.

J	Shuai, J; Shen, CQ; Zhu, ZK				Shuai, Jun; Shen, Changqing; Zhu, Zhongkui			Adaptive Morphological Feature Extraction and Support Vector Regressive Classification for Bearing Fault Diagnosis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROTATING MACHINERY			English	Article							FIREFLY ALGORITHM; DECOMPOSITION; SIGNAL	Numerous studies on fault diagnosis have been conducted in recent years because the timely and correct detection of machine fault effectively minimizes the damage resulting in the unexpected breakdown of machineries. The mathematical morphological analysis has been performed to denoise raw signal. However, the improper choice of the length of the structure element (SE) will substantially influence the effectiveness of fault feature extraction. Moreover, the classification of fault type is a significant step in intelligent fault diagnosis, and many techniques have already been developed, such as support vector machine (SVM). This study proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis strategy that combines the extraction of morphological feature and support vector regression (SVR) classifier. The vibration signal is first processed using various scales of morphological analysis, where the length of SE is determined adaptively. Thereafter, nine statistical features are extracted from the processed signal. Lastly, an SVR classifier is used to identify the health condition of the machinery. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated using the data set from a bearing test rig. Results show the high accuracy of the proposed method despite the influence of noise.

J	Hierons, RM; Turker, UC				Hierons, Robert M.; Turker, Uraz Cengiz			Distinguishing Sequences for Distributed Testing: Preset Distinguishing Sequences	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						finite state machine; distributed test architecture; preset distinguishing sequence	SYNCHRONIZABLE TEST SEQUENCES; FINITE-STATE MACHINES; CHECKING SEQUENCES; FAULT-DETECTION; GENERATION; OBSERVABILITY; DESIGN; LENGTH	There has been long-standing interest in automatically generating test sequences from a finite state machine (FSM) and more recently this has been extended to the case where there are multiple physically distributed testers and so we are testing from a multi-port FSM. This paper explores the problem of generating a controllable preset distinguishing sequence (PDS) from a multi-port FSM, motivated by the fact that many FSM-based test generation algorithms use PDSs. We prove that it is generally undecidable whether a multi-port FSM has a controllable PDS but provide a class of multi-port FSMs for which the problem is decidable. We also consider the important case where there is an upper bound l on the length of PDSs of interest, proving that controllable PDS existence is PSPACE-hard and in EXPSPACE. In practice the upper bound l is likely to be a polynomial in terms of the size of the multi-port FSM and in this case controllable PDS existence is NP-Complete.

In the developed LS-based FDP system, a particle filtering based FDP algorithm, fault diagnostic model, failure prognostic model, and uncertainty management are discussed. Although uncertainty management has been developed in the traditional Riemann sampling(RS)-based FDP, it needs to be analyzed and managed in a totally different way since the working principle of LS-FDP is fundamentally different from that of RS-FDP. Inaccurate model structure and parameter, measurement noise, process noise, and unknown future loading are major contributing factors of uncertainties in LS-FDP framework. Since the noise in LS -based prognosis is a distribution on time axis while the noise in RS -based prognosis is one on fault state axis, this paper studies the transpose of noise distribution from state domain to time domain. In order to reduce the uncertainty in the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL), model noise and measurement noise terms are adjusted based on a short-term prediction with n steps and correction loop. In this scheme, the priori time distribution at the (t + n)-th Lebesgue state is predicted and stored at the t-th Lebesgue state. Then, at the (t n)-th Lebesgue state, when the posteriori distribution becomes available, it is compared with the stored priori distribution to manage the uncertainty. The methods for uncertainty management are illustrated by a case study of the prediction of RUL of gearbox. The experimental results show that the uncertainty in the diagnosis and prognosis process of gearbox is properly managed and the confidence interval is decreased, which enhances the confidence level for decision making and condition-based maintenance.

Aberrant overexpression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family proteins is closely linked to tumorigenesis and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. Obatoclax is an inhibitor targeting all antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. A previous study has described the antiproliferative action of obatoclax in one human colorectal cancer cell line without elucidating the underlying mechanisms. We herein reported that, in a panel of human colorectal cancer cell lines, obatoclax inhibits cell proliferation, suppresses clonogenicity, and induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest, along with cyclin D1 downregulation. Notably, ectopic cyclin D1 overexpression abrogated clonogenicity suppression but also G1-phase arrest elicited by obatoclax. Mechanistically, pre-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 restored cyclin D1 levels in all obatoclax-treated cell lines. Cycloheximide chase analyses further revealed an evident reduction in the half-life of cyclin D1 protein by obatoclax, confirming that obatoclax downregulates cyclin D1 through induction of cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation. Lastly, threonine 286 phosphorylation of cyclin D1, which is essential for initiating cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation, was induced by obatoclax in one cell line but not others. Collectively, we reveal a novel anticancer mechanism of obatoclax by validating that obatoclax targets cyclin D1 for proteasomal degradation to downregulate cyclin D1 for inducing antiproliferation.

J	Yang, SC; Chen, GR; Jian, DR				Yang, Shih-Chin; Chen, Guan-Ren; Jian, Da-Ren			On-Line Stator Open-Phase Fault Detection and Tolerant Control for Permanent Magnet Machines Using the Neutral Point Voltage	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Motor condition monitoring; motor fault detection; fault tolerant control.	DIAGNOSIS; DRIVE; RELIABILITY; SYSTEMS	Conventional machine stator open-phase fault detection methods rely on the detection of current harmonics from the sensing of phase currents. Because the magnitudes of current harmonics are proportional to the machine load condition, it is a challenge for the phase fault detection at the light load condition when fault-induced current harmonics are too small to detect. This paper proposes an improved stator phase fault detection for permanent magnet (PM) machines based on the use of neutral point (NP) in Y-connected windings. It is shown that the first-order voltage harmonic is resultant once the open-phase fault occurs. Comparing with prior detection methods based on the current measurement, the fault detection using NP voltage is insensitive to the load condition, because the proposed fault signal is induced by the voltage unbalance as a result of the open phase. In addition, considering the fault tolerant control, a single-phase drive is developed by connecting the machine NP to one of the inverter legs. The machine can drive at the most efficient condition using standard three-leg inverters under phase fault. A 50-W PM machine with the accessible NP is used to evaluate the proposed open-phase fault detection and tolerant control method.

The presented approach establishes an immune monitoring model of a manufacturing system by exhibiting desirable immune characteristics, such as adaptation, immune recognition, immune memory and self-organization. In the BIS-based structural model, a group of autonomous agents mimic immune cells (such as B-cells) in BIS, have local interactions with monitoring environment and deal with emerging problems by simulating immune responses. Simulating the biological immune mechanism is able to monitor, diagnose and learn the faults. The methods of recognition and evaluation of fault antigens are proposed which can be used to coordinate and control the manufacturing system. The physical simulation platform for biological immune-inspired monitoring system has been developed. The experimental results show the feasibility of using this approach for real-time health monitoring and coordination control of manufacturing system.

Learning temporal rules to forecast instability in continuously monitored patients	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article						machine learning; cardiorespiratory instability; early warning system; automated rule extraction	SYSTEMS	Inductive machine learning, and in particular extraction of association rules from data, has been successfully used in multiple application domains, such as market basket analysis, disease prognosis, fraud detection, and protein sequencing. The appeal of rule extraction techniques stems from their ability to handle intricate problems yet produce models based on rules that can be comprehended by humans, and are therefore more transparent. Human comprehension is a factor that may improve adoption and use of data-driven decision support systems clinically via face validity. In this work, we explore whether we can reliably and informatively forecast cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in step-down unit (SDU) patients utilizing data from continuous monitoring of physiologic vital sign (VS) measurements. We use a temporal association rule extraction technique in conjunction with a rule fusion protocol to learn how to forecast CRI in continuously monitored patients. We detail our approach and present and discuss encouraging empirical results obtained using continuous multivariate VS data from the bedside monitors of 297 SDU patients spanning 29 346 hours (3.35 patient-years) of observation. We present example rules that have been learned from data to illustrate potential benefits of comprehensibility of the extracted models, and we analyze the empirical utility of each VS as a potential leading indicator of an impending CRI event.

In this paper, a fuzzy c-means offline (FCM) clustering algorithm and the approximate weighted proximal support vector machine (WPSVM) online recognition approach have been proposed to reduce the feature size and improve the speed of classification of electrical characteristics in the spacecraft. In addition, the main component analysis for the complex signals based on the principal component feature extraction is used for the feature selection process. The data capture contribution approach by using thresholds is furthermore applied to resolve the selection problem of the principal component analysis (PCA), which effectively guarantees the validity and consistency of the data. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach in this paper can obtain better fault diagnosis results of the spacecraft electrical characteristics' data, improve the accuracy of identification, and shorten the computing time with high efficiency.

Essay scoring is a costly process when we consider the time spent by an evaluator. It may lead to inequalities of the effort by various evaluators to apply the same evaluation criteria. Bibliometric research uses the evaluation criteria to find relevancy of articles instead. Researchers mostly face relevancy issues while searching articles. Therefore, they classify the articles manually. However, manual classification is burdensome due to time needed for evaluation. The proposed model performs automatic essay evaluation using multi-text features and ensemble machine learning. The proposed method is implemented in two data sets: a Kaggle short answer data set for essay scoring that includes four ranges of disciplines (Science, Biology, English, and English language Arts), and a bibliometric data set having IoT (Internet of Things) and non-IoT classes. The efficacy of the model is measured against the Tandalla and AutoP approach using Cohen's kappa. The model achieves kappa values of 0.80 and 0.83 for the first and second data sets, respectively. Kappa values show that the proposed model has better performance than those of earlier approaches.

GTs such as this are of great importance in industry, as drivers of gas compressors for power generation. Because of their complexity and their execution environment, the failure rate of GTs can be high with severe consequences. These units are subjected to transient operations due to starts, load changes and sudden stops that degrade the system over time. To better understand the dynamic behavior of the turbine and to mitigate the aforementioned problems, these transient conditions need to be analyzed and predicted. In the absence of a thermodynamic mathematical model, other approaches should be considered to construct representative models that can be used for condition monitoring of the GT, to predict its behavior and detect possible system malfunctions. One way to derive such models is to use data-driven approaches based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. This work studies the use of state-of-the-art genetic programming (GP) methods to model the Mitsubishi single shaft Turbo-Generator. In particular, we evaluate and compare variants of GP and geometric semantic GP (GSGP) to build models that predict the fuel flow of the unit and the exhaust gas temperature. Results show that an algorithm, proposed by the authors, that integrates a local search mechanism with GP (GP-LS) outperforms all other state-of-the-art variants studied here on both problems, using real-world and representative data recorded during normal system operation. Moreover, results show that GP-LS outperforms seven other modeling techniques, including neural networks and isotonic regression, confirming the importance of GP-based algorithms in this domain.

J	Wiczorek, R				Wiczorek, Rebecca			Investigating users' mental representation of likelihood alarm systems with different thresholds	THEORETICAL ISSUES IN ERGONOMICS SCIENCE			English	Article						Graded warnings; trust; compliance and reliance; decision-making; signal detection theory	COLLISION-WARNING SYSTEMS; TRAFFIC INFORMATION; FAULT MANAGEMENT; COCKPIT DISPLAY; TRUST; AUTOMATION; TASK; RELIANCE; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE	This study investigated effects of threshold setting in likelihood alarm systems (LASs) on safety, performance and participants' mental representation of LASs. Three LASs were compared under two workload conditions. LASs had the same lower (first) threshold separating non-alerts from warnings but differed with regard to their higher (second) threshold dividing warnings from alarms. Behaviour, performance and trust were assessed. Participants of all three conditions responded to almost every alarm but only to parts of the warnings. Threshold setting affected safety, as the most liberal second threshold led to the highest joint human - machine sensitivity. Increasing workload decreased concurrent task performance. A negative correlation of trust in warnings and response rates to warnings reflected reliance and implies a mental representation of graduation of non-alerts. Results suggest that LAS threshold setting allows a precise guidance of users' behaviour and show the importance of knowledge regarding users' mental representation for the design of LASs.

J	Matic, D; Kanovic, Z				Matic, Dragan; Kanovic, Zeljko			Vibration Based Broken Bar Detection in Induction Machine for Low Load Conditions	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING			English	Article						motor; bar; vibration; fault; detection	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROTOR BARS; TRANSFORM; MOTORS; TIME	A new method for broken bar detection, based on vibration signal analysis, is presented in this paper. While there are several methods for broken bar detection at low slip based on the current signal analysis, detection based on vibration signals attracts much less attention. In the current paper, detection of the broken bar was conducted by observing fault frequency content of the modulus of the analytical vibration signal. A broken bar feature is extracted from low frequency range even for low slip conditions. Although this method is successfully used for broken bar detection based on current signal analysis, it is important to verify the method when vibration signal is measured. Procedure is verified in a real industrial environment for induction motor of 3.15 MW.

Complex rotating machines are usually equipped with multiple sensors, which enable the development of multidimensional prognostic models. By considering the possible synergy among different sensor signals, multivariate models may provide more accurate prognosis than those using single-source information. Consequently, numerous research papers focusing on the theoretical considerations and practical implementations of multivariate prognostic models have been published in the last decade. However, only a limited number of review papers have been written on the subject. This article focuses on multidimensional prognostic models that have been applied to predict the failures of rotating machinery with multiple sensors. The theory and basic functioning of these techniques, their relative merits and drawbacks and how these models have been used to predict the remnant life of a machine are discussed in detail. Furthermore, this article summarizes the rotating machines to which these models have been applied and discusses future research challenges. The authors also provide seven evaluation criteria that can be used to compare the reviewed techniques. By reviewing the models reported in the literature, this article provides a guide for researchers considering prognosis options for multi-sensor rotating equipment.

The images of oxy-gas flames are segmented into premixed and diffused regions through the watershed transform method. The weighted color and texture features of the diffused and premixed regions are extracted and projected into two subspaces using the PCA to reduce the data dimensions and noises. The multi-class KSVM model is finally built based on the flame features in the principal component subspace to identify the operation condition. Two classic multivariate statistic indices, for example, Hotelling's T-2 and squared prediction error, are used to assess the normal and abnormal states for the corresponding operation condition. The experimental results obtained on a lab-scale oxy-gas rig show that the weighted color and texture features of the defined diffused and premixed regions are effective for detecting the combustion state and that the proposed PCA-KSVM model is feasible and effective to monitor a combustion process under variable operation conditions.

J	Pietrowski, W				Pietrowski, Wojciech			Detection of time-varying inter-turn short-circuit in a squirrel cage induction machine by means of generalized regression neural network	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; 3D FEM; Induction machine; Fault analysis; Electromagnetics	STATOR FAULTS; AXIAL FLUX; MOTORS; DIAGNOSTICS	Purpose - Diagnostics of electrical machines is a very important task. The purpose of this paper is the presentation of coupling three numerical techniques, a finite element analysis, a signal analysis and an artificial neural network, in diagnostics of electrical machines. The study focused on detection of a time-varying inter-turn short-circuit in a stator winding of induction motor. Design/methodology/approach - A finite element method is widely used for the calculation of phase current waveforms of induction machines. In the presented results, a time-varying inter-turn short-circuit of stator winding has been taken into account in the elaborated field-circuit model of machine. One of the time-varying short-circuit symptoms is a time-varying resistance of shorted circuit and consequently the waveform of phase current. Ageneral regression neural network (GRNN) has been elaborated to find a number of shorted turns on the basis of fast Fourier transform (FFT) of phase current. The input vector of GRNN has been built on the basis of the FFT of phase current waveform. The output vector has been built upon the values of resistance of shorted circuit for respective values of shorted turns. The performance of the GRNN was compared with that of the multilayer perceptron neural network. Findings - TheGRNNcan contribute to better detection of the time-varying inter-turn short-circuit in stator winding than the multilayer perceptron neural network. Originality/value - It is argued that the proposed method based on FFT of phase current and GRNN is capable to detect a time-varying inter-turn short-circuit. The GRNN can be used in a health monitoring system as an inference module.

Detection of Shaft Misalignment Using Piezoelectric Strain Sensors	EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Dynamic strain; Piezoelectric strain sensors; Rotating machinery		This paper presents preliminary results of a new technique for diagnosing shaft misalignment in rotating machinery. The method is based on the measurement of dynamic strains in the bearing house of the rotating equipment using piezoelectric strain sensors (PSS). The high sensitivity to strain of the PSS allows detection of small dynamic strains in the bearing house of rotating machinery which are closely related to misalignment severity. Tests performed in a machine fault simulator showed that the proposed method has advantages over the conventional diagnosis of misalignment using vibration analysis, particularly at low rotational speed, in which little vibration is produced in terms of acceleration. The method is also useful for distinguishing misalignment from unbalance.	[Gama, A.

Predictive maintenance based on event- log analysis: A case study	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Predictive maintenance techniques are designed to help anticipate equipment failures to allow for advance scheduling of corrective maintenance, thereby preventing unexpected equipment downtime, improving service quality for customers, and also reducing the additional cost caused by over-maintenance in preventative maintenance policies. Many types of equipment-e.g., automated teller machines (ATMs), information technology equipment, medical devices, etc.-track run-time status by generating system messages, error events, and log files, which can be used to predict impending failures. Aiming at these types of equipment, we present a general classification-based failure prediction method. In our parameterized model, we systematically defined four categories of features to try to cover all possibly useful features, and then used feature selection to identify the most important features for model construction. The general solution is sufficiently flexible and complex to address failure prediction for target equipment types. We chose ATMs as the example equipment and used real ATM run-time event logs and maintenance records as experimental data to evaluate our method on the feasibility and effectiveness.

Fault detection algorithm used in a magnetic monitoring system of the hydrogenerator	IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; hydroelectric generators; preventive maintenance; machine insulation; fault detection algorithm; magnetic monitoring system; hydrogenerator; magnetic measuring methods; stator leakage flux measurement; condition based maintenance; preventive maintenance; power plant; magnetic unbalance; rotor poles; air gap asymmetry	GENERATOR	In this study, the authors propose a fault detection algorithm used in an on-line magnetic monitoring system in the hydropower plant. The proposed algorithm is based on two magnetic measuring methods: measurement of (inner) flux within generator in air gap and measurement of stator leakage (outer) flux outside of the generator. The system has to ensure, in situ and real time, magnetic monitoring and fault detection of hydrogenerator. The monitoring system is also useful for modern maintenance approach such as a condition based maintenance without generators' work interruption and better planned and preventive maintenance in the power plant. The proposed system successfully detects the presence of magnetic unbalance of hydrogenerator, occurring as a consequence of shorted turns in the windings of the rotor poles or air gap asymmetry. The presented measurement results are achieved in real exploitation conditions.

If this fault is not diagnosed on-time, it can quickly expand and generate serious damage and even full damage to the motor. So, realisation of this fault, its impact on the motors and finally its diagnosis methods are essential and has high priorityfor users of the motors. This study presents the trend of the negative impacts of the fault on the performance of the machine. Available indexes for this fault detection are introduced and described in details. By analysing these indexes, their merits and drawbacks, limitations and ambiguous points are extracted. Finally, these indexes are compared and the best and worst indexes are introduced. Moreover, one of the most used index and the simplest one will be simulated in order to show capability of a new current-based ITF diagnosis index.

On-line fault diagnostics in operating three-phase induction motors by the active and reactive currents	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Induction motor; Fault diagnosis; Broken rotor bar; Load oscillations; Modified winding-function approach (MWFA); Instantaneous active and reactive currents	MACHINES; BARS	Motor current stator analysis (MCSA) are usually used to detect the broken bars. In several industrial applications, like cement industry, the motor is subjected to load torque variations of low frequencies, which have effects similar to rotor faults in the current spectrum and result of diagnostic procedure may be ambigues. In this paper, we present a study based on the application of the instantaneous active and reactive courant signature analyses for discriminating broken rotor bars from mechanical load oscillation effects in operating three-phase squirrel cage induction motors. This method is attractive because it does not need to interrupt the operating system in its application and allows the user to "see" the diagnosis information in the same way as in the well-known MCSA, i.e., as sidebands next to the fundamental current component. This technique has been first tested through the simulation of induction motors using a mathematical model based on the modified winding-function approach (MWFA). Then, experimental results are presented in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed tool for discriminating between a motor with broken rotor bars from a motor driven by an oscillating load.

Early detection of any small inter-turn short circuit and location of the faulty phase at different load would eliminate some subsequent damage to adjacent coils and stator core, reducing then the repair cost. To achieve this purpose, the present paper presents a new method of diagnosis and detection of inter turn short circuit fault using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and neural networks (NN). This method consists in analyzing the stator current by DWT in order to compute the energy associated with the stator fault in the frequency bandwidth. Then, this energy is used as input for a NN classifier. The results obtained are astonishing and the approach is able to detect any small number of shorted turns and the faulty phase even under different load of the machine.

REMAINING LIFE TIME PREDICTION OF BEARINGS USING K-STAR ALGORITHM - A STATISTICAL APPROACH	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Remaining useful Life; K-Star algorithm; Statistical methods	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS	The role of bearings is significant in reducing the down time of all rotating machineries. The increasing trend of bearing failures in recent times has triggered the need and importance of deployment of condition monitoring. There are multiple factors associated to a bearing failure while it is in operation. Hence, a predictive strategy is required to evaluate the current state of the bearings in operation. In past, predictive models with regression techniques were widely used for bearing lifetime estimations. The Objective of this paper is to estimate the remaining useful life of bearings through a machine learning approach. The ultimate objective of this study is to strengthen the predictive maintenance. The present study was done using classification approach following the concepts of machine learning and a predictive model was built to calculate the residual lifetime of bearings in operation. Vibration signals were acquired on a continuous basis from an experiment wherein the bearings are made to run till it fails naturally. It should be noted that the experiment was carried out with new bearings at pre-defined load and speed conditions until the bearing fails on its own. In the present work, statistical features were deployed and feature selection process was carried out using J48 decision tree and selected features were used to develop the prognostic model. The K-Star classification algorithm, a supervised machine learning technique is made use of in building a predictive model to estimate the lifetime of bearings. The performance of classifier was cross validated with distinct data. The result shows that the K-Star classification model gives 98.56% classification accuracy with selected features.

MULTI-ELEMENT LAMB WAVE TRANSDUCERS TO CLASSIFY DAMAGE TYPE AND CHARACTERIZE SIZE BASED ON MODAL CONTENT	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 6A			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference	JUL 17-21, 2016	Vancouver, CANADA	ASME, Pressure Vessels & Pip Div			POLARIZED SHEAR-WAVES; GUIDED-WAVE; HOLLOW CYLINDERS; DEFECT DETECTION; ARRAY TRANSDUCERS; PHASED-ARRAY; EDGE CRACKS; SCATTERING; PLATE; PIPE	Assessing the structural integrity of PVP systems entails a hierarchical process to detect, locate, classify, and size damage in order to predict the remaining useful life of the system. Technologies to detect and locate damage have been researched intensely over the years, but classification and sizing of damage remains a challenging problem. In this work advanced sensing technology is employed to send and receive Lamb waves in plates. The receiver is a 16-element linear array that is made from PVDF; thus it is lightweight, low profile, flexible, inexpensive, and has minimal cross talk. The receiver has two novel capabilities that open new opportunities in diagnostics and prognostics: measurement of group velocity and determination of modal content. The actuator and receiver are intended to stay in place and function in a pitch-catch mode. The use of modal content to classify the type of damage as well as to size the defect is demonstrated.

J	Bazdar, A; Kazemzadeh, RB; Niaki, STA				Bazdar, Aliasghar; Kazemzadeh, Reza Baradaran; Niaki, Seyed Taghi Akhavan			Fault diagnosis within multistage machining processes using linear discriminant analysis: a case study in automotive industry	QUALITY TECHNOLOGY AND QUANTITATIVE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Discriminant analysis; fault diagnosis; multistage machining process; set-up errors; state space model	VARIATION-SOURCE IDENTIFICATION; MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; VARIATION PROPAGATION; STREAM; SYSTEMS; IMPROVEMENT; ERRORS	Statistical process control provides useful tools to improve the quality of multistage machining processes, specifically in continuous manufacturing lines, where product characteristics are measured at the final station. In order to reduce process errors, variation source identification has been widely applied in machining processes. Although statistical estimation and pattern matching-based methods have been utilized to monitor and diagnose machining processes, most of these methods focus on stage-by-stage inspection using complex models and patterns. However, because of the existence of high rate alarms and the complexity of the machining processes, a surrogate modelling is needed to solve quality control problems. Here, a novel approach based on variation propagation modelling and discriminant analysis of set-up errors is proposed to diagnose faults in multistage machining processes. In this approach, the future deviation is also allocated to the classification rule of process errors and finally the source of deviation is identified within machining process. The applicability and the performance of the proposed within stage fault diagnosis is investigated using an illustrative case study. The proposed approach can be used in vast multistage machining processes such as aerospace and automotive industries.

J	Guo, XJ; Shen, CQ; Chen, L				Guo, Xiaojie; Shen, Changqing; Chen, Liang			Deep Fault Recognizer: An Integrated Model to Denoise and Extract Features for Fault Diagnosis in Rotating Machinery	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; deep learning; stacked denoising autoencoder; feature extraction; integrated deep fault recognizer	NEURAL-NETWORK	Fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is significant to avoid serious accidents; thus, an accurate and timely diagnosis method is necessary. With the breakthrough in deep learning algorithm, some intelligent methods, such as deep belief network (DBN) and deep convolution neural network (DCNN), have been developed with satisfactory performances to conduct machinery fault diagnosis. However, only a few of these methods consider properly dealing with noises that exist in practical situations and the denoising methods are in need of extensive professional experiences. Accordingly, rethinking the fault diagnosis method based on deep architectures is essential. Hence, this study proposes an automatic denoising and feature extraction method that inherently considers spatial and temporal correlations. In this study, an integrated deep fault recognizer model based on the stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) is applied to both denoise random noises in the raw signals and represent fault features in fault pattern diagnosis for both bearing rolling fault and gearbox fault, and trained in a greedy layer-wise fashion. Finally, the experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method has better diagnosis accuracy than DBN, particularly in the existing situation of noises with superiority of approximately 7% in fault diagnosis accuracy.

J	Bao, XH; Wang, HF; Di, C				Bao, Xiaohua; Wang, Hanfeng; Di, Chong			Effects of rotor slot number on monitoring signals in submersible motor under eccentricity fault	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS AND MECHANICS			English	Article						Eccentricity; monitoring signals; rotor slot number; submersible motor	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; MAGNETIC-FIELD; INDUCTION; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS; FLUX; GAP	Eccentricity is a common fault during the operation of electrical machines due to manufacturing error and effect of rotor deflection. Therefore, eccentricity fault has been a research hotspot in recent decades for the reliable running of machines. The monitoring signals for detecting eccentricity have been proposed in many published papers. However, the effects of rotor slot number on the magnitudes of characteristic signals are seldom investigated. Thus, this paper presents the relationship between the number of rotor slots and the monitoring signals under static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity on the basis of the previous papers. The theoretical analysis shows that not all electrical machines generate the principal slot harmonics in the stator current. But these harmonics in the air-gap magnetic field are easily detected for all machines when the machines are under static or dynamic eccentricity. Moreover, the effect of rotor slot number on the low-frequency components under mixed eccentricity is also predicted.

Firstly, the collected vibration signals are processed by LMD which decomposes them into a series of product function (PF) components, and PF components are carried out by method of the morphological filtering and signal recombination. Then, the feature vector is obtained from the new PF components by LMD method. Secondly, a new kernel function is proposed to improve LS-SVM, which can solve the problem of kernel function parameters selection. Further, Lagrange parameters are processed by feature weighting method, and the weighted average value of the Lagrange parameters is calculated as the threshold value of Pruning algorithm, which can solve sparsity problem in LS-SVM. Thirdly, Energy features are inputted into the new LS-SVM to recognize machinery faults according to LS-SVM parameters. Finally, the performance of the proposed method was verified by a fault diagnosis case in a rolling element bearing. The results indicated that this new method could judge and classify the multi-fault of rotating machinery quickly and effectively.

The modern manufacturing has completely shifted from the manual inspections to the machine assisted vision inspection methodology. Furthermore, the research outcomes in industrial automation have revolutionized the whole product development strategy. The purpose of this research paper is to introduce a new scheme of automation in the sand casting process by means of machine vision based technology for mold positioning. Automation has been achieved by developing a novel systemin which casting molds of different sizes, having different pouring cup location and radius, position themselves in front of the induction furnace such that the center of pouring cup comes directly beneath the pouring point of furnace. The coordinates of the center of pouring cup are found by using computer vision algorithms. The output is then transferred to a microcontroller which controls the alignment mechanism on which the mold is placed at the optimum location.

However, it is questionable that the techniques are available to apply in permanent magnet machines with concentrated windings and different control methods. First of all, this study analyzes the harmonic components of line current in a brushless dc (BLDC) motor, including the issues such as supply imbalance and inherent structural asymmetry, through the developed finite-element analysis and experiment under different operating conditions. As a result, the third harmonic in negative frequency (-3f) is suitable as a fault detector because it is free from those issues. Finally, in BLDC motors with 120 degrees conduction in a six-step operation, the faults can be detected by determining whether or not the third harmonics exist at the incipient state.

Cogging torque minimization techniques are also explored in the presence of the anomaly to better understand their sensitivity to the condition. Also, the impact of single-sided and double-sided rotor topologies on both current harmonics and torque ripple is examined. It is found that static eccentricities incite significant increases in the amplitudes of space and subharmonics in the single-sided topology, which may be mitigated by the cogging torque minimization techniques. The double-sided topology is tolerant to the presence of static eccentricities unlike the single-sided topology; this is due to the opposing effect of the resulting asymmetrical properties of the air gap. Finally, this paper establishes a detection technique for static eccentricities in single-sided axial-flux permanent-magnet machine whereby the cogging torque minimization techniques do not impair on them.

Many studies have focused on one particular aging precursor at a time and continuously monitored it using custom-built circuits. Due to the difficulties in taking sensitive measurements, the reported findings are more on the quantities requiring less sensitive measurements. In this paper, two custom-designed testbeds are used to age a number of power MOSFETs and insulated gate bipolar transistors. An automated curve tracer is utilized to capture parametric variations in I-V curves, parasitic capacitances, and gate charges at certain time intervals. The results suggest that the only viable aging precursors are the on-state voltage drop/on-state resistance, body diode voltage drop, parasitic capacitances, and gate threshold voltage for die attach solder and gate-oxide degradation mechanisms. Based on the experimental results, gate threshold voltage variation is empirically modeled to estimate the remaining useful lifetime of the switches experiencing gate oxide degradation. The model parameters are found by the least squares method applied to inliers determined by the random sample and consensus outlier removal algorithm.

The methodology is based on singular perturbed techniques to take into account the slow behavior of degradations. The full-order system is firstly decoupled into slow and fast subsystems. An interval observer is designed for both subsystems under the assumption that the measurement noise and the disturbances are bounded. Then, the degradation is modeled as a polynomial whose parameters are estimated using ellipsoid algorithms.

Firstly, RSGWPT is used to extract feature vectors from representative statistical characteristics in the decomposition frequency band, and then the KPCA in the feature space is performed to reduce the dimension of features and to extract the dominant features for the following classification. Finally, a novel support vector machine, called twin support vector machine is used to construct a multi-class classifier. Inputting superior features to this classifier, the condition of the monitored machine component can be determined. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method is effective for multi-fault detection of rotating machinery. The TWSVM is also indicated that has better classification performance and faster convergence speed than the normal SVM. (C) 2016 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For simplifying the fault diagnosis problems, the execution of the proposed method is divided into three steps, i.e., fault preliminary detection, fault type recognition and fault degree identification. In the first step, a preliminary judgment about the health status of the equipment can be evaluated by the statistical analysis method based on the permutation entropy theory. If fault exists, the following two processes based on the artificial intelligence approach are performed to further recognize the fault type and then identify the fault degree. For the two subsequent steps, mixed-domain state features containing time domain, frequency-domain and multi-scale features are extracted to represent the fault peculiarity under different working conditions. As a powerful time-frequency analysis method, the fast EEMD method was employed to obtain multi-scale features. Furthermore, due to the information redundancy and the submergence of original feature space, a novel manifold learning method (modified LGPCA) is introduced to realize the low-dimensional representations for high-dimensional feature space. Finally, two cases with 12 working conditions respectively have been employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, where vibration signals were measured from an experimental bench of rolling element bearing. The analysis results showed the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method of which the diagnosis thought is more suitable for practical application. (C) 2016 ISA.

A screw accelerated test bench is introduced. Accelerometers are installed to monitor the performance degradation of ball screw. Combined with wavelet packet decomposition and isometric mapping (Isomap), the sensitive feature vectors are obtained and stored in database. Meanwhile, the sensitive feature vectors are randomly chosen from the database and constitute training samples and testing samples. Then the optimal kernel function parameter and penalty factor of SVM are searched with the method of QGA. Finally, the training samples are used to train optimized SVM while testing samples are adopted to test the prediction accuracy of the trained SVM so the screw remaining life prediction model can be got. The experiment results show that the screw remaining life prediction model could effectively predict screw remaining life.

J	Zhao, ZY; Quan, Q; Cai, KY				Zhao, Zhiyao; Quan, Quan; Cai, Kai-Yuan			A modified profust-performance-reliability algorithm and its application to dynamic systems	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Profust reliability; performance reliability; system degradation; health monitoring; quadrotor	FUZZY RELIABILITY; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION	In the field of system health monitoring, system performance degradation or fault occurrence will decrease the system reliability to some degree. However, traditional reliability analysis is of limited usefulness in evaluating the reliability of an individual product under dynamic operating and environmental conditions. In this case, research on performance reliability as well as real-time reliability has attracted extensive attentions. Considering the characteristics of fuzzy reliability theory, a performance reliability based on profust reliability theory has its advantage on tracking system's continuous degradation. On the basis of our previous work, this paper proposes a modified profust-performance-reliability (PPR) algorithm as a supplement to the profust reliability based approach to prognostics and health management. In the modified PPR algorithm, the item of transition probability among system's multi-states is replaced with the real-time distribution of system's health status, which achieves an easier implementation of PPR's calculation in practice with higher real-time capability and accuracy. Then, its application in the performance evaluation and prediction of dynamic systems are comprehensively proposed. Finally, a simulation of a quadrotor with partial loss of actuator effectiveness is presented to validate the availability and effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Neerukatti, RK; Fard, MY; Chattopadhyay, A				Neerukatti, Rajesh Kumar; Fard, Masoud Yekani; Chattopadhyay, Aditi			Gaussian Process-Based Particle-Filtering Approach for Real-Time Damage Prediction with Application	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Prognosis; Gaussian process; Particle filter; Data analysis; Structural safety; Temporal scour	SCOUR DEPTH; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROGNOSIS	A prognostic model capable of predicting temporal damage evolution is essential to prevent catastrophic failure of structures. Data driven techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, are widely used for prediction of damage in a variety of aerospace and civil applications. Most of the available techniques cannot be applied for real-time prediction because they assume the measured value to be the true value, which is often not true. They also require training data from a similar set of experiments based on which predictions are made, which may not always be available. In this paper, the authors propose a novel integrated approach that intelligently combines particle filter updating with a fully probabilistic Gaussian process model to predict complex physical phenomena (e.g., temporal local pier scour) considering both measurement and prediction uncertainties. In this example, the measurement model is obtained using radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors and the state space model is the Gaussian process-based prognosis model. The performance of the algorithm was tested using corrupt training data. Different scenarios are presented with application to predicting local scour near bridge piers, which is a highly stochastic phenomenon with training data mostly unavailable. The algorithm is used to make predictions using corrupt training data. The results indicate that the proposed approach predicts the scour depth accurately under varying field conditions.

Dead-zone phenomenon exists in many real practical systems due to the employment of low-cost commercial off-the-shelf sensors. Two Bernoulli random variables are utilized to model the dead-zone effect and a variant formation of Tobit Kalman filter is brought forward to generate a residual that can indicate the occurrence of an intermittent fault.

J	Fei, SW				Fei, Sheng-wei			Fault diagnosis of bearing based on relevance vector machine classifier with improved binary bat algorithm for feature selection and parameter optimization	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; improved binary bat algorithm; feature selection; relevance vector machine; bearing	BAYESIAN NETWORKS; SYSTEM; ROTOR	In this article, fault diagnosis of bearing based on relevance vector machine classifier with improved binary bat algorithm is proposed, and the improved binary bat algorithm is used to select the appropriate features and kernel parameter of relevance vector machine. In the improved binary bat algorithm, the new velocities updating method of the bats is presented in order to ensure the decreasing of the probabilities of changing their position vectors' elements when the position vectors' elements of the bats are equal to the current best location's element, and the increasing of the probabilities of changing their position vectors' elements when the position vectors' elements of the bats are unequal to the current best location's element, which are helpful to strengthen the optimization ability of binary bat algorithm. The traditional relevance vector machine trained by the training samples with the unreduced features can be used to compare with the proposed improved binary bat algorithm-relevance vector machine method. The experimental results indicate that improved binary bat algorithm-relevance vector machine has a stronger fault diagnosis ability of bearing than the traditional relevance vector machine trained by the training samples with the unreduced features, and fault diagnosis of bearing based on improved binary bat algorithm-relevance vector machine is feasible.

For the non-stationary characteristics of the signals in the transmission system of DFWT and the reality that it is difficult to obtain a large number of fault samples, Solidworks and Adams are used to simulate the different operating conditions of the transmission system of the DFWT to obtain the corresponding characteristic signals. Improved empirical mode decomposition (IEMD), which improves the end effects of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to decompose the signals to get intrinsic mode function (IMF), and the IEMD energy entropy reflecting the working state are extracted as the inputs of the support vector machine (SVM). Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the parameters of SVM to improve the classification performance. The results show that the proposed method can effectively and accurately identify the types of misalignment of the DFWT.

J	Zhao, HM; Sun, M; Deng, W; Yang, XH				Zhao, Huimin; Sun, Meng; Deng, Wu; Yang, Xinhua			A New Feature Extraction Method Based on EEMD and Multi-Scale Fuzzy Entropy for Motor Bearing	ENTROPY			English	Article						feature extraction; motor bearing; ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); multi-scale fuzzy entropy; correlation coefficient method; SVM; fault diagnosis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; FAULT-FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PERMUTATION ENTROPY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ROLLER-BEARINGS; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; REDUCTION METHOD; EMD METHOD; DIAGNOSIS	Feature extraction is one of the most important, pivotal, and difficult problems in mechanical fault diagnosis, which directly relates to the accuracy of fault diagnosis and the reliability of early fault prediction. Therefore, a new fault feature extraction method, called the EDOMFE method based on integrating ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), mode selection, and multi-scale fuzzy entropy is proposed to accurately diagnose fault in this paper. The EEMD method is used to decompose the vibration signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with a different physical significance. The correlation coefficient analysis method is used to calculate and determine three improved IMFs, which are close to the original signal. The multi-scale fuzzy entropy with the ability of effective distinguishing the complexity of different signals is used to calculate the entropy values of the selected three IMFs in order to form a feature vector with the complexity measure, which is regarded as the inputs of the support vector machine (SVM) model for training and constructing a SVM classifier (EOMSMFD based on EDOMFE and SVM) for fulfilling fault pattern recognition. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by real bearing vibration signals of the motor with different loads and fault severities. The experiment results show that the proposed EDOMFE method can effectively extract fault features from the vibration signal and that the proposed EOMSMFD method can accurately diagnose the fault types and fault severities for the inner race fault, the outer race fault, and rolling element fault of the motor bearing. Therefore, the proposed method provides a new fault diagnosis technology for rotating machinery.

A hybrid domain feature extraction method based on distance evaluation technique (DET) is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, the vibration signal of the motor bearing is decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The proper intrinsic mode function (IMF) component that is the most sensitive to the degradation of the motor bearing is selected according to the sensitive IMF selection algorithm based on the similarity evaluation. Then the distance evaluation factor of each characteristic parameter is calculated by the DET method. The differential method is used to extract sensitive characteristic parameters which compose the characteristic matrix. And then the extracted degradation characteristic matrix is used as the input of support vector machine (SVM) to identify the degradation state. Finally, It is demonstrated that the proposed hybrid domain feature extraction method has higher recognition accuracy and shorter recognition time by comparative analysis. The positive performance of the method is verified.

J	Zhang, HB; Zheng, Y; Kong, FR				Zhang, Haibin; Zheng, Yuan; Kong, Fanrang			Weak impulsive signals detection based on step-varying asymmetric stochastic resonance	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Asymmetric stochastic resonance; calculation step; impulsive signal; weak signal detection; fault diagnosis	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NOISE; AMPLIFICATION	Rotating machinery response is often characterized by the presence of periodic impulses modulated by high-frequency components. The fault information is often hidden in its envelope signal which is unilateral when demodulated. Conventional stochastic resonance with a symmetric potential cannot always contain the signal's original features especially the asymmetry. In this article, a step-varying asymmetric stochastic resonance system for impulsive signal denoising and recovery as well as the rotating machine fault diagnosis is proposed to further improve the impulsive signal-to-noise ratio. In the method, the asymmetry of step-varying asymmetric stochastic resonance can match the unilateral impulsive signal well to generate an optimal dynamic system by selecting proper system parameters and degree of asymmetry. Systems with different simulated or experimental signals are also studied to verify its effectiveness and availability. Results indicate that the step-varying asymmetric stochastic resonance performs much better in detection of impulsive signal than the conventional stochastic resonance with merits of good frequency response, anti-noise capability, adaptability to asymmetric signal and original waveform preserving.

If the rotating speed of the shaft is invariable, the gear-fault-induced modulation phenomenon manifest as frequency sidebands equally spaced around the meshing frequency and its harmonics in vibration spectra. However, under variable load and rotating speed of the shaft, the meshing frequency and its harmonics and the sidebands vary with time and hence the vibration signal becomes non-stationary. Using Fourier transform doesn't allow detecting the variation of the rotating machine and its harmonics which reflect the gear fault. In this study, we propose to use the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) to decompose signals generated by the variation of load and the size of the defect. This method is particularly suitable for processing non stationary signals. By using EEMD the signal can be decomposed into a number of IMFs which are mono component, we use also the spectrum and spectrogram of each IMF to show and calculate the frequency defect.

Most of the existing degradation or failure prediction models and approaches are population-based failures or suspensions, namely, to predict the failure time of a component, there are some failure or suspension histories of same type or similar components which can be used as reference. However, in practice, there exists the phenomenon in which no failure or suspension histories for some components can be used, what can be utilized is just the collected condition monitoring signals to date. In that case, failure time and probability are dcult to be estimated accurately. In this paper; a novel degradation prediction approach is introduced. Meantime, a new failure probability estimation function is developed based on component "service time" and "degradation extent" simultaneously. Then replacement and spare part ordering are jointly optimized according to the estimated failure probability. The optimization objective is to minimize long-run cost rate. Two bearing datasets are used to validate the proposed approach.

Different from other studies, this paper pays attention to neither the stator voltage and current, nor the winding inductance variation, but focuses on the faulty electromagnetic characteristics including the exciting current, the circulating current in the parallel branches (CCPB), and the electromagnetic torque (EMT). The simulation work is modeled for a QFSN-600-2YHG type turbo-generator and the experiment is taken on a MJF-30-6 fault-simulating generator to verify the theoretical analysis. The simulation result and the experiment data accord with the theoretical analysis and show that, as SISC occurs, second harmonics will be induced in the exciting current, first and third harmonics will be induced in the CCPB, and second and fourth harmonics will be produced in the EMT. Moreover, the corresponding time-domain waves will also fluctuate intensely, while the mean value of the exciting current and the EMT will be decreased. As SISC develops, the harmonic increment, the fluctuation intensity of the time waves, and the decreased rate of the mean value will be also increased. These united characteristics can be applied to the fault diagnosis and online monitoring on SISC fault.

Ganesh			Data aggregation in wireless sensor network using SVM-based failure detection and loss recovery	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data aggregation; wireless sensor network; support vector machine; sensor nodes		In wireless sensor network, data aggregation can cause increased transmission overhead, failures, data loss and security-related issues. Earlier works did not concentrate on both fault management and loss recovery issues. In order to overcome these drawbacks, in this paper, a reliable data aggregation scheme is proposed that uses support vector machine (SVM) for performing failure detection and loss recovery. Initially, a group head, selected based on node connectivity, splits the nodes into clusters based on their location information. In each cluster, the cluster member with maximum node connectivity is chosen as the cluster head. When the aggregator receives data from the source, it identifies node failures in the received data by classifying the faulty data using SVM. Furthermore, a reserve node-based fault recovery mechanism is developed to prevent data loss. Through simulations, we show that the proposed technique minimises the transmission overhead and increases reliability.

Fault diagnosis of bent shaft in rotor bearing system	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Rotating machinery; Bent shaft; Order analysis	BOW	Bent shaft is the most common fault in rotating machinery. Bent shaft generates excessive vibration in a machine, depending on amount and location of the bend. In this paper, order analysis technique of vibration analysis used for bent shaft diagnosis is proposed. In order analysis, both phase and amplitude are obtained. From phase and amplitude, the fault type and location are usually identified. Experimental results show order analysis is an effective technique for bent shaft.	[Mogal, S.

Manifold learning is a novel theory for image recognition that can be also applied to rotating machinery fault pattern recognition based on time-frequency distributions. However, the vibration signal of rotating machinery in fault condition contains cyclical transient impulses with different phrases which are detrimental to image recognition for time-frequency distribution. To eliminate the effects of phase differences and extract the inherent features of time-frequency distributions, a multiscale singular value manifold method is proposed. The obtained low-dimensional multiscale singular value manifold features can reveal the differences of different fault patterns and they are applicable to classification and diagnosis. Experimental verification proves that the performance of the proposed method is superior in rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

Therefore, it is of great significance to study the fault diagnosis of the planetary gear. A method of planetary gear fault diagnosis based on the multi-scale fractal box dimension of complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed. The original vibration signal is decomposed by CEEMD, and a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are obtained. Some effective IMFs are extracted, and their reconstructed signal associated with the feature information is obtained. The reconstructed signal is analysed with multi-scale analysis, and the fault feature information contained in the signals with different scales is quantified and extracted via a fractal box dimension. The status recognition of planetary gear is achieved by combining ELM. The experiments show that the proposed method is effective at diagnosing planetary gear faults.

To this end, many lifetime prediction methods have been developed to handle various failure-related data collected in different situations. Among these methods, machine learning and Bayesian updating are the most popular ones. In this article, a Bayesian least-squares support vector machine method that combines least-squares support vector machine with Bayesian inference is developed for predicting the remaining useful life of a microwave component. A degradation model describing the change in the component's power gain over time is developed, and the point and interval remaining useful life estimates are obtained considering a predefined failure threshold. In our case study, the radial basis function neural network approach is also implemented for comparison purposes. The results indicate that the Bayesian least-squares support vector machine method is more precise and stable in predicting the remaining useful life of this type of components.

J	Lu, JJ; Huang, JQ; Lu, F				Lu, Junjie; Huang, Jinquan; Lu, Feng			Sensor Fault Diagnosis for Aero Engine Based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine with Memory Principle	ENERGIES			English	Article						extreme learning machine (ELM); memory principle; online learning; aero engine; sensor fault diagnosis	FAILURE-DETECTION; DESIGN	The on-board sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) system is essential to guarantee the reliability and safety of an aero engine. In this paper, a novel online sequential extreme learning machine with memory principle (MOS-ELM) is proposed for detecting, isolating, and reconstructing the fault sensor signal of aero engines. In many practical online applications, the sequentially coming data chunk usually possesses a characteristic of timeliness, and the overdue training data may mislead the subsequent learning process. The proposed MOS-ELM can improve the training process by introducing the concept of memory principle into the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) to tackle the timeliness of the data chunk. Simulations on some time series problems and some benchmark databases show that MOS-ELM performs better in generalization performance, stability, and prediction accuracy than OS-ELM. The experiment results of the MOS-ELM-based sensor fault diagnosis system also verify the excellent generalization performance of MOS-ELM and indicate the effectiveness and feasibility of the developed diagnosis system.

J	Lim, P; Goh, CK; Tan, KC; Dutta, P				Lim, Pin; Goh, Chi Keong; Tan, Kay Chen; Dutta, Partha			Multimodal Degradation Prognostics Based on Switching Kalman Filter Ensemble	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Aerospace; commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS); diagnostics; multimodal degradation; neural networks; prognostics; switching Kalman filter (SKF) ensemble	PREDICTION; ALGORITHMS; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; STATES; MODEL	For accurate prognostics, users have to determine the current health of the system and predict future degradation pattern of the system. An increasingly popular approach toward tackling prognostic problems involves the use of switching models to represent various degradation phases, which the system undergoes. Such approaches have the advantage of determining the exact degradation phase of the system and being able to handle nonlinear degradation models through piecewise linear approximation. However, limitations of such existing methods include, limited applicability due to the discretization of predicted remaining useful life, insufficient robustness due to the use of single models and others. This paper circumvents these limitations by proposing a hybrid of ensemble methods with switching methods. The proposed method first implements a switching Kalman filter (SKF) to classify between various linear degradation phases, then predict the future propagation of fault dimension using appropriate Kalman filters for each phase. This proposed method achieves both continuous and discrete prediction values representing the remaining life and degradation phase of the system, respectively. The proposed framework is shown via a case study on benchmark simulated aeroengine data sets. The evaluation of the proposed framework shows that the proposed method achieves better accuracy and robustness against noise compared with other methods reported in the literature. The results also indicate the effectiveness of the SKF in detecting the switching point between various degradation modes.

J	Dugnani, R; Chang, FK				Dugnani, Roberto; Chang, Fu-Kuo			Analytical model of lap-joint adhesive with embedded piezoelectric transducer for weak bond detection	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						Lap-joint; bond-line; impedance; piezoelectric; sensor; structural health monitoring; adhesive; actuator; Lamb waves; diagnostics; prognostics	ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; KISSING BONDS; ULTRASONIC CHARACTERIZATION; INTERFACES; INSPECTION; BEHAVIOR; LAYER	In recent years, the aerospace and automotive industries experienced a growing interest in the implementation of structural members' bonding using adhesive films. Adhesive joints contribute to manufacturing savings and are advantageous from a structural prospective as they provide a relatively uniform stress distribution at the bonded region, hence reducing local stress concentration. Regretfully, the adhesive bonds' strength is vulnerable to the presence of defects which limits their use for structural purposes. A particularly dangerous class of defectsgenerically referred to as kissing bondconsists of localized imperfections that do not provide adequate bonding between the adherent and the adhesive yet maintaining the two surfaces in contact. Past attempts at detecting kissing bonds using ultrasonics were only marginally successful stressing the need to search for more reliable methods. This article describes a novel, in situ, impedance-based method for bond-line degradation detection during the service life of a structure. The method relies on piezoelectric transducers embedded within the adhesive bond-line and actuated by a low-voltage harmonic signal. The article focuses on deriving an approximate analytical model describing the dynamic behavior of the actuator embedded in the homogeneous bond-line. A study describing the sensitivity of the electro-mechanical response of the transducer to the changes in various bond-line properties and adhesion conditions is also presented.

Early bearing fault diagnosis methods commonly take time-frequency analysis as the fundamental basis, therein searching for characteristic fault frequencies based on bearing kinematics to identify fault locations. However, due to mode mixing, the characteristic frequencies are usually masked by normal frequencies and thus are difficult to extract. After time-frequency decomposition, the impact signal frequency can be distributed among multiple separation functions according to the mode mixing caused by the impact signal; therefore, it is possible to search for the shared frequency peak value in these separation functions to diagnose bearing faults. Using the wavelet transform, time-frequency analysis and blind source separation theory, this article presents a new method of determining shared frequencies, followed by identifying the faulty parts of bearings. Compared to fast independent component analysis, the sparse component analysis was better able to extract fault characteristics. The numerical simulation and the practical application test in this article obtained satisfactory results when combining the wavelet transform, intrinsic time-scale decomposition and linear clustering sparse component analysis, thereby proving the validity of this method.

J	Xia, TB; Tao, XY; Xi, LF				Xia, Tang-Bin; Tao, Xin-Yang; Xi, Li-Feng			Operation Process Rebuilding (OPR)-Oriented Maintenance Policy for Changeable System Structures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dynamic decision making; operation process rebuilding (OPR); opportunistic maintenance (OM); predictive maintenance (PdM); variable maintenance time window (VMTW)	PORT; PROGNOSTICS; MANAGEMENT; STRATEGY; MODEL	Considering the operation process rebuilding (OPR) of manufacturing/operation systems, we propose a dynamic interactive bilevel maintenance methodology to satisfy rapid market changes. Predictive maintenance (PdM) intervals at the machine level are dynamically scheduled by a multiobjective model for each diverse machine. A system-level opportunistic maintenance (OM) policy is proposed to facilitate PdM optimizations according to OPR activities. This novel OPR-OM policy utilizes a variable maintenance time window to construct optimal maintenance schedules that are suitable for changeable system structures. The results obtained by applying this methodology at Shanghai Port indicate that the proposed methodology can help a port transportation system to achieve rapid responses to OPR activities, which can significantly improve system efficiency and economy. Note to Practitioners-The majority of existing maintenance strategies focus on fixed system structures, which scarcely consider changeable system structures derived from operation process rebuilding (OPR). Thus, this paper, which is motivated by this problem, attempts to satisfy flexible needs in a keenly competitive market. This paper proposes a bilevel maintenance methodology that is integrated with OPR to achieve cost-effective and fast-responding system-level maintenance optimizations. Implementation of the proposed methodology involves the following basic steps: 1) collect individual machine condition data; 2) prepare machine-level maintenance schedules according to a multiobjective model (maintenance cost rate, machine availability, and operation profit rate); and 3) utilize a variable maintenance time window to optimize system-level maintenance according to OPR activities. The bilevel methodology can be easily modified according to practical requirements, i.e., other decision-making objectives at the machine level and the maintenance time window range at the system level.

In an ideal situation, the system to be diagnosed is assumed to be complete; however, this assumption is rather restrictive. In this paper, a novel approach, which uses rough set theory as a knowledge extraction tool to deal with diagnosis problems of an incomplete model, is investigated. DESs are presented as information tables and decision tables. Based on the incomplete model and observations, an algorithm called Optimizing Incomplete Model is proposed in this paper in order to obtain the repaired model. Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition for a system to be diagnosable is given. In ensuring the diagnosability of a system, we also propose an algorithm to minimize the observable events and reduce the cost of sensor selection.

In this paper, a new fault detection method using signal reconstruction based on Auto-Associative Extreme Learning Machines (AAELM) is proposed. AAELM are applied for fault detection on an artificially generated dataset to test the performance of the algorithm under controlled conditions and a real case study based on condition monitoring data from a combined-cycle power plant compressor. The performance of AAELM is compared to that of two other commonly used signal reconstruction methods: Auto-Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results from the two case studies demonstrate that AAELM achieve a smaller reconstruction error, shorter detection delay, lower spillover and a higher distinguishability compared to AAKR and PCA on the evaluated datasets. The obtained results are generalized to elaborate guidelines for industrial users for selecting suitable signal reconstruction algorithms based on their specific requirements and boundary conditions.

However, when SVMs are used for multi-faults diagnostics and classification, they result in a drop in classification accuracy; this is because the adaptation of SVMs for multi-faults classifications requires the reduction of the multiple classification problem into multiple subsets of binary classification problems that result in many contradictory results from each individual SVM model. To overcome this problem, a novel SVM-DS (Dempster Shafer evidence theory) model is proposed to resolve conflicting results generated from each SVM model and thus increase the classification accuracy. The analysis of results shows that the proposed SVM-DS model increased the accuracy of the fault diagnosis model from 76% to 94%, as SVM-DS continuously refines and eliminates all conflicting results from the original SVM model. The proposed SVM-DS model is found to be more accurate and effective in handling multi-faults diagnostic and classification problems commonly faced in the industries, as compared to the original SVM method.

J	Kate, RJ; Nadig, R				Kate, Rohit J.; Nadig, Ramya			Stage-specific predictive models for breast cancer survivability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Breast cancer; Survivability prediction; Machine learning; SEER dataset	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSIS; TOOLS	Background: Survivability rates vary widely among various stages of breast cancer. Although machine learning models built in past to predict breast cancer survivability were given stage as one of the features, they were not trained or evaluated separately for each stage. Objective: To investigate whether there are differences in performance of machine learning models trained and evaluated across different stages for predicting breast cancer survivability. Methods: Using three different machine learning methods we built models to predict breast cancer survivability separately for each stage and compared them with the traditional joint models built for all the stages. We also evaluated the models separately for each stage and together for all the stages. Results and conclusions: Our results show that the most suitable model to predict survivability for a specific stage is the model trained for that particular stage. In our experiments, using additional examples of other stages during training did not help, in fact, it made it worse in some cases. The most important features for predicting survivability were also found to be different for different stages. By evaluating the models separately on different stages we found that the performance widely varied across them. We also demonstrate that evaluating predictive models for survivability on all the stages together, as was done in the past, is misleading because it overestimates performance.

In order to monitor their status, detect faults, and predict their failure early, this study proposes a signal model-based fault coding to monitor the circuit response after being stimulated to perform a fault diagnosis without training a large amount of sample data and fault classifiers. Manifold features extracted from circuit responses are associated with a fault-indicating curve in the feature space, in which a group of fault bases are uniformly and continuously distributed along with gradual deviation from the nominal value of one critical component. These bases can be deployed in a factory setting but used during field operation. Fault coding is converted to a novel optimization problem, and the optimized solution forms a fault code representing fault class, suitable for realizing fault detection, and isolation for different components. A fault indicator based on comparison between fault codes can describe performance degradation trends. To improve the prediction accuracy, historical degradation data are collected and considered as a priori exemplars, and a novel exemplar-based conditional particle filter is proposed to track a degradation process for the prediction of remaining useful performance. Case studies on two analog filter circuits demonstrate that the proposed method achieves relatively high fault diagnosis and prognosis accuracy. The main advantages of our study are two-fold: first, the high diagnostic accuracy can still be obtained even if there is no large amount of training data; second, the prognostic effect remains relatively stable whenever triggering prognosis module.

It appears that the fault sensitivity of PMSM stator currents and rotor speed measurements is very low with regard to single mechanical faults. That is why an amplification of single mechanical fault signatures in frequency domain is proposed by adjusting the adaptive PMSM observer gains. To study the influence of the adaptive PMSM observer gains on fault signatures, the observer model is first of all linearized at an operating point. Then, the static gain, the resonance, and the quality factor Q of different transfer functions are analyzed. A dedicated experimental setup based on an original mechanical fault emulator and a 7.8 kW PMSM drive is designed to validate the simulation results. The simulation and the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to amplify single mechanical fault signatures and the calculated fault indicator.

Therefore, accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer is one of the most crucial works in follow-up treatment. In this work, we introduced a novel deep learning (DL) method named D-SVM for the prediction of human breast cancer prognosis. D-SVM was a supervised feature extraction and classification method integrating deep neural network and traditional support vector machine (SVM) classifier. This novel algorithm effectively learned hierarchical and abstract representation from raw input data and successfully integrated traditional classification method. Our experimental results clearly indicated that the proposed method could enable us to train a model that yielded reasonably good performance than traditional classification approaches on a small-scale gene expression dataset for breast cancer.

A test bench was developed where a three phase machine serves as disturbance generator of different frequencies. The control of the machines is based on multi scalar variables that ensures an independent control of the motor EMF and the rotor flux. For disturbance identification a speed observer system with load torque observer was implemented. It has been shown that the analysis of the estimated load torque provides sufficient results for disturbance identification. All investigations were done on an experimental setup.

It is usually achieved on the basis of material testing using standardized sampies, where weIl defined, homogeneous stress states and loading conditions can be realized. Both the deformation behaviour in the initial state, as weIl as the materials degradation during repetitive loading can then be mapped by calibrated damage mechanics FE-models. Such models employ the calculation of internal damage state variables at integration point level, which are functions of stress, strain, time and temperature. However, in the simulation of real components accommodating inhomogeneous stress states due to their complex geometries, damage localization effects can take place. As reported in previous works, local enhancement of damage variables at integration points and significant impact of the FE-mesh quality on the results are commonly obtained in the simulations. Such numerical features can hamper the applicability of damage mechanics models derived from standard material testing samples onto real solder joints geometries. In order to overcome mesh dependency and localization of damage evolution, we adopt a spatial weighted averaging of the damage state variable in a visco-plastic Chaboche material model. This approach overcomes the numerical localization of damage on discrete numerical points and is often referred to as nonlocal damage concept. Here, we highlight the algorithm of nonlocal damage calculation at integration point level, which we implemented for the use in a commercial FE software package. We achieve a spatial damage distribution on a finite microscopic scale with the aim to resemble the physical material degradation, known to happen on the scale of microscopic cracks, grain and grain-boundary modifications. FinaIly, we discuss the advantages and implications of the nonlocal damage approach on the basis of the damage evolution obtained by simulations of a Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) specimen.

The goal of this research is to determine breast tumor from digital mammograms with a machine learning technique in view of RF and combination of RF-ELM classifier. For digital mammogram images, MIAS database is used. Preprocessing is usually needed to enhance the low quality of the image. The region of interest (ROI) is determined in line with the scale of suspicious region. After the suspicious area is sectioned, features are extracted by texture analysis. GLCM is used as a texture attribute to extract the suspicious area. From all extracted features best features are selected with the help of CBF method. To enhance the exactness of classification, only six features are selected. These features are mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, variance, entropy and correlation coefficient. RF and RF-ELM are used as a classifier.

A competitive system has quick fault detection functionalities and maintenance enabled. This paper examines existing method to develop an online approach for superior detection of eccentricity fault in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors, in a marine propulsion setting. Detection of eccentricity fault is best carried out by monitoring vibration, air-gap flux density and induced emf. With the introduction of search coils, the proposed methodology aims to obtain the induced emf voltage in the air-gap. Search coil were found to decisively segregate fault symptoms appearing from other asymmetric interruptions such as load imbalance and input unbalanced voltage. Vibration in the motor was monitored by placing sensors on the stator yoke to detect vibration during various levels of eccentricity fault. In this research, eccentricity fault was simulated in 2D finite element analysis (FEA) platform using Ansys Maxwell and Ansys Mechanical. The simulated results shows a robust online based fault diagnosis method applicable for marine propulsion motors.	[Ahsanullah, Kazi; Jeyasankar, Elango; Vignesh, A. N.; Panda, S.

As current sensors are usually installed together with the IMs for control and protection purposes, using stator current for fault detection has become a common practice nowadays, as it is much cheaper than installing additional sensors. In this study, stator currents from the healthy and faulty IMs are obtained and analysed via MATLAB software. The current signatures from healthy and faulty IMs are conditioned using the inbuilt DSP module of the dSPACE prior to analysis using AI techniques. This paper presents a Growing Curvilinear Component Analysis (GCCA) neural network which is able to correctly identify anomalies in the IM and follow the evolution of the stator fault using its current signature, making on-line early fault detection possible.

Therefore, there is a strong need to develop an efficient condition monitoring. The main target is to achieve a relatively low cost and/or non-invasive system which is still powerful in terms of monitoring for online detection of developing faults. The presented paper addresses rotor eccentricity faults and studies conventional monitoring techniques for induction motors. In order to reduce the unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) in case of an eccentric rotor, the eccentricity-generated additional airgap flux waves should be reduced. The radial forces in an induction motor are calculated, and the characteristics of unbalanced magnetic pull are described.

This work proposes a classification algorithm, which can be extended towards an online bearing fault detection. The objective is to detect and classify the bearing faults in early stages. The overall design aspects of the online bearing fault detection and classification system are discussed. The proposed method is validated using experimental data, and a high accuracy of the fault classification was observed. Therefore, the proposed method can be applied for an online early fault detection and classification system.

This paper develops a new data-driven framework for estimating tool remaining useful life (RUL) in TCM. The framework includes the following modular components: data preprocessing with a proposed adaptive Baysian change point detection (ABCPD) for automatic data alignment, time window process, feature extraction, feature selection and a multi-layer neural network as the main machine learning algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated on a real-world gun drilling experimental dataset with multiple sensor measurements (i.e. thrust force, torque, 12 vibration signals). Different model selection, sensor selection, feature selection methods have been investigated in this paper. The simulation performance of the proposed framework is studied with the gun drilling dataset and it has been shown that the proposed framework has good performance.

However, NFV over multiple clouds has not yet attained the level of performance to be a viable replacement for traditional networks. One of the reasons is the absence of a standard based Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance and Security (FCAPS) framework for the virtual network services. In NFV, faults and performance issues can have complex geneses within virtual resources as well as virtual networks and cannot be effectively handled by traditional rulebased systems. To tackle the above problem, we propose a fault detection and localization model based on a combination of shallow and deep learning structures. Relatively simpler detection has been effectively shown to be handled by shallow machine learning structures like Support Vector Machine (SVM). Deeper structure, i. e., the stacked autoencoder has been found to be useful for a more complex localization function where a large amount of information needs to be worked through to get to the root cause of the problem. We provide evaluation results using a dataset adapted from fault datasets available on Kaggle and another based on multivariate kernel density estimation and Markov sampling.

However, the complexity and variability of the actual working condition leads to the data unstable and fault characteristics unpredictable. Traditional machine learning methods won't work or have a poor performance under this circumstance. In this paper, we propose a cross domain feature extraction method based on the Transfer Component Analysis algorithm to solve the problem.

These include keeping aircraft downtime as minimum as possible and keeping an adequate inventory to replace a faulty component. Traditionally, aircraft maintenance was performed on the principle of condition based maintenance (CBM) i.e. performing maintenance due to degradation of system performance. Although this approach has served its purpose, the advent of new aircrafts like A380, A350 and B787 and exponential growth in the number of aircrafts flying today calls for renewed design approach towards aircraft maintenance. There is a growing industry requirement for changing the aircraft maintenance design from being reactive to proactive. Technological advancements have led to development from mechanical aircraft system to electrical aircraft system. Health checking of an aircraft has evolved from inspection to system health monitoring. There are now more sensors, more systems and more exchange of data among systems and ground stations. These advancements are supporting the industry needs for proactive maintenance approach, but these advancements have been in silos and have grown over time catering to requirements one by one at system and subsystem level leading to inconsistencies, inefficiencies and ineffectiveness. Hence a new architecture which takes a holistic view of complete aircraft as a system for performing real time aircraft health monitoring is required. The advent of sensor technologies, intelligent aircraft systems, avionics communication networks, high performance computation clusters and frameworks for big data analytics hold the key for designing real time and integrated health monitoring of aircraft systems. In this paper an attempt has been made to define sources for "on the fly" health monitoring data generation, an architectural framework for usage of ISO-13374 standard, OSA-CBM supplied UML diagrams and ARINC 664 standard for transmission of health monitoring data and perform just in time health assessment by offline and online prognostic modules using " on the fly" health monitoring data and Hadoop framework.

In this method, the fan system is used as the research object to predict the bearing life, which is closer to the actual working condition of the bearing compared with the research on the bearing. The multi-parameter is used as the input value of the support vector machine (SVM), which is more accurate than the single parameter. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of SVM model, which improves the accuracy and certainty of parameter selection. The correlation analysis is used to choose the characteristics that are closely related to the remaining life. The unbalanced load is put on the fan blades to accelerate bearing life prediction process. The result shows that the model established by the parameters of the fan current, voltage and speed can accurately predict the residual life of rolling bearing, which not only provides theoretical guidance for the maintenance and replacement of the fan bearing, but also improves the fan predictive maintenance level.

The fault signal was simulated using ATPDraw/EMTP program at frequency 200 kHz The fault detection was analyzing the high frequency component by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). For the first stage, the coefficient of DWT was used for the fault detection. After the fault can be detected, the fault classification will be identified using SVM algorithm. The maximum coefficient from wavelet transform was used as input pattern of SVM to classify the type of fault. The input pattern of SVM consists of 4 input; maximum coefficient of DWT in all phase current and zero sequence current. For the SVM process, the fault classification used the five model of SVM because each model is working in parallel to avoid mistake (or error). In addition, the same input in five model were simultaneously used while the output of each models is differently according to specification of model. The overall result of 2160 case studies data can be summarized that the fault classification using SVM algorithm is highly satisfactory.

The prognosis can be improved by early treatment, but it requires accurate evaluation of the degree of RA progression to apply appropriate treatment. The modified total sharp (mTS) score in hand or foot X-ray image has been used to quantitatively evaluate the RA progression evaluation. However, the mTS score measurement takes huge labor and it is very time consuming method because a physician should evaluate progression grade for all hand joints, and the evaluation is subjective. This paper proposes an automated finger joint detection and mTS score estimation method using support vector machine. The experiment in 45 RA patients shows that the proposed method succeeded in detecting the finger joint and estimating the mTS score. As the number of learning data increases, the proposed method can estimate the mTS score with higher accuracy.

In general, ML algorithms offer insight in complex processes by analyzing measured data without acquiring in-depth domain knowledge. In contrast to common physical simulations they do not require excessive computational time and are well suited for real time analysis. This study focuses on transferring the potential of ML to the production of electric drives. Three major issues are identified: the preprocessing of the data, dealing with small data sets and the selection of an appropriate machine learning algorithm. Depending on the specific application in production, different algorithms, for example support vector machines, neural networks, random forests or boosted algorithms come into consideration. The potential of ML in electric drives production is demonstrated using two concrete applications: In the case of contacting technologies, such as thermo and ultrasonic crimping, ML algorithms for predictive maintenance, quality management and process control are considered. The second use case covers the selective magnet assembly. Here, a ML-based concept is proposed that predicts the cogging torque by analyzing magnet properties, as well as process parameters.

Solar Energy Management as an Internet of Things (IoT) Application	2017 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SYSTEMS & APPLICATIONS (IISA)	International Conference Information Intelligence Systems and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA)	AUG 27-30, 2017	Larnaca, CYPRUS	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Fdn, Univ Piraeus, Univ Cyprus, Austrian, Univ Piraeus, Res Ctr, Cyprus Tourism Org			FORECAST	Photovoltaic (PV) array analytics and control have become necessary for remote solar farms and for intelligent fault detection and power optimization. The management of a PV array requires auxiliary electronics that are attached to each solar panel. A collaborative industry-university-government project was established to create a smart monitoring device (SMD) and establish associated algorithms and software for fault detection and solar array management. First generation smart monitoring devices (SMDs) were built in Japan. At the same time, Arizona State University initiated research in algorithms and software to monitor and control individual solar panels. Second generation SMDs were developed later and included sensors for monitoring voltage, current, temperature, and irradiance at each individual panel. The latest SMDs include a radio and relays which allow modifying solar array connection topologies. With each panel equipped with such a sophisticated SMD, solar panels in a PV array behave essentially as nodes in an Internet of Things (IoT) type of topology. This solar energy IoT system is currently programmable and can: a) provide mobile analytics, b) enable solar farm control, c) detect and remedy faults, d) optimize power under different shading conditions, and e) reduce inverter transients. A series of federal and industry grants sponsored research on statistical signal analysis, communications, and optimization of this system. A Cyber-Physical project, whose aim is to improve solar array efficiency and robustness using new machine learning and imaging methods, was launched recently.

It reduces the signals not coherent to rotation frequency effectively, and extracts the repetitive signals directly related to machine operation condition. This paper proposes a method to improve the traditional time domain synchronous averaging, and discusses the time domain synchronous averaging method based on the accurate alignment reference signal. Searching the phase reference data for the linearly interpolated between the points on either side of the zero-crossing level, the vibration data are then digitally re-sampled with interpolation, using the cumulative phase angle results to provide the re-sampling positions. Analysis results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the improved time domain synchronous averaging in engineering practice.

Thus it is difficult to recognize and capture typical fault frequencies. For this purpose, an approach was proposed for fault diagnosis of gearboxes, by combining temporal feature extraction based on independent component analysis (ICA) and fault classification based on forward least squares approximation support vector machine (FLSA-SVM). Multiple ICA neural networks were batch trained by multi-classes vibration data separately, each corresponding to one of fault patterns of gearboxes. A feature extractor was structurally constructed by the trained ICA networks, followed by a post-processing unit of feature extraction based on one second-order measure, i.e. residual total correlation (RTC). Experimental results show that the proposed approach is efficient and effective for fault diagnosis of gearboxes, even if the used train sets are of small size. The integrated ICA-RTC feature extractor is able to extract low-dimensional representative features from time-domain data, and to overcome some difficulties in traditional frequency-domain feature extraction.

An approach for fractal feature extraction from vibratory signals of rolling bearings was studied in this paper. We judged the existence of an early-stage inner race defect by analyzing the trend-changing characteristics on all fractal feature parameters synthetically, determined the window time when the early-stage inner race defect occurs by means of the change points of maximum linearity-mean values on fractal characteristic curves, and made a final diagnosis decision by quantitatively evaluating symptom likelihood on the fractal feature parameters. The results from a case study based on the test-to-failure data showed that the propose approach in this paper is effective and of great application potential to early-stage health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.

Extreme learning machine (ELM) has been widely used as a fast classification model. But a key problem for ELM is to reduce the impact of random variables and it can't make full use of the direct and indirect information among different layers. To solve the problems, a connection is built between the input layer and the output layer. That is, the output layer receives information not only from the hidden layer but also directly from the input layer. And a set of the input layer weights and the hidden layer thresholds will be chosen analytically by founding the best accuracy. Meanwhile, feature extraction is the prerequisite for classification. In order to improve the accuracy of the multi-fault classification, this paper applies the kurtosis spectral entropy (KSE) algorithm to get the useful features from the vibration signals. Then the eigenvalues are input into the DP-ELM model for pattern recognition. In this paper, two sets of rolling bearing data at different speed are used to test. And each set of data includes six different states. Compared with ELM, back propagation neuron network (BP) and radial basis function (RBF), the experimental results show that, with as few as possible of the hidden nodes, the improved method used in this paper ensures a short learning time that it might learn hundreds of times faster than BP method, and obviously increases the accuracy at a degree. Finally, 10 times 10-fold-cross-validation are used to prove the effectiveness.

Its running state directly affects the performance of the whole machine and it is also the main cause of mechanical equipment failure. This paper focuses on the fault diagnosis of the rolling bearings. The method of fault diagnosis based on the self-adaptive denoise of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and improved back propagation (BP) neural network with differential evolution (DE) algorithm is studied. Firstly, the signal is decomposed by EEMD, and then the reconstructed signal of adaptive noise reduction is acquired based on the threshold of distance measurement. Secondly, utilizing the error of BP neural network as the objective function, weights and thresholds of the network are optimized by DE algorithm. Finally, the optimized BP network is used for fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective and accurate than the traditional BP neural network.

The bearings defects are the most important defects that can occur in these. In this context, we propose a new approach for the detection of these defects based on the analysis of the stator current. The Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition is applied to the stator current experimental data of the asynchronous motor subjected to various loads in healthy and failing case. The results of the analysis of the envelope of selected Intrinsic Mode Functions, obtained by Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm allowed us to get a better discrimination of different bearing defects.

However, the increase in the voltage demands an accurate and robust protection system again potential fault conditions. Series arc is one of the fault conditions which needs to be detected and addressed before the benefits of using higher voltages in vehicle can be fully realized. In this paper, an efficient arc detection algorithm is presented based on advanced machine learning algorithms to recognize series arcs in the electrical systems of 48V vehicles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm recognizes the arcs in the signal with accuracy of more than 99% detection. The algorithm only uses measured current and therefore, no additional wiring will be added to the system.

C	Liu, C; Lore, KG; Sarkar, S			IEEE	Liu, Chao; Lore, Kin Gwn; Sarkar, Soumik			Data-driven root-cause analysis for distributed system anomalies	2017 IEEE 56TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	56th Annual IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 12-15, 2017	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE			GRANGER CAUSALITY; CAUSE DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; OSCILLATIONS	Modern distributed cyber-physical systems encounter a large variety of anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. In this regard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex fault propagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme for distributed cyber-physical systems built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of a complex system. We present two approaches for root-cause analysis, namely the sequential state switching (S-3, based on free energy concept of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, RBM) and artificial anomaly association (A(3), a multi-class classification framework using deep neural networks, DNN). Synthetic data from cases with failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are simulated to validate the proposed approaches, then compared with the performance of vector autoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis. Real dataset based on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) is also used for validation. The results show that: (1) S-3 and A(3) approaches can obtain high accuracy in root-cause analysis and successfully handle multiple nominal operation modes, and (2) the proposed tool-chain is shown to be scalable while maintaining high accuracy.

This results in collection of larger amount of raw data (big data) that is generated at different levels of network architecture and is typically underutilized. To unleash full value of the complex data sets, innovative machine learning algorithms need to be utilized for the comprehensive analysis of the big data in order to extract valuable insights which can be used for improving the overall performance of the network. In addition, a major challenge for cellular network operators is to cope up with increasing number of complete (or partial) cell outages and to simultaneously reduce operational expenditure (OPEX). This paper contributes towards the aforementioned problems by exploiting big data generated from the core network of 4G LTE-A known as call detail record (CDR) to detect anomalous behavior of the network. We present a semi-supervised statistical-based anomaly detection technique to identify in almost real-time: first, unusually low user activity region depicting sleeping cell, which is a special case of cell outage and is particularly challenging to detect as it does not trigger any alarm and remains invisible until a number of complaints are received from the subscribers; and second, unusually high user traffic area corresponding to a situation where special action such as additional resource allocation, fault avoidance solution etc. may be needed. Achieved results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for timely and reliable anomaly detection in current and future cellular networks.

Extracting knowledge from high dimensional data which contain a large number of features and a small sample size presents intrinsic challenges for classification models. Genetic Algorithms can be successfully adopted to efficiently search through high dimensional spaces, and multivariate classification methods can be utilized to evaluate combinations of features for constructing optimized predictive models. This paper proposes a framework which can be adopted for building prediction models for high dimensional biomedical data. The proposed framework comprises of three main phases. The feature filtering phase which filters out the noisy features; the feature selection phase which is based on multivariate machine learning techniques and the Genetic Algorithm to evaluate the filtered features and select the most informative subsets of features for achieving maximum classification performance; and the predictive modeling phase during which machine learning algorithms are trained on the selected features to construct a reliable prediction model. Experiments were conducted using four high dimensional biomedical datasets including protein and gene-expression data. The results revealed optimistic performances for the multivariate selection approaches which utilize classification measurements based on implicit assumptions.

BEMS can discover problems related to energy wastage, user comfort and building maintenance. Remote analysis and categorization of the different Heating, Ventilation and Air- Conditioning (HVAC) Terminal Unit (TU) behaviours based on a unique set of features using BEMS data is the main aim of the proposed work. Hence, a novel feature extraction method inspired by the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller response curve to define events from TU data is proposed and applied to multidimensional, real-time data streams remotely retrieved from a building based in the city of London. The feature extraction method executing across different TUs and the feature sets obtained, have been used to identify different TU behaviour patterns. Subsequently, unsupervised machine learning has been employed to study faulty and non-faulty TUs.

Many machine learning algorithms have been applied to gearbox fault diagnosis. However, many of the current machine learning algorithms did not provide satisfactory fault diagnostic results due to their shallow architectures. Recently, a class of machine learning models with deep architectures called deep learning has received more attention because it can learn high-level features of inputs. This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis method for drivetrain gearbox of DFIG wind turbines using rotor current signal analysis. In the proposed method, the instantaneous fundamental frequency of the rotor current signal is first estimated to obtain the instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. Then, Hilbert transform is used to demodulate the rotor current signal to obtain its envelope, and the resultant envelope signal contains fault characteristic frequencies that are in proportion to the varying DFIG shaft rotating frequency. Next, an angular resampling algorithm is designed to resample the nonstationary envelope signal to be stationary based on the estimated instantaneous shaft rotating frequency. After that, the power spectral density analysis is performed on the resampled envelope signal for the gearbox fault detection. Finally, a classifier with a deep architecture that consists of a stacked autoencoder (SAE) and a support vector machine is proposed for gearbox fault classification using extracted fault features. Experimental results obtained from a DFIG wind turbine drivetrain test rig are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this regard, six phase transmission system with the ability to transmit 73% more power has been proved to be a better alternative than the classical three phase transmission network and that too without any major modifications in the existing set-up. However, the protection protocol of six-phase transmission system is quite complex, due to the larger number of possible faults. In this context, this paper presents a protection scheme based on combined framework of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and support vector machine (SVM). The approach aims at performing the tasks of detection and classification of shunt faults in six-phase transmission system. The use SVM is motivated by the fact that it has emerged as an efficient, powerful and fast machine learning tool for finding solution to the complex classification problems. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme have been examined for wide variation in fault parameters such as fault location, fault resistance and inception angle. The test results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in providing information regarding the system status and immunity to parameter perturbations.

There is a need for pleasant environment at Hospitals, Education Institutions and residence area which can be achieved by reduction of noise from busy traffic, construction areas, within the vicinity of industrial machines and even from certain home appliances. Adaptive Noise Elimination is a substitute technique for approximating signals undermined by added substance commotion or obstruction. Its leverage lies in that, with no priori evaluations of signal or clamor, levels of commotion dismissal are feasible that would be troublesome or difficult to accomplish by other signal processing techniques for evacuating commotion. Its cost, definitely, is that it needs two information sources - an essential info containing the tainted signal and a reference input containing clamor connected in some obscure route with the essential commotion. The reference input is adaptively separated and subtracted from the essential contribution to get the flag gauge. Adaptive filtering before subtraction permits the treatment of sources of info that are deterministic or stochastic, stationary or time-variable. Thus, by cancelling the unnecessary sounds through ANC techniques the paper deals with creation of a cost effective portable module which can be attached to windows or the machines itself to eliminate the unnecessary sounds. This paper also involves detection and notification of internal faults of machine which affects its efficiency. Early recognition of abnormality in electrical machines is vital in view of their assorted variety of utilization in various fields. A legitimate blame location plot stops proliferation of the disappointment or point of confinement it's heightening to extreme degrees and consequently anticipates unscheduled downtimes that reason loss of generation and monetary pay. The significant disappointments are related with basic hardware like generators, processing machines, engines, fans and pumps. Thus, this module monitors various working aspects of the machine and the failure prediction simulation system using vibration analysis notifies the fault even before we can observe visible failures. Thus necessary actions can be taken in advance.	[Kumar, Arun K. M.] VTU, Dept ECE, Belgavi, Karnataka, India; [Kumar, Arun K. M.] SJTJIT, Ranebennur, Karnataka, India; [Manjunath, T.

Data mining is applied to find the hidden patterns in the important roles of medical diagnosis and prognosis. Dimension reduction is an important topic in data mining, which is widely used in the areas of genetics, medicine and bioinformatics. The medical data are paradoxical and hundreds of independent features in them. In order to make the valuable decisions and to improve the efficiency, accuracy of mining tasks on high dimensional data, we propose a new dimension reduction (Feature selection & Extraction) algorithm a hybrid model of PSO-PCNN. From the proposed algorithm, the best attributes from the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) will be passed as input to the Pulse coupled Neural Network (PCNN) for further optimization. The datasets collected from the several Diabetic public health care centers, it was about 470 instances and also having 28 attributes of Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) patient with Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT). This paper focuses on extracting the best potential attributes from the paradoxical high dimensional medical datasets. The proposed algorithm reduces these high dimensional features in to 13 attributes with limited number of iterations. Our comparisons are performed in terms of relevance and redundancy. The obtained experimental result shows very promising outcomes for the computational efficiency and also to improve the classification accuracy.

There are several faults that may arise in machines increasing noise and vibration. Cogging is one of the main faults in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs). Tools for the diagnosis of cogging are needed to detect the machines that do not fulfil the quality requirements. The usual methods found in bibliography to assess cogging are Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) or directly measuring it by means of a torque sensor. This paper studies the feasibility of the alternative and unpublished method of vibration signals measured with accelerometers to evaluate cogging. In this paper a machine is designed and manufactured, in order to measure the effect of cogging in the vibration of the machine. The tested machine allows to apply several cogging levels, and the vibrations and the torque are measured with the machine running at several rotational speeds. Especially at lower rotational speeds, the effect of the cogging is clearly observed in the spectra of the torque. However, the spectra of the vibration signals do not show the effect of cogging torque, since at the cogging frequency the amplitudes do not correspond to the cogging levels.

DaTSCAN is widely used as a hallmark of nigrostriatal nerve cells degeneration such as in Parkinson's Disease (PD). DaT density is commonly assessed by calculating the Striatum Binding Ratio (SBR). For some subjects showing abnormal motor signs, SBR falls in the normal range which is known as Scan Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit (SWEED). The fate of these subjects to develop PD is not obvious. In this paper, we developed Machine Learning based models for PD classification and SWEDD condition prediction using data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). We availed of the Multivariate Logistic Regression (MLR) and Principal Component Analysis-Linear Support Vector Machine (PCA-LSVM) to establish competent models. The SBR values were calculated from the least affected- and most affected-side of Putamen and Caudate regions and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) were used as significant contributors to our models. The MLR provided a correct classification between PD and controls at an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98. The R-2 from Cox and Snell test was significantly high (0.65) which indicate a high significance of the model. At an optimal threshold of 98%, 8 subjects from SWEED were detected as participants who would develop PD. The PCA-LSVM model provided a correct classification between PD and controls at an average accuracy of 0.92. The LSVM predicted 5 SWEED subjects as participants who would develop PD. Four subjects were cross identified from the MLR and PCA-LSVM. Developed models provided high capacities to distinguish PD participants from controls. The MLR at its optimum threshold coequal the PCA-LSVM model in the prognostic of SWEED group.

The 6/4 FSPM topology utilized in this paper is particularly useful in high speed applications due to low pole count. One of the key feature of the dual-stator 6/4 FSPM is that it overcomes the even harmonics which is an important drawback in the conventional 6/4 FSPM topology. Unlike interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines, where both permanent magnet (PM) and saliency contribute to overall torque, FSPM machines rely only on the PM to develop torque. Hence for a given torque value, PM flux is higher in FSPM than IPM which makes ISC more detrimental in FSPM. Finite element analysis (FEA) is performed on both the dual-stator 6/4 FSPM and a baseline IPM machine. Typically, IPM machines have considerable amount of spatial harmonics. However, because of its unique even order harmonic cancelation properties, the current waveforms obtained for the dual-stator FSPM are more sinusoidal which make it easier for online diagnostics of ISC.

Then pressure data on the curve for each time are seen as a variable and the curve is chosen as the fault sample, analysed by the method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Last, principal components or sum of variance contribution rates more than 95% are selected as sample eigenvalues and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for fault diagnosis. Diagnosis results show that all testing faults can be identified accurately, which indicates SVM model has an extremely excellent ability to identify faults. To further verify the performance of SVM for fault identification, BP neural network is established to compare. The result shows that SVM model is more accurate than BP neural network in fault recognition.

The resources of the production plant are modelled in order to enable the simulation of their functionalities. A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities. Efficient algorithms and technologies for data analysis and prediction are utilized. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be predicted as a result from the simulation of physically-based models, without the machines' operation being stopped, as it happens in the common predictive maintenance solutions.

These are reliable and robust, however may develop a multitude of faults related to machine components like bearings, stator or rotor, etc. Consequently, a number of motor fault identification methods have been developed in the past years for their early diagnosis. This paper gives a comparative analysis for detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bar faults occurring in three phase induction motors fed through variable speed drive. Firstly, it gives a brief overview of two widely used methods known as Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) and Park's Vector Analysis (PVA). Secondly, it provides the details of experimentation carried out to find the presence of broken rotor bar fault and judge their severity. Further, a comparative analysis of both methods is provided in finding the presence and judging the severity of broken rotor bars for motors operating under different loading conditions. PVA is used here successfully for experimentally determining fault severity. Motor parameters such as current, voltage and slip are used as diagnosis means for finding the presence of broken rotor bars and estimating their number. Since fault indicators in motor parameters are highly dependent on operating conditions, the data is acquired for different motor loading. The results obtained are compared and verified using both the methods.

A Bayesian inference engine, called Probabilistic tool for GPON-FTTH Access Network self-DiAgnosis (PANDA), is applied to fault diagnosis of Gigabit capable Passive Optical Networks (GPON). PANDA approach has been assessed on real diagnosis data, showing very satisfactory alignment with an operational rule-based expert system. Furthermore, it provides diagnosis conclusions for all tested cases, even if some monitoring data is missing or incomplete. Finally, an expectation maximization algorithm allows to finely tune the probabilistic model.

However, due to the shutdown during a short period, the regeneration phenomena may occur and further affect the degradation state and rate. In this paper, we concentrate on degradation modeling for such degradation process with the regeneration phenomena. Firstly, we adopt the traditional Wiener process to describe the continuous degradation path and a nonlinear regression model to reflect the regeneration process. Secondly, since the analytical forms of parameters estimation via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) cannot be obtained, we identify the parameters by combining the Bayes rule and expectation conditional estimation (ECM) algorithm. Thirdly, a numerical approach based on Monte Carlo method is given for deriving the RUL under the concept of the first passage time (FPT). Two case examples are provided for illustration including numerical and practical cases.

This paper presents a locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA) based feature dimensionality reduction approach. Different from locally preserving projection (LPP) that only preserves the local structure of data manifold, LSDA can also employ the discriminant information at each local area when conducting the projection. In the proposed fault diagnosis approach, various multi-domain features are calculated aimed at exploring the machinery condition information roundly from different perspectives. LSDA is applied to discover the representative information contained in the high dimensional feature set. Then a lower informative feature space can be constructed with LSDA. Finally, the effective KNN classifier is used to recognize the condition of machinery with the most representative eigenvectors. A bearing fault experiment is conducted to verify the proposed method.

Yet, such models remain incompetent to detect new phish in a real-time application. In this concern, this paper advocates an empirical analysis with the recently published works via a chronological validation. Chronological validation achieved by testing the works on three benchmarking data sets to appraise the causality between their detection outcomes and their limitations. Throughout chronological validation, the tested works have fallen short at detecting new phish web pages with an accessible detection accuracy. High to moderate faults and misclassifications are resulted as implications for their limitations and fixed real-time settings. Accordingly, this paper infers that by elevating the tested models in terms of using new and hybrid features, robust subset of features, and actively learned classifiers; an adaptive anti-phishing model with adjustable settings will be resilient against the up-to-date and scalable web flows. With such inferences, this paper highlights what future trends to develop along with depicting a taxonomy of current status and open problems as a guide to the researchers for their future achievements.

Our water-retaining infrastructure deteriorates under environmental impacts, therefore the ageing of building materials causes a greater probability of deterioration and even failure. Durability of hydraulic structures depends on maintenance circumstances, surveillance, timely repair of structures or rehabilitations. Prognosis of the deterioration speed and durability of slabs is the main problem in each pond. The durability of concrete slabs covering layer can be evaluated by time (T-laye), which equals the time to expose reinforcement of a reinforced concrete structure. Based on the results of the field investigation, the modelling of durability of reinforced concrete slabs for earth dam slope protection was performed. Regularities of concrete compression strength of reinforced concrete slabs for earth dam slope protection under the influence of freezing-thawing cycles and other environmental factors were established. Using the developed durability evaluation method of reinforced concrete slabs for earth dam slope protection, the remaining service life of the construction till the probable beginning (T-5%) or end of its deterioration (T-50%) may be calculated. It is also possible to determine the time (T-layer), during which the reinforcement of the reinforced concrete construction is uncovered/exposed. Using the estimated constant of degradation in designing of reinforced concrete slabs for earth dam slope protection for using them at changing water level, there is a possibility to choose concrete of such strength, that the reinforcement of the construction would not be exposed during the intended period of usage.

Within the manufacturing industry, machine learning algorithms are often used for improving manufacturing system fault diagnosis. This study focuses on a review of recent fault diagnosis applications in manufacturing that are based on several prominent machine learning algorithms. Papers published from 2007 to 2017 were reviewed and keywords were used to identify 20 articles spanning the most prominent machine learning algorithms. Most articles reviewed consisted of training data obtained from sensors attached to the equipment. The training of the machine learning algorithm consisted of designed experiments to simulate different faulty and normal processing conditions. The areas of application varied from wear of cutting tool in computer numeric control (CNC) machine, surface roughness fault, to wafer etching process in semiconductor manufacturing. In all cases, high fault classification rates were obtained. As the interest in smart manufacturing increases, this review serves to address one of the cornerstones of emerging production systems.

Compared with other maintenance strategies, the predictive maintenance strategy has the advantage of lowering the maintenance cost and time. Thus, many studies have been conducted to develop a predictive maintenance model based on a growth of prediction methodology. However, these studies tend to focus on building the predictive model and measuring its performance, rather than selecting the appropriate components for predictive maintenance. Nevertheless, selecting the predictive maintenance policy and target component are as important as model selection and performance measurement. In this paper, a selection method is proposed to improve component selection by referencing current literature and industry expert knowledge. The results of this research can serve as a foundation for further studies in this area.

Nowadays, researchers have intensively investigated deep learning algorithms for solving challenging problems in many areas such as image classification, speech recognition, signal processing, and natural language processing. In this study, we not only review typical deep learning algorithms in computer vision and signal processing but also provide detailed information on how to apply deep learning to specific areas such as road crack detection, fault diagnosis, and human activity detection. Besides, this study also discusses the challenges of designing and training deep neural networks.

PMU data are used in real-time to inform wide area state estimation, monitor area control error, and event detection. As PMU data becomes more reliable, these devices are finding roles within control systems such as demand response programs and early fault detection systems. As with other cyber physical systems, maintaining data integrity and security are significant challenges for power system operators. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multiple machine learning techniques for detecting malicious data injection within PMU data streams. The two datasets used in this study are from the Bonneville Power Administration's PMU network and an inter-university PMU network among three universities, located in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. These datasets contain data from both the transmission level and the distribution level. Our results show that both SVM and ANN are generally effective in detecting spoofed data, and TensorFlow, the newly released tool, demonstrates potential for distributing the training workload and achieving higher performance. We expect these results to shed light on future work of adopting machine learning and data analytics techniques in the electric power industry.

The traditional resonance demodulation method is widely accepted as a powerful tool in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The method of wavelet decomposition combined with resonance demodulation is described in this paper, which is used to extract the fault feature. The test data of the fault bearing is collected, and the feasibility of the method is verified.

Especially, the diagnosis method consists of feature extraction using discrete wavelet packet decomposition and fault classification using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. Based on the feature extraction, the classifier is evaluated in terms of running time and identification rate compared with the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy and the running time is shorter than that of the other methods.

First, using the pairwise coupling method and the one-to-one support vector machine to obtain the basic probability distribution function, the problem of how to obtain the original evidence was solved. Second, the theory of evidence was improved. The conflicting evidence was judged by the distance function of evidence. Then, the evidence was modified and combined to get fusion results. A variety of rotor fault signals were collected and analyzed in the experiments. The results showed that the diagnosis method was effective.

The fault detection and isolation are carried out by evaluating the residuals and the fault signature matrix derived from the bond graph model of the system. In order to refine the fault candidates set after fault isolation, a Bayesian method is adopted where the potential faults in the fault candidates set are treated as the special states to facilitate the unknown parameters estimation. According to the estimation results, the true faults can be obtained which are useful for further maintenance purpose. Simulation studies are conducted to validate the proposed method.

For gaining importance in industry and decrease possible loss of production due to machine stopping, a new intelligent method for bearing health assessment based on Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Blind Source Separation (BSS). EMD is one of the most powerful time-frequency analysis decompose the signal into a set of orthogonal components called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). BSS method used to separate IMFs of one-dimensional time series into independent time series. The health indicator based on the robust correlation coefcient is proposed based on a weighted average correlation calculated from different combinations of the original data. The correlation coefficients between separated IMFs used to estimate the health of bearing; The correlation coefficient used for comparison between the estimated sources with differents degradation levels. The correlation coefficient values are then fitted to a regression to obtain the model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation. The method is applied on accelerated degradations bearings called PRONOSTIA. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reflect effectively the performance degradation of bearing.

To allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuous-time probabilistic model for a monitored patient's temporal sequence of physiological data. Our model captures "informatively sampled" patient episodes: the clinicians' decisions on when to observe a hospitalized patient's vital signs and lab tests over time are represented by a marked Hawkes process, with intensity parameters that are modulated by the patient's latent clinical states, and with observable physiological data (mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task Gaussian process. In addition, our model captures "informatively censored" patient episodes by representing the patient's latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.

The authors have previously proposed a parametrically-encoded Bayesian network approach to combine load monitoring, structural deformations and crack inspection results into an updating framework to perform future fatigue life predictions. The framework uses a lognormal S-N crack initiation approach, assuming vessels start their service lives with uncertain fatigue strength and load spectral estimates. Additionally, extreme values from the same load spectra are assumed to cause visible deformations of the plating field in the structure. The network updates design-stage estimates of loading and fatigue strength based on in-service measurements. The updated parameters are then used for prognosis of future structural state. In our previous work, a fleet of five vessel, with four inspected and one un-inspected was assumed. In this case, we showed that either positive or negative evidence (e.g. the presence or absence of cracks) was useful to the network for updating. Thus, the value of differing types of evidence was not as critical as may be expected. However, in the previous work the impact of the number of ships inspected was not explored. Here we extend the study to explore how the prognosis capability degrades as fewer and fewer ships are inspected.

This paper presents a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model which is designed to optimize the predictive railway tamping activities for the planning horizon up to four years. Five technical and economic aspects are taken into account to schedule tamping: (1) track quality (the standard deviation of the longitudinal level) degradation over time; 2) track quality thresholds based on train speed limits; 3) track geometrical alignment; 4) tamping machine operation factors, and finally, 5) the discount rate. The usage of the model is explored in case studies, including a Danish railway track between Odense and Fredericia with 57.2 km of length. The total cost can be reduced with up to 50% using the proposed model, which shows its great potential to support railway tamping planning in practice.	[Li, R.; Salling, K.

J	Eren, L				Eren, Levent			Bearing Fault Detection by One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DAMAGE DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; DECOMPOSITION; SENSORLESS; MACHINE	Bearing faults are the biggest single source of motor failures. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and other decision support systems are widely used for early detection of bearing faults. The typical decision support systems require feature extraction and classification as two distinct phases. Extracting fixed features each time may require a significant computational cost preventing their use in real-time applications. Furthermore, the selected features for the classification phase may not represent the most optimal choice. In this paper, the use of 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed for a fast and accurate bearing fault detection system. The feature extraction and classification phases of the bearing fault detection are combined into a single learning body with the implementation of 1D CNN. The raw vibration data (signal) is fed into the proposed system as input eliminating the need for running a separate feature extraction algorithm each time vibration data is analyzed for classification. Implementation of 1D CNNs results in more efficient systems in terms of computational complexity. The classification performance of the proposed system with real bearing data demonstrates that the reduced computational complexity is achieved without a compromise in fault detection accuracy.

Deep models like deep belief network (DBN) had shown its advantage in fault feature extraction without prior knowledge. In this paper, an end-to-end approach based on deep convolution neural network (DCNN) is presented. The approach embodying the idea of end to end diagnosis has only one simple and elegant convolution neural network and don't need any exquisite hierarchical structure that was used in the traditional methods. The samples of time-domain signals are inputted into the proposed model without any frequency transformation, and the approach can diagnosis bearing fault types and fault sizes simultaneously as output. Experimental researches had shown that the approach has the advantages such as a simple structure, less iteration and real-time, while its accuracy on the diagnosis of fault types and fault sizes can still be guaranteed.

The optimal feature subset with fewer features contains more discriminative information which can improve the performance of fault diagnosis models. A novel sequential backward feature selection method based on dissimilarity is proposed to detect the difference of features between normal and fault data. The proposed feature selection method can be used to find relevant features with fault. Furthermore, the fault diagnosis model combines the proposed feature selection method with support vector machine. Experimental results on a chemical process indicate that the proposed feature selection method is useful and superior in fault diagnosis.

Single Event Upsets (SEUs) due to radiation impose an increasing problem to the reliable operation of FPGA used in communication, mile-aero, automotive and industrial designs. By developing safe case sequential logic and fault tolerant state machines with error mitigation circuitry logic, the FPGA design can be protected from SEUs. When a soft error occurs, these method ensures safe design operation by returning the design to a known safe or reset state of operation. This logic provides reliable system operation. The objective of this work is to implement automatic error detection and correction of FSMs for single event upsets is presented. We also analyze how bit errors within same clock cycle can be removed by the addition of error checking bits using SEC-DED code algorithm. The SEC-DED is commonly used as error detection and correction since it is more efficient than parity checker. The SEC-DED code can be used as the error detection and correction circuitry behind the FSMs to improve the reliable operation. The proposed architecture is simulated in VCS. This structure is synthesized in Xilinx Virtex 7 for implementing on FPGA. The result of the proposed design is analyzed and compared to determine its performance in terms of reliability.

Early detection of changes in software are also necessary as it helps the software developers and project managers to allocate resources in an efficient manner. It is very critical for the project managers and software developers to detect changes in software in the earlier phases of software development so that the portions of software that are more prone to changes can be restructured and redesigned. Various statistical and machine learning based models are available for maintenance effort prediction of these objects oriented systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for maintenance effort prediction using hybridized (i.e., combining search-based techniques with machine learning alternatives) techniques. Specifically, we will address these research issues: (i) low repeatability of empirical studies involving maintainability models, (ii) less usage of statistical tests for comparing the effectiveness of different models, and (iii) non-assessment of predictive performance of hybridized techniques. The models are constructed using object-oriented metrics and the results of this research are validated using two commercial datasets. Based on the experiments conducted it has been proved that hybridized techniques have capability for predicting maintenance effort.

However, Android based applications are highly vulnerable to various types of malware attacks attributed to their open nature and high popularity in the market. The fault lies in the underneath permission model of Android applications. These applications need a number of sensitive permissions during their installation and runtime, which enables possible security breaches by malware. The contributions of this paper are twofold: 1) We extract a set of 123 dynamic permissions from 11000 Android applications in a largest publicly available dataset till date; 2) We evaluate a number of machine learning classi fi cation techniques including Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (J48), Random Forest (RF), Simple Logistic (SL), and k-star on the newly designed dataset for detecting malicious Android applications. The experimental results indicate that although the malware classi fi cation accuracy of RF, J48, and SL are comparable, SL performs marginally better than the other techniques.

Over the years different techniques have been utilized in the diagnosis and prognosis of CPSs. This information has been used to facilitate maintenance decision making in long term and short term. From the existing literature, the authors have remarked that, most of the proposed methodologies deal with CBM for individual CPSs with less attention on the cases where CPSs form fleets, in which each CPS is comprised of similar types of subsystems or equipments. The authors therefore, address the fleet level of CPSs through which the existing diagnosis and decision making methodologies can be restudied. This article proposes an original way to support fleet maintainer's decision using the fuzzy logic methodology approach in diagnosis and Pareto optimization process for decision making. An application to the pantograph of a fleet of trains is proposed.

An increasing number of deadline-based (real-time) applications are moving to cloud for high availability and low latency. Applications like financial transactions, health-care system, scientific workflows with their real-time nature, i.e., deadline bound, need provisioning of computing services, despite the presence of failure. So, cloud running deadline-based applications need a fault-tolerant framework that can assure availability and responsiveness. Fault can occur in any layer of cloud; physical, virtual, or application and can be handled by various fault management methods, which include fault avoidance, fault detection, and fault recovery. Here, our primary focus is on a Virtual Machine (VM) failure and its detection. We showed the VM behavior in normal working condition and with the failed state through state transition diagram. A timeout based VM fault detector RT-PUSH proposed for cloud running real-time applications.

A severe problem with BEV is battery degradation, leading to a reduction of the already very limited range of a BEV. Analytic models are required to determine the impact of service usage to provide guidance on how to drive and charge and also to support service tasks such as predictive maintenance. However, while the increasing number of sensor data in automotive applications allows for more fine-grained model parameterization and better predictive outcomes, in practical settings the amount of storage and transmission bandwidth is limited by technical and economical considerations. By means of a simulation-based analysis, dynamic user behavior is simulated based on real-world driving profiles parameterized by different driver characteristics and ambient conditions. We find that by using a shrinked subset of variables the required storage can be reduced considerably at low costs in terms of only slightly decreased predictive accuracy.

In this paper, the prediction models are developed using machine learning methods including extreme learning machine (ELM), multiple linear regression, support vector regression and BP neural network. The feature variable sets are optimized through correlation analysis and supplementing indoor temperature. Besides, this paper proposed a strategy to determine the time ahead of prediction model. The thermal response time of building is used as the prediction time step of model. The prediction performances of ELM models with different hidden layer nodes are analyzed and contrasted. The actual data of the building heating using ground source heat pump system are collected and used to test the performances of the models. The results show that the thermal response time of the building is about 40 minutes. Four feature sets are obtained and performances of models with FS4 are better. For different machine learning methods, the performances of ELM models are better than others. In addition, the optimal number of hidden layer nodes is 11 for the ELM model with FS4.

The development of advanced algorithms oriented towards fuel cell system monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics and control can significantly reduce the incidence of degradation mechanisms and faulty events on fuel cell performance and durability. Therefore, a valuable increase in system efficiency and lifetime can be achieved by proper design of such algorithms, especially for applications working under highly variable load profiles. The present work deals with the design of a model-based control algorithm aimed at mitigating degradation effects on a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) system. Such an algorithm embeds cell degradation models, describing Ostwald ripening and Platinum dissolution mechanisms, which affects the cell Electrochemical Surface Area. The control algorithm is developed aiming at PEMFC durability improvement, while ensuring user power request, and its performance is evaluated in simulated environment addressing stationary power generation applications with variable load profile and comparing the cell degradation decay under different control strategies.

This paper proposes a novel diagnosis scheme that uses three unscented Kalman Filters (UKFs) to detect and isolate current sensor and position sensor faults of PMSM drive system. The PMSM drive model is built in Matlab/Simulink. In the process of fault diagnosis, three UKFs are used in the fault diagnosis process, and each UKF receives different sensor information. All faults can be efficiently isolated by using these UKFs as different faults affect each UKF differently. From the results we got, it is conclude that the proposed methodology could properly handle the nonlinear properties with good robustness and high diagnosis accuracy. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The key implementation goal consists in efficiently handling massive incoming data streams and supporting advanced data analytics services like anomaly detection. In an on-going, industrial project, a 24/7 available stream processing engine usually faces dynamically changing data and workload characteristics. These changes impact the engine's performance and reliability. We propose Strider, a hybrid adaptive distributed RDF Stream Processing engine that optimizes logical query plan according to the state of data streams. Strider has been designed to guarantee important industrial properties such as scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, high throughput and acceptable latency. These guarantees are obtained by designing the engine's architecture with state-of-the-art Apache components such as Spark and Kafka. We highlight the efficiency (e.g., on a single machine machine, up to 60x gain on throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems, a throughput of 3.1 million triples/second on a 9 machines cluster, a major breakthrough in this system's category) of Strider on real-world and synthetic data sets.

In most existing research, the primary focus has been on explicit specification-driven solutions which requires too much effort for application developers, and leads to inflexibility. We propose a fuzzy job distributor (load balancer) for fault tolerance management to reduce levels of management complexity for the user. The proposed approach aims to reduce the possibility of fault occurrences in the system by a fair distribution of user job requests among available resources. In our self-adaptive approach, the system manages anomalous situations that might lead to failure by distributing the incoming job request based on the reliability of processing nodes, i.e., virtual machines (VMs). The reliability of VMs is a variable parameter and changes during its lifetime. Our approach is implemented and comparatively analysed using OpenStack. The experimental results show a significant reduction in the occurrence of faults in comparison with other load balancing algorithms.

A method combining Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Random Forest (RF) is proposed. Firstly, the original signal is decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EEMD, and the effective IMFs are selected. Then their energy entropy is calculated as the feature. Finally, the classification is performed by RF. In addition, the wavelet method is also used in the proposed process, the same as EEMD. The results of the comparison show that the EEMD method is more accurate than the wavelet method.

This knowledge is sometimes a luxury and could introduce added uncertainty and bias to the results. To address this problem a deep learning enabled featureless methodology is proposed to automatically learn the features of the data. Time-frequency representations of the raw data are used to generate image representations of the raw signal, which are then fed into a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for classification and fault diagnosis. This methodology was applied to two public data sets of rolling element bearing vibration signals. Three time-frequency analysis methods (short-time Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and Hilbert-Huang transform) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN architecture achieves better results with less learnable parameters than similar architectures used for fault detection, including cases with experimental noise.

C	Jung, U		Tan, CM; Goh, TN		Jung, Uk			Nonparametric Wavelet-Based Multivariate Control Chart for Rotating Machinery Condition Monitoring	THEORY AND PRACTICE OF QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING IN ASIA INDUSTRY			English	Proceedings Paper	Congress of the Asian-Network-for-Quality (ANQ)	AUG, 2014	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Asian Network Qual		Multivariate control chart; Fault detection; Wavelet transformation; Bootstrap technique; Vibration signal	STRUCTURAL DAMAGE DETECTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; EMD	Signal processing of vibration signals from rotating machinery has been an active research area for recent years. Especially, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is considered as a powerful tool for feature extraction in detecting fault on rotating machinery. However, the number of retained DWT features can be still too large to be used for standard multivariate statistical process control (SPC) techniques although DWT significantly reduces the dimensionality of the data. Even though many feature-based SPC methods have been introduced to tackle this deficiency, most of methods require a parametric distributional assumption that restricts their feasibility to specific problem of process control and thus limits their applications. This study introduced new feature extraction technique to alleviate the high dimensionality problem of implementing multivariate SPC when the quality characteristic is a vibration signal from bearing system. A set of multiscale wavelet scalogram features was generated to reduce the dimensionality of data, and is combined with the bootstrapping technique as nonparametric density estimation to set up an upper control limit of control chart. Our example and numerical simulation of a bearing system demonstrated that the proposed method has satisfactory fault-discriminating ability without any distributional assumption.

In either case considerable manual effort is required for diagnosing building operation problems related to energy usage or occupant comfort. We present a Cognitive Building demo that uses (i) semantic reasoning to model physical relationships of sensors and systems, (ii) machine learning to predict and detect anomalies in energy flow, occupancy and user comfort, and (iii) speech-enabled Augmented Reality interfaces for immersive interaction with thousands of devices. Our demo analyzes data from more than 3,300 sensors and shows how we can automatically diagnose building operation problems.

In operating conditions, components usually experience stresses continuously varying over time, which have an impact on the degradation processes. This paper investigates a Wiener process model to track and predict the RL under time-varying conditions. The item-to-item variation is captured by the drift parameter and the degradation characteristic of the whole population is described by the diffusion parameter. The bootstrap method and Bayesian theorem are employed to estimate and update the distribution parameters of a' and b', which are the coefficients of the linear drifting process in the degradation model. Once new degradation information becomes available, the RL distributions considering the future operating condition are derived. The proposed method is tested on Lithium-ion battery devices under three levels of charging/discharging rates. The results are further validated by a simulation method.

J	Wang, LM; Shao, YM				Wang, Liming; Shao, Yimin			Fault mode analysis and detection for gear tooth crack during its propagating process based on dynamic simulation method	ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Tooth root crack; Propagation; Gear mesh stiffness; Fault mode analysis	MESH STIFFNESS CALCULATION; SPUR GEAR; TRANSMISSION; FRICTION; PATH	Gearbox is one of the most important parts of rotating machinery, therefore, it is vital to carry out health monitoring for gearboxes. However, it is still an unsolved problem to disclose the impact of gear tooth crack fault on gear system vibration features during the crack propagating process, besides effective crack fault mode detection methods are lacked. In this study, an analytical model is proposed to calculate the time varying mesh stiffness of the meshing gear pair, and in this model the tooth bending stiffness, shear stiffness, axial compressive stiffness, Hertzian contact stiffness and fillet-foundation stiffness are taken into consideration. Afterwards, the vibration mechanism and effects of different levels of gear tooth crack on the gear system dynamics are investigated based on a 6 DOF dynamic model. Then, the crack fault vibration mode is studied, and a parametrical-Laplace wavelet method is presented to describe the crack fault mode. Furthermore, based on the maximum correlation coefficient (MCC) criterion, the optimized Laplace wavelet base is determined, which is then designed as a health indicator to detect the crack fault. The results show that the proposed method is effective in fault diagnosis of severe tooth crack as well as the early stage tooth crack. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome the coupling of the two PMSMs, the master-slave selection principle is introduced. The coupling phase with the larger absolute value of the phase current error is determined as the master coupling phase and the leg-switch-state of the common leg is set as the phase-switch-state of the master coupling phase. On the other hand, the phase-switch-states of four individual phases are directly assigned to the four individual legs, respectively. The executing process of DHCC does not require any machine parameters, which enhances the system robustness. The effectiveness of DHCC is verified by experimental results.

J	Yung, KC; Sun, B; Jiang, XP				Yung, Kam-Chuen; Sun, Bo; Jiang, Xiaopeng			Prognostics-based qualification of high-power white LEDs using Levy process approach	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Light-emitting diodes; Qualification; prognostics; Reliability; Anomaly detection; Levy process	ANOMALY DETECTION; LIFE; DEGRADATION; UNCERTAINTY	Due to their versatility in a variety of applications and the growing market demand, high power white light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have attracted considerable attention. Reliability qualification testing is an essential part of the product development process to ensure the reliability of a new LED product before its release. However, the widely used IES-TM-21 method does not provide comprehensive reliability information. For more accurate and effective qualification, this paper presents a novel method based on prognostics techniques. Prognostics is an engineering technology predicting the future reliability or determining the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of a product by assessing the extent of deviation or degradation from its expected normal operating conditions. A Levy subordinator of a mixed Gamma and compound Poisson process is used to describe the actual degradation process of LEDs characterized by random sporadic small jumps of degradation degree, and the reliability function is derived for qualification with different distribution forms of jump sizes. The IES LM-80 test results reported by different LED vendors are used to develop and validate the qualification methodology. This study will be helpful for LED manufacturers to reduce the total test time and cost required to qualify the reliability of an LED product. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	McDonald, GL; Zhao, Q				McDonald, Geoff L.; Zhao, Qing			Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution and Convolution Fix: Application to vibration fault detection	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Gearbox; Fault detection; Minimum entropy deconvolution; Vibration; Rotating machine; Deconvolution	SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; BALL-BEARINGS; DIAGNOSIS; GEAR; ENHANCEMENT; MACHINES	Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been applied successfully to rotating machine fault detection from vibration data, however this method has limitations. A convolution adjustment to the MED definition and solution is proposed in this paper to address the discontinuity at the start of the signal - in some cases causing spurious impulses to be erroneously deconvolved. A problem with the MED solution is that it is an iterative selection process, and will not necessarily design an optimal filter for the posed problem. Additionally, the problem goal in MED prefers to deconvolve a single-impulse, while in rotating machine faults we expect one impulse-like vibration source per rotational period of the faulty element. Maximum Correlated Kurtosis Deconvolution was proposed to address some of these problems, and although it solves the target goal of multiple periodic impulses, it is still an iterative non-optimal solution to the posed problem and only solves for a limited set of impulses in a row. Ideally, the problem goal should target an impulse train as the output goal, and should directly solve for the optimal filter in a non-iterative manner. To meet these goals, we propose a non-iterative deconvolution approach called Multipoint Optimal Minimum Entropy Deconvolution Adjusted (MOMEDA). MOMEDA proposes a deconvolution problem with an infinite impulse train as the goal and the optimal filter solution can be solved for directly. From experimental data on a gearbox with and without a gear tooth chip, we show that MOMEDA and its deconvolution spectrums according to the period between the impulses can be used to detect faults and study the health of rotating machine elements effectively.

In this paper, a novel indicator of bearing performance degradation assessment is presented based on the mathematical morphology (MM) theory for higher efficiency. Because the traditional mathematical morphology particle (MMP) is unable to exactly describe the bearing's performance degradation, we extended its definition to the general space to address the limited ability of the former definition. On the basis of the innovative definition, we used the morphology erosion operation instead of the morphology open operation to calculate the general mathematical morphology particle (GMMP) of the bearing's whole life data. The analysis of the simulation and practical application demonstrated that the proposed index is feasible and effective to indicate the performance degradation of the bearing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this issue, practitioners might require the use of self-starting approaches that consider only the available knowledge about the current degradation process and the asset operating context to update the prognostic model. Some authors use Autoregressive (AR) models for this purpose that are adequate when the asset operating context is constant, however, if it is variable, the accuracy of the models can be affected. In this paper, three autoregressive models with exogenous variables (ARX) were constructed, and their capability to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a process was evaluated following the case of the aluminum crack growth problem. An existing stochastic model of aluminum crack growth was implemented and used to assess RUL estimation performance of the proposed ARX models through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Point and interval estimations were made based only on individual history, behavior, operating conditions and failure thresholds. Both analytic and bootstrapping techniques were used in the estimation process. Finally, by including recursive parameter estimation and a forgetting factor, the ARX methodology adapts to changing operating conditions and maintain the focus on the current degradation level of an asset (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Aiming at the nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of bearing vibration signals as well as the complexity of condition-indicating information distribution in the signals, a novel rolling element bearing fault diagnosis method based on multifractal theory and gray relation theory was proposed in the paper. Firstly, a generalized multifractal dimension algorithm was developed to extract the characteristic vectors of fault features from the bearing vibration signals, which can offer more meaningful and distinguishing information reflecting different bearing health status in comparison with conventional single fractal dimension. After feature extraction by multifractal dimensions, an adaptive gray relation algorithm was applied to implement an automated bearing fault pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed method can identify various bearing fault types as well as severities effectively and accurately.

Kinetic parameters were obtained from experimental photo-fermentations using fluorescent lamps as artificial light source. Three different light intensities (I) were tested in order to evaluate the influence of this process variable on growth rate and hydrogen production. Optimal conditions for state variables, such as I, pH and Temperature, were experimentally obtained and then used as parameters in the mechanistic model. Kinetics from either the proposed mechanistic model or the experimental photo-fermentations were compared, obtaining similar time trajectories for the process variables when operating at optimal conditions. However, this similarity decreased slightly at different light intensities, when the pH oscillated during the fermentations. Simulations under different initial conditions of substrate concentration, pH, and light intensity were run so as to generate data sets, used for constructing data-based classification models. A complete methodology, which entails a feature extraction step with Multi-way Principal Component Analysis technique and a proper classification stage using Support Vector Machines as algorithm, was proposed and addressed in order to develop such data models. These models were validated on both simulated and experimental data, which supported the robustness not only of the data based models but also the developed mechanistic model. One-hundred percent classification performance was obtained after validating the data-based models, which envisages a further application of these models to other fields such as process monitoring, process control or fault diagnosis.

J	Lu, SL; Wang, XX; He, QB; Liu, F; Liu, YB				Lu, Siliang; Wang, Xiaoxian; He, Qingbo; Liu, Fang; Liu, Yongbin			Fault diagnosis of motor bearing with speed fluctuation via angular resampling of transient sound signals	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; ROTATING MACHINERY; WAVELET; SEPARATION; TRANSFORM; DEMODULATION	Transient signal analysis (TSA) has been proven an effective tool for motor bearing fault diagnosis, but has yet to be applied in processing bearing fault signals with variable rotating speed. In this study, a new TSA-based angular resampling (TSAAR) method is proposed for fault diagnosis under speed fluctuation condition via sound signal analysis. By applying the TSAAR method, the frequency smearing phenomenon is eliminated and the fault characteristic frequency is exposed in the envelope spectrum for bearing fault recognition. The TSAAR method can accurately estimate the phase information of the fault-induced impulses using neither complicated time-frequency analysis techniques nor external speed sensors, and hence it provides a simple, flexible, and data-driven approach that realizes variable-speed motor bearing fault diagnosis. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed TSAAR method are verified through a series of simulated and experimental case studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, YB; He, B; Liu, F; Lu, SL; Zhao, YL				Liu, Yongbin; He, Bing; Liu, Fang; Lu, Siliang; Zhao, Yilei			Feature fusion using kernel joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices for rolling bearing fault identification	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; MANIFOLD; WAVELET; PCA; LDA	Fault pattern identification is a crucial step for the intelligent fault diagnosis of real-time health conditions in monitoring a mechanical system. However, many challenges exist in extracting the effective feature from vibration signals for fault recognition. A new feature fusion method is proposed in this study to extract new features using kernel joint approximate diagonalization of eigen-matrices (KJADE). In the method, the input space that is composed of original features is mapped into a high-dimensional feature space by nonlinear mapping. Then, the new features can be estimated through the eigen-decomposition of the fourth-order cumulative kernel matrix obtained from the feature space. Therefore, the proposed method could be used to reduce data redundancy because it extracts the inherent pattern structure of different fault classes as it is nonlinear by nature. The integration evaluation factor of between-class and within-class scatters (SS) is employed to depict the clustering performance quantitatively, and the new feature subset extracted by the proposed method is fed into a multi-class support vector machine for fault pattern identification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental vibration signals with different bearing fault types and seventies. Results of several cases show that the [(JADE algorithm is efficient in feature fusion for bearing fault identification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) and Cell division cycle 20 related protein 1 (CDH1), as co-activators of APC/C, play significant roles in the spindle assembly checkpoint, guiding ubiquitin-mediated degradation, together with CDC23. During the embryonic development of the brine shrimp, Artemia sinica, CDC20, CDH1 and CDC23 participate in cell cycle regulation, but the specific mechanisms of their activities remain unknown. Herein, the full-length cDNAs of cdc20 and cdc23 from A. sinica were cloned. Real-time PCR analyzed the expression levels of As-cdc20 and As-cdc23. The locations of CDH1, CDC20 and CDC23 showed no tissue or organ specificity. Furthermore, western blotting showed that the levels of As-CDC20, securin, cyclin B, CDK1, CDH1, CDC14B, CDC23 and geminin proteins conformed to their complicated degradation relationships during different embryo stages. Our research revealed that As-CDC20, As-CDH1 and APC mediate the mitotic progression, downstream proteins degradation and cellular differentiation in the process of embryonic development in A. sinica.

In this study, we discovered for the first time that brusatol (BRU), a quassinoid extracted from Brucea Esters, has the capability to inhibit HIF-1 signaling pathway. We found that BRU concentration-dependently down-regulated HIF-1 alpha protein levels under hypoxia or CoCl2-induced mimic hypoxia in HCT116 cells without causing significant cytotoxicity. Besides, the transactivation activity of HIF-1 was suppressed by BRU under hypoxic conditions, as well as the expression of HIF-1 target genes, including VEGF, GLUT1, HK2 and LDHA. In addition, BRU can also decrease glucose consumption under hypoxia through inhibition of HIF-1 signaling pathway. Further studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of BRU on HIF-1 signaling pathway might be attributed to promoting degradation of HIF-1a. Interestingly, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial ROS level were both decreased by BRU treatment, indicating the involvment of mitochondrial ROS regulation in the action of BRU. Taken together, these results provided clear evidence for BRU-mediated HIF-1 alpha regulation and suggested its therapeutic potential in colon tumors.

To investigate their distinct roles, we generated knockout mice deficient in CycG1 (G1KO) or CycG2 (G2KO), as well as double knockout mice (DKO) deficient in both proteins. All knockouts developed normally and were fertile. Generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from these mice revealed that G2KO MEFs, but not G1KO or DKO MEFs, were resistant to DNA damage insults caused by camptothecin and ionizing radiation (IR) and underwent cell cycle arrest. CycG2, but not CycG1, co-localized with.H2AX foci in the nucleus after gamma-IR, and gamma H2AXmediated DNA repair and dephosphorylation of CHK2 were delayed in G2KO MEFs. H2AX associated with CycG1, CycG2, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), suggesting that.H2AX affects the function of PP2A via direct interaction with its B'. subunit. Furthermore, expression of CycG2, but not CycG1, was abnormal in various cancer cell lines. Kaplan-Meier curves based on TCGA data disclosed that head and neck cancer patients with reduced CycG2 expression have poorer clinical prognoses. Taken together, our data suggest that reduced CycG2 expression could be useful as a novel prognostic marker of cancer.

An experiment platform is established and the ESC tests are implemented on ten 18650-type lithium cells considering different state-of-charges (SOCs). Based on the experiment results, several efforts have been made. (1) The ESC process can be divided into two periods and the electrical and thermal behaviors within these two periods are analyzed. (2) A modified first-order RC model is employed to simulate the electrical behavior of the lithium cell in the ESC fault process. The model parameters are re identified by a dynamic-neighborhood particle swarm optimization algorithm. (3) A two-layer model based ESC fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed. The first layer conducts preliminary fault detection and the second layer gives a precise model-based diagnosis. Four new cells are short-circuited to evaluate the proposed algorithm. It shows that the ESC fault can be diagnosed within 5 s, the error between the model and measured data is less than 0.36 V. The effectiveness of the fault diagnosis algorithm is not sensitive to the precision of battery SOC. The proposed algorithm can still make the correct diagnosis even if there is 10% error in SOC estimation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A data-driven method to enhance vibration signal decomposition for rolling bearing fault analysis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Empirical Mode Decomposition; Combined Mode Functions; Vibration; Bearing; Fault detection	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE	Health condition analysis and diagnostics of rotating machinery requires the capability of properly characterizing the information content of sensor signals in order to detect and identify possible fault features. Time-frequency analysis plays a fundamental role, as it allows determining both the existence and the causes of a fault. The separation of components belonging to different time-frequency scales, either associated to healthy or faulty conditions, represents a challenge that motivates the development of effective methodologies for multi-scale signal decomposition. In this framework, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a flexible tool, thanks to its data-driven and adaptive nature. However, the EMD usually yields an over-decomposition of the original signals into a large number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The selection of most relevant IMFs is a challenging task, and the reference literature lacks automated methods to achieve a synthetic decomposition into few physically meaningful modes by avoiding the generation of spurious or meaningless modes. The paper proposes a novel automated approach aimed at generating a decomposition into a minimal number of relevant modes, called Combined Mode Functions (CMFs), each consisting in a sum of adjacent IMFs that share similar properties. The final number of CMFs is selected in a fully data driven way, leading to an enhanced characterization of the signal content without any information loss. A novel criterion to assess the dissimilarity between adjacent CMFs is proposed, based on probability density functions of frequency spectra. The method is suitable to analyze vibration signals that may be periodically acquired within the operating life of rotating machineries. A rolling element bearing fault analysis based on experimental data is presented to demonstrate the performances of the method and the provided benefits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ou, L; Yu, DJ; Yang, HJ				Ou, Lu; Yu, Dejie; Yang, Hanjian			A new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on GFT impulse component extraction	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Rolling bearing; Graph Fourier Transform; Impulse component; Component extraction	SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; TRANSIENT FAULTS; GRAPHS; SIGNALS; ECG; COMPRESSION; MACHINERY; FILTER	Periodic impulses are vital indicators of rolling bearing faults. The extraction of impulse components from rolling bearing vibration signals is of great importance for fault diagnosis. In this paper, vibration signals are taken as the path graph signals in a manifold perspective, and the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) of vibration signals are investigated from the graph spectrum domain, which are both introduced into the vibration signal analysis. To extract the impulse components efficiently, a new adjacency weight matrix is defined, and then the GFT of the impulse component and harmonic component in the rolling bearing vibration signals are analyzed. Furthermore, as the GFT graph spectrum of the impulse component is mainly concentrated in the high-order region, a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on GFT impulse component extraction is proposed. In the proposed method, the GFT of a vibration signal is firstly performed, and its graph spectrum coefficients in the high-order region are extracted to reconstruct different impulse components. Next, the Hilbert envelope spectra of these impulse components are calculated, and the envelope spectrum values at the fault characteristic frequency are arranged in order. Furthermore, the envelope spectrum with the maximum value at the fault characteristic frequency is selected as the final result, from which the rolling bearing fault can be diagnosed. Finally, an index KR, which is the product of the kurtosis and Hilbert envelope spectrum fault feature ratio of the extracted impulse component, is put forward to measure the performance of the proposed method. Simulations and experiments are utilized to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Leclere, Q; Andre, H; Antoni, J				Leclere, Quentin; Andre, Hugo; Antoni, Jerome			A multi-order probabilistic approach for Instantaneous Angular Speed tracking debriefing of the CMMNO'14 diagnosis contest	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Instantaneous Angular Speed; Wind turbines; Order tracking; Demodulation; Virtual tacho	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FAULT-DETECTION; SIGNAL; CYCLOSTATIONARITY; ACCELERATION; METHODOLOGY; COMPONENTS; SEPARATION; GEARBOX	The aim of this work is to propose a novel approach for the estimation of the Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) of rotating machines from vibration measurements. This work is originated, from the organisation, by the authors of this paper, of a contest during the conference CMMNO 2014, that was held in Lyon, December 2014. One purpose of the contest was to extract the IAS of a wind turbine from a gearbox accelerometer signal. The analysis of contestant contributions led to the observation that the main source of error in this exercise was the wrong association of one selected and tracked harmonic component with one mechanical periodic phenomenon, this association being assumed as an a priori hypothesis by all the methods used by the contestants. The approach proposed in this work does not need this kind of a priori assumption. A majority (but not necessarily all) periodical mechanical events are considered from a preliminary analysis of the kinematics of the machine (harmonics of shaft rotation speeds, meshing frequencies, etc.).

J	Pan, MC; Chu, WC; Le, DD				Pan, M. -Ch.; Chu, W. -Ch.; Le, Duc-Do			Adaptive angular-velocity Vold-Kalman filter order tracking - Theoretical basis, numerical implementation and parameter investigation	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Adaptive order tracking; Parameter investigation; Rotary machinery	SHAFT-SPEED INFORMATION; EXPLORATION; ALGORITHM	The paper presents an alternative Vold-Kalman filter order tracking (VKF_OT) method, i.e. adaptive angular-velocity VKF_OT technique, to extract and characterize order components in an adaptive manner for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotary machinery. The order/spectral waveforms to be tracked can be recursively solved by using Kalman filter based on the one-step state prediction. The paper comprises theoretical derivation of computation scheme, numerical implementation, and parameter investigation. Comparisons of the adaptive VKF_OT scheme with two other ones are performed through processing synthetic signals of designated order components. Processing parameters such as the weighting factor and the correlation matrix of process noise, and data conditions like the sampling frequency, which influence tracking behavior, are explored. The merits such as adaptive processing nature and computation efficiency brought by the proposed scheme are addressed although the computation was performed in off-line conditions. The proposed scheme can simultaneously extract multiple spectral components, and effectively decouple close and crossing orders associated with multi-axial reference rotating speeds.

J	Singh, DS; Zhao, Q				Singh, Dheeraj Sharan; Zhao, Qing			Pseudo-fault signal assisted EMD for fault detection and isolation in rotating machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Rotating machine; Vibration monitoring; Empirical mode decomposition; Enveloping; Signal assisted fault detection	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT SPECTRUM; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	This paper presents a novel data driven technique for the detection and isolation of faults, which generate impacts in a rotating equipment. The technique is built upon the principles of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), envelope analysis and pseudo-fault signal for fault separation. Firstly, the most dominant intrinsic mode function (IMF) is identified using EMD of a raw signal, which contains all the necessary information about the faults. The envelope of this IMF is often modulated with multiple vibration sources and noise. A second level decomposition is performed by applying pseudo-fault signal (PFS) assisted EMD on the envelope. A pseudo-fault signal is constructed based on the known fault characteristic frequency of the particular machine. The objective of using external (pseudo-fault) signal is to isolate different fault frequencies, present in the envelope. The pseudo-fault signal serves dual purposes: (i) it solves the mode mixing problem inherent in EMD, (ii) it isolates and quantifies a particular fault frequency component. The proposed technique is suitable for real-time implementation, which has also been validated on simulated fault and experimental data corresponding to a bearing and a gear-box setup, respectively.

J	Lv, Y; Yuan, R; Song, GB				Lv, Yong; Yuan, Rui; Song, Gangbing			Multivariate empirical mode decomposition and its application to fault diagnosis of rolling bearing	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Multivariate EMD; Multiple sensors; Fault correlation factor; Rolling bearing	NONLOCAL MEANS; EMD	Rolling bearings are widely used in rotary machinery systems. The measured vibration signal of any part linked to rolling bearings contains fault information when failure occurs, differing only by energy levels. Bearing failure will cause the vibration of other components, and therefore the collected bearing vibration signals are mixed with vibration signal of other parts and noise. Using multiple sensors to collect signals at different locations on the machine to obtain multivariate signal can avoid the loss of local information. Subsequently using the multivariate empirical mode decomposition (multivariate EMD) to simultaneously analyze the multivariate signal is beneficial to extract fault information, especially for weak fault characteristics during the period of early failure. This paper proposes a novel method for fault feature extraction of rolling, bearing based on multivariate EMD. The nonlocal means (NL-means) denoising method is used to preprocess the multivariate signal and the correlation analysis is employed to calculate fault correlation factors to select effective intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Finally characteristic frequencies are extracted from the selected IMFs by spectrum analysis. The numerical simulations and applications to bearing monitoring verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicate that this novel method is promising in the field of signal decomposition and fault diagnosis.

J	He, D; Wang, XF; Li, SC; Lin, J; Zhao, M				He, Dan; Wang, Xiufeng; Li, Shancang; Lin, Jing; Zhao, Ming			Identification of multiple faults in rotating machinery based on minimum entropy deconvolution combined with spectral kurtosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Minimum entropy deconvolution; Spectral kurtosis; Multi-fault diagnosis; Envelope analysis	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; TRANSIENT FAULTS; DIAGNOSTICS; MODEL; ENHANCEMENT; KURTOGRAM; SIGNALS; DEFECT	Due to the complexity of mechanical system, multiple faults may co-exist in a rotating machinery, where vibration is commonly used for diagnosis. The measured vibration signal could be considered as a result of convolution process of malfunction induced periodic impact signal and resonant response of the mechanical component, and deconvolution is an effective way to restore impulses. The minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) has been shown to be an effective deconvolution method and has been employed in rotating machinery fault diagnosis. Nevertheless, the simulation in this paper shows that the MED is unable to identify multi-faults of rotating machinery fully when different faults excite different resonance frequencies. To overcome this shortcoming, a new multi-faults detection method based on Spectral kurtosis (SK) and MED is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation data and field signals from a vacuum pump. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zeng, M; Yang, Y; Luo, SR; Cheng, JS				Zeng, Ming; Yang, Yu; Luo, Songrong; Cheng, Junsheng			One-class classification based on the convex hull for bearing fault detection	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						One-class classification; Nearest point problem; Generalized Gilbert algorithm; Reduced convex hull; Bearings; Fault detection	SUPPORT; DIAGNOSIS	Originating from a nearest point problem, a novel method called one-class classification based on the convex hull (OCCCH) is proposed for one-class classification problems. The basic goal of OCCCH is to find the nearest point to the origin from the reduced convex hull of training samples. A generalized Gilbert algorithm is proposed to solve the nearest point problem. It is a geometric algorithm with high computational efficiency. OCCCH has two different forms, i.e., OCCCH-1 and OCCCH-2. The relationships among OCCCH-1, OCCCH-2 and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) are investigated theoretically. The classification accuracy and the computational efficiency of the three methods are compared through the experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that OCCCH (including OCCCH-1 and OCCCH-2) using the generalized Gilbert algorithm performs more efficiently than OCSVM using the well-known sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm; at the same time, OCCCH-2 can always obtain comparable classification accuracies to OCSVM. Finally, these methods are applied to the monitoring model constructions for bearing fault detection. Compared with OCCCH-2 and OCSVM, OCCCH-1 can significantly decrease the false alarm ratio while detecting the bearing fault successfully. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Juesas, P; Ramasso, E				Juesas, P.; Ramasso, E.			Ascertainment-adjusted parameter estimation approach to improve robustness against misspecification of health monitoring methods	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-series; Noisy and uncertain labels; Weighted distribution theory; Health monitoring; CMAPSS datasets	HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; NONSTATIONARY; DIAGNOSTICS; PROGNOSTICS; FRAMEWORK	Condition monitoring aims at ensuring system safety which is a fundamental requirement for industrial applications and that has become an inescapable social demand. This objective is attained by instrumenting the system and developing data analytics methods such as statistical models able to turn data into relevant knowledge. One difficulty is to be able to correctly estimate the parameters of those methods based on time-series data. This paper suggests the use of the Weighted Distribution Theory together with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to improve parameter estimation in statistical models with latent variables with an application to health monotonic under uncertainty. The improvement of estimates is made possible by incorporating uncertain and possibly noisy prior knowledge on latent variables in a sound manner. The latent variables are exploited to build a degradation model of dynamical system represented as a sequence of discrete states. Examples on Gaussian Mixture Models, Hidden Markov Models (HMM) with discrete and continuous outputs are presented on both simulated data and benchmarks using the turbofan engine datasets. A focus on the application of a discrete HMM to health monitoring under uncertainty allows to emphasize the interest of the proposed approach in presence of different operating conditions and fault modes. It is shown that the proposed model depicts high robustness in presence of noisy and uncertain prior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With new emerging semiconductor technologies, higher inverter switching frequencies will be possible and high inverter dv/dt-rates appear, resulting in transient overvoltages at the machine which increase the stress on the insulation system and lead to insulation degradation. Thus, insulation condition monitoring is getting more and more important to ensure a safe and reliable operation of traction motors in trains and locomotives, trams and so on. This study proposes an online insulation monitoring approach that is able to detect incipient insulation defects by evaluation of the motor transient current response on voltage pulses injected by standard inverter switching. Experimental results of this concept are obtained with tests on a 1.4 MW induction machine for railway application. Additionally, the influence of different dv/dt-rates up to 20 kV/mu s on the monitoring performance is verified using a VSI-inverter equipped with SiC semiconductors.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-tumorigenic capacities of NQO1 have not been fully elucidated. Here we show a previously undescribed function for NQO1 in stabilizing HIF-1 alpha, a master transcription factor of oxygen homeostasis that has been implicated in the survival, proliferation and malignant progression of cancers. We demonstrate that NQO1 directly binds to the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF-1 alpha and inhibits the proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1 alpha by preventing PHDs from interacting with HIF-1 alpha. NQO1 knockdown in human colorectal and breast cancer cell lines suppresses HIF-1 signalling and tumour growth. Consistent with this pro-tumorigenic function for NQO1, high NQO1 expression levels correlate with increased HIF-1 alpha expression and poor colorectal cancer patient survival. These results collectively reveal a function of NQO1 in the oxygen-sensing mechanism that regulates HIF-1 alpha stability in cancers.

HIF-1 alpha stability is regulated by VHL-E3 ligase-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation; however, the hypoxia-regulated deubiquitinase that stabilizes HIF-1 alpha has not been identified. Here we report that HAUSP (USP7) deubiquitinase deubiquitinates HIF-1 alpha to increase its stability, induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promote metastasis. Hypoxia induces K63-linked polyubiquitinated HAUSP at lysine 443 to enhance its functions. Knockdown of HAUSP decreases acetylation of histone 3 lysine 56 (H3K56Ac). K63-polyubiquitinated HAUSP interacts with a ubiquitin receptor CBP to specifically mediate H3K56 acetylation. ChIP-seq analysis of HAUSP and HIF-1 alpha binding reveals two motifs responsive to hypoxia. HectH9 is the E3 ligase for HAUSP and a prognostic marker together with HIF-1 alpha. This report demonstrates that hypoxia-induced K63-polyubiquitinated HAUSP deubiquitinates HIF-1 alpha and causes CBP-mediated H3K56 acetylation on HIF-1 alpha target gene promoters to promote EMT/metastasis, further defining HAUSP as a therapeutic target in hypoxia-induced tumour progression.

Firstly, support vector machine (SVM) was used to evaluate the predictive value of each feature for pathology and TNM clinical stage. Secondly, Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the prognostic value of these imaging signatures selected by SVM which subjected to a primary cohort of 138 patients, and an external independent validation of 61 patients. The results indicated that predictive accuracy for histopathology, N staging, and overall clinical stage was 75.16%, 79.40% and 80.33%, respectively. Besides, Cox models indicated the signatures selected by SVM: "correlation of co-occurrence after wavelet transform" was significantly associated with overall survival in the two datasets (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-2.75, p = 0.010; and HR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.10-6.85, p = 0.027, respectively). Our study indicates that the phenotypic features might provide some insight in metastatic potential or aggressiveness for NSCLC, which potentially offer clinical value in directing personalized therapeutic regimen selection for NSCLC.

J	Cui, HY; Qiao, YY; Yin, YM; Hong, M				Cui, Hongyu; Qiao, Yuanying; Yin, Yumei; Hong, Ming			An investigation of rolling bearing early diagnosis based on high-frequency characteristics and self-adaptive wavelet de-noising	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Wavelet de-noising; Energy entropy; Grey relational analysis; Rolling bearing; Fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; ENTROPY; VPMCD; SVM	Rolling bearings are necessary parts in rotary machines. However, the problem of early fault diagnosis for rolling bearings is difficult to solve due to its low signal-to-noise ratio and non-linear and non-stationary signal. Based on a detailed investigation of rolling bearing vibration signals, this paper proposes a method for determining whether a fault occurs by comparing the high-frequency band power. If a fault occurs, we first de-noise the vibration signals using wavelet de-noising and then extract the fault characteristics in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain to avoid the limitations of using only one domain. Finally, the fault location is identified using the grey correlation method. According to the method application results, the recognition accuracy using the method proposed in this paper is satisfactory, proving that the method has superior performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It involves an efficient multi-energetic model suited for diagnostics and prognostics, developed using some specific properties of Bond Graph (BG) theory. The benefits of Particle Filters (PF) are integrated with the BG model derived fault indicators named Analytical Redundancy Relations, for prognostics of the Electrical-Electrochemical part. The hybrid prognostics involves statistical degradation model obtained using real degradation tests. Prognostics problem is formulated as the joint state-parameter estimation problem in PF framework where estimations of state of health (SOH) is obtained in probabilistic domain. This in turn is used for prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) under constant current as well as dynamic current solicitations. The SOH estimation and RUL prediction is obtained with very high accuracy and precise confidence bounds. Moreover, a comparative analysis with Extended Kalman Filter demonstrates the usefulness of PF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among the widespread failures of the induction machine there are rotor faults. This paper focuses on the detection of broken rotor bars fault using multi-indicator. However, diagnostics of asynchronous machine rotor faults can be accomplished by analysing the anomalies of machine local variable such as torque, magnetic flux, stator current and neutral voltage signature analysis. The aim of this research is to summarize the existing models and to develop new models of squirrel cage induction motors with consideration of the neutral voltage and to study the effect of broken rotor bars on the different electrical quantities such as the park currents, torque, stator currents and neutral voltage. The performance of the model was assessed by comparing the simulation and experimental results. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the model, and allow detection and diagnosis of these defects.

This paper is aimed at suggesting a dynamic model of PMSM with phase-to-phase fault based on an equivalent electric circuit model including the real form of back EMF. The faulty model is used for studying the machine behavior and extracting the fault signatures for diagnosis. Two diagnostic techniques the Spectral Analysis (ESA) and Extend Park's Vectors Approach (EPVA) based on frequency analysis are applied to detect this kind of fault.

Not only does such noise impact the scientific validity and costs of studies, but when assessed in the context of clinically translatable indications such as phenotype prediction, it can lead to inaccurate conclusions that could ultimately impact patients. We applied a sequence of ranking methods to damp noise associated-with microarray outputs, and then tested the utility of the approach in three disease indications using publically available datasets. Materials and methods: This study was performed in three phases. We first theoretically analyzed the effect of noise in phenotype prediction problems showing that it can be expressed as a modeling error that partially falsifies the pathways. Secondly, via synthetic modeling, we performed the sensitivity analysis for the main gene ranking methods to different types of noise. Finally, we studied the predictive accuracy of the gene lists provided by these ranking methods in synthetic data and in three different datasets related to cancer, rare and neurodegenerative diseases to better understand the translational aspects of our findings. Results and discussion: In the case of synthetic modeling, we showed that Fisher's Ratio (FR) was the most robust gene ranking method in terms of precision for all the types of noise at different levels. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) provided slightly lower performance and the rest of the methods (fold change, entropy and maximum percentile distance) were much less precise and accurate. The predictive accuracy of the smallest set of high discriminatory probes was similar for all the methods in the case of Gaussian and Log-Gaussian noise. In the case of class assignment noise, the predictive accuracy of SAM and FR is higher. Finally, for real datasets (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Inclusion Body Myositis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) we found that FR and SAM provided the highest predictive accuracies with the smallest number of genes. Biological pathways were found with an expanded list of genes whose discriminatory power has been established via FR Conclusions: We have shown that noise in expression data and class assignment partially falsifies the sets of discriminatory probes in phenotype prediction problems. FR and SAM better exploit the principle of parsimony and are able to find subsets with less number of high discriminatory genes. The predictive accuracy and the precision are two different metrics to select the important genes, since in the presence of noise the most predictive genes do not completely coincide with those that are related to the phenotype. Based on the synthetic results, FR and SAM are recommended to unravel the biological pathways that are involved in the disease development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Banerjee, A; Quiroz, JC; Abu-Mahfouz, I				Banerjee, Amit; Quiroz, Juan C.; Abu-Mahfouz, Issam			Statistical Comparison of Feature Sets for Time Series Classification of Dynamic System Response	ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART B-MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS; ALGORITHM; TRACKING	The use of classification techniques for machine health monitoring and fault diagnosis has been popular in recent years. System response in the form of time series data can be used to identify the type of defect and severity of defect. However, a central issue with time series classification is that of identifying appropriate features for classification. In this paper, we explore a new feature set based on delay differential equations (DDEs). DDEs have been used recently for extracting features for classification but have never been used to classify system responses. The Duffing oscillator, Van der Pol-Duffing (VDP-D) oscillator, Lu oscillator, and Chen oscillator are used as examples for dynamic systems, and the responses are classified into self-similar groups. Responses with the same period should belong to the same group. Misclassification rate is used as an indicator of the efficacy of the feature set. The proposed feature set is compared to a statistical feature set, a power spectral coefficient feature set, and a wavelet coefficient feature set. In the work described in this paper, a density-estimation algorithm called DBSCAN is used as the classification algorithm. The proposed DDE-based feature set is found to be significantly better than the other feature sets for classifying responses generated by the Duffing, Lu, and Chen systems. The wavelet and power spectral coefficient data sets are not found to be significantly better than the statistical feature set for these systems. None of the feature sets tested is discerning enough on the VDP-D system.

Estimation of Remaining Useful Life of Slow Speed Bearings Using Acoustic Emission Signals	JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Remaining useful life; AE Signals; Slow speed; Rolling element bearings; Artificial neural network; Linear regression; Signal intensity estimator		Various direct and indirect sensing methods for machine condition monitoring have been reported in the literature. Among these methods, acoustic emission technique is one of the effective means of monitoring rolling element bearings during industrial processes. Today, many machines use computerized classification in a wide range of applications. Further, recent developments indicate the drive towards integration of diagnosis and prognosis algorithms in future integrated machine health management systems. With this in mind, this paper concentrates on the estimation of the remaining useful life for bearings whilst in operation. To implement this, a linear regression classifier and multilayer artificial neural network model have been proposed to correlate the selected AE features with corresponding bearing wear throughout laboratory experiments. Results showed that the proposed models exhibit good prediction performance. This paper also presents the use of a new representative fault indicator, signal intensity estimator, employed for AE signals originating from natural degradation of slow speed rolling element bearings. It is concluded that the obtained results were promising and selecting this appropriate signal processing technique can significantly affect the defect identification.

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) for crucial components of a manufacturing machine aims to forecast in advance the precise time when some aging component will be broken and replace it in time, to avoid performing abnormally to manufacture defect products. This study focuses on the CBM for a crucial component called particle filter of a pneumatic conveyor machine in the LED epitaxy plant. Conventional forecasting methods were based on the theory of statistics, which requests a large number of data samples and assumes some probability distribution. With advance of machine technology, however, the data samples of broken particle filters to be collected are very few, such that those conventional methods cannot be applied. As a result, this study proposes a novel hybrid grey forecasting and harmony search approach, in which grey forecasting was shown to perform well for small data samples. In the proposed method, operating conditions of particle filters are monitored and collected by industrial sensors. Then, those data are preprocessed by data filtering and clustering. Finally, a hybrid grey forecasting and harmony search approach is used to fit the curve of the aging condition of a particle filter. Numerical analysis of a real example in an LED epitaxy plant shows that the proposed method performs better than conventional methods.

Fault Detection in State Variable Filter Circuit Using Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) Algorithm	INFORMACIJE MIDEM-JOURNAL OF MICROELECTRONICS ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS			English	Article						Analog circuits; Neural network; fault detection; Extreme learning machine	ANALOG; DIAGNOSTICS	Electronic applications have become important in industry, science, and everyday life. Modern applications demand greater complexity and smaller packaging, which makes testing more critical. Testing of analog circuit contributes major cost in IC manufacturing. This paper proposes a new method for fault classification in analog circuits using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Kernel ELM algorithms. ELM is a single hidden layer feed forward neural network (SLFN) which chooses the input weight randomly and computes the output weight analytically. The features of the benchmark circuit are extracted by simulating the transfer function of the circuit. The fault dictionary constructed from the features of the circuit is used as the inputs to the ELM and KELM algorithm. Simulation results show that KELM algorithm has better performance at faster learning speed than the ELM algorithm. KELM algorithm outperforms BP-NN-based and ELM-based approaches significantly with effective classification.

J	Pandarakone, SE; Mizuno, Y; Nakamura, H				Pandarakone, Shrinathan Esakimuthu; Mizuno, Yukio; Nakamura, Hisahide			Frequency Spectrum Investigation and Analytical Diagnosis Method for Turn-to-Turn Short-circuit Insulation Failure in Stator Winding of Low Voltage Induction Motor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article						Diagnosis; induction motor; turn-to-turn insulation failure; stator winding; frequency spectrum; Support Vector Machine	MACHINE; FAULTS	Low-voltage induction motors are widely used in the factories and are becoming very essential components for the industrial process. Improper diagnosis and condition monitoring of induction motor not only leads to high repair expenses but also cause extraordinary financial losses due to their unexpected downtime. In general, turn-to turn short-circuit failure of stator winding due to their deterioration or damage of electrical insulation is one of the most feasible failures in motor drive systems. This paper proposes a diagnostic method based on amplitudes of characteristic frequency components of load current as features. These features are extracted by close analysis of frequency spectrum and its dependence on load current variation. This method has the advantage of low cost and short data processing time. Also to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis, a novel diagnostic method is proposed with the aid of Support Vector Machine. It is found that the proposed diagnosis method using the features and Support Vector Machine enables the detection of a slight insulation failure like one turn-to-turn short-circuit with practically accepted accuracy.

Adjusting the SVM parameters improves its effectiveness and accuracy, which is always a challenge. On the other font, the Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm (BSOA), an evolutionary algorithm for solving optimization problems, is proposed and proven to be effective through various benchmark problems. This paper proposes an optimization method for the SVM parameters based on BSOA. For convenience, the proposed method has been named BSOA-SVM. This method is tested with some real-world benchmark data sets to verify its robustness and effectiveness. Then, BSOA-SVM is applied for diagnosing roller bearing fault, which is a real world problem. In this diagnosing process, the original acceleration vibration signals are first decomposed into product function (PFs) by using the local mean decomposition (LMD) method. Next, initial feature matrices are extracted from PFs by singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to give single values. Finally, these values serve as input vectors for the BSOA-SVM classifier. The results from the problem show that the combination of the BSOA-SVM classifiers obtains higher classification accuracy with a lower cost time compared to other methods.

Potential VD analogs are being developed as therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatments. The large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel K(Ca)1.1 regulates intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways and is associated with high grade tumors and poor prognoses. In the present study, we examined the effects of treatments with VD receptor (VDR) agonists on the expression and activity of K(Ca)1.1 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells using real-time PCR, Western blotting, flow cytometry, and voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Treatments with VDR agonists for 72 h markedly decreased the expression levels of K(Ca)1.1 transcripts and proteins in MDA-MB-453 cells, resulting in the significant inhibition of depolarization responses induced by paxilline, a specific K(Ca)1.1 blocker. The specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 suppressed VDR agonist-induced decreases in K(Ca)1.1 protein expression. These results suggest that K(Ca)1.1 is a new downstream target of VDR signaling and the down-regulation of K(Ca)1.1 through the transcriptional repression of K(Ca)1.1 and enhancement of K(Ca)1.1 protein degradation contribute, at least partly, to the antiproliferative effects of VDR agonists in breast cancer cells.

Fault Classification and Detection in a Rotor Bearing Rig	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Bearing; Unbalance; Gearbox; Feature Selection; Vibration	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	Fault classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) were carried out on a rotor bearing rig by considering the vibration signals from bearings with multiple defects and rotor unbalance. Then the fault classification methodology has been validated with vibration data from bearing, rotor unbalance and gearbox having seeded defects. The vibration signals have been acquired using seven accelerometers mounted on the rotor bearing rig. A compensation distance evaluation technique was used for selecting the two sensitive features among the twelve time domain features of the measured vibration signals from each of the accelerometers. Multi-class support vector algorithm was used for the classification of defects in the rotor bearing system. SVM parameters were optimised for better classification of the defects in the rotor bearing system and it was found that a better classification is obtained when signals from all accelerometers are considered rather than one accelerometer. The developed fault classification methodology can be used for online fault classification and detection in rotating machines.

On deterministic chaos in software reliability growth models	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Software reliability; Chaos theory; Time series analysis; Machine learning; Forecasting	FAULT-DETECTION; PREDICTION	Software reliability growth models attempt to forecast the future reliability of a software system, based on observations of the historical occurrences of failures. This allows management to estimate the failure rate of the system in field use, and to set release criteria based on these forecasts. However, the current software reliability growth models have never proven to be accurate enough for widespread industry use. One possible reason is that the model forms themselves may not accurately capture the underlying process of fault injection in software; it has been suggested that fault injection is better modeled as a chaotic process rather than a random one. This possibility, while intriguing, has not yet been evaluated in large-scale, modern software reliability growth datasets. We report on an analysis of four software reliability growth datasets, including ones drawn from the Android and Mozilla open-source software communities. These are the four largest software reliability growth datasets we are aware of in the public domain, ranging from 1200 to over 86,000 observations. We employ the methods of nonlinear time series analysis to test for chaotic behavior in these time series; we find that three of the four do show evidence of such behavior (specifically, a multifractal attractor). Finally, we compare a deterministic time series forecasting algorithm against a statistical one on both datasets, to evaluate whether exploiting the apparent chaotic behavior might lead to more accurate reliability forecasts.

J	Sarkar, S; Chakravarthy, SR; Ramanan, V; Ray, A				Sarkar, Soumalya; Chakravarthy, Satyanarayanan R.; Ramanan, Vikram; Ray, Asok			Dynamic data-driven prediction of instability in a swirl-stabilized combustor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPRAY AND COMBUSTION DYNAMICS			English	Article						Gas turbine combustor; combustion instability; symbolic dynamics; probabilistic finite state automata; information theory	NOISE; INTERMITTENCY; AUTOMATA	Combustion instability poses a negative impact on the performance and structural durability of both land-based and aircraft gas turbine engines, and early detection of combustion instabilities is of paramount importance not only for performance monitoring and fault diagnosis, but also for initiating efficient decision and control of such engines. Combustion instability is, in general, characterized by self-sustained growth of large-amplitude pressure tones that are caused by a positive feedback arising from complex coupling of localized hydrodynamic perturbations, heat energy release, and acoustics of the combustor. This paper proposes a fast dynamic data-driven method for detecting early onsets of thermo-acoustic instabilities, where the underlying algorithms are built upon the concepts of symbolic time series analysis (STSA) via generalization of D-Markov machine construction. The proposed method captures the spatiotemporal co-dependence among time series from heterogeneous sensors (e.g. pressure and chemiluminescence) to generate an information-theoretic precursor, which is uniformly applicable across multiple operating regimes of the combustion process. The proposed method is experimentally validated on the time-series data, generated from a laboratory-scale swirl-stabilized combustor, while inducing thermo-acoustic instabilities for various protocols (e.g. increasing Reynolds number (Re) at a constant fuel flow rate and reducing equivalence ratio at a constant air flow rate) at varying air-fuel premixing levels. The underlying algorithms are developed based on D-Markov entropy rates, and the resulting instability precursor measure is rigorously compared with the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of its performance of instability prediction, computational complexity, and robustness to sensor noise.

J	Huang, JJ; Jiang, Z; Zhao, JW				Huang, Junjie; Jiang, Zhen; Zhao, Junwei			Component fault diagnosis for nonlinear systems	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article						multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems; component faults; fault feature index; fault diagnosis	SLIDING MODE OBSERVERS; UNKNOWN INPUT OBSERVERS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; KALMAN FILTER; TOLERANT CONTROL; ACTUATOR; SENSOR; RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	In the field of fault diagnosis, the state equation of nonlinear system, including the actuator and the component, has been established. When the faults in the system appear, it is difficult to observe the fault isolation between the actuator and the component. In order to diagnose the component fault in the nonlinear systems, a novel strategy is proposed. The nonlinear state equation with only the component system is built on mathematical equations. The nonlinearity of the component equation is expanded and estimated with Taylor series. If the actuator is perfect, the anomaly of the state equations reflects the component fault. The fault feature index is defined to detect the component fault and the initial fault. The numerical examples of the component faults are simulated for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems. The results show that the component faults, as well as the incipient faults, can be detected. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified.

Dynamic neural networks for gas turbine engine degradation prediction, health monitoring and prognosis	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Dynamic neural networks; Health monitoring prediction; Gas turbine engines; Degradation prediction; Prognosis	TIME-SERIES; SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETER SELECTION; MODEL; DIAGNOSTICS	In this paper, the problem of health monitoring and prognosis of aircraft gas turbine engines is considered by using computationally intelligent methodologies. Two different dynamic neural networks, namely the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input neural networks and the Elman neural networks, are developed and designed for this purpose. The proposed dynamic neural networks are designed to capture the dynamics of two main degradations in the gas turbine engine, namely the compressor fouling and the turbine erosion. The health status and condition of the engine in terms of the turbine output temperature (TT) are then predicted subject to occurrence of these deteriorations. Various scenarios consisting of fouling and erosion separately as well as combined are considered. For each scenario, several neural networks are trained and their performance in predicting multiple flights ahead TTs is evaluated. Finally, the most suitable neural networks for achieving the best prediction are selected by using the normalized Bayesian information criterion model selection. Simulation results presented demonstrate and illustrate the effective performance of our proposed neural network-based prediction and prognosis strategies.

J	Wang, SY; Huang, YX; Gong, L; Li, L; Liu, CL				Wang, Shuangyuan; Huang, Yixiang; Gong, Liang; Li, Lin; Liu, Chengliang			Improved feature extraction using structured Fisher discrimination sparse coding scheme for machinery fault diagnosis	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; feature extraction; discrimination sparse coding; dictionary learning; worm gear	K-SVD; DICTIONARY; OPTIMIZATION; REGRESSION; TRANSFORM; SELECTION	Vibration signals reflecting different kinds of machinery conditions are very useful for fault diagnosis. However, vibration signal characteristics are not the same for different types of equipment and patterns of failure. This available information is often lost in structureless condition diagnosis models. We propose a structured Fisher discrimination sparse coding-based fault diagnosis scheme to improve the feature extraction procedure considering both efficiency and effectiveness. There are three major components: (1) a structured dictionary for synthesizing the vibration signals that is learned by structure Fisher discrimination dictionary learning, (2) a tree-structured sparse coding to extract sparse representation coefficients from vibration signals to represent fault features, and (3) a support vector machine's classifier on the features to recognize different faults. The proposed algorithm is verified on a standard bearing fault data set and a worm gear fault experiment.

On the other hand, the continuous advancement of technical knowledge and the increasing capabilities of monitoring and computing offer opportunities for new developments in reliability engineering. In this paper, I reflect on some of these challenges and opportunities in research and application. The underlying perspective taken stands on the following: The belief that the knowledge, information, and data (KID) available for the modeling, computations, and analyses done in reliability engineering is substantially grown and continue to do so; The belief that the technical capabilities for reliability engineering have been significantly advanced; The recognition of the increased complexity of the systems, nowadays more and more made of heterogeneous, highly interconnected elements. In line with this perspective, opportunities and challenges for reliability engineering are discussed in relation to degradation modeling and integration of multistate and physics-based models therein, accelerated degradation testing, component-, system-and fleet-wide prognostics and health management in evolving environments. The paper is not a review, nor a state of the art work, but rather it offers a vision of reflection on reliability engineering, for consideration and discussion by the interested scientific community. It does not pretend to give the unique view, nor to be complete in the subject discussed and the related literature referenced to.

The monitoring system can collect various oil parameters through the use of different types of sensor and display the variation trends of each parameter in real time. The data collected by the online condition monitoring system can be shared with distributed analysis centres via the Internet and then further deeply analysed. The relationship between the working load of a steam turbine and the number of solid particles over 4 mu m in the lubricating oil is expressed by a piecewise function, which is then applied in the fault diagnosis of the steam turbine. The variation trends of moisture are extracted and predicted using a qualitative trend extraction method and a sliding window. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to maintain the balance between the complexity and accuracy of the prediction model and to determine the most suitable length of the sliding window. Experiments conducted on the No 3 steam turbine in a power plant indicate that the condition monitoring system can successfully detect faults in the steam turbine and that the future trend of moisture can be correctly predicted by the prediction model.

In the proposed CQPSMFD method, the COA is used to initialize the parameters of the QPSO algorithm in order to obtain the CQPSO algorithm with the better convergence speed. Then the CQPSO algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the SVM model to construct a high-precision SVM model (CQPSM) with the higher accuracy and stronger generalization ability. Next, the CQPSMFD method based on CQPSM method is proposed for motor. Finally, the experiment data from Case Western bearing dataset and actual motor are selected to verify the CQPSMFD method.

J	Yan, JY; Zhu, HJ; Yang, XQ; Cao, YH; Shao, LF				Yan, Jiyu; Zhu, Huijie; Yang, Xiaoqiang; Cao, Youhui; Shao, Lifu			Research on fault diagnosis of hydraulic pump using convolutional neural network	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						convolutional neural network; fault diagnosis; hydraulic pump; deep learning		The failure mechanism of hydraulic pump is complex, and its faulty features are frequently submerged in the nonlinear interference caused by various components. The fault diagnosis of hydraulic pump is a challenge in the field of machinery. The conventional fault diagnosis approaches have several drawbacks. First, the operator should be cognizant of the mechanism of hydraulic pump. Second, the procedure is onerous, and has many parameters to set. Third, the shallow classification is weak for this complex problem, which leads to low accuracy rate. This paper developed a new scheme by using improved convolutional neural network. It can be directly used without human intervention, although the operator knows little knowledge about hydraulic pump. Therefore, it is simple to be employed and easy for widely promotion. Validated by fault diagnosis cases of hydraulic pump, the proposed scheme is not only simple for application, but also is superior to other machine learning algorithms, especially when the pump speed varies.

For the non-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of fault vibration signals, a novel multifractal manifold (MFM) method based on detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is proposed. The proposed method consists of three steps. Firstly, calculate the multifractal fluctuation functions of signal series with an appropriate polynomial order, according to multifractal DFA method. Secondly, construct multifractal feature vector for each signal sample to reveal the nonlinear characteristics in different scales. Finally, implement manifold learning to reduce the dimension of multifractal feature vectors. The obtained low-dimensional MFM features can reveal the differences of signal samples from different fault patterns effectively, which are benefit for automatic pattern recognition and multiple fault diagnosis. The recognition performance of the proposed MFM method is verified by fault experiments of gearbox and rolling element bearing, which demonstrates the superiority of MFM method in rotating machinery fault diagnosis compared to other DFA-based methods.

Firstly, the pedestal looseness extent of rotating machinery is characterized by vibration signal of rotating machinery and its spectrum, then the time-frequency features are extracted from vibration signal to construct the origin looseness extent feature set. Secondly, the algorithm of looseness sensitivity index is designed to filter out the non-sensitive feature and poor sensitivity feature from the origin looseness extent feature set, avoiding the interference of non-sensitive and poor sensitivity feature. The sensitive features are selected to construct the looseness extent sensitive feature set, which has stronger characterization capabilities than the origin looseness extent feature set. Moreover, an effective manifold learning method called linear local tangent space alignment (LLTSA) is introduced to compress the looseness extent sensitive feature set into the low-dimensional looseness extent sensitive feature set. Finally, the low-dimensional looseness extent sensitive feature set is inputted into weight K nearest neighbor classifier (WKNNC) to recognize the different pedestal looseness extents of rotating machinery, the WKNNC's recognition accuracy is more stable compared with that of a k nearest neighbor classification (KNNC). At the same time, the pedestal looseness extent recognition of rotating machinery is realized. The feasibility and validity of the present method are verified by successful pedestal looseness extent recognition application in a rotating machinery.

Next, the acquired low-dimensional features array is input into the well trained deep belief network (DBN) model to evaluate the performance status of the bearing. Finally,after the bearing accelerated degradation data from Cincinnati University were investigated for further research, through the comparison experiments with two other popular dimensionality reduction methods (principal component analysis (PCA) and Laplacian Eigenmaps) and two other intelligent assessment algorithms (hidden Markov model (HMM) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN)), the proposed CAM has been proved to be more sensitive to the incipient fault and more effective for the evaluation of bearing performance degradation.

J	Etien, E; Rambault, L; Cauet, S; Sakout, A				Etien, Erik; Rambault, Laurent; Cauet, Sebastien; Sakout, Anas			Soft sensor design for mechanical fault detection in PMSM at variable speed	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Soft sensor; Mechanical fault detection; Variable speed; PMSM	DIAGNOSIS MODEL	This paper presents a soft sensor (SS) used to localize mechanical faults in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) at variable speed. The speed contains crucial information about the fault and the characteristic frequencies sought can be amplified by a proper observer design to improve the detection procedure. On the other hand, all the measurements are expressed as a function of estimated position in order to obtain a speed independent signature. An original experimental setup based on a mechanical fault emulator is proposed to validate the simulation results. Simulations and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective to amplify the single fault signatures and calculate fault indicator at variable speed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
