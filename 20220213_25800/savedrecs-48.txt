Fault diagnosis of WWTP based on improved support vector machine	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						fault diagnosis of WWTP; SVM; GA; improved SVM	HISTORICAL DATA-ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM	Wastewater treatment is a complicated process where sensors and equipment are operated at harsh conditions, and there are often long time delays in variables' response to disturbances. In this work, support vector machine is applied to diagnose fault. Because of the unbalanced distribution of the fault classes data quantity or importance, the risk functional R-WLOO(alpha) with weight coefficient based on leave-one-out errors is presented; then Genetic Algorithms (GA) is used to globally optimize the risk functional R-WLOO(alpha). Because of the size of the data is large, we present a simple algorithm of RWLOO(alpha) to reduce the amount of calculation. The improved SVM is used to classify dataset of WWTP, and the results indicate that compared with the standard SVM and BP neural network (NN), the improved one can gain higher classification accuracy.

Detection of broken rotor bars in induction motor using starting-current analysis and effects of loading	IEE PROCEEDINGS-ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article							SIGNATURE ANALYSIS	The detection of broken-rotor-bar faults based on common steady-state-analysis techniques, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), is known to be significantly dependent on the loading conditions of the induction motor. At light load, it is difficult to distinguish between healthy and faulty rotors because the characteristic broken-rotor-bar fault frequencies in the stator current are very close to the fundamental-frequency component and their amplitudes are small in comparison. As a result, detection of broken bar faults and classification of the fault severity under light load is very difficult. To overcome this problem, the analysis of the envelope of the transient starting-current waveform using the wavelet-transform has been investigated. The envelope extraction is used to remove the strong fundamental-frequency component, which would otherwise overshadow the characteristic differences between a healthy motor and a faulty motor with broken rotor bars. The wavelet-transform results are processed to develop a normalised parameter called the 'wavelet indicator' which is sensitive to the presence of broken-rotor-bar faults. The results are verified using tests on machines with a varying number of broken bars, as well as partially broken rotor bars, over a wide range of loading conditions. The effects of initial rotor position and supply imbalance are also investigated.

Actuators and servo motors in the aerospace and transportation industries are examples of this kind of operation. Detection of faults in such applications is, however, challenging because of the need for complex signal processing techniques. Two novel methods using windowed Fourier ridges and Wigner-Ville-based distributions are proposed for the detection of rotor faults in brushless dc motors operating under continuous nonstationarity. Experimental results are presented to validate the concepts and illustrate the ability of the proposed algorithms to track and identify rotor faults. The proposed algorithms are also implemented on a digital signal processor to study their usefulness for commercial implementation.

Compound rub malfunctions feature extraction based on full-spectrum cascade analysis and SVM	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						acceleration signal; full spectrum; fault diagnosis; rotor; support vector machine	ROTATING MACHINERY; FAULT; DIAGNOSIS	The acceleration signals of operational rotor vibration provide a lot of information about its running behaviour. The acceleration signal features of identification and extraction in the process of speed change are important for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The full-spectrum cascade analysis of rotating machinery vibrations is an efficient method that enables the symptoms of some special types of fault (especially for rub) to be clearly detected. Some typical compound rub malfunctions have been researched by experiments in this study. Acceleration signals have been received by the experimental apparatus and analysed by full spectrum. The abrupt changes in surging acceleration signals of rotor malfunctions can be detected and their fault feature spectra shown in full-spectrum cascade plots. The full-spectrum experimental data are applied to the support vector machine (SVM) training to be classified. The results indicate the potential and feasibility of this approach for the diagnosis of rotor malfunctions. The full-spectrum cascade plot can enhance the feature information for the knowledge base of the rotating machinery rub fault diagnosis system and is of great significance to diagnose compound rub faults in a rotor more accurately.

Kernel classifier with adaptive structure and fixed memory for process diagnosis	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; SENSOR; PLS; PCA	A unified least-square kernel (ULK)framework is formulated for both process modeling and fault diagnosis issues. As a specific algorithmic implementation of the ULK method, an adaptive kernel learning (AKL) network classifier is developed for process diagnosis, which is a two-stage online learning algorithm with a fixed-memory strategy. A new concept of space angle index is proposed to structure the growth of node and actively control the complexity of the network. The AKL network performs a backward decreasing for forgetting an old pattern and a forward increasing for incorporating a new online pattern. The recursive algorithms for both stages are derived for quick online updating. Applications of the AKL network to two numerical cases and the Tennessee Eastman process show good performance in comparison to other established methods, and new insights on the pattern recognition for fault diagnosis arising from this flexible classifier are highlighted.

J	Sima, C; Dougherty, ER				Sima, Chao; Dougherty, Edward R.			What should be expected from feature selection in small-sample settings	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; ERROR ESTIMATION; PREDICTION; SURVIVAL	Motivation: High-throughput technologies for rapid measurement of vast numbers of biological variables offer the potential for highly discriminatory diagnosis and prognosis; however, high dimensionality together with small samples creates the need for feature selection, while at the same time making feature-selection algorithms less reliable. Feature selection must typically be carried out from among thousands of gene-expression features and in the context of a small sample (small number of microarrays). Two basic questions arise: (1) Can one expect feature selection to yield a feature set whose error is close to that of an optimal feature set? (2) If a good feature set is not found, should it be expected that good feature sets do not exist? Results: The two questions translate quantitatively into questions concerning conditional expectation. (1) Given the error of an optimal feature set, what is the conditionally expected error of the selected feature set? (2) Given the error of the selected feature set, what is the conditionally expected error of the optimal feature set? We address these questions using three classification rules (linear discriminant analysis, linear support vector machine and k-nearest-neighbor classification) and feature selection via sequential floating forward search and the t-test. We consider three feature-label models and patient data from a study concerning survival prognosis for breast cancer. With regard to the two focus questions, there is similarity across all experiments: (1) One cannot expect to find a feature set whose error is close to optimal, and (2) the inability to find a good feature set should not lead to the conclusion that good feature sets do not exist. In practice, the latter conclusion may be more immediately relevant, since when faced with the common occurrence that a feature set discovered from the data does not give satisfactory results, the experimenter can draw no conclusions regarding the existence or nonexistence of suitable feature sets.

J	Gebraeel, N				Gebraeel, Nagi			Sensory-updated residual life distributions for components with exponential degradation patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						prediction methods; prognostics; reliability; stochastic processes	MODEL; SIGNALS	Research on interpreting data communicated by smart sensors and distributed sensor networks, and utilizing these data streams in making critical decisions stands to provide significant advancements across a wide range of application domains such as maintenance management. In this paper, a stochastic degradation modeling framework is developed for computing and continuously updating residual life distributions of partially degraded components. The proposed degradation methodology combines population-specific degradation characteristics with component-specific sensory data acquired through condition monitoring in order to compute and continuously update remaining life distributions of partially degraded components. Two sensory updating procedures are developed and validated using real-world vibration-based degradation information acquired from rolling element thrust bearings. The results are compared with two, benchmark policies and illustrate the benefits of the sensory updated degradation models proposed in this paper.

J	Djurdjanovic, D; Jun, N				Djurdjanovic, Dragan; Jun Ni			Stream-of-variation (SoV)-based measurement scheme analysis in multistation machining systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						measurement scheme analysis; multistation machining; nonexistent or uncertain statistical knowledge; stream of variation methodologies; worst-case maximum-likelihood (WCML) estimation	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VARIATION PROPAGATION; SENSOR OPTIMIZATION	Today, machining systems are complex multistation manufacturing systems that involve a large number of machining operations and several locating datum changes. Dimensional errors introduced at each machining operation get transformed and cause the occurrence of new errors as the workpiece propagates through the machining system. The appropriate choice of measurements in such a complex system is crucial for the subsequent successful identification of the root causes of machining errors hidden in dimensional measurements of the workpiece. In order to facilitate this measurement selection process, methods for quantitative characterization of measurement schemes must be developed. This problem of quantitative measurement characterization referred to as the measurement scheme analysis problem is dealt with in this paper. The measurement scheme analysis is accomplished through characterization of the maximal. achievable accuracy of estimation of process-level parameters based on the measurements in a given measurement scheme. The stream of variation methodology is employed to establish a connection between the process-level parameters and measured product quality. Both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian assumptions in the estimation are considered and several analytical properties are derived. The properties of the newly derived measurement scheme analysis methods are demonstrated in measurement scheme characterization in the multistation machining system used for machining of an automotive cylinder head.

Modeling and characterization of induction motor internal faults using finite-element and discrete wavelet transforms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st IEEE International Magnetics Conference (Intermag 2006)	MAY 08-12, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE		discrete wavelet transforms; FE; induction machines; internal faults		This paper examines the behavior of a three-phase induction motors with internal fault conditions under sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal supply voltages. This includes two types of faults, rotor broken bar and stator faults. Early detection and diagnosis of these faults are desirable for condition assessment, maintenance schedule, and improved operational efficiency of induction motors. The terminal behavior of the induction motor was investigated by coupling the induction motor transient finite-element (FE) model and external electric circuit. Such a model would allow the efficient representation of the induction machine with internal faults. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was then used to extract the different harmonic components of the stator currents. The key advantages of the DWT are its ability to provide a local representation (in both time and frequency) of the current signal for normal and faulty modes, and its applicability to nonstationary signals.

It is very challenging, however, to process a large amount of information in a limited time in order to make decisions about the health of the processes and products. This paper develops a "preprocessing" procedure for multiple sets of complicated functional data in order to reduce the data size for supporting timely decision analyses. The data type studied has been used for fault detection, root-cause analysis, and quality improvement in such engineering applications as automobile and semiconductor manufacturing and nanomachining processes. The proposed vertical-energy-thresholding (VET) procedure balances the reconstruction error against data-reduction efficiency so that it is effective in capturing key patterns in the multiple data signals. The selected wavelet coefficients are treated as the "reduced-size" data in subsequent analyses for decision making. This enhances the ability of the existing statistical and machine-learning procedures to handle high-dimensional functional data. A few real.-life examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure compared to several ad hoe techniques extended from single-curve-based data modeling and denoising procedures.

J	Dong, M; He, D; Banerjee, P; Keller, J				Dong, Ming; He, David; Banerjee, Prashant; Keller, Jonathan			Equipment health diagnosis and prognosis using hidden semi-Markov models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						hidden semi-Markov model; condition-based maintenance; diagnosis; prognosis		In this paper, the development of hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) for equipment health diagnosis and prognosis is presented. An HSMM is constructed by adding a temporal component into the well-defined hidden Markov model (HMM) structures. The HSMM methodology offers two significant advantages over the HMM methodology in equipment health diagnosis and prognosis: (1) it overcomes the modeling limitation of HMM due to the Markov property and therefore improves the power in diagnosis, and (2) it can be directly used for prognosis. The application of the HSMMs to equipment health diagnosis and prognosis is demonstrated with the fault classification application of UH-60A Blackhawk main transmission planetary carriers and prognosis of a hydraulic pump health monitoring application. The effectiveness of the HSMMs is compared with that of the HMMs. The results of the application testing have shown that the HSMMs are capable of identifying the faults under both test cell and on-aircraft conditions while the performance of the HMMs is not comparable with that of the HSMMs. Furthermore, the HSMM-based methodology can be used to estimate the remaining useful life of equipment.

To obtain the best final product, chemical engineers have to consider many factors including environmental effects, stability, economic considerations, and so on. In particular, when considering the stability if the process and the purity of the product, it is very important to detect any faults in the chemical process immediately. In this paper, a hybrid fault diagnosis model based on the signed digraph (SDG) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. By means of the system decomposition based on SDG, the local models of each measured variable are constructed and more accurate and fast models are using an SVM, which has no loss of information and shows good performance, in order to obtain the estimated value of the variable, which is then compared with the measured value in order to diagnose the fault. To verify the performance of the proposed model, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) Process was studied and the proposed method was found to demonstrate a good diagnosis capability compared with previous statistical methods.

Detecting and predicting early faults of complex rotating machinery based on cyclostationary time series model	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Vibration signals of complex rotating machinery are often cyclostationary, so in this paper one novel method is proposed to detect and predict early faults based on the linear (almost) periodically time-varying autoregressive (LPTV-AR) model. At first the algorithms of identifying model parameters and order are presented using the higher-order cyclic-cumulant, which can suppress additive stationary noises and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Then numerical simulations are done and the results indicate that this model is more effective for cyclostationary signals than the classical AR model. In the end the proposed method is used for detecting incipient gear crack fault in a helicopter gearbox. The results demonstrate that the approach can be used to detect and predict early faults of complex rotating machinery by the kurtosis of the residual signal.

It consists of three main steps: data acquisition, data processing and maintenance decision-making. Diagnostics and prognostics are two important aspects of a CBM program. Research in the CBM area grows rapidly. Hundreds of papers in this area, including theory and practical applications, appear every year in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. This paper attempts to summarise and review the recent research and developments in diagnostics and prognostics of mechanical systems implementing CBM with emphasis on models, algorithms and technologies for data processing and maintenance decision-making. Realising the increasing trend of using multiple sensors in condition monitoring, the authors also discuss different techniques for multiple sensor data fusion. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on current practices and possible future trends of CBM. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Practical scheme for fast detection and classification of rolling-element bearing faults using support vector machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						support vector machines; condition monitoring	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM	This paper studies the application of support vector machines (SVMs) to the detection and classification of rolling-element bearing faults. The training of the SVMs is carried out using the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm. In this paper, a mechanism for selecting adequate training parameters is proposed. This proposal makes the classification procedure fast and effective. Various scenarios are examined using two sets of vibration data, and the results are compared with those available in the literature that are relevant to this investigation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Al-Ghamd, AM; Mba, D				Al-Ghamd, Abdullah M.; Mba, David			A comparative experimental study on the use of acoustic emission and vibration analysis for bearing defect identification and estimation of defect size	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						acoustic emission; bearing defect; condition monitoring; defect size; vibration analysis		Vibration monitoring of rolling element bearings is probably the most established diagnostic technique for rotating machinery. The application of acoustic emission (AE) for bearing diagnosis is gaining ground as a complementary diagnostic tool, however, limitations in the successful application of the AE technique have been partly due to the difficulty in processing, interpreting and classifying the acquired data. Furthermore, the extent of bearing damage has eluded the diagnostician. The experimental investigation reported in this paper was centred on the application of the AE technique for identifying the presence and size of a defect on a radially loaded bearing. An experimental test rig was designed such that defects of varying sizes could be seeded onto the outer race of a test bearing. Comparisons between AE and vibration analysis over a range of speed and load conditions are presented. In addition, the primary source of AE activity from seeded defects is investigated. It is concluded that AE offers earlier fault detection and improved identification capabilities than vibration analysis. Furthermore, the AE technique also provided an indication of the defect size, allowing the user to monitor the rate of degradation on the bearing; unachievable with vibration analysis.

Both cases are different. There is no experience in elevator monitoring and diagnosis, and modeling has been performed using Neural Networks. On the other hand, machine tools were monitored through vibration systems where some experience exists. In this case, Bayesian Networks are the paradigm of choice as it was also recommended to include some 'adaptation' mechanism for the knowledge modeled in the network. The final system also includes a sensor processing unit and a remote maintenance module system that provides an automated remote condition monitoring system, for both applications. Results indicate the feasibility of partial solutions in monitoring and diagnosis, though future enhancements are needed to compose a complete solution. This paper explains the characteristics of the Bayesian Network solution finally developed for high-speed machine tools, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and indicate the future enhancements.

Static typing for a faulty lambda calculus	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article						transient hardware faults; soft faults; type systems; typed intermediate languages; lambda calculus; fault tolerance; reliable computing	ERROR-DETECTION	A transient hardware fault occurs when an energetic particle strikes a transistor, causing it to change state. These faults do not cause permanent damage, but may result in incorrect program execution by altering signal transfers or stored values. While the likelihood that such transient faults will cause any significant damage may seem remote, over the last several years transient faults have caused costly failures in high-end machines at America Online, eBay, and the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, among others [ 6, 44, 15]. Because susceptibility to transient faults is proportional to the size and density of transistors, the problem of transient faults will become increasingly important in the coming decades. This paper defines the first formal, type-theoretic framework for studying reliable computation in the presence of transient faults. More specifically, it defines lambda(zap), a lambda calculus that exhibits intermittent data faults. In order to detect and recover from these faults, lambda(zap) programs replicate intermediate computations and use majority voting, thereby modeling software-based fault tolerance techniques studied extensively, but informally [ 10, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 41]. To ensure that programs maintain the proper invariants and use lambda(zap) primitives correctly, the paper defines a type system for the language. This type system guarantees that well-typed programs can tolerate any single data fault. To demonstrate that lambda(zap) can serve as an idealized typed intermediate language, we define a type-preserving translation from a standard simply-typed lambda calculus into lambda(zap).

Application and optimization of the discrete wavelet transform for the detection of broken rotor bars in induction machines	APPLIED AND COMPUTATIONAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS			English	Article						discrete wavelet transform; induction machines; fault diagnosis; rotor bar breakages; characteristic pattern	MOTOR	The problem of the bar breakage diagnosis in electrical induction cage machines is a matter of increasing concern nowadays, due to the widely spread use of these machines in the industry. The classical approach, focused on the Fourier analysis of the steady-state current, has some drawbacks that could be avoided if a study of the transient behavior of the machine is performed. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an ideal tool for this purpose, due to its suitability for the analysis of signals whose frequency spectrum is variable in time. The paper shows how the study of the high-level signals resulting from the DWT of the transient starting current of an induction motor allows the detection of a particular characteristic harmonic that occurs when a rotor bar breakage has taken place. This constitutes an alternative approach that avoids some problems that the traditional method implies and that can even lead to a wrong diagnosis of the fault.

Prognostics and health management of electronic packaging	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						electronics; phase growth; prognosis	RELIABILITY; GROWTH; BGA	The current state of the art in managing system reliability is geared toward the development of predictive models for unaged pristine materials. The current state of art allows the prediction of time-to-failure for a pristine material under known loading conditions based on relationships such as the Paris' power law [161, [17], the Coffin-Manson relationship [2], [13], [23], [24], and the S-N diagram. There is a need for methods and processes which will allow interrogation of material state in complex systems and subsystems to determine the remaining useful life prior to repair or replacement. This capability of determination of material or system state is called prognosis. In this paper, a methodology for prognostication of electronics has been demonstrated with data of leading indicators of failure for accurate assessment of product damage prior to appearance of any macro indicators of damage. Proxies for leading indicators of failure have been identified. Examples of proxies include microstructural evolution characterized by average phase size and correlated to time and equivalent creep strain rate, and stresses at interface of silicon structures. Structures examined include an electronics package and microelectromechanical systems package and interconnections. The test vehicle includes packages that have been mounted on a metal-backed printed circuit board typical of electronics deployed in harsh environments. In application environment, the metal backing provides thermal dissipation, mechanical stability, and interconnections reliability. Since an aged material knows its state, the research presented in this paper focuses on enhancing the understanding of material damage to facilitate proper interrogation of material state. A mathematical relationship has been developed between phase growth rate and time-to-1-percent failure to enable the computation of damage manifested and a forward estimate of residual life.

J	Nandi, S				Nandi, Subhasis			Detection of stator faults in induction machines using residual saturation harmonics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference	MAY 15-18, 2005	San Antonio, TX	IEEE		induction motors; saturation harmonics; stator fault	TURN SHORT CIRCUITS; WINDINGS; MOTORS; DIAGNOSIS	Stator fault is one of the most commonly occurring faults in ac machines. Recent estimates suggest that 30%-40% of all reported induction machine faults are stator fault related. Going by the number of occurrences, the position of stator faults is only second to bearing-related faults. Third harmonic line currents, which are caused by the interaction of a reverse-rotating field and saturation-related permeance variation, the third harmonic component in the line voltage, and the speed ripple consequent to the reverse-rotating field, have been reported to increase under stator fault conditions. Since the reverse-rotating field is produced by voltage unbalance as well as stator faults the measurement of third harmonic in the line current may not be a reliable estimator of stator faults, particularly at an incipient stage. The third and the other triplen-related harmonics are however found to be a very decisive indicator of the fault if measured in the machine terminal voltages just after switch-off. The fault-detection technique is independent of machine parameters and supply unbalances. Simulation and experimental results with very few shorted turns show that not only the presence of stator fault but also the phase in which the fault has occurred can be detected reliably. However, because of the nature of detection, it should strictly be called an offline method that can only validate existing online schemes, unless used for motors operating continuously in transient modes or form-wound machines.

This paper begins with the description of a 5-kVA synchronous generator specifically designed and constructed to allow for simulation of armature winding, field winding, or rectifier diode deterioration in a brushless machine. Subsequently, a description of the experimental methodology and the results of experiments are presented. Specific features that can be used,as indicators of the deterioration are described, and a theoretical basis for them is provided. The proposed features can be obtained continuously during normal generator operation. As such, they can be used as a basis for both brushless and brush-fed synchronous generator health monitoring applications.

J	Lee, S; Bryant, MD; Karlapalem, L				Lee, Sanghoon; Bryant, Michael D.; Karlapalem, Lalit			Model- and information theory-based diagnostic method for induction motors	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; ROTOR FAULTS; MACHINES; SENSOR	Introduced is a model-based diagnostic system for motors, that also employs concepts of information theory as a health metric. From an existing bond graph of a squirrel cage induction motor, state equations were extracted and simulations performed. Simulated were various cases, including the response of an ideal motor which functions perfectly to is specifications, and motors with shorted stator coils, a bad phase capacitor designer and broken rotor bars. By constructing an analogy between the motor and a communication channel, Shannon's theorems of information theory were applied to assess functional health. The principal health metric is the channel capacity, which is based on integrals of signal-to-noise ratios. The channel capacity monotonically reduces with degradation of the system, and appears to be an effective discriminator of motor health and sickness. The method was tested via simulations of a three-phase motor; and for experimental verification, a two-phase induction motor was modeled and tested. The method was able to predict impending functional failure, significantly in advance.

Vibration signals and stator current signals are measured as the fault diagnosis media. Many sensors result in many features to ANN. In order to avoid the curse of dimensionality phenomenon and improve the classification rate, PCA and GA are employed to reduce the feature dimensionality of the measured data. PCA removes the relative features. Then the irrelative features after PCA are selected by GA to find better feature subset as inputs to the network under a few population and generations. GA is also used to optimize the ANN structure in that the selected PCs feature subset is evaluated by it. The efficiency of the proposed system is validated by comparison of other three systems: ANN only, ANN with PCA and ANN with GA. The classification success rate for the ANN with PCA and GA was 100% for validation, while the rates of ANN only, ANN with PCA and ANN with GA were 83.33%, 86.67% and 98.89%, respectively.

Acoustical feature extraction of rotating machinery with combined wave superposition and blind source separation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						fault diagnosis; acoustical monitoring; feature extraction; combined wave superposition; blind source separation	HOLOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION; RADIATION	As the result of vibration emission in air, machine sound signal carries affluent information about the working condition of machine and it can be used to make mechanical fault diagnosis. The fundamental problems with fault diagnosis are the estimation of the number of sound sources and the localization of sound sources. The wave superposition can be employed to identify and locate sound sources, which is based on the idea that an acoustic radiator can be approximated and represented by the sum of the fields due to a finite number of interior point sources. But, in practice, a large number of measurements must be used in order to achieve a desired resolution, which makes the reconstruction process very time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, a combined wave superposition method has been developed reconstruct to acoustic radiation from machine acoustical signals. This method combines the advantages of both the wave superposition and Helmholtz equation-least squares methods, and it allows for reconstruction of the acoustic field from an arbitrary object with relatively few measurements, thus significantly enhancing the reconstruction efficiency. After sound source localization, the blind source separation (BSS) is proposed to extract acoustical feature from the mixed measuring sound signals. In a semi-anechoic chamber, a cross-planar microphone array, which consists of 29 microphones, was successfully applied to obtain the two-dimensional mapping of the sound sources. The location, the sound pressure, and the properties in frequency domain of the sound sources can be found through this method precisely. The experimental results demonstrate that the methods presented can potentially become an acoustical diagnosis tool.

With the advent of Internet and tether-free technologies, companies necessitate dramatic changes in transforming traditional "fail and fix (FAF)" maintenance practices to a "predict and prevent (PAP)" e-maintenance methodology. E-maintenance addresses the fundamental needs of predictive intelligence tools to monitor the degradation rather than detecting the faults in a networked environment and, ultimately to optimize asset utilization in the facility. This paper introduces the emerging field of e-maintenance and its critical elements. Furthermore, performance assessment and prediction tools are introduced for continuous assessment and prediction of a particular product's performance, ultimately enable proactive maintenance to prevent machine from breakdowns. Recent advances on intelligent prognostic technologies and tools are discussed. Several case studies are introduced to validate these developed technologies and tools. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They can be based on empirical modelling, which aims at associating measured data to machine conditions. Arguably, different monitoring tasks present different challenges to the maintenance engineer. This paper presents the development of a flexible software solution for condition monitoring, novelty identification and machinery diagnostics, which can easily be customised to a wide range of monitoring scenarios. Its main constituents are a number of independent software modules, such as the fault and symptom tree, the fuzzy classification module, the novelty detection and the neural network diagnostics sub-systems. It is implemented on two different applications, namely machine tool monitoring and gearbox monitoring. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zattoni, E				Zattoni, E			Detection of incipient failures by using an H-2-norm criterion: Application to railway switching points	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						linear systems; fault detection; H-2-optimization; railway points	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	The paper deals with condition monitoring of electric switch machines for railway points. The proposed detection system is based on off-line processing of armature current and voltage sampled as the machine operates a switch of railway tracks. These data are normally available from conventional railway signalling infrastructures; no additional transducers and instrumentation are required. The system, which basically consists of an algorithm tuned on a model of the machine behaviour as both the rails are simultaneously driven towards their rest position, allows detection of faults of an incremental nature, specifically those connected to progressive increasing of frictional loads due to loss of lubrication, deterioration of slide chairs and increasing obstructions. The algorithm implements finite impulse response systems whose convolution profiles are designed on the basis of an H-2-norm type criterion which guarantees robustness, particularly with respect to electrical noise.

This paper deals with the demodulation of the current signal of an induction motor driving a multistage gearbox for its fault detection. This multistage gearbox has three gear ratios, and thus, three rotating shafts and their corresponding gear mesh frequencies (GMFs). The gearbox is loaded electrically by a generator feeding an electrical resistance bank. Amplitude demodulation and frequency demodulation are applied to the current drawn by the induction motor for detecting the rotating shaft frequencies and GMFs, respectively. Discrete wavelet transform is applied to the demodulated current signal for denoising and removing the intervening neighboring features. Spectrum of a particular level, which comprises the GMFs, is used for gear fault detection.

Automatic fuzzy ontology generation for semantic help-desk support	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						conceptual clustering; customer service support; fault diagnosis; formal concept analysis; fuzzy logic; ontology generation; semantic web; semantic web services		Customer service support is an important operation for most multinational manufacturing companies. With the advancement of internet technologies, customer services nowadays are supported through web-based systems. More recently, rapid development of the semantic web and semantic web services has prompted us to develop a semantic help-desk for supporting customer services over the semantic web environment, which is presented in this paper. In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA)-based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation technique consists of the following steps: fuzzy formal concept analysis, fuzzy conceptual clustering, and ontology generation. As such, the supporting machine services provided by the proposed system will potentially improve customer satisfaction in terms of reducing machine down time and increasing productivity. In this paper, an experiment has also been conducted for performance evaluation. The experimental result shows that the proposed approach has attained good performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency when the queries are associated with appropriate membership values, and a suitable confident threshold is set.

Suryam			Vibration-based diagnosis for ageing management of rotating machinery: a summary of cases	INSIGHT			English	Article								Availability of rotating machinery used in power plants and other processing industries is very important for overall production. To enhance this availability, vibration-based condition monitoring is usually used. Vibration-based condition monitoring is considered to be mature enough to predict the occurrence of faults in rotating machinery so that remedial action can be well-planned and maintenance works for all kinds of machinery can be completed in one shutdown. However, if the occurrence of faults/failure is frequent and related to the ageing factor, it would definitely affect the overall performance of plants even though vibration-based condition monitoring would detect faults well in advance. For such cases, it has been observed that either in-situ dynamic characterisation by modal testing, or Operation Deflection Shape (ODS) analysis, or both tests on in-situ rotating machinery be the best option to identify the root causes and resolve the problems. Examples of such cases are summarised here.

Earlier work has introduced the use of a neural-network approach to learn non-linear mapping functions for condition monitoring systems. However, the performance of the neural-network largely depends upon the quality of the training data, and that of the quality and type of the pre-processing of the input data. A reverse algorithm called BJEST (Bansal-Jones Estimation), for estimating the machine input parameters using the motion current signature, has been designed and proven to be successful in estimating the macro-dynamics of the motion current signature. This motivated the enhancement of the predictive analysis to incorporate non-linear characteristic of the motion current signature. The results show considerable improvement in the estimation of the parameters using the enhanced BJEST algorithm due to estimation consistency, hence, improving the real-time predictive maintenance system.

A set of no defective and defective motors were analysed by means of the acceleration signal provided by the accelerometer, and the displacement and velocity signals given by a single-point laser vibrometer. Advantages and disadvantages of both absolute and relative sensors and of contact and non-contact instrumentation are discussed taking into account the applicability to real on-line quality control measurements and bringing to light the related measurement problems due to the specific environmental conditions of assembly lines and sensor installation constraints. The performance of different signal-processing algorithms is discussed: RMS computation at steady-state proves effective for pass or fail diagnosis, while the amplitude of selected frequencies in the averaged spectra allows also for classification of a variety of special faults in bearings. Joint time-frequency analysis output data can be successfully used for pass or fail diagnosis during transients, thus achieving a remarkable reduction in testing time, which is important for on-line diagnostics.

This paper develops the theoretical basis and practical implementation of IAS data acquisition and IAS estimation when noise influence is included. IAS data is modelled as a frequency modulated signal of which the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by using a high-resolution encoder. From this signal model and analysis, optimal configurations for IAS data collection are addressed for high accuracy IAS measurement. Simultaneously, a method based on analytic signal concept and fast Fourier transform is also developed for efficient and accurate estimation of IAS. Finally, a fault diagnosis is carried out on an electric induction motor driving system using IAS measurement. The diagnosis results show that using a high-resolution encoder and a long data stream can achieve noise reduction by more than 10 dB in the frequency range of interest, validating the model and algorithm developed. Moreover, the results demonstrate that IAS measurement outperforms conventional vibration in diagnosis of incipient faults of motor rotor bar defects and shaft misalignment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jemwa, GT; Aldrich, C				Jemwa, Gorden T.; Aldrich, Chris			Kernel-based fault diagnosis on mineral processing plants	MINERALS ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Process Systems for the Metallurgical Industries	2005	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA			process control; froth flotation; modeling	IDENTIFICATION	Safe operation, environmental issues, as well as economic considerations all form part of the wide range of driving forces for the development of better fault diagnostic systems on process plants. The continuous search for novel methods for fault detection and identification resulting from these incentives has recently drawn attention to support vector machines as a means towards improved fault diagnosis. These kernel-based methods are in theory capable of better generalization, particularly as far as large systems are concerned, since their performance is not dependent on the number of variables under consideration and recent studies underlined their promising role in diagnostic systems. However, integration of these methods into the classical multivariate statistical process control framework is complicated by difficulties in the identification of the original variables associated with detected faults. In this paper, a general strategy for process fault diagnosis is proposed. First, kernel methods are used to remove nonlinear structure from the data, if present, after which the residuals from the data are used to monitor the process. A novel element of the strategy is the use of one-class support vector machines to estimate nonparametric confidence limits for these residuals.

J	Thanagasundram, S; Schlindwein, FS				Thanagasundram, S.; Schlindwein, F. S.			Comparison of integrated micro-electrical-mechanical system and piezoelectric accelerometers for machine condition monitoring	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						integrated micro-electrical-mechanical system accelerometers; condition monitoring; dry vacuum pumps; vibrational analysis; autoregressive modelling	DOPPLER ULTRASOUND SIGNALS; ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARINGS	The design and implementation of instrumentation to collect real-time vibrational data from a quasi-steady state machine (a dry vacuum pump) for fault prediction diagnostics is presented. When simultaneous multiple data collection points are required on the same machinery, the use of conventional transducers such as piezoelectric accelerometers becomes impractical due to their price, as each needs an expensive associated charge amplifier. The use of inexpensive micromachined integrated micro-electrical-mechanical system accelerometers such as ADXL105 has been explored here as an alternative to piezoelectric accelerometers for obtaining reliable and predictable data for diagnostics. Surface micromachined accelerometers are a new technology and their usage for vibrational analysis has been conservative due to concerns over increased noise levels and tolerance to high temperatures. In this article, it is shown that such concerns can be allayed. The time and frequency domain vibration signatures obtained using both types of accelerometers are compared. The study shows that ADXL105 accelerometers can be an effective alternative low-cost high-quality solution for machine condition monitoring.

J	Davy, M; Desobry, F; Gretton, A; Doncarli, C				Davy, Manuel; Desobry, Frederic; Gretton, Arthur; Doncarli, Christian			An online support vector machine for abnormal events detection	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						abnormality detection; support vector machines; sequential optimization; gearbox fault detection; audio thump detection		The ability to detect online abnormal events in signals is essential in many real-world signal processing applications. Previous algorithms require an explicit signal statistical model, and interpret abnormal events as statistical model abrupt changes. Corresponding implementation relies on maximum likelihood or on Bayes estimation theory with generally excellent performance. However, there are numerous cases where a robust and tractable model cannot be obtained, and model-free approaches need to be considered. In this paper, we investigate a machine learning, descriptor-based approach that does not require an explicit descriptors statistical model, based on support vector novelty detection. A sequential optimization algorithm is introduced. Theoretical considerations as well as simulations on real signals demonstrate its practical efficiency. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Data fusion/data mining-based architecture for condition-based maintenance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						condition-based maintenance; data fusion; data mining		Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is a maintenance philosophy wherein equipment repair or replacement decisions are based on the current and projected future health of the equipment. The constituents and sub-processes within CBM include sensors and signal processing techniques that provide the mechanism for condition monitoring, and decision support models. Since past research has been dominated by condition monitoring techniques for specific applications, the maintenance community lacks a generic CBM architecture that would be relevant across different domains. This paper attempts to fulfil that need by proposing a combined data fusion/data mining-based architecture for CBM. Data fusion, which is extensively used in defence applications, is an automated process of combining information from several sources in order to make decisions regarding the state of an object. Data mining seeks unknown patterns and relationships in large data sets; the methodology is used to support data fusion and model generation at several levels. In the architecture, methods from both these domains analyse CBM data to determine the overall condition or health of a machine. This information is then used by a predictive maintenance model to determine the best course of action for maintaining critical equipment.

Dynamic modelling of spur gear pair and application of empirical mode decomposition-based statistical analysis for early detection of localized tooth defect	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							MESHING VIBRATION; FAULT-DETECTION; FAILURE; AVERAGE; SIGNALS	Gears are one of the most common and important machine components in many advanced machines. An improved understanding of vibration signal is required for the early detection of incipient gear failure to achieve high reliability. This paper mainly consists of two parts: in the first part, a 6-degree-of-freedom gear dynamic model including localized tooth defect has been developed. The model consists of a spur gear pair, two shafts, two inertias representing load and prime mover and bearings. The model incorporates the effects of time-varying mesh stiffness and damping, backlash, excitation due to gear errors and profile modifications. The second part consists of signal processing of simulated and experimental signals. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a method of breaking down a signal without leaving a time domain. The process is useful for analysing non-stationary and nonlinear signals. EMD decomposes a signal into some individual, nearly monocomponent signals, named as intrinsic mode function (IMF). Crest factor and kurtosis have been calculated of these IMFs. EMD pre-processed kurtosis and crest factor give early detection of pitting as compared to raw signal. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Guo, QJ; Yu, HB; Xu, AD				Guo, Qian-jin; Yu, Hai-bin; Xu, Ai-dong			A hybrid PSO-GD based intelligent method for machine diagnosis	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						wavelet neural network; particle swarm optimization; gradient descent algorithm; machine diagnosis	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PARTICLE; POWER	This paper presents an intelligent methodology for diagnosing incipient faults in rotating machinery. In this fault diagnosis system, wavelet neural network techniques are used in combination with a new evolutionary learning algorithm. This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of the constriction factor approach for particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique and the gradient descent (GD) technique, and is thus called HGDPSO. The HGDPSO is developed in such a way that a constriction factor approach for particle swarm optimization (CFA for PSO) is applied as a based level search, which can give a good direction to the optimal global region, and a local search gradient descent (GD) algorithm is used as a fine tuning to determine the optimal solution at the final. The effectiveness of the HGDPSO based WNN is demonstrated through the classification of the fault signals in rotating machinery. The simulated results show its feasibility and validity.

First of all, from measurements carried out on the system, features are extracted from current and voltage measurements without any other sensors. These features are used to build up a pattern vector, which is considered as the system signature. Then, a feature selection method is applied in order to select the most relevant features, which define the representation space. The decision phase is based on the "k-nearest neighbors" (knn) rule, associated with an evolution tracking of system using trajectory allowing a diagnosis not only of states defined in the training set, but also of the intermediate states. The appearance of a new operating mode is taken into account in order to enrich the initial knowledge base and thus to improve the diagnosis. This approach is illustrated on asynchronous motor of 5.5 kW with squirrel cage, in order to detect broken bars under any load level. The experimental results prove the efficiency of PR methods in condition monitoring of electrical machines.

Insulation-condition indicators such as capacitance, dissipation factor (tan 6), and ac insulation resistance are calculated online based on the differential leakage-current measurements for each phase. A model for a three-phase ac-machine insulation system is derived and analyzed for both offline and online testing. Guidelines for interpreting the measured indicators for determining the: 1) overall condition and 2) significant degradation in the individual GW and PP insulation for each phase of the stator are given based on the analysis. Experimental results on a 15-hp induction motor under intentional GW and PP insulation degradation conditions show that incipient insulation degradation can be detected and classified with high sensitivity.

Pilar Molina			Validation of a new method for the diagnosis of rotor bar failures via wavelet transform in industrial induction machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	SEP 07-09, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA			broken rotor bars; fault diagnosis; startup transient; wavelet analysis		In this paper, the authors propose a method for the diagnosis of rotor bar failures in induction machines, based on the analysis of the stator current during the startup using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Unlike other approaches, the study of the high-order wavelet signals resulting from the decomposition is the core of the proposed method. After an introduction of the physical and mathematical bases of the method, a description of the proposed approach is given; for this purpose, a numerical model of induction machine is used in such a way that the effects of a bar breakage can clearly be shown, avoiding the influence of other phenomena not related with the fault. Afterward, the new diagnosis method is validated using a set of commercial induction motors. Several experiments are developed under different machine conditions (healthy machine and machine with different levels of failure) and operating conditions (no load, full load, pulsating load, and fluctuating voltage). In each case, the results are compared with those obtained using the classical approach, based on the analysis of the steady-state current using the Fourier transform. Finally, the results are discussed, and some considerations about the influence of the DWT parameters (type of mother wavelet, order of the mother wavelet, sampling rate, or number of levels of the decomposition) over the diagnosis are done.

In the case of a fault, it has been established that the pattern of the fault currents contain a typical signature of the nature and location of the fault for a given winding. This paper describes a new approach using wavelet transform (WT) for extraction of features from the impulse test response of a transformer in time-frequency domain and support vector machine in regression mode to classify the patterns inherent in the features extracted through the WT of different fault currents. This paper also describes an approach to identify the type and location of the transformer faults accurately by analyzing experimental impulse responses that contain noise. Here, experimental impulse responses have been preprocessed with the help of wavelet-packet filters to remove the unwanted noise from the signal and thereby enhance the analyzing capability of continuous wavelet transform.

Scott			Prognostics and health management as design variable in air-vehicle conceptual design	JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT			English	Article								Flight critical systems in air vehicles achieve required reliability through different redundancy design techniques including physical system redundancy. Prognostics and health management technology provides the opportunity to eliminate some of the physical redundancy (and associated weight) through implementation of accurate remaining useful life algorithms. Consideration of this subsystem design approach up front during the conceptual design process rather than downstream during the detailed design phase of the air vehicle system can produce a more optimal air-vehicle configuration with regard to reliability and weight. Results are presented for an unmanned air-vehicle design optimization, which included remaining useful life algorithm confidence, control surface actuator redundancy, and control surface configuration as optimization variables. Optimization constraints included landing dispersion, mission reliability, and mission availability. Reductions in air-vehicle weight were achieved with reasonable algorithm confidence requirements.

The best way to manage the complexity and risk is to abstract and model them. This paper presents a new method of modeling Web-based Remote Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis Systems (WRMFDSs) with Unified Modeling Language (UML). A component framework model is put forward. A highly maintainable WRMFDS with three reusable component packages was developed using component-based programming. This paper, which studies a reusable WRMFDS model, aims at making such advanced information technologies be used widely in the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis domain, it can give developers a paradigm to accomplish the similar systems.

However. fault detection using analytical methods is not always possible because it requires perfect knowledge of a process model. This paper proposes a neural network based expert system for diagnosing problems with induction motors using vibration analysis. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals. and the neural network is trained and tested using the vibration spectra. The efficiency of the developed neural network expert system is evaluated. The results show that a neural network expert system can be developed based on vibration measurements acquired on-line from the machine.

J	Zhang, YP; Huang, SH; Hou, JH; Tao, S; Wei, L				Zhang, YP; Huang, SH; Hou, JH; Tao, S; Wei, L			Continuous wavelet grey moment approach for vibration analysis of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; wavelet transform; wavelet grey moment; wavelet grey moment vector; rotating machinery		The statistical characteristics of the continuous wavelet transform scalogram of vibration signal are explored, and two features, wavelet grey moment (WGM) and first-order wavelet grey moment vector (WGMV), are proposed for condition monitoring of rotating machinery. Faulty signals from a rotor test rig are studied using the first-order WGM. The analysis indicates that first-order WGM can reveal the time-frequency features of vibration signals well and that it could be used to diagnose faults quantitatively. The effectiveness of the first-order WGMV is also demonstrated by experimental data. Results show that the first-order WGMV is suitable to reflect the local information of scalogram, and would be an effective method of vibration signal analysis for fault diagnostics of rotating machinery. The result by FFT analysis is also given. Compared with the conventional FFT method, the two features presented in this paper are more suitable to extract characters of faults quantitatively.

It is shown that SRC is capable of significantly enhancing the resolution of fault diagnosis when compared to conventional correlation-based techniques. The performance of this approach is evaluated using three time-frequency transformation techniques: the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and S-Transform. In addition, three different 2D windows are used to isolate features for use with SRC: a rectangular (boxcar) window, a Gaussian window and a Kaiser window. The results have indicated that SRC is a promising too] for machine condition monitoring (MCM). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), a set of feature coefficients, represented with different frequency resolutions, related to the mechanical faults is extracted from the stator current of the induction motors operating over a wide range of speeds. A new integrated diagnostic system for electrical machine mechanical faults is then proposed using multiple Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). This paper shows that using multiple ANFIS units significantly reduces the scale and complexity of the system and speeds up the training of the network. The diagnostic algorithm is validated on a three-phase induction motor drive system, and it is proven to be capable of detecting rotor bar breakage and air gap eccentricity faults with high accuracy. The algorithm is applicable to a variety of industrial applications where either continuous on-line monitoring or off-line fault diagnostics is required. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Murphey, YL; Abul Masrur, M; Chen, ZH; Zhang, BF				Murphey, Yi Lu; Abul Masrur, M.; Chen, ZhiHang; Zhang, Baifang			Model-based fault diagnosis in electric drives using machine learning	IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS			English	Article						electric drives; electric vehicle; field-oriented control (FOC); fuzzy techniques; hybrid vehicle; inverter; machine learning; model-based diagnostics; motor; neural network; power electronics	MOTOR DRIVE	Electric motor and power electronics-based inverter, are the major components in industrial and automotive electric drives. In this paper, we present a model-based fault diagnostics system developed using a machine learning technology for detecting and locating multiple classes of faults in an electric drive. Power electronics inverter can be considered to be the weakest link in such a system from hardware failure point of view; hence, this work is focused on detecting faults and finding which switches in the inverter cause the faults. A simulation model has been developed based on the theoretical foundations of electric drives to simulate the normal condition, all single-switch and post-short-circuit faults. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, fault diagnostic neural network (FDNN). We validated the capability of the FDNN on data generated by an experimental bench setup.

Unbalance and harmonics detection in induction motors using an optical fiber sensor	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						engine fault detection; Fabry-Perot interferometers; ILFE accelerometer; induction motor; unbalanced voltage	VOLTAGE UNBALANCE; PERFORMANCE	In this work, a new method for the detection of the negative effects of a particular unbalanced voltage and inverter harmonics on the performance of an induction motor using fiber sensors is proposed. Supplying a three-phase induction motor with unbalanced voltages causes an oscillating electromagnetic torque that generates vibrations, increased losses, efficiency reduction, and an extra temperature rise that leads to a reduction on insulation life of the machine. A new in-line fiber etalon accelerometer has been designed to detect these vibrations in the range DC-500 Hz. The in-line fiber etalon scheme used provides high robustness and stability, giving enough sensitivity to monitor the low-frequency and low-amplitude oscillations in the stator of the machine that exist in a voltage unbalance situation. To prove this claim, a 1.5-kW squirrel cage induction motor is analyzed under different unbalance levels. It is shown that a precise unbalance factor can be detected without accessing to the electric part of the machine and an accurate monitoring can be obtained using the high-resolution analysis proposed.

First, they study an original model that takes into account the effects of interturn faults resulting in the shorting of one or more circuits of stator-phase winding. They introduce, thus, additional parameters to explain the fault in the three stator phases. Then, they propose a new faulty model dedicated to broken rotor bars detection. The corresponding diagnosis procedure based on parameter estimation of the stator and rotor faulty model is proposed. The estimation technique is performed by taking into account prior information available on the safe system operating in nominal conditions. A special three-phase induction machine has been designed and constructed in order to simulate true faulty experiments. Experimental test results show good agreement and demonstrate the possibility of detection and localization of previous failures.

J	Lautre, NK; Manna, A				Lautre, Nitin K.; Manna, Alakesh			A study on fault diagnosis and maintenance of CNC-WEDM based on binary relational analysis and expert system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						binary relations; expert system (ES); fault diagnosis; wire breakage		The paper presents a binary relational analysis and expert system base module for maintenance and fault diagnosis of CNC wire EDM. The module proposes a framework of integrated maintenance and fault diagnosis system. The study explores the binary coded matrix system, which plays an important role in prediction and diagnosis of wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) faults on the spot by expert guidance. In this study, 15 inputs were considered to observe eight probable causes with the help of the forward and backward propagation algorithms. Inputs and output matrices were considered in the form of a square matrix. To explain the fault diagnosis and to realize the importance of maintenance through advice, the detection of faults is investigated through forward and back propagation of matrix transformation on the spot. It is an integrated backup that can be individually focused when input and output parameter do not match. It is a time saving, knowledge acquisition, easy to maintain, and capable of self-learning system. To verify the developed framework, 120 data sets were generated for proper analyzing of acquired output through graphical representation. The paper also presents some of the important features of maintenance schedule and probable causes of wire breakage with remedial actions in tabular form. The developed system can help the operators, trainees, and manufacturing engineers in achieving trouble free machining through quick detection of faults and proper maintenance of machines in actual practice.

A non-contact method for detecting on-line industrial robot position errors using a microwave Doppler radar motion detector	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						robot non-contact position error detection	CALIBRATION	To be useful, industrial robots must meet positioning accuracy requirements for their given applications. Off-line calibration generally improves robot positioning accuracy to levels needed for open-loop use in most industrial applications. Applications that require greater accuracy with respect to external assemblies generally turn to closed-loop control or passive compliance. However, industrial robot systems do not generally monitor in-process robot position to detect machine faults that can lead to product faults, scrap, machine damage, and additional costs. To achieve greater operational efficiencies, new non-invasive, non-contact methods for monitoring robot position are needed. The investigators developed a low-cost method for in-process industrial robot position monitoring using a Doppler motion detector and a statistical position error measure. The method detects position errors at robot repeatability levels.

The poison message failure can propagate in the network and cause unstable network. In this paper, we apply machine learning, data mining technique in network fault management area. We use k-nearest neighbor method to identify the poison message failure. Also we integrate the k-nearest neighbor method with message filtering approach. We also propose a "probabilistic" k-nearest neighbor method that outputs a probability distribution (rather than the identity) of the poison message. Through extensive simulations, we show that k-nearest neighbor method is very effective in identifying the responsible message type.

J	Gebert, J; Kothe, H; Grongroft, A				Gebert, Julia; Koethe, Harald; Groengroeft, Alexander			Prognosis of methane formation by river sediments	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						dredged material; methane formation; organic matter; pore water; prognosis; sediment	SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; ANOXIC PADDY SOIL; DENSITY FRACTIONS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; TEMPERATURE; SIZE; METHANOGENESIS; DECOMPOSITION; COMMUNITY	Background. Under anoxic conditions typically prevailing in disposal sites for dredged sediment, methanogenesis is the terminal step during microbial degradation of sediment organic matter. Sediment gas production may pose several problems to site management and post-closure utilisation. Depending on the magnitude of gas/methane formation and the intended utilisation of the site, countermeasures will have to be effected during and after deposition of the dredged material. For this purpose it may be of interest to pre-estimate the extent of gas formation from simple sediment variables. Therefore, the aim of the investigations presented here was to analyse the interrelations between gas formation and sediment physical, chemical and biological qualities. Methods. Freshly sampled riverbed sediment from nine German federal waterways was analysed for standard solid physical and chemical parameters, pore water composition, cell counts of methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and gas formation over a period of 500 days. Particle size and density fractionation were carried out in order to characterise organic matter quality. Correlations between methane formation and sediment chemical, physical and microbiological characteristics were tested using linear and multiple correlation analysis. Results and Discussion. The selected sediments, including two with marine influence, differed strongly regarding texture, chemical parameters, pore water composition, and methanogen cell counts. The course of methane formation was found to follow distinct phases. The commencement of methane formation was preceded by a lag phase of variable duration. The lag phase was followed by a strong increase of the methane formation rate up to a sediment-characteristic maximum of 5-30 nmol CH4 h(-1) g dw(-1). Eventually, the rate of methane formation decreased and reached a more stable, long-term level. The extent and amplitude of each phase varied strongly between sediments and could be correlated well with only a few standard analytical parameters, despite the strong heterogeneity of sediment with respect to chemical, physical, and biological characteristics. Lag phase duration depended strongly on the content of inorganic electron acceptors and also on the number of methanogens present at the beginning of the experiment. Maximum and steady state methanogenesis were mainly determined by sediment total nitrogen. As analysis of sediment density fractions revealed that total nitrogen reflected the share of readily degradable macro-organic matter. Conclusion and Outlook. The results imply that the observed methane formation is a function of the temporally changing balance of the availability of election acceptors and H, and the share of easily degradable organic matter. For fresh riverbed sediments, the latter may be deduced from total nitrogen content. Overall, the results showed that methane formation by freshly dredged material may well be pre-estimated from standard analytical data within the first few years of deposition. However, the differently degradable organic matter pools will change over time with respect to size, chemical nature and association with the sediment mineral phase. It can thus be expected that the correlations found in this study will not be readily transferable to older materials. Further studies on the gas formation and organic matter quality by older sediments, e.g. from older dredged material disposal sites of known age, should be conducted and results should be combined with existing organic matter degradation models in order to improve the prediction of sediment gas formation over time.

The first aim was to study some of the theoretical aspects of bispectral estimation. A lot of attention was paid to the influence of noise, the number of segments, the influence of one or several harmonic deterministic components and aliasing. These aspects are typical of rotating machinery. An example of successful fault identification in DC electric motors is presented. The identification proved to be capable to identify quadratically coupled mechanical system when the power-spectra analysis failed. Further it proved to be quite resistant to noise.

J	Wu, JD; Chen, JC				Wu, JD; Chen, JC			Continuous wavelet transform technique for fault signal diagnosis of internal combustion engines	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault signal diagnosis; continuous wavelet transform; digital signal processing	ORDER-TRACKING TECHNIQUE; PROCESS MODEL KNOWLEDGE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; VIBRATION	A fault signal diagnosis technique for internal combustion engines that uses a continuous wavelet transform algorithm is presented in this paper. The use of mechanical vibration and acoustic emission signals for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery has grown significantly due to advances in the progress of digital signal processing algorithms and implementation techniques. The conventional diagnosis technology using acoustic and vibration signals already exists in the form of techniques applying the time and frequency domain of signals, and analyzing the difference of signals in the spectrum. Unfortunately, in some applications the performance is limited, such as when a smearing problem arises at various rates of engine revolution, or when the signals caused by a damaged element are buried in broadband background noise. In the present study, a continuous wavelet transform technique for the fault signal diagnosis is proposed. In the experimental work, the proposed continuous wavelet algorithm was used for fault signal diagnosis in an internal combustion engine and its cooling system. The experimental results indicated that the proposed continuous wavelet transform technique is effective in fault signal diagnosis for both experimental cases. Furthermore, a characteristic analysis and experimental comparison of the vibration signal and acoustic emission signal analysis with the proposed algorithm are also presented in this report.

J	Yang, WX				Yang, WX			Establishment of the mathematical model for diagnosing the engine valve faults by genetic programming	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TRANSFORM	Available machine fault diagnostic methods show unsatisfactory performances on both on-line and intelligent analyses because their operations involve intensive calculations and are labour intensive. Aiming at improving this situation, this paper describes the development of an intelligent approach by using the Genetic Programming (abbreviated as GP) method. Attributed to the simple calculation of the mathematical model being constructed, different kinds of machine faults may be diagnosed correctly and quickly. Moreover, human input is significantly reduced in the process of fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by an illustrative example, in which three kinds of valve states inherent in a six-cylinders/four-stroke cycle diesel engine, i.e. normal condition, valve-tappet clearance and gas leakage faults, are identified. In the example, 22 mathematical functions have been specially designed and 8 easily obtained signal features are used to construct the diagnostic model. Different from existing GPs, the diagnostic tree used in the algorithm is constructed in an intelligent way by applying a power-weight coefficient to each feature. The power-weight coefficients vary adaptively between 0 and 1 during the evolutionary process. Moreover, different evolutionary strategies are employed, respectively for selecting the diagnostic features and functions, so that the mathematical functions are sufficiently utilized and in the meantime, the repeated use of signal features may be fully avoided. The experimental results are illustrated diagrammatically in the following sections. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hierons, RM; Ural, H				Hierons, RM; Ural, H			Optimizing the length of checking sequences	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						finite state machine; checking sequence; test minimization; distinguishing sequence	FINITE-STATE MACHINE; FAULT-DETECTION EXPERIMENTS; DETERMINISTIC IMPLEMENTATION; TEST-GENERATION; DESIGN	A checking sequence, generated from a finite state machine, is a test sequence that is guaranteed to lead to a failure if the system under test is faulty and has no more states than the specification. The problem of generating a checking sequence for a finite state machine M is simplified if M has a distinguishing sequence: an input sequence (D) over bar D with the property that the output sequence produced by M in response to (D) over bar D is different for the different states of M. Previous work has shown that, where a distinguishing sequence is known, an efficient checking sequence can be produced from the elements of a set A of sequences that verify the distinguishing sequence used and the elements of a set Upsilon of subsequences that test the individual transitions by following each transition t by the distinguishing sequence that verifies the final state of t. In this previous work, A is a predefined set and Upsilon is defined in terms of A. The checking sequence is produced by connecting the elements of Upsilon and A to form a single sequence, using a predefined acyclic set E-c of transitions. An optimization algorithm is used in order to produce the shortest such checking sequence that can be generated on the basis of the given A and E-c. However, this previous work did not state how the sets A and E-c should be chosen. This paper investigates the problem of finding appropriate A and E-c to be used in checking sequence generation. We show how a set A may be chosen so that it minimizes the sum of the lengths of the sequences to be combined. Further, we show that the optimization step, in the checking sequence generation algorithm, may be adapted so that it generates the optimal E-c. Experiments are used to evaluate the proposed method.

The IPS comprises several generic embedded devices (GEDs) and remote clients. The GED can be easily embedded into various types of equipment to acquire equipment engineering data and meet the specification requirements of Interface A for supporting semiconductor industry equipment engineering capabilities. Furthermore, the GED has an open-standard application interface offering pluggable and customized intelligent applications. With this feature, the intelligent applications can be distributed and localized, releasing the factory network burden and enhancing equipment reliability and processing quality. This paper also develops two typical pluggable applications: the predictive maintenance scheme (PMS) for detecting equipment faults and the virtual metrology scheme (VMS) for conjecturing equipment-processing quality. Integrating the PMS into the IPS and the VMS into the IPS are, respectively, accomplished using the conveyor equipment and the sputtering equipment in a TFT-LCD factory. These two illustrative examples clearly demonstrate that IPS is versatile, configurable, and effective.

P.; Kumar, Vinod			Vibration based fault diagnosis of induction motor	IETE TECHNICAL REVIEW			English	Article								All types of rotating machines even new ones generate some level of vibrations. Small level of machine vibration is acceptable, however higher level and increasing trends are symptoms of abnormal machine performance. Therefore, machine vibration analysis becomes one of the important tools for machine fault identification. This paper presents an integrated pattern recognition method based on Euclidean distance measure for vibration diagnostic of machine health. The overall process is subdivided into stages of data acquisition, preprocessing, feature extraction and calculation of distance index. A computerized on-line monitoring system has been developed to record the frame vibrations, temperature, speed, line voltages and line currents from a three-phase induction motor for different operating conditions. The proposed method is suitable for both off-line and on-line applications, The method has been successfully tested for a large number of vibration data collected from the set of five identical test motors under different operating conditions. The test results establish the accuracy, effectiveness and reliability of the method.

J	Wu, FQ; Meng, G				Wu, FQ; Meng, G			Feature extraction based on the 3D spectrum analysis of acoustic signals to identify rotor malfunction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						acoustics signal; fault diagnosis; rotor; time-frequency analysis	ROTATING MACHINERY; GEAR FAILURES; VIBRATION	The acoustic signals of an operating rotor contain plenty of information about its running condition and can be measured by non-contact devices. Therefore, it is necessary to base fault diagnosis on the acoustic signals of a rotor. In this study, the typical malfunctions of unbalance, looseness, rubbing, misalignment, and abrupt unbalance were simulated in experiments. Acoustic signals were received by BSWA microphones and a 16-channal Sony tape recorder, which were analyzed by 3D spectrum. The sequential spectra can be separated by uniform increments of time or speed. When data is acquired by a relatively slow acceleration with uniform increases in speed, one dimension (the ordinate) is equivalent to the speed of rotation. Thus, the plot demonstrates the frequency versus speed-of-rotation interference diagram. The plot allows the analyst to evaluate the various frequency components of vibration as the machine approaches its operating speed. The abrupt changes in surging sound signals of rotor malfunctions can be detected, and their fault spectrum features are shown in the 3D spectrum. The results demonstrate the potential and feasibility of this approach for the diagnosis of rotor malfunctions.

In particular, that data are reliable in order to produce meaningful results. The authors describe a method that automatically estimates the reliability of reference heart rates (HRr) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms recorded by vital-signs monitors. The reliability is quantitatively expressed through a quality index QI) for each HRr. Design: The proposed method estimates the reliability of heart rates from vital-signs monitors by (1) assessing the quality of the ECG and PPG waveforms, (2) separately computing heart rates from these waveforms, and (3) concisely combining this information into a QI that considers the physical redundancy of the signal sources and independence of heart rate calculations. The assessment of the waveforms is performed by a Support Vector Machine classifier and the independent computation of heart rate from the waveforms is performed by an adaptive peak identification technique, termed ADAPIT, which is designed to filter out motion-induced noise. Results: The authors evaluated the method against 158 randomly selected data samples of trauma patients collected during helicopter transport, each sample consisting of 7-second ECG and PPG waveform. segments and their associated HRr. They compared the results of the algorithm against manual analysis performed by human experts and found that in 92% of the cases, the algorithm either matches or is more conservative than the human's QI qualification. In the remaining 8% of the cases, the algorithm infers a less conservative QI, though in most cases this was because of algorithm/human disagreement over ambiguous waveform quality. If these ambiguous waveforms were relabeled, the misclassification rate would drop from 8% to 3%.

J	Wang, FL; Mechefske, CK				Wang, FL; Mechefske, CK			Adaptive modelling of transient vibration signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						time-series modelling; adaptive line enhancer; time-frequency analysis; transient vibration signals	LINE ENHANCER; DIAGNOSTICS	Conventional vibration signal processing techniques are most suitable for stationary processes. However, most mechanical faults in machinery reveal themselves through transient events in vibration signals. Time-series modelling, including autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modelling and autoregressive (AR) modelling, is an efficient approach for transient signal analysis. Based on the adaptive prediction technique, this paper applies the principle of the adaptive line enhancer (ALE) to the modelling of transient vibration signals. The time-series models, adaptive algorithms and the rational time-frequency transfer function are investigated in the paper. Simulation and experimental studies with different time-frequency-amplitude distributions and transient vibration responses are described. The results show that the adaptive modelling method can trace the time-frequency signal and extract dynamic features such as time-frequency distributions and time-amplitude distributions from sample signals. Given the simple programming and potentially easy implementation in on-line applications, this method should have application in machine monitoring and fault diagnosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yuan, SF; Chu, FL				Yuan, SF; Chu, FL			Support vector machines-based fault diagnosis for turbo-pump rotor	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; support vector machines; turbo pump rotor		Most artificial intelligence methods used in fault diagnosis are based on empirical risk minimisation principle and have poor generalisation when fault samples are few. Support vector machines (SVM) is a new general machine-learning tool based on structural risk minimisation principle that exhibits good generalisation even when fault samples are few. Fault diagnosis based on SVM is discussed. Since basic SVM is originally designed for two-class classification, while most of fault diagnosis problems are multi-class cases, a new multi-class classification of SVM named 'one to others' algorithm is presented to solve the multi-class recognition problems. It is a binary tree classifier composed of several two-class classifiers organised by fault priority, which is simple, and has little repeated training amount, and the rate of training and recognition is expedited. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the application to the fault diagnosis for turbo pump rotor. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Acosta, GG; Verucchi, C; Gelso, ER				Acosta, GG; Verucchi, C; Gelso, ER			A current monitoring system for diagnosing electrical failures in induction motors	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; induction motor; current monitoring	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATION; KNOWLEDGE; STATOR	Induction motors are critical components in industrial processes. A motor failure may yield an unexpected interruption at the industrial plant, with consequences in costs, product quality, and safety. Many of these faulty situations in three phase induction motors have an electrical reason. Among different detection approaches proposed in the literature, those based on stator current monitoring are advantageous due to its non-invasive properties. One of these techniques resorts to spectrum analysis of machine line current. Another non-invasive technique is the Extended Park's Vector Approach, which allows the detection of inter-turn short circuits in the stator winding. This article presents the development of an online current monitoring system that uses both techniques for fault detection and diagnosis in the stator and in the rotor. Based on experimental observations and on the knowledge of the electrical machine, a knowledge-based system was constructed in order to carry out the diagnosis task from these estimated data.

Here, we described self-assembled peptide sequences that release therapeutic payloads upon specific interaction with disease-associated proteases. The core peptide sequence consists of a protease cleavable region flanked by two self-assembly motifs. In aqueous solution, the peptides self-assemble as a gel scaffold. With treatment of the model preparations with the appropriate protease, the matrix can be degraded in a controlled fashion, where the degradation rate is fine-tuned by varying the peptide compositions. Protease-mediated drug release was demonstrated by enzymatic treatment of a model therapeutic peptide incorporated into the optimized matrix. Our results suggest that this type of material may have far-reaching applications for functionally targeted drug delivery.

This approach is based on the hierarchical and modular integration of Petri nets. The modularity provides the integration of three types of processes: those representing the productive process, fault detection, and fault treatment. The hierarchical aspect of the approach allows us to consider processes on different levels of detail (i.e., factory, manufacturing cell, or machine). Case studies considering detection and treatment of faults are presented, and a simulation tool is applied to verify the models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dielectric response measuring results can be affected by different parameters like measuring voltage, temperature, water content and aging condition of insulating system. In this work numerous measurements are presented, thus to understand, how the dielectric response measurement results at the insulating system of high voltage rotating machines can be affected by these parameters in the time and frequency domain. Because of the importance of the dielectric response application as a non-destructive diagnostic method the possibilities and limitations of this method to reflect the deterioration processes due to thermal and electrical stress were also investigated. In addition the possibility to transfer the measuring data from the time to frequency domain was investigated and the calculated and measured data were compared. For the test object actual stator bars were used that were manufactured with epoxy VPI technology.

J	Jin, NN; Zhou, SY				Jin, NN; Zhou, SY			Signature construction and matching for fault diagnosis in manufacturing processes through fault space analysis	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT SUBSPACES; VARIATION PROPAGATION; MODELS; TESTS	Variation-source identification in manufacturing processes is highly desired since it enables improvements in product quality. Recently, data-driven variation-source identification has received considerable attention. This paper presents a systematic variation-source identification method by assuming a linear model between the quality measurements and process faults. The noise term in the model is assumed to have a simple form. The variation-source identification is achieved through the testing of the common eigenspace between the fault signatures and the covariance matrix of the newly collected samples. Three types of fault signatures are constructed from either one or two covariance matrices for pattern matching. A systematic procedure to construct the signature is presented. A case study of a machining operation is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

It has been previously observed that these errors can cancel out one another for certain features. The mathematical modeling and analysis of this phenomenon is currently an open issue. We use the concept of an Equivalent Fixture Error (EFE) embedded into a modeling methodology to obtain insights into this fundamental phenomenon and achieve an improved process control. Based on our process fault model we develop a sequential root cause identification procedure and EFE compensation methodology. A case study is presented to demonstrate the proposed diagnostic procedure. A simulation study is also performed to illustrate the error compensation procedure.

J	Zhong, ZM; Chen, J; Zhong, P; Wu, JB				Zhong, ZM; Chen, J; Zhong, P; Wu, JB			Application of the blind source separation method to feature extraction of machine sound signals	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						blind source separation; feature extraction; Gerschgorin disk estimator; machine sound; mechanical fault diagnosis; partial singular value decomposition; time-frequency separation algorithm	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DIAGONALIZATION	As the result of vibration emission in air, a machine sound signal carries important information about the working condition of machinery. But in practice, the sound signal is typically received with a very low signal-to-noise ratio. To obtain features of the original sound signal, uncorrelated sound signals must be removed and the wavelet coefficients related to fault condition must be retrieved. In this paper, the blind source separation technique is used to recover the wavelet coefficients of a monitored source from complex observed signals. Since in the proposed blind source separation (BSS) algorithms it is generally assumed that the number of sources is known, the Gerschgorin disk estimator method is introduced to determine the number of sound sources before applying the BSS method. This method can estimate the number of sound sources under non-Gaussian and non-white noise conditions. Then, the partial singular value analysis method is used to select these significant observations for BSS analysis. This method ensures that signals are separated with the smallest distortion. Afterwards, the time-frequency separation algorithm, converted to a suitable BSS algorithm for the separation of a non-stationary signal, is introduced. The transfer channel between observations and sources and the wavelet coefficients of the source signals can be blindly identified via this algorithm. The reconstructed wavelet coefficients can be used for diagnosis. Finally, the separation results obtained from the observed signals recorded in a semi-anechoic chamber demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented methods.

Monitoring may be limited to the observation of current system states, with maintenance and repair actions prompted by these observations. Alternatively, monitoring of current system states is being augmented with prediction of future operating states and predictive diagnosis of future failure states. Such predictive diagnosis or prognosis is motivated by the need for manufacturers and other operators of complex systems to optimize equipment performance and reduce costs and unscheduled downtime. Prognosis is a difficult task requiring precise, adaptive and intuitive models to predict future machine health states. Numerous modeling techniques have been proposed in the literature and implemented in practice. This paper reviews the philosophies and techniques that focus on improving reliability and reducing unscheduled downtime by monitoring and predicting machine health.

J	Kim, DH; Song, JY				Kim, DH; Song, JY			Ubiquitous-based mobile control and monitoring of CNC machines for development of u-machine	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						CNC; ubiquitous machine; anywhere-anytime; mobile control and monitoring	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	This study was an attempt to control and monitor Computerized Numerical Controller (CNC) machines anywhere and anytime for the development of a ubiquitous machine (u-machine). With a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) phone, the machine status and machining data of CNC machines can be monitored in wired and wireless environments, including the environments of IMT2000 and Wireless LAN. Moreover, CNC machines call be controlled anywhere and anytime. The concept of the anywhere-anytime controlling and monitoring of a manufacturing system was implemented in this study for the purpose of u-manufacturing and u-machines. In this concept, the communication between the CNC controller and the PDA phone was successfully performed anywhere and anytime for the real-time monitoring and control of CNC machines. In addition, the interface between the CNC controller and the developed application module was implemented by Object linking and embedding for Process Control (OPC) and shared CNC memory. For communication, the design of a server contents module within the target CNC was based on a TCP/IP. Furthermore, the client contents module within the PDA phone was designed with the aid of embedded c++ programming for mobile communication. For the interface, the monitoring data, Such as the machine status, the machine running state, the name of the Numerical Control (NC) program, the alarm and the position of the stage axes, were acquired in real time from real machines with the aid of the OPC method and by sharing the CNC memory. The control data, such as the start, hold, emergency stop, reserved start and reserved stop, were also applied to the CNC domain of the real machine. CNC machines can therefore be controlled and monitored in real time, anywhere and anytime. Moreover, prompt notification from CNC machines to mobile phones, including cellular phones and PDA phones, can be automatically realized in emergencies.

J	Tse, PW; Zhang, JY; Wang, XJ				Tse, PW; Zhang, JY; Wang, XJ			Blind source separation and blind equalization algorithms for mechanical signal separation and identification	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						blind source separation; blind equalization; blind deconvolution; machine fault diagnosis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SELF-RECOVERING EQUALIZATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; DECONVOLUTION; CUMULANTS; BEARING; SYSTEMS	Many advanced techniques have been developed for diagnosis of machine faults caused by vibration. They are effective if the inspected vibration is well isolated from interference caused by vibrations from adjacent components. However, the components of manufacturing machines are numerous, small, and packed closely together. Thus the signal collected by a sensor is the aggregate of vibrations from all nearby components. This, coupled with noise, makes it nearly impossible to detect the anomalous vibration generated by a particular component, especially those generated by small defective components. Recently, new signal processing methods, such as blind source separation (BSS) and blind equalization (BE), have been proposed to separate or recover the aggregated vibrations so that each source of vibration can be correctly identified. In this paper, a comparison study is presented. Some widely used BSS and BE algorithms have been compared to evaluate their performance in the separation of mechanical vibrations. Both simulated signals and real vibrations generated by industrial machines were used to verify the effectiveness of BSS and BE. Their deficiencies have also been identified and improvements are proposed in the paper, so that they could be effectively applied in the fault diagnosis of complex manufacturing machines.

Cellular lysosomes are already known to accumulate many metals and organic xenobiotics and the lysosomal accumulation of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) is demonstrated here in the hepatopancreatic digestive cells and ovarian oocytes of the blue mussel. Lysosomal membrane integrity or stability appears to be a generic indicator of cellular well-being in eukaryotes; and in bivalve Molluscs it is Correlated with total oxygen and nitrogen radical scavenging capacity (TOSC), protein synthesis, scope for growth and larval viability; and inversely correlated with DNA damage (micronuclei), as well as lysosomal swelling (volume density), lipidosis and lipofuscinosis, which are all characteristic of failed or incomplete autophagy. Integration of multiple biomarker data is achieved using multivariate statistics and then mapped onto "health status space" by using lysosomal membrane stability as a measure of cellular well-being. This is viewed as a crucial step towards the derivation of explanatory frameworks for prediction of pollutant impact oil animal health; and has facilitated the development of a conceptual mechanistic model linking lysosomal damage and autophagic dysfunction with injury to cells, tissues and the whole animal. This model has also complemented the creation and use of a cell-based bioenergetic computational model Of Molluscan hepatopancreatic cells that Simulates lysosomal and cellular reactions to pollutants. More speculatively, the use of coupled empirical measurements of biomarker reactions and modelling is proposed as a practical approach to the development of an operational toolbox for predicting the health of the environment.

The model of the fully assembled machine is composed by the submodels of the rotor, of the bearings and of the foundation, while the effect of the faults is modelled by means of equivalent force systems. Some identification techniques, such as the least squares identification in frequency domain, proposed by the authors, have proven to be quite robust even if the submodels are not fine-tuned. Anyhow, the use of a reliable model can increase the accuracy of the identification. Normally a supporting structure is represented by means of rigid foundation or by pedestals, i.e. 2 d.o.f. mass-spring-damper systems, but these kind of models are often not able to reproduce correctly the influence of the dynamical behaviour of the supporting structure on the shaft, especially in large machines where coupled modes are present. Therefore, peculiar aspect of this paper is the use of a modal foundation to model the supporting structure of the machine and the method is discussed in detail in this first part. The modal representation of the foundation is then introduced in the least squares identification technique in frequency domain. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of a reliable model can increase the accuracy of identification. Rigid supports or lumped mass pedestals are not always enough to account for foundation dynamics; a modal representation of the supports can improve the identification results. The method, discussed in the first part, is here validated using experimental data of a 320 MW steam turbogenerator. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of fault identification on real data from a large machine, where the supporting structure is accounted for by means of a modal model.

J	Fan, XF; Zuo, MJ				Fan, XF; Zuo, MJ			Fault diagnosis of machines based on D-S evidence theory. Part 2: Application of the improved D-S evidence theory in gearbox fault diagnosis	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						improved D-S evidence theory; gearbox; fault diagnosis		Fault diagnosis requires reasoning and decision-making based on diagnostic knowledge and features extracted from raw data. In practice, fault features may be uncertain and imprecise due to sensor errors, fluctuating working conditions, and limitations of feature extraction methods. Features may not be apparent when a fault is in the early stages of development. In addition, diagnostic knowledge is not always accurate because most of it is obtained from experts' experience. In Part 1 of this study, a new decision method is proposed that can deal with these issues, combine multi-evidence information from different methods, and provide more accurate diagnostic results. It is an improvement on conventional D-S evidence theory. Part 2 of this study reports an application of the improved D-S evidence theory in gearbox fault diagnosis. Compared with conventional diagnostic methods, the proposed method call enhance diagnostic accuracy and autonomy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Oh, JE; Kim, WT; Sim, HJ; Lee, JY				Oh, Jae-Eung; Kim, Woo-Taek; Sim, Houn-Jin; Lee, Jung-Yoon			Advanced multidimensional spectral analysis and its application for early fault detection	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						diagnostics; identification; random vibration; spectrum analysis; wavelet; multidimensional spectral analysis	WAVELET; IDENTIFICATION	For the early detection and diagnosis of a machine fault, it is necessary to identify the source that contains a fault signal, and to estimate the magnitude of the fault signal in the case of multiple input systems. However, most conventional research is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method, so it requires entire time data and cannot be used for fault signals occurring instantaneously. Fourier-based methods are not well suited to the analysis of non-linear or non-stationary systems owing to their time-varying nature. Thus, in this paper, a wavelet packet based technique that calculates the time-varying coherence functions for input/output relationships is developed. Advanced multidimensional spectral analysis (MDSA) is introduced, and the proposed method analyses the signal instantaneously in both time and frequency domains. Introducing the instantaneous ordinary coherence function (IOCF), which is obtained from the wavelet packet analysis, it shows the possibility of 'early fault detection' by analysing signals instantaneously in time. Thus, by examining the trend of coherence functions, it is possible to find which signal contains the major fault signal and the degree to which the system is damaged.

J	Li, ZN; He, YY; Chu, FL; Han, J; Hao, W				Li, ZN; He, YY; Chu, FL; Han, J; Hao, W			Fault recognition method for speed-up and speed-down process of rotating machinery based on independent component analysis and Factorial Hidden Markov Model	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								The behavior characteristics of the speed-up and speed-down process of rotating machinery possess the distinct diagnostic value. The abundant information, non-stationarity, poor repeatability and reproducibility in this process lead to the necessity to find the corresponding method of feature extraction and fault recognition. In this paper, combining independent component analysis (ICA) and Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM), a new method of the fault recognition named ICA-FHMM is proposed. In the proposed method, ICA is used for the redundancy reduction and feature extraction of the multi-channel detection, and FHMM as a classifier to recognize the faults of the speed-up and speed-down process in rotating machinery. This method is compared with another recognition method named ICA-HMM, in which ICA is similarly used for the feature extraction, however Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very effective, and the ICA-FHMM recognition method is superior to the ICA-HMM recognition method. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ogaji, SOT; Singh, R; Pilidis, P; Diacakis, M				Ogaji, SOT; Singh, R; Pilidis, P; Diacakis, M			Modelling fuel cell performance using artificial intelligence	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						neural network; artificial intelligence; fuel cell	NEURAL-NETWORKS; GAS-TURBINE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIMULATION	Over the last few years, fuel cell technology has been increasing promisingly its share in the generation of stationary power. Numerous pilot projects are operating worldwide, continuously increasing the amount of operating hours either as stand-alone devices or as part of gas turbine combined cycles. An essential tool for the adequate and dynamic analysis of such systems is a software model that enables the user to assess a large number of alternative options in the least possible time. On the other hand, the sphere of application of artificial neural networks has widened covering such endeavours of life such as medicine, finance and unsurprisingly engineering (diagnostics of faults in machines). Artificial neural networks have been described as diagrammatic representation of a mathematical equation that receives values (inputs) and gives out results (outputs). Artificial neural networks systems have the capacity to recognise and associate patterns and because of their inherent design features, they can be applied to linear and non-linear problem domains. In this paper, the performance of the fuel cell is modelled using artificial neural networks. The inputs to the network are variables that are critical to the performance of the fuel cell while the outputs are the result of changes in any one or all of the fuel cell design variables, on its performance. Critical parameters for the cell include the geometrical configuration as well as the operating conditions.

J	Zhan, YM; Makis, V				Zhan, YM; Makis, V			A robust diagnostic model for gearboxes subject to vibration monitoring	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION; WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; LOCAL FAULT-DETECTION; PROCESSING TECHNIQUES; ROTATING MACHINERY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GEAR FAILURE; SIGNALS	This paper presents a robust model-based technique for the detection and diagnosis of gear faults under varying load conditions using the gear motion residual signal. Since the majority of energy in the healthy state of the gear of interest is concentrated at the meshing fundamental and its harmonics, the gear motion residual signal, obtained by the removal of the regular gear meshing fundamental and its harmonics from the time-synchronous average (TSA) signal, will be much less sensitive to the varying load conditions than the TSA signal. Also, the gear motion residual signal usually shows evidence of faults earlier and more clearly than the TSA signal. Therefore, less load dependence and an earlier indication of incipient faults can be obtained simultaneously. A noise-adaptive Kalman filter-based auto-regressive (AR) model is fitted to the gear motion residual signals in the healthy state of the gear of interest. By the selection of a proper model order which provides a compromised model for the healthy gear under various load conditions with the aid of a specific AR model order selection method proposed in this study, further enhancement in load independence can be obtained in the AR model residuals. Consequently, a robust statistical measure, which takes the percentage of outliers exceeding the three standard deviation limits of the baseline AR model residuals, is applied to evaluate the state of the gear of interest. The proposed diagnostic model is validated using full lifetime vibration signals of gearbox operating from new to breakdown under a variety of failure modes and demonstrates remarkable advantages over other newly proposed techniques.

The objective is to use existing theories to improve the diagnosis procedures in electrical engineering. First of all, a single signature is determined to monitor several different operating modes. For this purpose, features are extracted from the combination of the stator currents and voltages. Then, the sequential backward algorithm is applied in order to select the most relevant features. The classification is performed by the k-nearest neighbors rule with reject options. The methodology is applied on a 5.5 kW motor in normal conditions, then with stator and rotor faults. The experimental results prove the efficiency of pattern recognition methods in condition monitoring of electrical machines. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vichare, NM; Pecht, MG				Vichare, NM; Pecht, MG			Prognostics and health management of electronics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						built-in-test (BIT); prognostics and health management (PHM)	SYSTEM-DESIGN; BIT	There has been a growing interest in monitoring the ongoing "health" of products and systems in order to predict failures and provide warning to avoid catastrophic failure. Here, health is defined as the extent of degradation or deviation from an expected normal condition. While the application of health monitoring, also referred to as prognostics, is well established for assessment of mechanical systems, this is not the case for electronic systems. However, electronic systems are integral to the functionality of most systems today, and their reliability is often critical for system reliability. This paper presents the state-of-practice and the current state-of-research in the area of electronics prognostics and health management. Four current approaches include built-in-test (BIT), use of fuses and canary devices, monitoring and reasoning of failure precursors, and modeling accumulated damage based on measured life-cycle loads. Examples are provided for these different approaches, and the implementation challenges are discussed.

Normal performance characteristics of the motor are obtained through a discrete-time lumped-parameter network model. The model is modified to accommodate shortcircuit faults in order to simulate faulty operation. Fault signatures are extracted from the waveforms of electromagnetic torque and phase-voltage summation using wavelet transform. Three independent detection techniques are introduced. Experimental measurements agree acceptably with simulation results, and validate the proposed methods. This work sets forth the fundamentals of an automatic fault detector and locator, which can be used in a fault-tolerant drive.

The two techniques under consideration are: 1) the iron core probe based method developed recently and 2) the existing air core probe based method. A qualitative comparison of the two techniques is presented along with an experimental comparison on a 120-MW generator stator core. The test results are compared in terms of fault detection sensitivity, signal to noise ratio, and ease of interpretation, which are the main requirements for stator core inspection. In addition to the comparison, the performance of the iron core probe technique for machines with short wedge depression depth is presented along with the recent improvements in the algorithm.

The wavelet transform is used to extract diagnostic indices from the current waveform of the motor dc link. An intelligent agent based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) is developed to automate the fault identification and location process. ANFIS is trained offline using simulation results under various healthy and faulty conditions obtained from a lumped-parameter, network model. ANFIS testing shows that the system could not only detect the open-switch fault, but also identify the faulty switch. Good agreement between simulation results and measured waveforms confirms the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

This fault indicator is based on the rotating magnetic-field pendulous-oscillation concept in faulty squirrel-cage induction motors. Using the "swing-angle indicator," it will be demonstrated here that an interturn fault can be detected even in the presence of machine manufacturing imperfections. Meanwhile, a broken-bar fault can be detected under both direct-line and PWM excitations, even under the more difficult condition of partial-load levels. These two conditions of partial load and motor manufacturing imperfections, which are considered as difficult situations for fault detection, are investigated through experimentally obtained test results for a set of 2- and 5-hp induction motors.

The approach is based on the utilization of a detailed multi-body simulation model. In this study, the approach to detect abnormalities is applied to the study of a reel. The reel under investigation is used at the finishing end of the papermaking process and it consists of a number of subsystems including hydraulics, electrical drives, and mechanical parts. in the reel, mechanical parts are coupled by joints, contacts, and friction. The symptoms of the faults are generated using the variables which can be measured from the reel. When using a traditional component level monitoring method, the faults in the process often cannot be recognized. However, in the proposed multi-body simulation approach, the supervision of a machine can be focused on the functionality of the entire process, whereas detection of faults can be carried out without the use of additional instrumentation. When the multi-body simulation approach is used, the modelling of a machine can be carried out in a straightforward and systematic manner including the dynamic coupling between the subsystems of a machine.

J	Burgess, M				Burgess, M			Probabilistic anomaly detection in distributed computer networks	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						machine learning; anomaly detection; data-mining		Distributed host-based anomaly detection has not yet proven practical due to the excessive computational overhead during training and detection. This paper considers an efficient algorithm for detecting resource anomalies in event streams with either Poisson or long tailed arrival processes. A form of distributed, lazy evaluation is presented, which uses a model for human-computer interaction based on two-dimensional time and a geometrically declining memory to yield orders of magnitude improvements in memory requirements. A three-tiered probabilistic method of classifying anomalous behaviour is discussed. This leads to a computationally and memory economic means of finding probable faults amongst the symptoms of network and system behaviour. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, WM; Meng, G				Zhang, WM; Meng, G			Stability, bifurcation and chaos of a high-speed rub-impact rotor system in MEMS	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						MEMS; micro-rotor; stability analysis; bifurcation; chaos; rub-impact	ELECTROSTATIC MICROMOTORS; JEFFCOTT ROTOR; BEARINGS; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; ENGINE	A general model of a Jeffcott micro-rotor system with rub-impact is established based on the classic impact theory and is analyzed by the modem nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theories. An investigation is carried out on the stability of the rub solutions of the rotor system and the results provide a better understanding of the dynamical characteristics, such as the transition among periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic responses, of the rotor system with rub-impact under different system parameter combinations. Nonlinear behaviors of rub-related vibrations are studied with a large number of numerical simulations. The effects of rotating speed, imbalance, damping coefficient, impact stiffness, and friction coefficient on the micro-rotor responses are investigated in detail. It is demonstrated that the system goes through an extraordinary route to chaos and alternates among the periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic motions as the system parameters change. These forms of dynamical characteristics can be effectively used to diagnose the rub-impact fault. The results help engineers to optimize the design of micro-rotating machinery in MEMS, as well as to develop sensitive monitoring/diagnosis systems assessing machinery conditions.

J	Kar, C; Mohanty, AR				Kar, C; Mohanty, AR			Multistage gearbox condition monitoring using motor current signature analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATION SIGNALS; KS TEST; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Even though there are a number of condition monitoring and analysis techniques, researchers are in search of a simple and easy way to monitor vibration of a gearbox, which is an omnipresent and an important power transmission component in any machinery. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been the most recent addition as a non-intrusive and easy to measure condition monitoring technique. The objective of this paper is to detect artificially introduced defects in gears of a multistage automotive transmission gearbox at different gear operations using MCSA as a condition monitoring technique and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test as an analysis technique assuming that any defect or load has a specific probability distribution. Empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) are used to differentiate these probability distributions. Steady as well as fluctuating load conditions on the gearbox are tested for both vibration and current signatures during different gear operations. It is concluded that combined MCSA and KS test can be an effective way to monitor and detect faults in gears. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mao, Y; Pi, DY; Liu, YM; Sun, YX				Mao, Y; Pi, DY; Liu, YM; Sun, YX			Accelerated recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine for key variable identification	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						variable selection; support vector machine; recursive feature elimination; fault diagnosis	FAULT-DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Key variable identification for classifications is related to many trouble-shooting problems in process industries. Recursive feature elimination based on support vector machine (SVM-RFE) has been proposed recently in application for feature selection in cancer diagnosis. In this paper, SVM-RFE is used to the key variable selection in fault diagnosis, and an accelerated SVM-RFE procedure based on heuristic criterion is proposed. The data from Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) simulator is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the key variable selection using accelerated SVM-RFE (A-SVM-RFE). A-SVM-RFE integrates computational rate and algorithm effectiveness into a consistent framework. It not only can correctly identify the key variables, but also has very good computational rate. In comparison with contribution charts combined with principal component aralysis (PCA) and other two SVM-RFE algorithms, A-SVM-RFE performs better. It is more fitting for industrial application.

Gabor filters scheme that imitates the early human vision process is applied to the sample under inspection. Defects can be automatically segmented from the regular texture by applying the proposed method. Proper thresholding ensures segmentation of the defect from the texture background. The results obtained using this method confirms its efficiency. This can also be applied to detect defects on surfaces and materials that have regular periodic texture.

J	Wang, JP; Hu, HT				Wang, JP; Hu, HT			Vibration-based fault diagnosis of pump using fuzzy technique	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						fuzzy logic principle; fault diagnosis; vibration; pump	LOGIC	This paper focuses on a problem of vibration-based condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of pumps used in oil field to recover petroleum. The vibration-based machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis incorporate a number of machinery fault detection and diagnostic techniques. Many machinery fault diagnostic techniques utilize automatic signal classification in order to increase accuracy and reduce errors caused by subjective human judgment. In this paper, fuzzy logic principle is used as a fault diagnostic technique to describe the uncertain and ambiguous relationship between different fault symptoms and the events, analyze the fuzzy information existing in the different phases of fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of the pumps, and classify frequency spectra representing various pump faults. The diagnostic features are extracted from frequency spectra of the vibration signals of the pump. The frequency spectra representing a number of different fault conditions are then processed using fuzzy membership function, which is established by means of dynamic signal processing based on the condition variables. Correct classification and condition recognition of different pump fault spectra are realized when fuzzy comprehensive discrimination according to the defuzzy diagnosis rules is applied. The work conducted, proposing the new method of the pump fault identification based on fuzzy logic technique, shows the great potentiality and the strong ability to classify and identify machinery faults.

J	Antoni, J; Randall, RB				Antoni, J; Randall, RB			The spectral kurtosis: application to the vibratory surveillance and diagnostics of rotating machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						spectral kurtosis; fault detection; blind detection; kurtogram	BEARING; DEMODULATION	In the previous paper, the authors have demonstrated the high potential of the spectral kurtosis (SK) to detect and characterise non-stationary signals. The present paper brings together these ideas and shows how the SK can be efficiently used in the vibration-based condition monitoring of rotating machines. First, and in contrast to classical kurtosis analysis, the SK provides a robust way of detecting incipient faults even in the presence of strong masking noise. Second, the SK offers an almost unique way of designing optimal filters for filtering out the mechanical signature of faults. The first property is of practical importance for monitoring purposes, whereas the second one proves very useful in diagnostics. Another originality of the paper is the introduction of the concept of kurtogram, from which optimal band-pass filters can be deduced, for instance as a prelude to envelope analysis. All the original findings presented in the paper are illustrated using actual industrial cases. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pedregal, DJ; Carnero, MC				Pedregal, DJ; Carnero, MC			State space models for condition monitoring: a case study	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						condition monitoring; state space system; Kalman filter; vibration analysis; fixed interval smoother; maximum likelihood	PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; DETERIORATING SYSTEMS; KALMAN FILTER; OPTIMIZATION; INSTRUMENTATION; REPLACEMENT; REGRESSION; SIMULATION; POLICY	A Condition Monitoring system can increase safety, quality and availability in industrial plants. Safety requirements are especially important in critical machineries, like a turbine driving a centrifugal compressor located at a petrochemical plant in the case study presented in this paper. A Condition Monitoring system is set up for vibration data coming from the turbine. Four years of monthly data observed at two different locations of the equipment are analysed. The core of the system is a model to forecast the state of the machine using data provided by the Condition Monitoring system at each moment in time. The model is based on the State Space framework whose associated recursive algorithms (Kalman Filter and Fixed Interval Smoothing) provide the basis for a number of different operations, from which the most important in the present context is the extrapolation of the distribution of forecasts on which the probability of failure is estimated. The cost model on which the decision of making a preventive replacement is taken is based on the 'expected cost per unit time' for a pre-determined critical value of the vibration measure. The system is thoroughly tested on the data. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Samanta, B; Al-Balushi, KR; Al-Araimi, SA				Samanta, B; Al-Balushi, KR; Al-Araimi, SA			Artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm for bearing fault detection	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						condition monitoring; feature selection; genetic algorithm; bearing faults; neural network; probabilistic neural network; radial basis function; rotating machines; signal processing	DIAGNOSIS; GEAR; FEATURES	A study is presented to compare the performance of three types of artificial neural network (ANN), namely, multi layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) network and probabilistic neural network (PNN), for bearing fault detection. Features are extracted from time domain vibration signals, without and with preprocessing, of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings. The extracted features are used as inputs to all three ANN classifiers: MLP, RBF and PNN for two- class (normal or fault) recognition. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been used to select the characteristic parameters of the classifiers and the input features. For each trial, the ANNs are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANNs are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a rotating machine. The roles of different vibration signals and preprocessing techniques are investigated. The results show the effectiveness of the features and the classifiers in detection of machine condition.

This approach has been expanded to include a prognostics component and tested on a pilot-scale service water system modeled on the design employed in a nuclear power plant. A key element in plant optimization is understanding and controlling the aging process of safety-specific nuclear plant components. This article covers the development and demonstration of a physics-based approach to prognostic analysis that combines distributed computing, radio frequency data links, measurement of aging precursor metrics and their correlation with degradation rate and projected machine failure.

Besides its simpler design and implementation, this technique allows dealing better with complex and large data sets. For that reason, it was expected to improve usual pattern classifiers performance reported in chemical engineering literature, such as artificial neural networks or PCA modeling techniques. In order to compare results with previously reported works, a standard case study such as the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process benchmark was considered and SVM achieved consistent and promising results. Besides, the difficulties encountered when comparing the results reported are discussed and a FDS comparison methodology is proposed based on reliability and accuracy of each FDS. In that sense, this study establishes a reference framework for future comparisons.

A new-type structure of remote diagnosis system for high-speed wire rolling mills is presented in this paper. The signal processing, computer network and remote diagnosis etc techniques are used to predictive maintenance manage the rolling mills units in this system. The new structure reinforced the remote feedback function, made up the existing fault diagnosis systems' insufficiency in the extension and the function, promoted resource sharing and avoided the repeat development. The remote diagnosis example shows that the system can monitor and diagnose the fault information of remote machine timely and effectively.

Distinguishing diesel faults and classifying them is more difficult. In this paper we use a new method 'Wigner Trispectrum(WT)' to describe the characteristics of vibration signals got from diesel engine. WT of signals can characterize each fault. Then WT of signals as fault features are input into Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVH) to classify faults. Finally different faults can be distinguished correctly. Application indicates that the method described in the paper is a good way in analysis and classification of diesel engine faults.

Fault feature extract is the premise for the fault diagnosis. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is a mathematical tool that has a special advantage over the traditional Fourier transform in analyzing non-stationary signals. It adopts redundant basis functions and hence can provide an arbitrary time-frequency resolution. The signals are decomposed into different frequency bands with the WPT, then, the energy percents of every frequency band components are calculated as the fault detection index. In this paper, the fault signals are sampled from one gear with pitting fault. According to the characteristic of the gear pitting signals, decompose the signals with the WPT and the changes of the energy percents in the frequency bands including the gear natural frequency will be used as the fault index. Fault style identification is the other vital issue of the fault diagnosis process. Support vector machines (SVM) is a new general machine-learning tool for classification, forecasting and estimation in small-sample cases. The principle and the process of gear pitting identification using SVM is presented. This paper only shows the availability for pitting fault diagnosis with the integration of the WPT and SVM, but the conclusion is also flexible for other machinery fault style classification.

Decentralized failure diagnosis in discrete event systems	2006 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-12	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference 2006	JUN 14-16, 2006	Minneapolis, MN	Amer Automat Control Council			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DIAGNOSABILITY	In this paper, we develop and analyze decentralized failure diagnosis schemes for systems that can be modeled as finite state machines (FSMS). We consider a scenario where we are given multiple local diagnosers (with partial access to the events occuring in the system under diagnosis) and focus on designing a global coordinator which gathers the estimates of the local diagnosers at irregularly spaced time intervals and combines them to reach the final diagnosis decision. The functionality of the system and the local diagnosers is known, and each local diagnoser does not necessarily observe the same events as other diagnosers. We require the global coordinator to perform diagnosis using only simple processing of the results it receives from the local diagnosers. More specifically, we consider two possible strategies for the coordinator to reach a final diagnosis decision: (i) intersection of local estimates or (ii) consultation of a stored table that is constructed offline. In both cases, the global coordinator can operate in real time without knowledge of the functionality of the system or the local diagnosers. For each scheme, we derive conditions for single-request diagnosability and multiple-request diagnosability. We also explore the trade-offs between the two schemes in terms of processing and memory requirements on the global coordinator.

Embedded control with predictive diagnostics algorithm of the induction machine drive system	2006 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-12	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference 2006	JUN 14-16, 2006	Minneapolis, MN	Amer Automat Control Council		Blackfin ADSP-BF561; DSP; motor control; condition monitoring; induction motors; IGBT		Fault diagnostics of AC Induction Machines (ACIM have been widely researched however, an integrated algorithm for motor control with automated fault detection, prevention and condition monitoring is still missing. Condition monitoring can reduce the downtime of the processes and increase the maximum interval between failures, thus minimizing the number and cost of unscheduled maintenances, which is highly beneficial. In addition, embedding a systems condition analysis algorithm in to the motor control algorithm results in to an integrated approach; this can reduce the cost of the system and enhance its integrity. Thus, a new algorithm is introduced for the control of ACIM and the power inverter with embedded systems fault prediction and diagnosis. The embedded control and diagnostics algorithm is implemented using the Analog Devices Blackfin (TM) ADSP-BF561 dual core Digital Signal Processor (DSP). Core 1 is dedicated to implement the control algorithm while core 2 mainly implements the fault prediction and diagnostics algorithm. The diagnostics algorithm can shutdown the drive system on an imminent catastrophic fault. The algorithm employs various techniques to detect and predict different faults of the AC drive system. In this paper, the Inverter fault prediction and diagnosis are covered. The DSP communicates the systems electrical and mechanical parameters to a Windows XP (TM) PC through the USB connection, which is mainly used to monitors and displays the electrical parameters of the inverter and the motor it also allows update of the DSP controller for speed/torque adjustments.

Accurate diagnosis of small faults can significantly improve system availability and reliability. This paper proposes a new scheme for the automatic diagnosis of interturn short circuit faults in PMSM stator windings. Both the fault location and fault severity are identified using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The performance of the motor under the fault conditions is simulated through lumped-parameter models. Waveforms of the machine phase currents are monitored, based on which a fitness function is formulated and PSO is used to identify the fault location and fault size. The proposed method is simulated in MATLAB environment. Simulation results provide preliminary verification of the diagnosis scheme.

It is shown how on-line PD analysis and visual inspections are combined to form an efficient tool for predictive maintenance. On-line partial discharge pattern measurements were used to identify potential problems in the machine insulation. Subsequent visual inspections served to verify the findings and determine the location and severity of these defects. Partial discharge measurements were used in order to verify the efficiency of the corrective action and have shown to be an effective quality assurance tool.

However, in practice, it is impossible to realize a perfectly symmetrical electric motor fed by a balanced supply. Hence, in this paper, the influence of supply unbalance on the performance of synchronous machine with constructional asymmetries has been discussed. In order to conduct a theoretical study, asymmetries in the stator winding and the field winding of the machine have been considered. The field current signature analysis of the machine model with aforementioned asymmetries, with balanced and unbalanced supply, has been presented. In order to validate the theoretical results, experimental results by analyzing the field current and the voltage induced in a rotor-mounted search-coil of a synchronous machine have also been presented. The results of such a study will be extremely useful in developing unambiguous fault diagnostic tools.

In addition, wiring is expensive, heavy, vulnerable, and adds an additional layer of complexity to a vehicle's design. Therefore, the integration of a wireless interface into these sensors make equipment upgrades more attractive due to ease of installation. Wireless sensing approaches provide a robust data backbone which is immune to physical damage near adjacent machinery or compartment spaces. Wireless sensing approaches are very cost effective when the cost of additional wiring is high and weight reduction is important. In today's competitive markets,, the goal is to cut cost and reduce manning. This means simultaneously cutting spending on maintenance as well as ensuring equipment malfunctions do not occur. With reductions in maintenance schedules and the number technicians needed to perform required maintenance actions, a new health monitoring system needs developed that can not only diagnosis faults but can also place a request for parts and materials as well as schedule manpower needed to perform the repair action before the machine causes an unplanned failure. This paper discusses such an autonomous health monitoring system. Our team developed and demonstrated a new system design approach that can diagnosis and track overall machinery health, inform operators shortly before maintenance action is needed, place orders for parts needed to perform the specific repair or maintenance action and schedule needed manpower for repair action. This embedded wireless system was integrated into legacy Navy supply and maintenance systems. This paper discusses the wireless device, architecture, and processing used to meet the new objective of a sense and respond applications.

Improving the maintenance process and enabling prognostics for control actuators using CAHM software	2006 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					Actuator health monitoring of military systems is currently performed both on-board the aircraft (at the Operational-Level) and at ground-based maintenance installations (i.e., Intermediate or Depot levels). Current on-board health monitoring employs Built-In-Tests (BITs), which apply conservative thresholds to flight control data to identify problems early and avoid in-flight failures. However, the extreme operation and interdependent nature of these military systems often cause flight control parameters to exceed these thresholds even though the component is healthy. Intermediate or Depot testing may fail to recreate the in-flight problems experienced or not substantiate the on-board assessment. This has led to high incidences of Can Not Duplicate (CND) errors, high sparing requirements, and has affected maintenance costs and operational readiness. The authors are developing a Control Actuator Health Management (CAHM (TM)) software package that employs both data-driven and model-based algorithms to provide diagnostic and prognostic indicators for hydraulic servovalves and mechanical actuators.(1,2) These software modules use actuator command/response data, physical actuator models, signal processing techniques, neural network modeling, advanced feature and knowledge fusion strategies, classification algorithms, and an evolving array of prognostics methods. Advanced reasoners are also being developed to interpret BIT results for better fault isolation. Each class of diagnostic algorithm has specific requirements and advantages, including the low computational burden of data-driven algorithms (when compared with other diagnostic techniques) and the ability of model-based algorithms to relate faults back to physically meaningful parameters. These diagnostic algorithms will not only help isolate faults, but will also provide a gray-scale health assessment of components, which will be much more useful to maintenance technicians than a simple pass/fail BIT designation. In the presence of sufficient historical health information, diagnosis can be extended to prognosis using a suite of trending algorithms and novel tracking methods to provide an estimate of remaining useful life (RUL). This paper highlights the current state of the innovative software tool, which is initially targeted toward implementation in an intermediate test data environment.

Recent changes in weapons platform acquisition and support requirements have spurred interest in application of prognostic health management (PHM) concepts developed for mechanical systems to electronic systems. The approach, development, and validation of prognostics for two types of electronic equipment are discussed in this paper. The two applications, a switch-mode power supply and a GPS receiver were selected based on their relatively high failure rates and relevance to many commonly used avionics systems. The method identifies prognostic features by performing device, circuit, and system-level modeling. Device modeling with equivalent circuit and mathematical physics of failure models describe parameter degradation resulting from damage accumulation for each device. Prognostic features extracted from a small array of sensors on the power supply, and from the GPS operational communication data stream are used to update life usage and failure progression models to provide an indication of the health state. The results of accelerated failure tests on both systems are used to illustrate the approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting the useful life remaining. The solutions have applicability to power supplies in many avionic systems, and to a broad class of mixed digital/analog circuitry including radar and software defined radio.

It has become common place for vehicles to rely on electrical power, in whole or in part, for all systems, including critical systems such as flight control and fuel delivery. Microprocessors embedded in digitally controlled power distribution systems, as well as in the digital controllers within these systems, provide an unprecedented, affordable and inherent opportunity to monitor an electrically powered vehicle's systems health. Data transmitted to and from these controllers can be used to characterize the system and component operating signatures, thereby enabling advanced diagnostic and prognostic capabilities. These capabilities will ensure a high mission reliability rate as well as reduce life cycle ownership costs. The Aircraft Electrical Power Systems Prognostics and Health Management (AEPHM) program, presently being worked by Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL), Boeing, and Smiths Aerospace, has developed and demonstrated health management (diagnostics, prognostics and decision aids) algorithms. The first phase of the program, which ended in July of 2005, addressed electric actuation, fuel pumps/valves and arc fault protection. The second phase is addressing power generation. Algorithm development is based on data collected from seeded and accelerated run-to-failure laboratory testing. The AEPHM architecture supports system level fusion of evidence and state information from multiple sources to improve estimates of degradation. The robustness of health management as a function of possible data sources and data rates is being determined. The product of the research will be adaptable to a range of platforms, including military, space and commercial vehicles. Phase I of the program was completed with an end to end, hardware-in-the-loop (electric actuator, fuel pump, fuel valve, arc fault, and power distribution unit) demonstration with on-line data generation to show the integration of the technology into a realistic setting(1,2).

On false alarm mitigation	2006 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of complex military vehicles or industrial machines presumes the capability to correctly detect faults in components or subsystems. Faults are malfunctions that are observed in the monitoring system. Two types of errors can occur during automated fault detection: (1) missed detections or (2) false alarms. The practical consequence of either type of error is that a failed component may not be replaced when necessary, or alternatively, may be unnecessarily serviced due to a false alarm. In the most catastrophic cases of incorrect fault detection, the outcome may include the loss of an expensive military asset, or human life. The false alarm problem is particularly troublesome for condition based maintenance and prognostics problems where fault signatures necessarily need to be detected at lower levels. Here, we present an overview of some of the vagaries of fault and anomaly detection in the framework of reducing false alarms. New algorithmic approaches to user-controllable false alarm rates will be presented, followed by a dose of pragmatism, as real-world false alarm mitigation on a currently-deployed military aircraft is described.

Use of non-Gaussian distribution for analysis of shaft components	2006 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					The drive train(1,2) of a helicopter is a flight critical system in which the transmission of power results in both lift and thrust via a complex set of gears and shafts. Maintenance cost of this aircraft system is typically high due to the large damaging forces directed through these components. Consequently, monitoring the health of the drive train can potentially enhance flight safety and reduce operating costs. Health and Usage Management Systems (HUMS) monitor the drive train by using accelerometers to measure component vibration. Algorithms process the time domain vibration data into various condition indicators (CI), which are used to determine component health via thresholding. For the rotating machinery, a standard set of CI are shaft order one, two and three (i.e. 1, 2 or 3 times the shaft RPM). Shaft order one (SOI) is indicative of an unbalance, where as higher shaft order can be used to detect a bent shaft or misalignment condition. The magnitude of the shaft orders sometimes have maximum allowable values set by the manufacture. At other times, some method is used to set thresholds, and maintenance is recommended when that vibration exceeds that threshold. In this paper, we present evidence that the distribution of the magnitude vibration is Rayleigh for nominal (health components) and the Rice for components that are damaged. A model for shaft magnitude is used which describes the Rayleigh distribution. It will be shown that the Rice distribution is the general case of the Rayleigh distribution when the component has nonzero centrality (e.g. an imbalance). Threshold setting procedures for the Rayleigh distribution are given for anomaly detection (e.g. component is no longer normal) and for failure detection (component is damaged) and compared to Gaussian model. Finally, examples are given against real world conditions. The Rayleigh and Rice distribution will be beneficial for diagnostics and prognostics as it measures non-centrality (imbalance) and variance (stiffness) in shaft vibration better than Gaussian models. We feel that use of this class of non-Gaussian distributions may allow accurate calculation of useful life remaining because it is sensitive to changes in shaft stiffness that is a precursor to component failure.

The system has been developed to enable proactive life management and continuous diagnostic and prognostic improvements through a single fusion and decision support platform for helicopters, aeroplanes and engines. The system allows the user to build a wide range of intelligent applications without the need for re-writing software. This paper describes a suite of applications including engine applications for vibration analysis, life/fleet management and performance degradation monitoring. The paper describes an application that allows diagnostics and prognostics to be made by fusing oil wear debris data and Health and Usage Management System (HUMS) data. The paper also describes an application that fuses HUMS condition indicators and manages a large volume of Chinook fleet data. Such applications have been routinely applied to intelligently manage MOD aircraft data. The FUMS (TM) applications have significantly reduced the workload of MOD personnel and their military benefits have been recognised as a result of daily use. FUMS (TM) is also used as an independent verification platform and is being configured to assist the qualification of an airborne HUMS. The paper presents some of the FUMS (TM) real life results. The paper also discusses the verification, qualification and certification aspects of Prognostic Health Management (PHM).

Scott			Prognostics usefulness criteria	2006 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					Prognostics(1,2) and Health Management (PHM) can provide remarkable insight for maintenance management of large systems, but must be implemented with a healthy respect for the end user and a practical view of the hardware and software capabilities. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program is implementing a comprehensive PHM system to maximize the supportability of the air system. The prognostic algorithms must have a defined minimum capability to aid implementation and verification. However, the complexity of the air system precludes creating exact requirements for remaining useful life and confidence. Instead, "usefulness criteria" are created to link the user need with the minimum capability of the algorithm. The usefulness criteria are a list of goals related to aircraft supportability which can be used to define the minimum acceptable time to maintenance indication for the prognostic algorithm. The goals in the usefulness criteria were applied to each prognostic algorithm in the F-35 PHM system. When assigned, these usefulness criteria provide a means to measure the improved performance of the aircraft and fleet maintenance as well as prioritize the implementation of the prognostic algorithms. The development and implementation of the algorithms in relation to these usefulness criteria are still in process, but it is expected that most algorithms will exceed the criteria. Those which do not meet the criteria will be re-evaluated with a trade study to determine if further efforts in hardware and software development are warranted. This process of usefulness criteria development and application can be rigorously applied to the development of any PHM system. This paper covers the development of the usefulness criteria for the F-35 program and the implementation results to date.	[Line, J. Kevin; Clements, N.

This has been true for both mechanical and electronic systems. There has been a long history of trying to develop and implement various degrees of prognostic and useful life remaining capabilities. Recently, stringent Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Health Management (PHM) capability requirements are being placed on new applications, like the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), in order to enable and reap the benefits of new and revolutionary Logistic Support concepts. While fault detection and fault isolation effectiveness with very low false alarm rates continue to improve on these new applications; prognostics requirements are even more ambitious and present very significant challenges to the system design teams. These prognostic challenges have been aggressively addressed for mechanical systems for some time; but are only recently being fully explored for electronics systems. This second paper(1,2) in a series will continue to explore background, benefit impacts, and architectures; highlight some additional design challenges and issues; discuss prognostic capabilities for electronic systems; review strategies for prognostic capability verification and validation; and draw heavily on other related lessons learned from previous. and current prognostic development efforts.

Thermal gradient cycling occurs during system operation which eventually results in thermo-mechanical fatigue induced material failure. Such material failures can result in immediate electronic system shutdown with no advanced fault or warning signals. This NAVAIR sponsored SBIR project uses state-of-the-art material modeling to predict degradation of circuit board elements as a means for "simulated fault detection." This effort has been focused on the specific aspect of solder fracture and fatigue since electronic industry statistics have attributed this failure issue as a driving factor in system reliability. This project demonstrates feasibility for using conventional sensing, combined with thermal modeling, to predict solder degradation due to thermal cycling as a means to prognosticate electronic power supply system reliability. Current status, as well as future plans, of electronic prognosis development will be discussed.(1,2)	[Nasser, Loren; Curtin, Maggie] VEXTEC Corp, 750 Old Hickory Blvd,Bldg 2,Suite 270, Brentwood, TN 37027 USA		Nasser, L (corresponding author), VEXTEC Corp, 750 Old Hickory Blvd,Bldg 2,Suite 270, Brentwood, TN 37027 USA.

This paper describes results of a comparative analysis of two approaches to improving platform reliability. The first is based on platform inspections (performed at specific time intervals) and replacement of parts whose remaining life is found to be limited. By selecting appropriate inspection time intervals and fraction of remaining life left, various levels of platform reliability are achieved. The second approach utilizes prognostics capability, which provides estimates of remaining useful life based on platform's health state and the upcoming mission duration. In the analysis, the US Army Abrams M1A1 tank reliability data are utilized. Two operational regimes are considered. A steady-state situation develops after the tanks have been operating sufficiently long, and the average operational availability is not a strong function of time. In contrast, pulse reliability is achieved during a mission of limited duration (pulse). Such situations arise, for example, when tanks are selected for a specific mission that is limited in time, but during which repair or replacement of parts is not possible and high platform reliability is required. The presented results can be used for evaluating the benefits of prognostics approach, determining intelligent maintenance procedures, and developing effective strategies for achieving improved operational readiness and required pulse reliability.

An intelligent fault diagnosis system can ensure uninterrupted and reliable operation of vehicular systems, and aid in vehicle health monitoring. Due to cost constraints, the current electronic control units (ECUs) for control and diagnosis have 1 similar to 2 MB of memory and 24 similar to 50 MHz of processor speed. Therefore, intelligent data reduction techniques and partitioning methodology are needed for effective fault diagnosis in automotive systems. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach using a data reduction technique, coupled with a variety of classifiers, for an automotive engine system. Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) is employed to improve the classifier performance. Our proposed techniques can be used for any vehicle systems without the need to tune the classification algorithms for a specific vehicle model. Our proposed fault diagnosis scheme results in significant reduction in data size (25.6 MB -> 12.8 KB) without loss of accuracy in classification.

Equipment diagnostics, on the other hand, involve the process of determining by examination (operator, visual, test data) the nature and circumstances of the "failure condition" in the equipment, after the fact. In modern electronic systems, the systems themselves have internal health monitoring mechanisms which can provide early diagnostic indications (data) of the impending failures so that a "prognosis" of the equipment can be made with a reasonable level of confidence. It is this ability to leverage the diagnostic data from the equipment's own internal health monitoring mechanisms and predict impending failures that we call "Just-in-time Maintenance". This paper outlines a vision for an EPS design framework and discusses the synergy and benefits of using Just-in-time Maintenance.

For any feature extracted from a sensor signal, a baseline is created that is accepted or rejected according to its statistical properties and the largest time constant of the system. The proposed framework determines alarms using an alarm coefficient that is motivated by established engineering norms, heuristics, and acceleration models.

This paper describes the process, with related examples, used to develop prognostics algorithms for a commercially available switched-mode power supply (SMPS) using corroborative evidence sources. The process begins with a Pareto analysis indicating the primary modes of failure. Critical components are identified using a three-tier failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) by investigating device, circuit, and system parameters sensitive to degradation. Once acceleration factors, or sources of degradation, are known damage accumulation failure models for each critical component are derived from highly accelerated life tests (HALT). Then, healthy components are systematically degraded to varying levels of severity by performing highly accelerated stress testing (HAST). These components are used in seeded fault tests to identify system-level parameters sensitive to device damage. Features extracted from data recorded during seeded fault tests are used to derive feature-based failure models. Finally, reasoning and data fusion algorithms are applied to both models to generate corroborative remaining useful life (RUL) predictions.

Due to the presence of inherent timing constraints and variables in a communication protocol, an IUT is modeled more accurately by using extended finite-state machines (EFSMs). However infeasible paths due to the conflicts among timing condition and action variables of EFSMs can complicate the test generation process. The fault detection capability of the graph augmentation method given in [81, [91 is analyzed in the presence of multiple tinting faults. The complexity increases with the consideration of the concurrent running and expiring of timers in a protocol. It is proven that, by using our graph augmentation models, a faully IUT will be detected for the multiple occurrences of pairwise combinations of a class of timing faults.	[Batth, Samrat S.; Uyar, M.

With the proposed approach useful diagnostic indications can be obtained by a low-cost extension of the monitoring activity. In this way, the reliability of the obtained indications can be significantly increased considering the combination of advanced time-frequency transform, or time - scale, such as wavelets, and a new evolutionary optimisation approach based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This paper describes an approach to the joint optimization of neural network structure and weights which can take advantage of the backpropagation algorithm as a specialized decoder The presented approach has been successfully applied to a real-world machine fault diagnosis problem.

Then, by prior searching in depth and maximal searching in reliability, the optimum routes from the original place sets to the objective place sets were set zip. In reasoning based on Petri net, by a series of matrix calculation for the status vector recurrence, the quick diagnosing results could be got.

Likewise, signal injection oil induction machines is used oil sensorless motor control fields to find out the rotor position. Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is the most widely used method for identifying faults in Induction Motors. MCSA focuses its efforts oil the spectral analysis of stator current. Motor faults such as broken rotor bars, bearing damage Mid eccentricity of the rotor axis can be detected. However, the method presents some problems at low speed and low torque, mainly due to the proximity between the frequencies to be detected and the small amplitude of the resulting harmonics. This paper proposes to inject all additional voltage into the machine under test at a frequency different from the fundamental one, and then to study the resulting harmonics around the new frequencies appearing due to the composition between injected and main frequencies.

A special information compression (IQ method is used to send the information obtained from various sensors to the maintenance center in a compact and economical way. The IC method uses the neural-gas unsupervised learning algorithm to locate a predefined number of neurons in the densest data areas of the parameter space. These neurons serve as a kind of information granules of the current machine operation that are later sent in a wireless way to the maintenance center for further information recovery (IR) and performance analysis. Here a special weighted moving window average (MWA) method is used, as well as an original fuzzy inference-based analysis for comparison of different operations. and discovery of possible deteriorations. A knowledge-based fault diagnosis method is also proposed and analyzed in the paper. The whole IC/IR computational strategy is illustrated on real experimental data from a hydraulic excavator which demonstrate its merits and applicability.

In this paper stiffness degradation is identified using pattern classification techniques that rely on the spectral content of the vibration induced during the operation of the gearbox. In particular, the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm, as well as a novel neural network classifier was deployed to address this issue. The classification process was generally able to classify early signs of stiffness degradation. It was found, however, that multiple networks are essential to classification in regions of practical concern. To this end selection of features and clear understanding of the disparity among them play key roles. It was further determined that noise attenuation must be incorporated into the process for the results to be reliable. Finally, the effects of initial conditions must be well understood in order for the diagnostic process to produce reliable conclusions.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful recognition method for the problem with small sampling, nonlinear and high dimension. A multi-tie SVM classifier was applied to fault diagnosis of power equipment in this paper. Content of five diagnostic gases dissolved in oil obtained by dissolved gas analysis (DGA) for power transformer is preprocessed through a special data processing, and six features were extracted for SVMs. Then the multi-tie SVM classifier was trained with the training samples which were extracted by the above data processing. Finally, four types of transformer states were identified by the trained classifier. The test results showed that the classifier had an excellent performance on training speed and reliability.

These motors are exposed to a wide variety of environments and conditions, which age the motor and make it subject to inter-turn incipient faults. Stator winding is the heart of machine. Therefore, it is always essential to check winding performance from time to time. This can be done by various conventional methods are discussed here, and noninvasive approach, using the theory of instantaneous symmetrical component is introduced. The simulation and experimental results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.	[Ballal, M. S.] Nagpur Univ, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Khan, Z.

For this purpose, we used a Wiener filter to decrease the dynamics of the 50 Hz and to increase the frequencies associated to the mechanical load. Thus, we could detect the presence of a ball defect. This result is corroborated by an envelope analysis of the vibratory signals. The suggested method exploits the cyclostationarity of electrical signals (voltage and current) via their cyclic statistics to resynchronize the signals according to the electrical cycle (50 Hz) in order to recover frequency fluctuations. We then estimate the Wiener filter which is highly adapted to our application in order to obtain a signal corresponding to the electrical part only, which allows extracting the mechanical part on the measured current. An experimental result, in the presence of fault in rolling element bearings, illustrates the high performance of the proposed method.

A detailed model of the induction motor describing the actual layout and geometry of the stator phase windings and rotor bars is essential for the simulation and analysis of induction motor under fault mode of operation. The performance of the motor depends on actual physical construction of the motor. Even a newly manufactured motor may have unequal stator phases, rotor bars and non uniform air-gap. This paper addresses simulation and experimental validation of coupled circuit model useful for asymmetrical as well as fault mode operation of three phase squirrel cage induction motor. A new three phase squirrel cage induction motor is considered for the validation of the coupled circuit model under healthy condition. The model parameters are determined experimentally or calculated from motor geometry. The magnetizing inductances are calculated using winding function method. The model is used for the simulation of air gap eccentricity mode of motor operation. Fault diagnosis methods use either current, flux, vibration, speed or temperature for the diagnosis of internal faults. Therefore, analysis of these variables is essential for the understanding, design and implementation of internal fault diagnosis.

Parameter estimation via second order sliding modes with application to thermal modelling in a high speed rotating machine	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1-6			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology	DEC 15-17, 2006	Bombay, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc				Sliding mode observers (SMOs) are a well-developed technique with applications in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis (CMFD). Design of a SMO requires a nominal mathematical model. If this and indeed many other observer methodologies are to be routinely implemented in industry, automated methods are required for nominal parameter measurement. In this paper an algorithm for estimation of linear time invariant model parameters is developed. The concept of a second order sliding mode is used to increase the number of parameters that can be estimated from each dynamical equation. The results are demonstrated with simulated data from the cooling system of a dry vacuum pump. The algorithm is shown to be useful in estimating nominal parameters for the observer. Results show that the SMO based estimation scheme is also useful for continuous CMFD in a vacuum pump cooling system where intermittent faults are possible.

Researchers had pursued rigorously various diagnostic approaches for electrical machines. Apart from analyzing the conventional vibration, current, voltage signals people are trying to explore fault signatures from torque, power, speed, flux etc. Methods such as offline/online, with/without additional sensor, model-based, signal-based etc. are being explored vastly. A number of signal processing techniques and fault detection decision-making tools are being reported frequently. Undoubtedly this field is vast in scope. Hence keeping this in mind to avoid repetition as well to facilitate future research a brief review is presented in this paper. Nearly 80% electrical motors used in industries are induction motors and hence industries depend on the performance of them to a great extend. This paper will mainly concentrate on induction machines with a very brief review of other machines.	[Basak, Debasmita; Das, S.

Compared to conventional techniques the presented approach works well for a non linear physical system and is thus suited for condition monitoring of machine system under varying operating and loading conditions. The performance of this technique is investigated through experimental study of realistic vibration signals. The results demonstrate that complexity analysis and time domain parameters in conjunction with ANFIS provide an effective measure forbearing health evaluation.	[Wadhwani, Sulochana; Wadhwani, A.

This paper proposes a novel approach to detect and classify three types of common faults in rolling element bearings. The approach proposed here makes use Gaussian Mixture model to classify. Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Kurtosis are extracted from the bearing vibration signal and are used as features. A classification rate of 95% is obtained when using the MFCC features only while a classification rate improves to 99% when Kurtosis features are added to the MFCC..

Until now, in the most medical researches, the reasons for suffering from breast tumor are unclear. However, most medical researches proved that DNA viruses are the high-risk factors closely related to human cancers. In recent years, hospitals and health organizations have been furnished with modern computerized medical equipment for data collection, monitoring and diagnosis. Additionally, these data are stored in large medical information systems for analysis purpose. Developing truthful and reliable classifiers for diagnosis and prognosis has become an essential task in medical and healthcare. It was reported with increasing confirmation that the machine learning algorithms can generate more accurate and transparent classifiers and decision rules for physicians than traditional methodologies. In the machine learning algorithms, decision trees have been already successfully used in the areas of medicine and healthcare. In this paper, an algorithm of decision trees, Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID), is applied to build a classifier for predicting breast cancer and fibroadenoma. The results demonstrate that the decision tree technique is more favorably than logistic regression in terms of rule accuracy and knowledge transparency to physicians. Furthermore, the medical classifier can assist inexperienced physicians to prevent from misdiagnosis.

It is motivated by the scarce of fault samples in mine hoist such requiring very high security system. A novel approach is presented in order to diagnose blockage piston in cylinder, a typical fault of mine hoist braking system. This method mainly consists of three steps: (1) apply 3 levels wavelet package to construct and reconstruct signal of brake distance-time, extract fault feature vectors (2) set up training samples (3) establish a SVM fault classifier to complete fault diagnosis. E'xperimental results show that SVM method can effectively accomplish the blockage piston in cylinder fault diagnosis of braking system and has a high adaptability for fault diagnosis in the case of smaller number of samples.

In the paper, the power spectrum of fault signals are decomposed by wavelet analysis, which predigests choosing method of fault eigenvectors, and a fault diagnosis model based on least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is presented Via structural risk minimization principle to enhance extensive ability, the model preferably solves many practical problems, such as small sample, non-linear, high dimension number and local minimum points. In the model, the nonsensitive loss function is replaced by quadratic loss function and the inequality constraints are replaced by equality constraints. The parameter of kernel function is chosen on dynamic to enhance preciseness rate of diagnosis. The simulation results show the validity of the LSSVM model.

Accurate diagnosis of incipient faults can significantly improve system availability and reliability. This paper proposes a new scheme for the automatic diagnosis of turn-to-turn short circuit faults in PMSM stator windings. Both the fault location and fault severity are diagnosed using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The performance of the motor under the fault conditions is simulated through lumped-parameter models. Waveforms of the machine phase currents are monitored, based on which a fitness function is formulated and PSO is used to identify the fault location and fault size. Simulation results in MATLAB provide preliminary verification of the diagnosis scheme.

Hierarchical HMMs for autonomous diagnostics and prognostics	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE		condition-based-maintenance; diagnostics; health-state estimation; prognostics; remaining-useful-life; dynamic Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models		The ability to effectively control maintenance and support costs under ever increasing global competition not only requires timely identification of impending failures of critical equipment but also calls for accurate estimation of remaining-useful-life (RUL). This is especially important for critical systems with high maintenance and logistics cost such as military systems and nuclear plants. Accurately forecasting the failure time (i.e., prognostics) can lead to failure prevention and diminish the time and cost associated with unnecessary maintenance. This paper presents a prognostic method that relies on Hidden Markov models (HMMs) for health-state forecasting. HMMs present an opportunity to estimate unobservable health-states using observable sensor signals. In particular, implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) improves the design and realization of flexible HMM structures (such as Auto-Regressive HMMs and Hierarchical HMMs) for representing complex systems. Hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate on-line the health-state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical fashion such that health-states can be represented as distinct nodes at the top of the hierarchy. Monte Carlo simulation, with state transition probabilities derived from a hierarchical HMM, is employed for RUL estimation. Results on health-state and RUL estimation are very promising and are reported in this paper.

A system of Parallel Neural Networks (PNN) can be designed to monitor the offset of any signal from its healthy operation. This paper presents the use of Interprocessor Communication mechanism (IPC) in PNNs. It describes integration of multi-neural networks cells in monitoring complex manufacturing machines. Each NN cell is trained with critical status of a subsystem of the machine. IPC signals activate an associated NN cell for identifying real-time status of each subsystem of the compound system. NNs cells have independent topologies. Experimental results indicate that the use of IPC in PNNs architecture achieves a high degree of precision in real-time monitoring.

The primary focus of this paper is to present a robust data driven fault diagnosis scheme. The investigated scheme has the capability to detect and identify faulty components of a given system through examination of its output due to a specified input. The use of the wavelet packet transformation serves to draw out those features of the output response which best characterize each of the fault classes for the various components. Support vector machines are used as the diagnosis phase to detect and isolate faults of a given system.

And the negative-selection algorithm is inspired by the negative-selection mechanism of the nature immune system, and it is can detect any tiny change in an actual system, so it can be used in the state monitoring and fault diagnosis. In order to increase effectively the operation reliability of the brushless machines, a new detection method has been presented to the faults diagnosis of rotating rotor rectifiers in generators with brushless excitation systems, which is based on the negative-selection algorithm. When any rotating rotor rectifier has some faults, such as one bridge arm breaking, then the rectifiers are under abnormal operating mode, and the current waveform is changed, so the signal waveform monitored is unusual. Different fault has different signal waveform, and the signal waveform can be also analyzed by taking: advantage of the negative-selection algorithm, then the fault type can be identified The development trends of the application of the negative-selection algorithm for fault diagnosis are also introduced.

An on-line torque & flux linkage estimator for permanent magnet motor drives based on the instantaneous voltage-current data	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-7			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	JUL 09-13, 2006	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, ABB Canada, Ecol Technol Superieure		torque estimator; motor optimization; permanent-magnet motors; current flux-linkage locus	SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR; DC	This paper describes the implementation and validation of an on-line torque and flux linkage estimator applied to a 3-phase permanent magnet AC machine. The estimator is based on the sampling of phase currents and the reconstruction of phase voltages from PWM duty cycles to determine the phase energy and the associated copper loss over a complete electrical cycle. From this and utilising the relationship between coenergy and torque with the psi-i locus, the resultant torque and instantaneous flux linkage can be estimated. The estimator is validated using a 3-phase interior permanent magnet AC machine operating with both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal current waveforms. It is proposed that the resultant torque and flux linkage estimations can be integrated into an existing DSP motor controller to optimise steady-state performance and be used in online motor parameter monitoring and fault analysis/diagnostics.

Fault detection analysis in induction motors by injecting additional test signal	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-7			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	JUL 09-13, 2006	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, ABB Canada, Ecol Technol Superieure		fault detection; induction motor; electrical drives		Condition monitoring methods for the dynamic performance analysis of electrical drives received considerable attention in recent years. Many of these methods use vibration sensors based on proximity probes. However, it has been suggested that stator current monitoring can provide the same indications without requiring access to the motor. Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is now going to be a widely used method for identifying faults in Induction Motors. MCSA utilizes results of spectral analysis of the stator current to spot an existing or incipient failure of the motor or the drive system. Motor faults such as broken rotor bars, bearings damage and eccentricities of the rotor axis can be detected. However, when the motor is working at both low speed and low torque some problems appear, due to the small amplitude and the proximity between the frequencies to be detected. This paper proposes to inject to the machine an additional voltage test at a different frequency to the fundamental one, and then to study the resulting harmonics around the new frequencies appearing due to the composition between injected and main frequencies. Theoretical development and experimental results are presented to support the research.	[Rosero, J.; Cusido, J.; Espinosa, A. Garcia; Ortega, J.

Increasing anomaly in magnetic field distribution results in a degradation of steady-state and dynamic performance of induction motor. It can be determined through the analysis of the average duty cycle of the modulated voltage. Broken rotor bars would cause torque and speed ripple which is compensated by speed control algorithm. Consequently oscillation in duty cycle of the modulated stator voltage appears. This effect can be simply detected without additional hardware. Correct evaluation of faulty motor performance is very significant part of condition monitoring and diagnostic procedure in modern supervision systems of electrical drives.

Faults in the armature and field windings of the synchronous generator are two of the most common failure modes associated with the synchronous generator. Thus, early detection and tracking of these faults has the potential to reduce overall maintenance cost and system downtime. In this paper, an observer is developed to monitor synchronous generator field and armature circuit health. The proposed observer is shown to be capable of detecting the onset of such faults, measure the relative severity of the fault, and differentiate between armature and field faults.

Three-phase IM are the "workhorses" of industry and are the most widely used electrical machines. In industrialized nations, 70% of industrial processes use the induction motor. For this reason, detection of incipient motor failures is very important, thereby avoiding production lost and reducing operational costs. The main idea of motor damage detection leads with "motor variables, currents, flux, electric torque and power, variations (in particular the spectrum) with respect to the normal time-varying operating conditions of the motor". MCSA is a noninvasive on line monitoring technique to diagnose faults in three-phase IM by differences detection between fault and normal conditions, in current spectrum. Experimental tests were realized in IM of small power, and the results will be validated in later works with a representative quantity of motors.

Each of these methods is based on different concepts of power spectral estimation: nonparametric, parametric and eigenvalue decomposition, respectively. The frequency resolution, variance and detection capability are different for each method according to the set of parameters used. The paper also aims to determine which method is best suited for the implementation in automated fault detection systems. The evaluation is based on the sampled current taken on a prototype machine running under different load and faulty conditions. The effect of the main parameters of each method on the capacity to detect faults is also evaluated and compared. The comparison is performed considering the ability to discriminate fault related frequencies in the corresponding power spectrum. Different window types, window length, overlap and sampling frequency are analyzed and compared.	[Pereira, Luis A.; Fernandes, Denis; Gazzana, Daniel S.; Libano, F.

Monitoring and diagnosis of faults in interior permanent magnet motors using discrete wavelet transform	2006 IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE RECORDS		English	Proceedings Paper	37th IEEE Power Electronics Specialist Conference (PESC 2006)	JUN 18-22, 2006	Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE			MACHINE DRIVE RESPONSE; SHORT-CIRCUIT	This paper presents a novel application of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based algorithm for detecting and diagnosing various disturbances caused by electrical faults in the three-phase interior permanent magnet (IPM) motor. The DWT coefficients of fault currents of different levels of resolution using a selected mother wavelet are transformed to the root mean square (RMS) values through the determination of signal energies of different frequency bands of the DWT. The RMS values are then used in a rule-based classifier (RBC) in order to differentiate between different faulted and normal conditions. The criterion for the fault detection is the comparison of the DWT coefficients of the fifth level details (d(5)) of fault currents using a selected mother wavelet with a threshold determined experimentally during the healthy condition of the motor. The complete protection technique incorporating the proposed DWT based diagnosis algorithm is implemented in real-time using the ds1102 digital signal processor board for a laboratory I-hp IPM motor. It is found that the proposed DWT based protection algorithm is very fast, and has responded at the instant or within one cycle of the fault occurrence in all cases of investigated faults.	[Khan, M.

Thus comprehension of rotor broken bar effects, and detection methods is useful for the safety of the motor drive. Effort of researchers ensure complex models with capability to describe broken bars effects, but these models do not help detect broken bar. Use of variable speed induction motor drives allow to exploit model based detection method. This paper proposes the use of a simply model that allows to evaluate effects of rotor broken bars and that can be exploited for fault detection or even for control. Detailed analysis of the model and results from simulation are presented to validate the proposed approach.	[Santos, P. M.; Correa, M. B. R.; Jacobina, C. B.; da Silva, E. R. C.; Lima, A. M.

Despite of various, more or less questionable practical results obtained, the topic increased in interest especially concerning those methods and techniques which are related to rotor fault detection case. Although the recent trend is toward the non-invasive, potentially sensorless methods (that use more and more sophisticated mathematical models in order to avoid false alarms), the present paper takes also into consideration the traditional, dedicated techniques in use. However, most of these methods in use are limited to the case of the three-phase squirrel cage induction motor. A wide range of literature is cited in order to provide appropriate references. Some critical comments regarding the new achievements are also included.

Fault evaluation of relative-coupled BLDC drives for multi-facet mobile robot with distributed speed factors	2006 IEEE VEHICLE POWER AND PROPULSION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)	SEP 06-08, 2006	Windsor, ENGLAND			distributed system relative-coupled motion control; brushless DC motor; drive reliability; fault state diagrams; speed synchronization		This paper presents the evaluation of possible fault incidences between two identical brushless direct-current (BLDC) drives applied as front and rear in-wheels in a complex multi-actuated mobile robot. The independent drives are relatively coupled to provide information on relative speed errors between actuators without the need of universal master speed references. Such advance decentralized coupling strategy enables flexible distributed control of the BLDC drives, therefore enabling smooth synchronization actions to achieve the performance of various multi-motion robot constraints. Detection of faults is critical for electric drives (and machines) in high-risk robotic applications. As actuator drives become more complex, the probability of failure increases. Failure is unacceptable and may lead to unprecedented downturn in robot performance. Advances in actuator and controller design have led to the ability to detect faults as they occur and likelihood of mitigating the faults, thus allowing actuator reconfiguration. An investigation into instantaneous primary failures of short and open circuit drives is carried out to evaluate successive dual speed responses of distributed synchronization. Markov state models are developed to show the various state fault transitions of twin actuator scenarios in mobile robot. The normal operation reliability of an actuator drive is determined using baseline failure rates of major components. Failure state diagrams (with remedial strategies) are used to measure reliability of drive under normal operation after a fault has occurred. The co-simulation of speed behaviors between actuator drives are achieved by using Matlab/Simulink and Simplorer. The results are analyzed and an investigation into individual drive faults is carried out to study the possibility of drive catastrophic failures. Such an analysis would allow the possibility of developing future fault diagnosis and curative operating strategies, which together will enable the adaptive fault-tolerant operation of multifaceted mobile robots.

The detection of faults is an important first step in building a prognostic reasoner. This paper describes an approach for improving the performance of fault detection systems that operate on time series data. The method generates synthetic data that closely matches the characteristics of the raw data. These synthetic data are used to develop and evaluate classification systems in the common situation where real labeled data is quite scarce. The real data can then be preserved for use as a test set to assess the performance of the classification system.

This method combines computed order tracking, cepstrum analysis with ANN. Firstly, the vibration signal during speed-up process of the gearbox is sampled at constant time increments and then is resampled at constant angle increments. Secondly, the resampled signals are processed by cepstrum analysis. The order cepetrum of with normal, wear and crack fault are processed for feature extracting. In the end, the extracted features are used as inputs to RBF for recognition. The RBF is trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANN is tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a gearbox. The results show the effectiveness of order cepstrum and RBF in detection of the gear condition.

The precision and speed of the classification are important research issues in fault pattern recognition for this kind of intelligent fault diagnosis. Although many improved ANN (Artificial Neural Net) methods have been proposed for this purpose, most approaches focus only on the classification precision, instead of the computing speed. In this paper, a SVM model for fault diagnosis is introduced and analyzed about its limitation from sensibility to noisy data. To address this problem, we introduce the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method to reduce the dimension of the sample set and de-noise data sampled from the machine. Furthermore, for the whole real-time data processing and fault pattern recognition, a kind of wavelet packet analysis is applied to translate the field sensor signal in time-spectrum into the energy value in frequency-spectrum corresponding frequency segments real-timely. Therefore we present a new machine learning method: PSVM (Primary component analysis Support Vector Machine) method based on wavelet packet analysis in the fault diagnosis field. And this improved method particularly betters the precision and computing speed of the classification then other typical networks. And also the whole processing workflow is illustrated in details. Finally the diagnosis result of the CNC grinding machine demonstrates this method with both high classification precision and quick computational speed. And the whole integration of wavelet packet analysis, PCA and SVM is proved a new, effective and practical approach especially for the real-time online fault diagnosis exactly.

Probabilistic diagnosis of thermal plants condition	2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROBABILISTIC METHODS APPLIED TO POWER SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems	JUN 11-15, 2006	KTH, Stockholm, SWEDEN		KTH			A thermal plant (such as a gas turbine) is a system subject to considerable stress, which causes creep and fatigue. The condition of each component - and therefore the overall plant performance - invariably degrades with operation time, until it is partially restored by some maintenance action. We present a pro-active solution for localizing and tracking the origin of the plant faults (compressor fouling, turbine erosion, etc.). The diagnosis is obtained by analyzing the observed symptoms (performance degradation in efficiency, flow capacity, etc.). The solution uses a probabilistic approach to compute on-line the probabilities of the potential origins of the faults given the latest process information. The updated probabilities encapsulate all the condition information and quantify how likely each fault origin is, thereby providing crucial input to risk-based planning of machine operation and maintenance.

We define a natural framework in the cross product of the decision's time horizon and the type of domain knowledge used by the SC models. Within this framework, we analyze the progression from simple lexicon to annotated lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We compare this progression with the injection of domain knowledge in SC to perform tasks in the context of Prognostics & Health Management (PHM), such as anomaly detection and identification (unsupervised clustering), failure mode analysis (supervised learning), prognostics of remaining useful life (prediction), on-board fault accommodation (realtime control), and off board logistics actions (decision support). Finally, we analyze Evolutionary Fuzzy Systems (EFS) and determine their position and role in this framework.

The results from the comparison can be used for detailed operations recognition and fault diagnosis. The raw data from each operation are represented in a compressed form by a neural model. A special "growing model learning" algorithm is proposed in the paper and compared with the standard "fixed model learning" algorithm. Results from a test example show the superiority of the growing learning algorithm in terms of computation time and its ability to guarantee the predetermined model accuracy. Two methods for numerical comparison of pairs of operations, which utilize the trained neural models, are also proposed in the paper. They use the center-of-gravity and the relative size of each operation. Finally, an application of the methods to the comparison and recognition of eight operating states of hydraulic excavator is given in the paper.

The kernel of the system is a generic evolving model that is not dependent on the specific measured parameters determining the health of a particular machine. Two alternative strategies are introduced in order to predict abrupt and gradually developing (incipient) changes. This algorithm is realized as an autonomous software agent that continuously updates its decision model implementing an unsuprevisory recursive learning algorithm. Results of validation of the proposed algorithm by accelerated testing experiments are also discussed.

Besides the traditional one phase current spectrum analysis, the diagnostic procedures based on spectrum analysis of the instantaneous partial powers, total power, and finally the current space vector modulus are considered. It is shown that the relationship between the angular displacements of the current side-bands components is directly related to the fault type. The amplitude increase of the fault characteristic frequencies is used as a fault detection criterion. This allows us to investigate the ability of each of the five diagnostic procedures to detect mechanical and electrical faults. As a result, the total instantaneous power diagnostic procedure was observed to exhibit the highest values of the detection criterion in case of mechanical faults while in case of electrical ones the most reliable diagnostic procedure is tightly related to the motor power factor angle.

The test-bed proposed consists in a three-phase wound-rotor induction machine that has been converted in a squirrel-cage machine with current-measuring capability on two bars. Common multi-core copper cables have been used for cage fabrication; faults can be quickly produced and repaired without machine dismantling. The cage prototype was used to perform extensive tests about motor currents spectral characterization under severe rotor fault conditions (large number of broken bars).

Intensive research effort has been focused on the signature analysis to predict or detect electrical and mechanical faults in induction machines. Different signals can be used, voltage, current, stray flux. In the case of wind generators, considering that both the machine signals and the control signals are accessible, for diagnostic purposes, there are interesting additional possibilities, for example the use of the converter modulating voltages.

In order to avoid further economical and social costs, fault diagnosis has to be performed as soon as possible. Fault diagnosis has been a major area of investigation among power system problems and intelligent system applications. Several approaches have been proposed for solving this problem. This paper advocates the application of Support Vector Machines for mapping the relationship between electrical signals and fault locations in transmission lines. The significance of voltages and currents is analyzed using steady-state and electromagnetic transient information, i.e., two ways of feeding the fault location models are compared. The tests consider different operating and fault conditions, including different types of fault, a variety of fault impedances, fault angles, line loading, equivalent system impedances, and fault locations.

Therefore, such a fault detection method that is independent of the sensor is required. In this paper, an estimation method of reaction force is proposed for the drive system of the injection unit composed of a servo motor and a ball screw. We use a disturbance observer, and its structure is determined for the two-mass damper model. We construct a simplified low dimensional observer and its coefficients are identified from experimental data by the least square method.

Single point defects will cause certain characteristic fault frequencies to appear in machine vibration spectrum. In traditional methods, data extracted from frequency spectrum has been used to identify damaged bearing part. Because of impulsive nature of fault strikes, and complex modulations present in vibration signal, a simple spectrum analysis may result in erroneous conclusions. When a shaft rotates at constant speed, strikes due to a single point defect repeat at constant intervals. Each strike shows a high energy distribution around it. This paper considers the time intervals between successive impulses in auto-correlated vibration power signals. The most frequent interval between successive impulses determines the period of defective part. This period is related to fault frequency and therefore shows the defective part. A comparison of results extracted from the traditional and the proposed methods shows the efficiency improvement of the second method in respect of the first one.

Many of these methods are based on evaluating special frequency magnitudes in machine signals spectrums. Current, power, flux, etc are among these signals. Frequencies related to broken rotor fault are dependent to slip; therefore, correct diagnosis of fault depends on accurate determination of motor velocity and slip. The traditional methods typically require several sensors that should be pre-installed in some cases. A practical diagnosis method should be easily performed in site and does not take too much time. This paper presents a diagnosing method based on only a vibration sensor. Motor velocity oscillation due to broken rotor causes frequency components at twice slip frequency difference around speed frequency in vibration spectrum. Speed frequency and its harmonics as well as twice supply frequency, can easily and accurately be found in vibration spectrum, therefore the motor slip can be computed. Now components related to rotor fault can be found. According to this method, an apparatus consisting necessary hardware and software has been designed. Experimental tests have confirmed the efficiency of the method.

The observer/diagnoser is only able to obtain partial information regarding the state of the given system at intermittent time intervals that are determined by certain synchronizing conditions between the system and the observer/diagnoser. By adopting a probabilistic framework, mathematical analysis has been made to optimally choose the synchronizing conditions and develop adaptive strategies that achieve a low probability of aliasing, i.e., a low probability that the external observer/diagnoser incorrectly declares the system as fault-free.

While the test error probability of these methods is rather low, it is still considered prohibitive for accurate production testing. In this paper, we demonstrate how to minimize this test error probability and, thus, how to bridge the accuracy of functional and machine-learning-based test methods. The underlying idea is to measure the confidence of the machine-learning-based test decision and retest the small fraction of circuits for which this confidence is low via standard functional test Through this approach, the majority of circuits are tested using fast machine-learning-based tests, which, nevertheless, are equivalent to the standard functional ones with regards to test error probability.

Order analysis is one of the major methods in character analysis for the analysis of non-stationary vibration signals in run-up or coast down of rotating machinery. An order analysis method, which employs instantaneous frequency estimation based on time-frequency analysis, is introduced. In contrast with traditional order analysis methods, this method avoids the use of tachometer and other special hardware; hence it makes the application of order analysis simplified. The order analysis introduced in the paper with the character that only software is depended for order tracking makes it specially satisfy the requirement of Virtual Instruments. Corresponding order analysis items, such as order spectrum, order spectrum matrix and tracking order spectrum etc., which are applied in Virtual Instruments, are also introduced. A test example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the method presented.

The pressure fluctuation signal of the fluidized bed, which was a typical nonlinear and non-stationary signal, was decomposed to a series of IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions) with different scales by the EMD. Then the normalized energies of IMFs were extracted as the feature vector of the fault diagnosis. The gas velocity that had important influence on the flow pattern of the fluidized bed was also introduced in the feature vector. Finally, the feature vector was fed to the SVM classifier to implement the fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.

The motivation for the on-line health monitoring is to prevent routine maintenance from interrupting long-term continuous reactor operation. However, the outcome of the on-line monitoring implementation has a broader impact, and amounts to a paradigm shift in maintenance strategy from outage-based maintenance to continuous real-time monitoring of operational and structural integrity. Indeed, on-line health monitoring data will provide a foundation for diagnostics and prognostics (i.e., predictive) capabilities that will detect component degradation prior to failure, thus allowing for proactive rather than reactive maintenance strategies. Specifically, this paper briefly reports on our studies on (1) on-line monitoring strategy and its benefits, (2) candidate reactor components where on-line monitoring provides maximum benefits, (3) applicable on-line NDE sensor methodologies and conceptual sensor designs, and (4) model-based sensor performance estimations.

Thus these impulsive vibration signals can be used as indicators of machinery faults. However it is often difficult to make objective measurement of impulsive signals because of background noise signals. In order to ease the measurement of impulsive signal embedded in background noise, we enhance the impulsive signals using adaptive signal processing and then analyze them in time and frequency domain by using time-frequency representation. This technique is applied to the diagnosis of faults within laboratory gearbox.

In this paper we present a fault diagnostics system developed using machine learning technology for detecting and locating multiple classes of faults in an electric drive. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, "Fault Diagnostic Neural Network" (FDNN). We presented our study on two different neural network systems and show that a well-designed hierarchical neural network system is robust in detecting and locating faults in electric drives.

A method for enabling proactive fault monitoring in high-end computer servers	ADVANCES IN COMPUTER, INFORMATION, AND SYSTEMS SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Computer, Information and Systems Sciences and Engineering (CISSE 2005)	DEC 10-20, 2005	ELECTR NETWORK	Univ Bridgeport, IEEE				This paper describes a new method for monitoring electronic components in computer servers. Conventional monitoring techniques implemented in mid-range and high-end computer systems rely on low-speed low-resolution internal instrumentation that produces low quality measurements of critical system parameters. The poor quality measurements lead to degraded performance of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms. The developed method is based on the capability of an auto-associative memory to restore an associated response given an imprecise key vector. The method is performed in two stages. In the collection stage, high-quality signatures representing observable parameters of known good and faulty electronic components are collected using high-speed high-resolution instrumentation. The collected signatures are then stored in the auto-associative memory matrix. In the monitoring stage, low-quality measurements acquired by the low-speed, low-resolution internal instrumentation (an A/D converter accessible via a system bus) are fed into the auto-associative memory. The auto-associative memory restores the high quality signatures. The restored high-quality signatures are then used by diagnostic algorithms for fault detection and isolation and by prognostic algorithms for the remaining useful life estimation.	[Usynin, A.

To improve the diagnosis accuracy a method that combines the multi-class support vector machines (MSVMs) outputs with the degree of importance of individual MSVMs based on fuzzy integral is presented. This provides a sound basis for integrating the results from MSVMs to get more accurate classification. The experimental results with the recognition problem of a blower machine show the performance of fault diagnosis can be improved.

The location dependent characteristic defect frequencies make it possible to detect the presence of a defect and to diagnose on what part of the bearing the defect is. The difficulty of localized defect detection lies in the fact that the energy of the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can be easily buried by noise. To solve this problem, the adaptive Gaussian chirplet distribution for an integrated time-frequency signature extraction of the machine vibration is developed; the method offers the advantage of good localization of the vibration signal energy in the time-frequency domain. Independent component analysis (ICA) is used for the redundancy reduction and feature extraction in the time-frequency domain, and the self-organizing map (SOM) was employed to identify the faults of the rolling element bearings. Experimental results show that the proposed method is very effective.

Considering the high data dimensionality in the large-scaled chemical industry seriously spoil classification capability of SVM, a modified adaptive chaotic binary ant system (ACBAS) is proposed and combined with SVM for fault feature selection to remove the irrelevant variables and ensure SVM classifying correctly. Simulation results and comparisons of Tennessee Eastman Process show the developed ACBAS can find the essential fault feature variables effectively and exactly, and the SVM fault diagnosis method combined with ACBAS-based feature selection greatly improve the diagnosing performance as unnecessary variables are eliminated properly.

According to the frequency symptom values for each fault causes, three kinds of membership functions are used. Besides, the structure of the FNN is large which spend much training time. Thus, when the matrix between frequency symptoms and fault causes can decoupled, the relational matrix decomposed into several sub-matrixes and the structure of the FNN can also divided into several sub-networks. In this study, two above-mention approaches are combined to diagnose multiple faults and compared with neural network (NN), FNN with single/versatile membership functions in two actual cases.

Compared with the general SVM, the active learning methods can effectively reduce the number of samples on the condition of keeping the classification accuracy. ASVM actively selects data points closest to the current separation hyperplane, while ProASVM selects the points according to the probability of the sample point as a support vector. The two methods are applied to classify the practical vibration signal of bearings and the results show that ProASVM is a better algorithm of classification than ASVM.

The experimental unit consists of induction motor drive and data acquisition module to obtain the fault signals. As the first step for diagnosis procedure, preprocessing is performed to make the acquired current simplified and normalized. To simplify the input data, three-phase currents are transformed into the magnitude of Concordia vector. As the next step, feature extraction is performed by kernel PCA. Finally, we used the linear classifier based on two types of distance measures. To show the effectiveness, the proposed fault diagnostic system has been intensively tested with the various data acquired under the different electrical and mechanical faults with varying load.

Second we described the fundamentals of two-shaft aero-engines vibration fault diagnosis, and then obtained the standard fault samples (training samples) and simulation samples (testing samples). Third we applied the two ANN methods to perform diagnosing. The accurate diagnostic results have proved the effectiveness of the RBF and SOFM methods for vibration fault diagnosis of two-shaft aero-engines.

Many techniques have been presented to diagnose fault in manufacturing systems. The SVM approach has received more attention due to its classification ability. However, the development of support vector machines (SVM) in the diagnosis of manufacturing systems is rare. Therefore, this investigation attempts to apply the SVM in the diagnosis of manufacturing systems. Furthermore, the tabu search is employed to determine two parameters SVM model correctly and efficiently. A numerical example in the previous literature was used to demonstrate the diagnosis ability of the proposed DSVMT (directed acyclic graph support vector machines with tabu search) model. The experiment results show that the proposed approach can classify the faulty product types correctly.

The functional state of these devices is necessary to determine with respect veracity and accuracy. Vibrating diagnostic and diagnostic using harmonic analysis of windings currents are methods for determination and identification faults of induction machines. Each of those methods is useful for a specific diagnostic area. With using vibrating diagnostic it is possible to diagnose faults of mechanical character as an overbalance, bearing faults, dislocation of rotor and stator axis and so on. For determination of faults of mechanical and electrical characters is applicable diagnostic method harmonic analysis of windings currents. Interference of magnetic field in the air gap of induction machines is common feature of mechanical. and electrical faults. Field incidence between stator and rotor creates mentioned changes of magnetic field in the air gap. Incurred exciting field evokes response at vibrating spectrum. The change of magnetic field evokes deformation of stator current too. Static and dynamic eccentricity, interruption of rotor cage, short-circuit of stator's winding, short circuit or released armature stampings belongs to faults evocatory change of magnetic field in the air gap of induction machines.

When used with condition-based maintenance, EP promises to significantly increase the effective mean-time-between system failures (MTBF) by predicting and avoiding system failures (maintenance planned based on condition). Increased MTBF numbers translate into enhanced availability and better operational reliability. This is essential for building highly dependable computing systems. This paper briefly reviews the steps required for achieving successful prognostics. The lessons learned from adopting EP to the previous and current generations of enterprise computing systems have influenced the next generation computer system designs, equipping future systems with more advanced capabilities for electronic prognostics. Sun Microsystems' new continuous system telemetry harness (CSTH) coupled with advanced pattern recognition substantially increases component reliability margins and system availability goals while reducing (through improved root cause analysis) costly sources of "no trouble found" events. These "no trouble found" events.. have become a significant warranty-cost issue for COTS and a sparing-logistics issue for mil spec electronic systems.

These models are constructed from historical maintenance and fault information of the equipment. Due to the complex nature of these machines, constructing these models involves significant manual effort which limits the widespread use of reliability-centric maintenance schemes. In this paper, we describe a process for automating the construction of fault trees, a class of non-state space reliability models, by analyzing maintenance data available as free-form text. It uses a combination of linguistic analysis and domain knowledge to identify the nature of the failure from short plain text descriptions of equipment faults. This information is used to automatically enrich and evolve existing fault trees for better reliability estimation.

Robust SVM-based biomarker selection with noisy mass spectrometric proteomic data	APPLICATIONS OF EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EvoWorkshops 2006	APR 10-12, 2006	Budapest, HUNGARY	EvoNet, Artpool Art Res Ctr			CANCER; SERUM; PATTERNS	Computational analysis of mass spectrometric (MS) proteomic data from sera is of potential relevance for diagnosis, prognosis, choice of therapy, and study of disease activity. To this aim, feature selection techniques based on machine learning can be applied for detecting potential biomarkes and biomaker patterns. A key issue concerns the interpretability and robustness of the output results given by such techniques. In this paper we propose a robust method for feature selection with MS proteomic data. The method consists of the sequentail application of a filter feature selection algorithm, RELIEF, followed by multiple runs of a wrapper feature selection technique based on support vector machines (SVM), where each run is obtained by changing the class label of one support vector. Frequencies of features selected over the runs are used to identify features which are robust with respect to perturbations of the data. This method is tested on a dataset produced by a specific MS technique, called MALDI-TOF MS. Two classes have been artificially generated by spiking. Moreover, the samples have been collected at different storage durations. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) applied to the resulting dataset, indicates that the proposed feature selection method is capable of identifying highly discriminatory proteomic patterns.

For this reason, machine condition monitoring has been developed to recognize incipient fault states. In this paper, the fault diagnostic problem is tackled within a neuro-fazzy approach to pattern classification. Besides the primary purpose of a high rate of correct classification, the proposed neuro-fuzzy approach aims at obtaining also a transparent classification model. To this aim, appropriate coverage and distinguishability constraints on the fuzzy input partitioning interface are used to achieve the physical interpretability of the membership functions and of the associated inference rules. The approach is applied to a case of motor bearing fault classification.

Crude rules were extracted and the corresponding dependent factors and antecedent coverage factors were calculated firstly from the diagnostic sample based on rough sets theory. Then the number of rules was used to construct partially the structure of a fuzzy neural network and those factors were implemented as initial weights, with fuzzy output parameters being optimized by genetic algorithm. Such fuzzy neural network was called KBFNN. This KBFNN was utilized to identify typical faults of rotating machinery. Diagnostic results show that it has those merits of shorter training time and higher right diagnostic level compared to general fuzzy neural networks.

A novel application is presented, exploring the potential of automatically identifying short circuits of windings that can appear during machine manufacturing and operation. Such faults are usually the result of the influence of electrodynamics forces generated during the flow of large short circuit currents, as well as of the forces occurring when the transformers or generators are transported. The early detection and classification of winding failures is of particular importance, as these kinds of defects can lead to winding damage due to overheating, imbalance, etc. Application results on investigations of windmill generator winding faults are presented. The ANN approach is proven effective in classifying faults based on features extracted by the WT.

Intensive research efforts have been focused on the signature analysis to predict or to detect electrical and mechanical faults in induction machines. Different signals can be used such as voltages, currents or stray flux. In the case of wind generators, considering that both the machine signals and the control signals are accessible for diagnostic purposes, there are interesting additional possibilities such as the use of the converter modulating voltages. In this paper, a complete system will be analyzed by suitable simulations and experimentations to deeply study fault influence and to identify the best diagnostic procedure to perform predictive maintenance. Moreover, in order to pass from classical systems to wireless equipments, a virtual platform structure will be presented.

Substantially, it can be boiled down to a pattern recognition problem. Recenty, support vector machine (SVM) becomes a hot technique in this area. When using SVM, how to simultaneously obtain the optimal feature subset and SVM parameters is a crucial problem. This study proposes a method for improving SVM performance in two aspects at one time: feature subset selection and parameter optimization. Fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO) is used to optimize both a feature subset and parameters of SVM simultaneously for predictive maintenance. Case analysis shows that this algorithm is scientific and efficient, and adapts to predictive maintenance management for any complicated equipment.

The proposed algorithm uses the stator current spectrum as inputs. By RST attribute reduction, redundant attributes are identified and removed. Then the reduction results are used as the input of SVM based classifiers to distinguish different motor conditions. A series of experiments using a three phase 1.5KW induction machine performed in different conditions are used to provide training and test data. The diagnosis results demonstrated that the solution can reduce the cost and raise the efficiency of the diagnosis.

Automatic train controller safety simulation	COMPUTERS IN RAILWAYS X: COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGN AND OPERATION IN THE RAILWAY AND OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Computer System Design and Operation in the Railway and Other Transit Systems	JUL 10-12, 2006	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	WIT Transact Built Environm		railway system; environment; safety; simulation; automation; modelling; boolean expression; microprocessor		Nowadays, we are observing an increased demand for better and safer mass transport systems. The supervision and control of these systems is made through an architecture known as Automatic Train Controller (ATC). The use of processors in ATC provides new challenges in a safety analysis. A typical railway system has a Speed-Distance Profile Generator that determines the maximum allowed speed in each track circuit. Dangerous situations are verified through the relative positioning and speeds between trains, switching machine positioning and other restrictions from operational commands generated by the ATC. Independent Safety Auditors should consider the failure modes of hardware and software in use. The safety analysis should consider alternative techniques to complete the complex task of evaluating how safe is the use of the processor and its associated software. Therefore, the use of simulation can improve and increase safety analysis, searching for fault states that could not be found in a static analysis. The main goal of this paper is to describe the development of a tool that simulates the behaviour of trains' movement in a subway system, with boolean expressions. The set of boolean expressions coordinates all the movements in a subway line and the simulation provides the possibility to find out lack of safety, considering different combinations in those boolean expressions. Another important goal is to simulate equipment faults in order to investigate problems not visible in a static analysis or even in a practical field test. Preliminary results have shown that the use of a simulator to execute boolean expressions offers a great variety of tests, allowing the detection of unsafe situations, complementing software tests validation in a final release. Through simulation, it is possible to observe the behaviour of simulated objects in specific internal points which improves the completeness in safety analysis.	[Gimenes, R. A. V.; de Almeida, J.

The diagnosis is developed by applying Bayesian networks, which qualify and quantify the cause-effect relationship among the variables of the process. The fault diagnosis is based on the on-line monitoring of variables easy to measure in the machine such as voltage, electric current, and temperature. The fault effects are based on experiments on a fault tolerant fuel cell, which are reproduced in a fuel cell model. A database of fault records is constructed from the fuel cell model, improving the generation time and avoiding permanent damage to the equipment.	[Riascos, Luis A.

They are based on the sidebands of phase current upper harmonics, and they are well suited for converter-fed induction motors. The ratios I(7-2s)f/I-5f and I(5+2s)f/I-7f are examples of such new indicators, and they are not dependent on load torque and drive inertia, as classical indicators (based on lower and upper sideband of first harmonic) do. So, the MCSA technique effectiveness is greatly improved, when applied on motors fed by low switching frequency converters (with natural harmonics) or by high switching frequency converters (with harmonic injection). Applications with grid-connected motors can be studied, too. Motor mathematical modeling was based on the multiphase symmetrical components theory; experimental work was performed by using a prototype with an appositely prepared cage, and successively method validation was achieved on other three industrial motors.

This paper focuses on a new approach for monitoring the condition of the stator insulation for failure-prone inverter-fed machines. The main concept of the proposed technique is to apply a DC and/or variable frequency AC test voltage to the stator insulation using the inverter, to perform standard off-line insulation tests whenever the motor is not operating. Two approaches for testing the insulation with minimal modifications to the inverter circuit are proposed and verified experimentally. The results show that the proposed technique provides a simple low cost solution for detecting stator insulation degradation at an early stage for reliable operation of inverter-fed machine systems, since the insulation condition can be monitored frequently. This not only helps prevent forced outages and safety risks due to insulation breakdown, but also helps perform maintenance in an efficient manner since individual motor maintenance can be prioritized and scheduled based on its present condition.

In this paper, we study the technical feasibility of detecting early symptoms and warning signs of power module degradation due to thermomechanical stress and fatigue, and developing a prognostic system that monitors the state of health of the power modules in electric, hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. A signature degradation trace of the on-voltage of IGBT modules was observed from accelerated power cycling test. This on-voltage "anomaly" can be attributed to sequential events of solder joint degradation followed by wirebond lift-off mechanisms. A quasi real-time IGBT failure prognostic algorithm based on monitoring the abnormal VCEsat variation at specific currents and temperatures is developed. The algorithm was verified using extensive SIMULINK modeling. The prognostic system can be implemented cost-effectively in existing vehicle hardware/software architectures.

Hence large time acquisition period are mandatory in order to achieve high frequency resolution. Moreover, a sharp knowledge of supply frequency and slip are required in order to monitor the spectrum lines specifically linked to electrical faults. Several research activities were aimed at retrieving algorithms to cope with the above issues. However for real-time implementation of diagnostic systems, a suitable computational cost is required. In this paper, statistical time domain techniques are used to track supply frequency and slip that features either a lower computational cost or a higher accuracy than traditional discrete Fourier transform techniques. Then, the accurate knowledge of supply frequency and slip are used to tune the parameters of the zoom-FFT algorithm that allows higher frequency resolution keeping constant the computational cost, or lower computational cost keeping constant the frequency resolution. Therefore, the proposed method allows an accurate estimation of the amplitudes of the stator current spectrum lines related to electrical faults at reduced computational cost.

In recent times, a plethora of new time-frequency distributions have appeared that are inherently suited to the analysis of non-stationary signals while offering superior frequency resolution characteristics. The Zhao-Atlas-Marks (ZAM) distribution is one such distribution. This paper proposes the use of these new time-frequency distributions to enhance non-stationary fault diagnostics in electric motors. One common myth has been that the quadratic time-frequency distributions are not suitable for commercial implementation. This paper addresses this issue in detail too. Optimal discrete time implementations of some of these quadratic time-frequency distributions are explained. These TFRs have been implemented on a digital signal processing (DSP) platform to demonstrate that the proposed methods can be implemented commercially.

However, this motor happens to present specific faults such as rotor broken bar, rotor eccentricity and/or stator winding turns defects. Some of them can be attenuated by a power segmentation. The main purpose of this paper is thus modelling of a Dual Stator Winding Induction Machine (DSWIM); this study includes stator inter-turn short circuit and rotor broken bar defects. Simulation and experimental results of this type of induction motor operating under fault demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in the monitoring of breakdowns.	[Andriamalala, R.

Different control strategies are studied, namely the direct torque control and the indirect rotor field oriented control. A detailed analysis of different motor/controller variables enlightens about the behavior of these systems under the presence of rotor faults. Numerous simulation results as well as experimental tests show the role played by parameters such as the speed loop bandwidth, reference speed of the drive, motor load level, etc., towards the choice of adequate quantities to be used as diagnostic indexes.

Detection of Rotor Faults in Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors using Adjustable Speed Drives	CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE 2006 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE, FORTY-FIRST IAS ANNUAL MEETING, VOL 1-5	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the IEEE Industry-Applications-Society (IAS)	OCT 08-12, 2006	Tampa, FL	IEEE, Ind Applicat Soc		fault diagnosis; induction motor; rotor asymmetries; electric drives	MACHINES	The need for detection of rotor faults at an earlier stage, so that maintenance can be planned ahead, has pushed the development of monitoring methods with increasing sensitivity and noise immunity. Addressing diagnostic techniques based on current signatures analysis (MCSA), the characteristic components introduced by specific faults in the current spectrum are investigated and a diagnosis procedure correlate the amplitudes of such components to the fault extent. In this paper, the impact of feedback control on asymmetric rotor cage induction machine behavior is analyzed. It is shown that the variables usually employed in diagnosis procedures assuming open-loop operation are no longer effective under closed-loop operation. Simulation results show that signals already present at the drive are suitable to effective diagnostic procedure. The utilization of the current regulator error signals and the influence of the regulators gains on their utilization in rotor failure detection are the aim of the present work. The use of a band-pass filter bank to detect the presence of sidebands is also proposed in the paper.

So far, an increase in some of the even harmonics in the field current has been reported to detect such faults. However no explanation has been provided for the cause of these harmonics. Moreover, the even harmonics can significantly increase with supply unbalance as well as time harmonics, which can lead to a serious confusion. Hence, in this study, an in-depth investigation was conducted to determine the origin of various harmonic components in the field current and their feasibility to detect stator faults. It was found that, owing to structural asymmetries of the field winding, some of these components clearly increased with stator inter-turn fault. The findings are helpful to detect faults involving few turns without ambiguity, in spite of with supply unbalance and time harmonics. Both simulation and experimental results are presented in this paper. The diagnosis results have also been verified using a rotor-mounted search-coil, which can also be used to detect even a one-turn stator fault very effectively.

The method to fault diagnosis of bearing based on EMD and envelope spectrum is presented. The methodology developed in this paper decomposes the original times series data in intrinsic oscillation modes, using the empirical mode decomposition. Then the envelope spectrum is applied to the selected intrinsic mode function (IMF) which stands for the bearing faults. The techniques are demonstrated by the experiments on a machine tool with a ball bearing under simulated crack on the inner race or outer race. The experimental results show that this method based on EMD and envelope spectrum can effectively diagnosis the faults of bearing.	[Li, H.; Zheng, H. Q.; Tang, L.

In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals such as speed-up or speed-down vibration signals effectively, the order cepstrum analysis technique is presented. This new method combines computed order tracking technique with cepstrum analysis. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then uses numerical techniques to resample the data at constant angle increments. Therefore, the vibration signals are transformed from the time domain transient signal to angle domain stationary one. In the end, the resampled signals are processed by cepstrum analysis method. The experimental results show that order cepstrum analysis can effectively diagnosis the faults of the gear crack.	[Li, H.; Zheng, H. Q.; Tang, L.

However, varying speed machinery faults detection is fraught with difficulties due to non-stationary machine vibration. Fixed time sampling cannot cope with the varying rotational frequency of the machine, resulting in increasing leakage error and spectral smearing. In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals during run-up and run-down of gears drive effectively, the angle domain average technique is combined with the continuous wavelet transform, which is applied to vibration analysis of gear for the detection of failure. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then is resampled at constant angle increments. Therefore, the time domain non-stationary signal is converted into angle domain stationary one. In the end, the resampled signals are analyzed using continuous wavelet transform. The experimental results show that the presented method can effectively diagnose the faults of the gear crack.	[Li, H.; Zhang, Y.

With a scheduled proactive maintenance program for consumables, the impact to manufacturing schedules is minimized while maintaining the ability of the tool to create "good" product, and down time due to troubleshooting is reduced. In photolithography, consumable optics provide a large opportunity for instituting this type of program, since optical degradation is very well understood having known causes such as chemical contamination, manufacturing defects and physical effects. These effects can either be reversed or compensated for via optics cleaning, parts replacement or counter-measures such as optical adjustments, optical filters, or tool modifications. Traditionally the lifetime of optics in described in terms of the number of pulses through the optic. This pulse limit is based on modeling and reflects the usage of the machine. There are several disadvantages to using this method, including unnecessarily changing parts prior to failure, or alternately, premature parts failure. Performance-based modeling can solve most issues associated with usage-based models; however, there are also challenges related to performance-based modeling that must be overcome to make the model useful. These include forecasting usage rates, degradation mode signature, and determining thresholds to allow for efficient parts ordering. Nikon has developed a preliminary model to automate performance-based forecasting that takes all of these challenges into account, and with further optimization this model can be implemented successfully providing a reduction in consumables related Cost of Ownership	Nikon Precis Inc, Belmont, CA 94002 USA		Conley, C (corresponding author), Nikon Precis Inc, 1399 Shoreway Rd, Belmont, CA 94002 USA.							0	0	0	0	0	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X		0-8194-6198-9	P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS			2006	6155						N1550	N1550	61550N	10.1117/12.659117			9	Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Instruments & Instrumentation; Optics	BEO46	WOS:000238440500021					2022-02-14

This work gives an overview of the most commonly used multivariate visualization techniques for the visualization of high dimensional data. The visualization of process dynamics in the original variable space is discussed. This work also presents visualization of data clusters in the transformed space using projection methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), class preserving projection (CPP) and methods proposed in this work based on Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), and support vector machines (SVM), as well as the discussion of the visualization of the process dynamics in the transformed low dimensional space. A rapid thermal annealing process data set is used through the paper as the example data set for comparison of various visualization techniques.

Any decision about maintenance strategies depends on their economic convenience. An important information for such decision is represented by the expected fuel saving that can be obtained by removing the anomalies. This evaluation, called prognosis, is not trivial when several anomalies take place in the plant, mainly because the anomalies change the operating conditions of all the components. An useful tool for solving this problem is the fuel impact formula formulated within the structural theory of thermoeconomics. When steam power plant are considered, this formula produces a good estimation of the expected fuel saving, thanks to the particular behaviour of the components, which efficiency slightly varies when the operating conditions do not change too much. In this paper, a prognosis procedure is proposed and applied to a system constituted by a gas turbine and a heat recovery system. The efficiency of the components considerably varies as the function of the operating conditions, which makes it an interesting test. Two anomalies are simulated in the turbine and in the heat recovery steam generator. The procedure is able to predict the fuel impact associated with the anomalies with an error lower than 5%.

For this reason, several attempts to diagnose reliably these short circuits have been made. Although considerable research has been carried out, the diagnosis of interturn short circuits is not a mature technique yet. This article presents and analyzes the online interturn short circuit diagnostic techniques developed so far for line-connected induction motors. By means of a comparative study, their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.

A clonal selection algorithm (CSA) is introduced for the first time in the literature to select optimal input features and RBF kernel parameters. CSA is shown to be capable of improving the speed and accuracy of classification systems by removing redundant and potentially confusing input features, and of optimizing the kernel parameters simultaneously. Simulation results on practice data demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed approach.

Feature extraction, including linear or nonlinear mapping technique, is efficient to estimate the intrinsic dimension of the data set, which is a key issue to machine fault diagnosis. This paper presents a novel application of feature extraction using the nonlinear mapping technique called curvilinear component analysis (CCA) for gear failure detection. In the approach high-dimensional data are nonlinearly projected toward an output space with dimension equal to the intrinsic dimension. Hence, enough information is remained to describe correctly the original data structure, and feature extraction based on CCA reduces dimensionality of the raw feature space for machine failure detection. Gearbox vibration signals measured under different operating conditions are analyzed using the technique. The results indicate that the intrinsic dimension of the data set is estimated and a 2-D subspace is extracted by the CCA technique, then the high-dimensional original feature data are projected into the 2-D space and form several clustering regions, each indicative of a specific gear condition, respectively. Thus, the gear operating conditions including normal, one cracked tooth, and one broken tooth are classified and detected clearly. It confirms that feature extraction based on the nonlinear mapping is very useful and effective for pattern recognition in mechanical fault diagnosis, and provides a good potential for applications in practice.

The proposed approach is distinguished by features and kernel parameters selection using clonal selection algorithms (CSA). It is capable of filtering out irrelevant input features, leading to improve prediction accuracy. As revealed in the experimental results, the proposed approach outperforms previous ones in both classification accuracy and computational effliciency.

However if the data are concentrated in a nonlinear subspace, PCA will fail to work well. Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) transforms the input data from the original input space into a higher dimensional feature space with the nonlinear mapping, and then uses the nonlinear principal components to realize the classification. In this paper a case of gear fault diagnosis was studied with K-PCA. The characteristic values of frequent domain from vibration signals of the gearbox under the running condition were extracted, and the KPCA method was used to classify gear crack fault. The result shows that KPCA is more effective to distinguish the state of the gear and more suitable to diagnose the gear faults in early stage.

But it is difficult to implement intelligent diagnosis because monitored information lacks logical relationship in oil monitoring. To solve this problem, the theory and method of case-based reasoning is adopted for the data processing and fault analysis in oil monitoring with an multi-agent system structure. Detailed definitions of agents in the system were proposed, and the multi-agent system framework was established finally. Multi-agent mechanism brings flexible for case based reasoning. It enhances the capability of solving complicated question in new system, and overcomes the shortcoming of the fault knowledge difficult to update in traditional systems.

Being of reasonably low differential order, it is suitable for mathematical analysis and can serve as a ground for fault detection and fault tolerant control of the IM. The modelling is performed by applying well established idealizing assumptions regarding the magnetic and electrical properties of the motor. Typical motor faults as broken rotor bars are taken into account. The model is validated against data collected from mass-produced industrial IMs. The validation shows very good agreement between simulations and experiment, for the fault considered.

If the objective is fault detection, an inappropriate execution order might reveal most faults late, thus delaying the bug fixing activity and eventually the delivery of the software. Prioritizing the test cases so as to optimize the achievement of the testing goal has potentially a positive impact on the testing costs, especially when the test execution time is long. Test engineers often possess relevant knowledge about the relative priority of the test cases. However this knowledge can be hardly expressed in the form of a global ranking or scoring. In this paper, we propose a test case prioritization technique that takes advantage of user knowledge through a machine learning algorithm, Case-Based Ranking (CBR). CBR elicits just relative priority information from the user, in the form of pair wise test case comparisons. User input is integrated with multiple prioritization indexes, in an iterative process that successively refines the test case ordering. Preliminary results on a case study indicate that CBR overcomes previous approaches and, for moderate suite size, gets very close to the optimal solution.

A new algorithm for the detection of faults in permanent magnet machines	IECON 2006 - 32ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society	NOV 07-10, 2006	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc				Most condition monitoring techniques are based on steady state analysis. However, machines typically operate under transient conditions thus prompting the development of non-stationary fault detection techniques. In this paper, the steady state analysis technique (Motor Current Signature Analysis) is extended to a new non-stationary fault detection technique to detect several different faults in a low-voltage high current PMSM. It will be shown that the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) technique cannot be applied directly to machines operating under transient conditions. The new technique, which is based on an adaptive algorithm capable of extracting non-stationary sinusoids, is able to extract fault information during transient operation of the machine.

This approach uses instantaneous power as a medium for fault detection. A multi-resolution instantaneous power decomposition based on wavelet transform provides the different frequency bands whose energies are affected directly by the broken bar fault. Actually, the instantaneous power has low frequency components which are difficult to localize in the frequency domain analysis unless there is a long signal acquisition of current and voltage. By the wavelet transform, the study of energy related to the low frequency band is free of noise and improves the fault diagnosis without having the slip information. This can be especially useful when the induction machine is not fully loaded. In this paper, it is shown that for these reasons the wavelet approach applied to instantaneous power is superior to the frequency domain in the case of one and three broken bars for a three-phase squirrel cage induction machine.

Different signals can be used: voltage, current and flux. The characteristic frequency research by a current spectral analysis is a well-known method widely used. This method is valid when the motor is supplied by the three-phase main network. However nowadays, in industrials applications, the asynchronous motors are more and more supplied by converters, in particular for variable speed. The current spectral analysis is almost not exploitable because of appearance of multiple harmonics of the commutation frequency. This paper presents a diagnosis method applied to A set "converter-machine-load". This method is based on pattern recognition approach. The use of the data standardization makes it possible to free from the level of load and thus to represent an operating mode by only one class. This fact allows decreasing the number of initial data necessary to the training phase and improving the final diagnosis.

This method is composed of two sequential processes: a feature extraction and a classification. In the process features extraction, the time-frequency representation (TFR) have been designed for maximizing the separability between classes representing the different faults; bearing fault, stator fault and rotor fault. The classification of a new signal is based on the Mahalanobis distance. The diagnosis is independent from the level of load. This method is validated on an 5.5 kW asynchronous motor test bench.

This type of test is useful especially for the maintenance purpose when it is possible to remove the load and supply effects. In this case, the current in rotor side decrease by its time constant and the spectrum induced in a search coil around the induction machine is analyzed with a time-frequency method allowing the rotor faults detection. The broken rotor bar effect is analyzed in the induced stator voltage spectrum too, but the experimental results show that its sensitivity is weak with respect to the given by the search coil induced voltage spectrum.

Therefore, motor monitoring incipient fault detection and diagnosis are important topics. This paper presents a method for on-line induction motor monitoring with the purpose of detecting and locating a single rotor broken bar. The method avoids any frequency analysis and observes instead the machine state with the help of the two models. The torque difference between the two models indicates a fault. The technique utilizes input signals from standard transducers. An experimental setup has been constructed to implement the new technique in on-line model.

Certainly the importance of induction machine by itself justify several research works on fault detection. Most of research works deal with three-phase induction machines. This work gives attention to stator fault detection in double winding three-phase machine, which can be seen as a six-phase induction machine. As a result it is shown how to exploit the six-phase model approach to detect fault as well as to better understand the physical behavior of the short-circuits in double winding induction machines. Experimental results coming from doubles star induction machines prototype systems confirm the good behavior of adopted modelling.	[da Silva, C. R.; Correa, M. B. R.; Jacobina, C. B.; Lima, A. M.

The state space model is derived from the voltage equations of stator and rotor. The bilinear behaviour of induction machines and its influence on the state space model is discussed. An open loop model suffers from model and parameter uncertainty. A closed loop observer is shown to greatly reduce these effects. Observer pole placement is mentioned. Feeding back rotor currents only, the observer becomes independent from stator current measurements. The resulting free residuals can be used for sensor fault detection. The observer is validated by laboratory experiment.

The model is based on the multiplied coupled circuit approach. The inductances calculation is performed thanks to an extension in 2-D of the modified winding function approach (eMWFA), which is able to take into account the space harmonics in addition to the effects of rotor bar skewing and to the linear rise of MMF across the slots. One have to note that an appropriate extension of this model can consider the stator winding faults in presence of broken rotor bars or static, dynamic or axial eccentricity. It is shown that the inter-turn short circuit gives rise to some spectral components witch appear in the current line spectrum. Some experimental tests validate these results and confirm the presence of other components due to several phenomenons cited in previous works.

Monitoring of static and dynamic air gap eccentricity of inverter fed induction machine drives	IECON 2006 - 32ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society	NOV 07-10, 2006	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc			DIAGNOSIS; FAULTS; MOTOR	The detection of eccentricity in modern ac drives is difficult under mains operation. At high dynamic inverter-fed operation it then becomes extremely challenging. The only industrially accepted method so far is the usage of the vibration spectrum obtained from extensive measurements. In this paper the influence of airgap asymmetry on the transient reactance of the machine is investigated. It is shown how the transient stimulation of the machine by the inverter can be used to determine even small changes of the transient reactances. Besides the stimulation of the machine with a specific switching sequence of the inverter, methods for a sophisticated excitation integrated into a PWM are described. Measurements of static as well as dynamic eccentricity are given to show not only the accuracy of the method, but especially the dynamic performance in tracking the time trace of the position of the eccentricity. Using the described method tracking is also possible at standstill of the drive where spectrum based methods deteriorate in their performance.

A great on line monitoring would provide fault diagnosis, optimal use and quality management. However, diagnosis is, until today, mainly based on vibration analysis and/or motor current signature analysis (weel known as MCSA). This paper presents a new approach in the whole electrical drive diagnosis thought original measurements.

Each of these methods is based on different concepts of power spectral estimation: non-parametric, parametric and eigenvalue decomposition, respectively. The frequency resolution, variance and detection capability are different for each method according to the set of parameters used. The paper also aims to determine which method is best suited for the implementation in automated fault detection systems. The evaluation is based on the sampled current taken on a prototype machine running under different load and faulty conditions. The effect of the main parameters of each method on the capacity to detect faults is also evaluated and compared. The comparison is performed considering the ability to discriminate fault related frequencies in the corresponding power spectrum. Different window types, window length, overlap and sampling frequency were analyzed and compared.

For this purpose, we used a Wiener filter to decrease the dynamics of the 50 Hz and to increase the frequencies associated to the mechanical load. Thus, we could detect the presence of a ball defect. This result is corroborated by an envelope analysis of the vibratory signals. The suggested method exploits the cyclostationarity of electrical signals (voltage and current) via their cyclic statistics to resynchronize the signals according to the electrical cycle (50 Hz) in order to recover frequency fluctuations. We then estimate the Wiener filter which is highly adapted to our application in order to obtain a signal corresponding to the electrical part only, which allows extracting the mechanical part on the measured current. An experimental result, in the presence of fault in rolling element bearings, illustrates the high performance of the proposed method.

That is, the vibration generated by industrial machines always contains nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Many analysis methods in current use are optimal for Gaussian and linear models but are suboptimal when the problem is one of analysing non-stationary, non-linear and non-Gaussian signals. Focusing on the defects of different joint time-frequency representations, the analysis of transient vibration signals is considered using Wigner higher-order based time-frequency distributions in this paper. The Wigner higherorder moment spectra (WHOS), which are the extensions of the Wigner-Ville distribution(WVD) to higherorder moment spectra domains, can describe the higher-order moment spectral characteristics from the time domain and the frequency domain simultaneourly. The simulation case show that this technique has high time-frequency resolution and reduced interference terms.

To motivate this research, it is explained and illustrated with experimental results why fault signatures from nonouter-race defects (e.g., inner-race defects) can be less salient than those from outef-race defects. Then, a signal model is presented for the production and propagation of an inner-race fault signature; this model is then used to design an inner-race fault-detection scheme. This scheme examines machine-vibration spectra for peaks with phase-coupled sidebands occurring at a spacing predicted by the model. The proficiency of this fault-detection scheme at detecting inner-race bearing faults is then experimentally verified with results from 12 bearings representing varying degrees of fault severity.

In this paper, we use a wearable tri-axial accelerometer to capture the movement data of human body, and propose a novel fall detection method based on one-class support vector machine (SVM). The one-class SVM model is trained by the positive samples from the falls of younger volunteers and a dummy, and the outliers from the non-fall daily activities of younger and the elderly volunteers. The preliminary results show that this method can detect the falls effectively, and reduce the probability of being damaged in the experiments for the elderly people.

Fault detection and monitoring of length loop control system in pickling process	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MODELLING, CONTROL & AUTOMATION JOINTLY WITH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT AGENTS, WEB TECHNOLOGIES & INTERNET COMMERCE, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Modelling, Control and Automation/International Conference on Intelligent Agents Web Technologies and International Commerce	NOV 28-30, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol, European Neural Network Soc, Int Assoc Fuzzy Set Management & Econ, Japan Soc Fuzzy Theory & Intelligent Informat, Taiwan Fuzzy Syst Assoc, World Wide Web Business Intelligence, Hungarian Fuzzy Assoc, Univ Canberra				Modern manufacturing facilities are large scale, highly complex, and operate with large number of variables under closed loop control. Early and accurate fault detection and diagnosis for these plants can minimise down time, increase the safety of plant operations, and reduce manufacturing costs. Fault detection and isolation is more complex particularly in the case of the faulty analog control systems. Analog control system are not equipped with monitoring function where the process parameters are continually visualised. We consider in this paper an approach to fault detection and isolation in the pickling process in cold rolling. The fault appeared on one of the power unit driving a rotary machine, this machine can not track a reference speed given by another machine. Using a computerised data acquisition system, the main machine parameters have been monitored. The fault has been detected and isolated on basis of analysis of monitored data. Normal and faulty situation have been obtained by an artificial neural network (ANN) model which is implemented to simulate the normal and faulty status of rotary machine.

The Shannon entropy of CWT coefficients in each scale is calculated in order to detect the characteristic trends of the CMM measurement data efficiently. This method is successfully implemented in a body-in-white (BIW) assembly for the detection of periodic trends in coordinate measure machine (CMM) data. It would contribute to main cause location in BIW quality control. The principle of the CWT and the property of the periodic trend after the CWT are explained from a mathematical viewpoint. An actual quality-control case is analyzed using the CWT method. Consistency between the results and the actual situation proves the effectiveness of this CWT method.

The ultrasonic signals measured on these materials contain echoes which are very similar to fault echoes. These echoes arise from grains which are contained in the material. For the detection of flaws various methods for suppressing echoes from grains have to be used. In this work we used the method for filtering ultrasonic signals based on discrete wavelet transform. For the classification of ultrasonic signals in A-scan we used a pattern recognition method called support vector machines. In this study we classify signals with fault echoes, echo from weld and back-wall echo. Ultrasonic signals were measured on materials used for constructing aeroplane engines. The experimental results indicate the performance of the proposed approach.

Various mechanical defects of rotary machines can be reflected in altered acoustic signatures. The proposed method is based on the psychoacoustic modelling of human auditory perception. For the purpose of machine fault detection, the gammatone filterbank is applied in the preprocessing of acoustic signals. Filtered signals are then rectified and features are calculated as mean values of rectified signals. A set of features represents an extracted machine signature. The machine states are evaluated by comparing the extracted signature with the database of previously collected machine signatures. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study where the quality of commercially produced compressors is estimated. Results show that major faults that occur in a production can be reliably detected.

Therefore the change of operation mode from grid connection to stand alone allows for uninterruptible supply of a selected part of grid connected load. However, in the stand alone operation mode the superior controllers should provide fixed amplitude and frequency of the generated voltage in spite of the load nature. Moreover, a soft transition from grid connection mode to stand alone operation requires that, the mains outage detection method must be applied. A grid voltage recovery requires change of the generator operational mode from stand alone to grid connection. However, the protection of a load from rapid change of the supply voltage phase is necessary. This may be achieved by synchronization of the generated and grid voltages and controllable soft connection of the generator to the grid. The paper presents the transients of controllable soft connection and disconnection to the grid of the variable speed doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) power system. A description of the mains outage detection methods for the DFIG is based on the grid voltage amplitude and frequency measurement and comparison with a standard values. Also an angle controller, between generated and grid voltages, for synchronization process is described. The short description of the sensorless Direct Voltage Control of the autonomous doubly fed induction generator (ADFIG) is presented. All the presented methods are proved based on PSIM simulation software and in a laboratorial conditions and the oscillograms with a test results are presented in the paper. A 2.2kW slip-ring induction machine was applied as a generator and 3.5kW DC motor was used as a primary mover to speed adjusting. A switching and sampling frequencies are equal to 8kHz. For filtering the switching frequency distortions in the output voltage external capacitances equal to 21uF per phase are connected to the stator. The control algorithm is implemented in a DSP controller build on a floating point ADSP-21061 with an Altera/FPGA support.

In this paper, a new strategy based on improved binary tree is proposed to solve diagnosis problem in blast furnace. According to the relations of categories in multi-class problem, it is needless to distinguish all the sorts. In order to improve classification efficiency, we take out the flimsy relatively support vectors in the proceeding of identifying, and then construct a new binary tree without flimsy branches by defining similarities between every two sorts. Compared with different multi-class classification algorithm, the simulation results show this algorithm keeps testing accuracy and proves better performance on identification efficiency and speed.

Output voltage signals of push-pull circuits under faulty conditions are obtained with simulation. Then wavelet coefficients of output voltage signals are gained by wavelet decomposition, and faulty feature vectors are extracted from coefficients. After training multi-class LS-WSVM by faulty feature vectors, the LS-WSVM classifiers of the circuit fault diagnosis system are built. The simulation result shows the fault diagnosis method of the push-pull circuits with multi-class LS-WSVM is effective.

A clonal selection algorithm (CSA) based encoding technique is applied to improve the accuracy of classification, which demonstrated in the literature for the first time. With features and RBF kernel parameters selection to predict incipient fault of power transformer improve the accuracy of classification systems and the generalization performance. The proposed approach is distinguished by removing redundant input features that may be confusing the classifier and optimizing the selection of kernel parameters. Simulation results of practice data demonstrate the effectiveness and high efficiency of the proposed approach, which makes operation faster and also increases the accuracy of the classification.

Indeed, software metrics provide a quantitative approach allowing the control and the improvement of the development process including the maintenance. The ISO/IEC international standard (14598) on software product quality states, "Internal metrics are of little value unless there is evidence that they are related to external quality". Many empirical prediction models are presented in the literature; their goal is to investigate the relationship between internal metrics and external qualities, in order to assess software quality. In this paper, we explore different machine-learning (ML) algorithms provided by an open source data-mining environment. We analyse their capacities to produce accurate and usable predictive models.

Hence, when a performance problem occurs in such environments, it is critical that the health monitoring software identifies the root cause with minimal delay. A technique commonly used for isolating root causes is rule definition, which involves specifying combinations of events that cause particular problems. However, such predefined rules (or problem signatures) tend to be inflexible, and crucially depend on domain experts for their definition. We present in this paper a method that automatically generates change point based problem signatures using administrator feedback, thereby removing the dependence on domain experts. The problem signatures generated by our method are flexible, in that they do not require exact matches for triggering, and adapt as more information becomes available. Unlike traditional data mining techniques, where one requires a large number of problem instances to extract meaningful patterns, our method requires few fault instances to learn problem signatures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by learning problem signatures for five common problems that occur in enterprise systems and reliably recognizing these problems with a small number of learning instances.

Understanding the dynamic response of this system requires factors affecting performance, conceived as a function of the throughput, degradative efficiency and lysosomal membrane stability, to be defined and quantified. A previous carbon/nitrogen flux model has been augmented by separately identifying lysosomal 'target' material (autophagocytosed or endocytosed proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and 'internal' material (digestive enzymes and lipid membrane components). Additionally, the whole cell's energetic costs for maintaining lysosomal pH and production of these internal components have been incorporated, as has the potentially harmful effect of generation of lipofuscin on the transitory and semi-permanent lysosomal constituents. Inclusion of the three classes of nutrient organic compounds at the whole cell level allows for greater range in the simulated response, including deamination of amino acids to provide molecules as a source of energy, as well as controlling nitrogen and carbon concentrations in the cytosol. Coupled with a more functional framework of pollutant driven reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant defence, the separate and combined effects of three stressors (nutritional quality, nutrient quantity and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [PAH-phenanthrene]) on the digestive cell are simulated and compare favourably with real data.

The overall challenge is developing suitable concepts and methods which can describe and predict distortion of a workpiece along the entire process chain. The objective to control distortion is to determine the mechanisms of distortion from the basic material up to the finished component part. Because of the complexity of the production chain of component parts, not all relationships between cause and effect are known so far. Therefore, manufacturers of component parts do not have continuous planning possibilities along the process chain to guarantee that the chosen material and the manufacturing steps lead to little distortion after the last process step quenching. A solution for this problem may be a prognosis model for distortion along the process chain in order to support the planning process. The inputs of this model should be indicators in terms of significant input parameters which are able to predict distortion. Current elaborations of how far indicators can be used for predicting distortion are presented by the example of the production of hearing rings in the SFB 570.

J	Zhan, YM; Makis, V; Jardine, AKS				Zhan, YM; Makis, V; Jardine, AKS			Adaptive state detection of gearboxes under varying load conditions based on parametric modelling	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; LOCAL FAULT-DETECTION; MESHING VIBRATION; TOOTH FAILURE; GEAR; PHASE; DIAGNOSIS; AMPLITUDE; WAVELET; CRACKS	Conventional vibration monitoring techniques are unable to provide accurate state analysis of a gearbox under varying load condition. This paper proposes a novel technique for state detection of gearbox, which fits a time-varying autoregressive model to the gear motion residual signals applying a noise-adaptive Kalman filter, in the healthy state of the target gear. The optimum autoregressive model order, which provides a compromised model fitting for the healthy gear motion residual signals collected under various load conditions, is determined with the aid of a specific model order selection method proposed in this study. Consequently, a robust statistical measure, which takes the percentage of outliers exceeding the three standard deviation limits is applied to evaluate the state of the target gear, where the standard deviation of autoregressive model residuals takes its maximum in all tested gear motion residual signals for model order selection. The proposed technique is validated using full lifetime vibration data of gearboxes operating from new to failure under four distinct load conditions. The investigated load conditions include: (1) constant load, (2) one jump from 100 to 200% nominal torque level, (3) one jump from 100 to 300% nominal torque level, and (4) constant changed to sinusoidal. In each application, the specific model order selection and comparison of the proposed gear state indicator with three counterparts proposed in recent studies are addressed in detail. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is also performed as a complementary statistical analysis. The results show that the proposed technique possesses a highly effective and robust property in the state detection of gearbox, which is independent of varying load condition as well as remarkable stability, early alarm for incipient fault and significant presence of fault effects.

J	Gai, GH				Gai, GH			The processing of rotor startup signals based on empirical mode decomposition	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						rotor startup signals; empirical mode decomposition; bode diagram; fault diagnosis		In this paper, we applied empirical mode decomposition method to analyse rotor startup signals, which are non-stationary and contain a lot of additional information other than that from its stationary running signals. The methodology developed in this paper decomposes the original startup signals into intrinsic oscillation modes or intrinsic modes function (IMFs). Then, we obtained rotating frequency components for Bode diagrams plot by corresponding IMFs, according to the characteristics of rotor system. The method can obtain precise critical speed without complex hardware support. The low-frequency components were extracted from these IMFs in vertical and horizontal directions. Utilising these components, we constructed a drift locus of rotor revolution centre, which provides some significant information to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Also, we proved that empirical mode decomposition method is more precise than Fourier filter for the extraction of low-frequency component. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of these approaches have traditionally been based on linear modeling techniques, which restricts the type of practical situations that can be modeled. Recently, many learning based non linear modeling using neural and other on-line approximation models have been developed. This paper presents a learning based stochastic methodology for constructing automated fault detection and diagnosis architecture for Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR). The main idea behind our approach is to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). By applying off-line training procedures, different fault models may be constructed using only system measurements. Based on these models, on-line fault diagnosis may be achieved. A Maximum Likelihood approach is used for fault detection. Some practical aspects of the different algorithms are discussed and simulation results using Scilab are presented.

Two models for outcome prediction - A comparison of logistic regression and neural networks	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						artificial neural network; regression; benchmaking; prognosis; stroke	ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; PROGNOSTIC MODELS; EXTERNAL VALIDATION; CLASSIFICATION; VARIABLES; SELECTION; TRIALS; ERRORS; SCALE; RISK	Objectives: Accurately predicting disease progress from a set of predictive variables is an important aspect of clinical work. For binary outcomes, the classical approach is to develop prognostic logistic regression (LR) models. Alternatively, machine learning algorithms were proposed with artificial neural networks (ANN) having become popular over the lost decades. Although some studies have compared predictive accuracies of LR and ANN models, some concerns regarding their methodological quality have been voiced. Our comparison has the advantage of being based on two large independent data sets allowing for elaborate model development and independent validation. Methods: From the German Stroke Database, a learning data set including 1754 prospectively recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke was used. Utilizing LR and ANN, two prognostic models were developed predicting restitution of functional independence and survival after 100 days. The resulting models were applied to classify 1470 patients with acute ischemic stroke; this test data set was collected independently from the learning data. Error fractions in the test data were determined, and differences in error fractions between the algorithms were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Results: For most prognostic models, error fractions in test data were below 40%. There was no difference between the algorithms except for the model predicting completely versus incompletely restituted or deceased patients (difference in error fractions = 4.01% [2.10-5.96%], p = 0.0001). Conclusions: The conscientiously applied LR remains the gold standard for prognostic modelling; however, ANN can be an alternative automated "quick and easy" multivariate analysis.

This is a pattern recognition problem and a condition monitoring system based on a hybrid of neural network and hidden Markov model (HMM) is proposed in this paper. Neural network realizes dimensionality reduction for Lipschitz exponent functions obtained from vibration data as input features and hidden Markov model is used for condition classification. The machinery condition can be identified by selecting the corresponding HMM which maximizes the probability of a given observation sequence. In the end, the proposed method is validated using gearbox vibration data.

A Multi-Agent System (MAS) based model for the predictive maintenance system of hydropower plant within the framework of Intelligent Control-Maintenance-Management System (ICMMS) is proposed. All maintenance activities, form data collection through the recommendation of specific maintenance actions, are integrated into the system. In this model, the predictive maintenance system composed of four layers: Signal Collection, Data Processing, Diagnosis and Prognosis, and Maintenance Decision-Making. Using this model a prototype of predictive maintenance for hydropower plant is established. Artificial Neural-Network (NN) is successfully applied to monitor, identify and diagnosis the dynamic performance of the prototype system online.

Development of novel tools for the diagnosis and prognosis of pheochromocytoma using peptide marker immunoassay and gene expression profiling approaches	PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Symposium on Pheochromocytoma	OCT 20-23, 2005	Bethesda, MD	NIH		chromogranin A; expression profiling; markers; peptide; secretogranin II; pheochromocytoma	II-DERIVED PEPTIDE; ADRENAL-GLANDS; PITUITARY; IDENTIFICATION; TUMORS	Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) are rare catecholamine-producing neoplasias that arise from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or from extra-adrenal locations. These neuroendocrine tumors are usually benign, but may also present as or develop into a malignancy. There are currently no means to predict or to cure malignant tumors which have a poor prognosis. We have recently validated several assays for the measurement of peptides derived from chromogranin A (CgA) and secretogranin 11 (SgII) in order to determine whether these secreted neuroendocrine products could provide useful, complementary markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of PHEOs. Both the CgA-derived peptide WE14 and the SgII-derived peptide EM66 proved to be sensitive circulating markers for the diagnosis of PHEO. In addition, much higher EM66 levels were measured in benign than in malignant tumoral tissues, suggesting that this peptide could represent a valuable tool for the prognosis of PHEO. We have also initiated a comparative microarray study of benign and malignant PHEOs, which allowed the identification of a set of about 100 genes that were differentially expressed and best discriminated the two types of tumors. A large majority of these genes were expressed at lower levels in the malignant disease and were associated with various characteristics of chromaffin cells, such as hormone secretion signaling and machinery, peptide maturation, and cellular morphology. Altogether, these studies provide novel tools for the management of PHEO, and new insights for the understanding of tumorigenesis in chromaffin cells, which may offer potential therapeutic strategies.

Integrating two or more reasoning techniques becomes a trend in developing intelligent diagnosis. In this paper we discuss the intelligent diagnosis problems and propose a diagnosis architecture for composite systems, which combines rule-based diagnosis and model-based diagnosis. These two diagnosis programs not only work efficiently with machine learning in different stages of the fault diagnosis process, but also efficiently improve the process by making the best use of their individual advantages.

The observer is applied to identify and estimate various faults of bearing to gain fault state residual sequence while the classifier is used to classify multiple fault modes of bearings. Also, the algorithms constructing observer and classifier are discussed and reasoned.

Current methods rely on the response of the machine to unbalance excitation and are mainly based on pattern recognition approaches. However these methods are relatively insensitive and the crack must be large before it can be robustly detected. Active magnetic bearings (AMB) have been used in high speed applications or where oil contamination must be prevented, although their low load capacity restricts the scope of applications. Recently AMBs have been proposed as an actuator to apply force to the shaft of a machine. The presence of the crack generates responses containing frequencies at combinations of the rotor spin speed and applied force. This paper discusses some of the issues to be addressed to enable this approach to become a robust condition monitoring technique for cracked shafts. The approach is illustrated with a number of simulated examples.	[Penny, John E.

An AutoRegressive (AR)-based condition monitoring algorithm was developed and tested on both a fault-free and a pump with an implanted ceramic bearing with an inner race defect at the High Vacuum (HV) end. The investigation provided some in-depth understanding of the effects of different operating conditions such as speed and load on the vibration of the pump. The first key step in the fault detection scheme was accurate determination of the running speed of the pump. It was observed that the rotating speed of the pump's rotor shaft on which the bearing case was directly connected to was often less than the set speed of the pump due to rotor slip. The second step was envelope demodulation of the time domain vibration signals where the resonance excited by the fault-induced impacts was identified and the vibration signal were bandpass filtered around the resonant peak. The third step is spectral estimation using parametric-based method of AR modelling. The advantage of the AR method is that it can work with smaller sample sizes and sampling rates compared to the more traditional approach of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and achieve far superior resolution capabilities. The analysis results showed that the effect of actual speed was predominant in the detection of bearing faults as this was the speed that was used in the calculations of the bearing defect frequencies and had to be determined very accurately. Initial results show that the fault diagnostic scheme is very promising and the bearing fault could be accurately determined at all speeds.

Dynamic modelling and testing of a representative aeroengine test rig with adjustable nonlinear bearing supports	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2006: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-8			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA2006)	SEP 18-20, 2006	Louvain, BELGIUM	Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			HARMONIC-BALANCE METHOD	A representative model of aero-engine test rig has been built, comprising the following basic components: rotor, shaft, casing, flexible support structure and bearing housings. One of the bearing housings is designed in such a way that the stiffness along one radial direction is adjustable, and can be set between linear and strongly nonlinear. In the latter case, it has the characteristic of snap-through springs, which is somewhat analogous to some magnetic bearing configurations. The adjustability of the bearing support stiffness makes it possible to study the dynamic properties of an engine rig with different boundary conditions. A notable aspect of this test rig is that all the major flexibilities in an operating aero-engine have been included, e.g. flexible support structure, casing etc. In the field of structural dynamics, mathematical models are widely used, especially at the design stage of a product when the effect of physical modifications on the total dynamic response of the structure is required before the real fabrication is carried out. In addition, highly accurate and efficient structural mathematical models are required for the emerging SMART machine concept, in which real-time machine diagnosis and prognosis methods demand fast and accurate decision-making based on the results of data processed using those models. The problem we are facing now is that, as the structure becomes more complicated, and consists of more segments and joints, many of which can be strongly nonlinear, the accuracy and efficiency of the mathematical model deteriorates rapidly due to the difficulties in modelling the joints and the nonlinearities existing in those joints. In this paper, a Frequency Response Function (FRF) coupling scheme, together with the Multi-Harmonic Balance Method (MHBM), is used to model the assembled test rig. The basic FRF coupling method has been well documented and its accuracy and efficiency in linear structure assemblies has been recognised in many papers and books. MHBM is widely used to solve nonlinear problems in the frequency domain. The advantage of this combined methodology is shown in the comparison between test and simulation results.

The causes for processing errors (error sources) are mainly from lathe, cutter, jig and work pieces. That is to say, each part of the craft system may produce the processing errors. The relationship knowledge database between, the error causes in process (error source) and the expression form of error in process (processing errors) is the content of this knowledge database. In this paper, the expert system and artificial intelligence are used for error sources analysis and diagnosis in machining process. Based on analyzing errors produced in the process, the paper measure and find out several errors exceeding standard and confirm possible error sources tentatively according to these errors, then, approach and get rid of possible error sources, measure other error sources to check whether errors exist, get rid of and verify further to the error sources, circulate in this term, finally, verify it, the cause of machining error can be gained.

This new technique measures the surface potential due to an A C current flowing in the sample via capacitive coupling. The more resistive the material the easier it is to create a measurable potential gradient. This makes the method particularly suitable for composites such as carbon fibre or ceramic based materials where conventional techniques are less effective. We present initial results for samples of stainless steel with machined faults on the reverse side. It is envisaged that in many cases this would be used in conjunction with other techniques in a data fusion system for example with eddy current sensing to provide complementary data. Such multi-sensor systems would enhance the probability of fault detection while at the same time reducing the number of false positive responses.

The paper starts with a brief review of the model-based approach, including model development, residual generation and fault detection and diagnosis. The applicability of this approach to rotation machinery is then considered. In order to overcome difficulties arising from phase shift and random measurements, the statistical performance of the vibration of rotation machinery is analysed in both time and frequency domains. A consistence model is developed using stochastic process theory. After model validation, the model-based approach is implemented in AC motor fault detection. The residual is generated by comparing the new measurement and the model prediction, by both subtraction and division. Fault detection results prove that the model-based approach is applicable to fault feature extraction for rotation machinery in the frequency domain.

Output layer's weights are modified with multi layer perceptron (MLP) policy. This learning method is applied to two systems as case studies. First one is the monitoring of industrial machine where the results are compared with other training methods such as MLP or Radial Basis Function (RBF). Oil analysis data is used for condition monitoring. The data is gathered by using ten stages technique. The second one is the Stock prediction where the data are highly nonlinear and normally unpredictable especially when the markets are affected by political facts. The simulation results are analyzed and compared with other methods.	Univ Tabriz, Fac ECE, Tabriz, Iran		Khanmohammadi, S (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac ECE, Tabriz, Iran.

Model-based identification of a shaft bow caused by rubs in the generator of a power unit	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH BIENNIAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING SYSTEMS DESIGN AND ANALYSIS, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Biennial ASME Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis	JUL 04-07, 2006	Turin, ITALY	ASME		diagnostics; fault identification; rotor-to-stator rubs; vibrations		The dynamic behavior of rotating machines due to faults can be simulated with model-based methods in which the faults are modelled with suitable sets of equivalent excitations. When rotor-to-stator rubs occur the friction forces can cause timevarying thermal bows of the shafts. The equivalent bending moments that cause the shaft bows can be estimated with model-based identification methods developed in the frequency domain: these techniques minimize the error between the machine experimental vibrations induced by the rubs and the system response provided by the simulating model. In this paper the results of the analysis of the experimental vibrations of a large turbine-generator unit that was subjected to partial-arc rubs are shown and discussed along with the diagnostic strategy used to identify the fault severity and the location of the shaft cross-sections where the heaviest rubs occurred. Comparisons between experimental data and simulated vibrations caused by the identified fault are shown.

The Hidden Markov Models - HMM - technique has been used to create quasi-stationary and stationary models and to take advantages of the multiple sensor data acquisition architecture. At first, Markov models for diagnostics have been defined. The main advantage of the HMMs approach is that all vibration raw data measured by a multisensor architecture can be used without any preprocessing. An effort to adapt the HMMs technique to the prognostic issue has also been carried out. To create Markov Models suitable for prognostics, the Viterbi Algorithm has been used to define the best sequence of model states and to optimize residual useful lifetime computation. Finally, experimental results are discussed, which encourage further research efforts according to the proposed approach.

Increasing readiness costs are severely impacting acquisition of new aircraft, which translates to an increase in the average age of the United States Air Force, Navy and Army aircraft fleet. As time marches on, this undesirable trend will become more and more difficult to overcome. It would be unwise to expect congress to increase the defense budget in the near future to overcome this dilemma. Hence, as the current aircraft fleets continue to age this problem will only get worse. A revolutionary paradigm shift must take place to reverse the aircraft sustainment demand for funding. Prognosis based asset management can go a long way towards reversing the operating cost trend. When applied to aircraft engines, prognosis based asset management may allow the services to reach cost of ownership entitlement as well as achieve significant safety and readiness improvements. This revolutionary change in engine management will employ condition (or state) based component lifing and inspections (verses the current hard time inspections limits). Instead of operating to fixed intervals, based on engine health, the component will dictate when the optimal inspection should occur. In other words, a sensor will determine when the engine needs to be inspected. This includes all nondestructive evaluation, borescope activities, component replacement and depot maintenance work. The concept of engine health management (EHM) has been an interesting topic for several years. The Navy explored prognosis and mechanical diagnostics in the early 70's for the F-8 and A-7 applications (1). Various limitations such as engine controller, storage, limited computing capacity / capabilities have prevented this from moving forward. Significant advances in both computing power and sensor technology now make it possible to obtain real time engine information and to make EHM a reality on an engine-by-engine basis. Obtaining flight-by-flight usage parameter information will provide the foundation for robust diagnostics as well as engine prognostics and allow real time fault tree analysis and near real time damage accumulation calculations. Once this information is available, engine prognosis can provide predictive capability for the health of engine components, appropriate inspection intervals and maintenance activities providing a substantial long-range cost avoidance opportunity for the DoD sustainment budget. Current fleet management capability is constrained by uncertainty in the current state of the individual aircraft engines. The ability to sense or measure the damage state of an individual part is limited at best. Further, specific part operational severity is not captured with the current lifing process, hence many components are not operating to their life entitlement because the life is based on fleet weighted average missions. Unlike the fixed interval inspections currently being performed, precise assessment is required for condition-based lifing. The key considerations in this new assessment process are 1) the fidelity of the analysis tools and 2) the definition of the boundary conditions (or environmental conditions used by the analysis tools) 3) improved understanding of diagnostics and engine faults and a better troubleshooting tool.

In order to meet these needs for next generation engines, dedicated prognostic algorithms must be developed that are capable of operating in an autonomous and real-time engine health management system software architecture that is distributed in nature. This envisioned prognostic and health management system should allow engine-level reasoners to have visibility and insight into the results of local diagnostic and prognostic technologies implemented down at the LRU and subsystem levels. To accomplish this effectively requires an integrated suite of prognostic technologies that can be applied to critical engine systems and can capture fault/failure mode propagation and interactions that occur in these systems, all the way up through the engine and eventually vehicle level. In the paper, the authors will present a generic set of selected prognostic algorithm approaches that can be applied to gas turbine engines, as well as provide an overview of the required reasoning architecture needed to integrate the prognostic information across the engine.

This paper gives an overview of a suite of FUMS (TM) algorithms that have been successfully developed for gas turbine applications and validated using a large volume of engine data. The system has been used to analyse both airborne acquired data and ground test-bed data. The system algorithms have been targeted at evaluating the following: stresses of compressor components, thermal transient stresses of turbine components, fatigue, Total Accumulated Cycles (TAC), engine vibration, neural network based performance/degradation and, Usage Indices (UIs) that summarise engine parameters and at the same time indicate the life/condition of engine components. By operating on data from the same engine on two test-beds, the system can be used to normalise the engine vibration and reconcile any differences in vibration-based acceptance/rejection criteria; these differences can result in the acceptance of an engine for on-wing operation at one site and the rejection of the engine at another site. The paper also gives an overview of the FUMS (TM) intelligent management software, which has allowed the MOD to plug-in 3rd party applications. In this way, MOD can evaluate, verify and procure engine technologies developed by various suppliers and build engine applications from these technologies without the need for software re-writing.

These systems provide significant benefits for trending shifts in engine performance and diagnosing system degradation that requires some maintenance action. However, this approach may be limited in the ability to uniquely identify damage for select components and failure modes. Advanced prognostic systems are being developed to work symbiotically with state of the art diagnostic techniques in use today; these advanced systems use advanced material and component damage evolution modelling linked with system-level structural analyses to intelligently guide the health management system to search for specific signatures that would be expected from key changes in component and system health [ 1,2,3,4]. Material damage models, advanced component models, and novel system-level structural analyses are being used to generate newly defined "structural transfer functions" (STFs) that provide a link between sensed parameters and the remaining capability of specific components, and the system. The characteristic damage signatures vary by component type and failure mode, and hence the specific STF approach varies among component types. An initial STF approach was developed and demonstrated for a specific component and damage type [5] under an initial feasibility program. This STF-based prognosis approach is fundamentally different from the traditional modal analysis based NDE approach used for crack detection. This presentation will review this novel STF-based prognosis approach, and consider examples of STFs characteristic of specific components and damage types, as well as progress towards the development of tools that are enabling system-level STF development [6].

There has been a long history of developing and implementing various degrees of prognostic and predictive useful life remaining capabilities. Stringent Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Health Management capability requirements are being placed on many of the new platform applications. While life usage accounting and fault detection / isolation effectiveness, with low false alarm rates, continue to improve on these new applications; prognostics requirements are even more ambitious and present very significant challenges to the system design teams. Though advanced life prediction and prognostic capabilities are being addressed for many mechanical and electronic systems; there are some unique challenges and issues associated with modem propulsion system applications. This paper will explore some of these design challenges and issues; discuss the various degrees of prognostic capabilities; address potential development methodologies; and draw heavily on lessons teamed from previous prognostic development efforts.

Nonetheless, there can be difficulties in managing availability and reliability, and the costs of unscheduled shut downs can be extremely large. Advanced gas turbine performance management offers opportunities in improving availability, reliability and productivity, driving down life cycle costs as well as adding to safety and compliance. This paper describes in detail the development of an engine fault diagnostics tool by the authors. The authors focus on structure, functionality as well as possible benefits of its use. The first part describes the structure and various methodologies adopted in the development of the system and the second part of the work describes the system and its salient features. The primary goal at this point of time was to test the utility, functionality and robustness of the presented tool, interesting and relevant results are obtained. Due to space limitations we restrict ourselves to discussing the system and not go into the details of actual simulation runs.

Differing from traditional neuron models, the AUILS neuron model fully employs the experience samples information within the local range and well embodies the association and analogy functions of cerebrum. The neural network, which is simple in structure and fast in learning speed, can realize the nonlinear mapping relationship between multi-input and multi-output. Through investigating the properties of AUILS and learning algorithm based on gradient, we build a method based on the neuron model for rotary machine fault diagnosis, which takes full advantage of expert experiences to estimate the reliability of fault existing according to the vibration signals of rotary machine in operation. It is verified that using the AUILS model, expert experiences can be well expressed in the diagnosis results.

Gradual degradation of contact surfaces induces developing conduction problems resulting in local temperature rise. The paper presents industrial case studies of continuous temperature monitoring of electrical contacts in energized equipment using wireless system with miniature temperature sensors. Wireless technology for on-line condition monitoring is applicable both as standalone system and with an interface with power quality monitoring system. Continuous on-line temperature monitoring combined with detail analysis of thermal contact behavior in correlation with the load current provides the means to evaluate physical condition of electrical contacts and detect abnormality. Practical applications of wireless temperature monitoring technique demonstrate its importance for properly and timely performed condition-based maintenance preventing possible disruption of electrical service. Observational data collected for several years of continuous contact temperature monitoring may be used for development of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms applicable for maintenance scheduling and better assets management.

Generally, this objective is realized by extracting the health index using machinery health monitoring system from different kinds of informative sources (vibrations, acoustic emissions, etc). The study summarized in this paper proposed a novel scheme for the extraction of machinery health index, which is based on the wavelet modulus maxima. This approach takes advantage of high sensitivity to non-stationary signatures. Specifically, modulus maxima distribution, a measure of the existence of singularity points, is the feature that is utilized to depict the presence of machinery fault and determine the degree of damage that occurred. This scheme is validated by real vibration data and the results presented herein show this approach to be an effective way in the extraction of machinery health index.

With the recent advances on pervasive computing, prognostics can be easily embedded in any devices and systems. When smart machines are networked and remotely monitored, and when their data is modeled and continually analyzed with sophisticated embedded systems, it is possible to go beyond mere "predictive maintenance" to intelligent "prognostics", the process of pinpointing exactly which components of a machine are likely to fail, and when and autonomously trigger service and order spare parts. This paper addresses the paradigm shift in modern maintenance systems from traditional "fail and fix" practices to "predict and prevent" methodology. Recent advances on prognostic technologies and tools are discussed. In addition, case studies are used to validate f these developed technologies and tools.

On this basis we can form the symptom observation matrix (SOM) for condition monitoring. From the other side we know, that contemporary complex machines may have many modes of failure, so called faults. The paper presents a method for the extraction of fault information from the symptom observation matrix by means of singular value decomposition (SVD), in the form of generalized fault symptoms. As the readings of the symptoms can be unstable, the moving average of the SOM was applied with the success. The attempt to assess the diagnostic contribution of primary measured symptoms was undertaken, and also some possibility to assess symptom limit value is considered. This possibilities are illustrated in the paper by processing the data taken directly from the machine vibration condition monitoring area.

In order to extract and classify, the fault information from the IMF from the two-dimension local wave, the RBF neural network is more excellent in terms of its approach and classifying ability. Several representative faults of some reciprocating compressor are investigated applying the proposed method. The result illustrates that it is, to a certain extent effective and practical.

The key to the fault bearings diagnosis is feature extracting and feature classifying. Multidimensional correlated variable is converted into low dimensional independent eigenvector by means of singularity value decomposition. The pattern recognition and the nonlinear regression are achieved by the method of support vector machine. In the light of the feature of vibration signals, eigenvector is obtained using singularity value decomposition, fault diagnosis of rolling bearing is recognized correspondingly using support vector machine multiple fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that the recognition of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on singularity value decomposition and support vector machine theory is available in the fault pattern recognizing and provides a new approach to intelligent fault diagnosis.

However in the gearbox fault diagnosis system, usually more than one sensor is placed to acquire vibration. signals. So the traditional method is difficult to judge the fault exactly. In the paper, multi-sensor data fusion is introduced to gearbox fault diagnosis. Different ways of data fusion are attempted to use in practical gearbox fault diagnosis. Based on the proper placement of sensors, several simple methods of data fusion in gearbox fault diagnosis are put forward firstly. In virtue of these methods, we can judge the source of fault, such as bearing, gear etc; noise disturbance can be reduced; gear local defects can also be judged, and rolling bearing fault can be distinguished from generic rotating machinery fault. At last, a model of multi-layer data fusion diagnosis is introduced in detail. The model consists of the pixel level fusion module, the feature and decision level fusion diagnosis module based on parallel BP neural network and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The first module is used to extract characters of typical gearbox faults. Then the second and third modules dispose the data in sequence. Finally diagnosis result can be gotten. Applications reveal that multi-sensor data fusion is successful and promising in gearbox fault diagnosis.

For this purpose, A model test rig is set up to simulate crack faults The startup vibration signals are roughly analyzed by 3-D spectrum (three-dimensional spectrum) at three conditions: uncracked rotor, shallow cracked rotor and deep cracked rotor. Then the wavelet transform is used to further analyze vibration signals in detail near the 1/2,1 and 2 times of critical speed and the results are presented in the form of reassigned wavelet scalogram. Results show that the combination of the 3-D spectrum and reassigned wavelet scalogram can well reveal the frequency structures of the signals; especially the 2-times superharmonic resonance can be measured at 1/2 times of critical speed; 1/2-times subharmonic resonance emerges at double critical speed; the harmonic components also become more and more complicated with the increase of crack depth.

However, current diagnosis methods are mostly based on the features of machine fault and pursue their exact expression in quantities that lead to a loss in rapidity. In this paper, two visual methods are presented to enhance intuitive, rapid diagnoses. They are supposed to detect faulty information only graphically. One method is based on high-order statistics and has the capability of restraining Gaussian noise. Its diagnosis effect is illustrated by analyzing the vibration signals of rolling beatings. The other method is continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based on Haar wavelet. Haar wavelet is seldom used in machine diagnosis due to its rectangular waveform in the supporting field and its dissimilarity to any component in the mechanical signal. However Haar wavelet continuous wavelet transform (HCWT) possesses the time-scale periodicity that should be useful when revealing the features in signals. Its diagnosis effect is validated by analysis of the vibration signals of rotor and gear. The applications demonstrate that the visual methods could simplify the diagnosis process and make it more intuitive, much easier, and faster.

Robot has following characteristics: special work mission, complicated work environment, strong independence. control, micro-power etc. The, fault detection technique of it is also a hot point research in machine and automation subject. After more fault, detection methods have been compared and analyzed; the control and the movement characteristics of Wall-Climbing Robot are studied, so a fault detection method is formed, that based on wavelet analysis and fractal theory. The noise signals of its sensor are decompounded to all kinds of unattached spectrums by using wavelet packet transform theory. Through the. multi-resolution decomposition, threshold value elimination and reconstruction, the high frequency, noise in the system is excluded and the characteristic frequency of fault signal is abstracted. The multi-scale spectrum correlation dimensions of the fault signals are computed out by using fractal theory. And in this series of dimension, the method of dimension furthest distance is used to define the fault sensitive dimension of system state. The smooth characteristic of the noise signals is picked up when the some faults happen, then the fault detection filter has been designed At last, a simulation experiment says that the characteristic space of the noise signals is accord with the state characteristic space. of Wall-Climbing Robot fault well. The results also show that the correlation dimension of fault signal is lower than that of normal signal. This conclusion can be a good quantitative evidence of whether fault occurs or not.

Through continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the scale-wavelet power spectrum (SWPS) of signals was obtained. The wavelet power (WP) distribution on different scales of each model is observed to be similar and mainly concentrated in particular scope of scale. By analyzing the distribution and diversity of SWPS, the WP on 1 similar to 32 scales of each model were extracted as 32-dimension and taken as input to train the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). By the trained BPNN to diagnose the fault signals under detection, the correctness rate is 100%. The fault diagnosis method based on the integration of the SPWS and neural network demonstrats to be efficient and feasible. So it has preferable engineering applicability and referenced value to diagnosis for complex machines.

Below, different models for the investigation of long-term landfill behaviour considering physical and biochemical processes are presented. Waste material in landfills is described as heterogeneous porous medium, where flow and transport processes of gases and liquids are combined with local material degradation and mechanical deformation. Conceptual considerations of chemical and biological reaction processes in landfill ecosystems are reflected in a structured degradation model. A multiphase flow and transport model for the numerical analysis of coupled transport and reaction processes in landfills and a constitutive model for the mechanical deformation behaviour of waste material are introduced.

Early and accurate fault detection and diagnosis for these plants can minimise down time, increase the safety of plant operations, and reduce manufacturing costs. Fault detection and isolation is more complex particularly in the case of the faulty analog control systems. Analog control systems are not equipped with monitoring function where the process parameters are continually visualised. In this situation, It is very difficult to find the relationship between the fault importance and its consequences on the product failure. We consider in this paper an approach to fault detection and analysis of its effect on the production quality using an adaptive centring and scaling in the pickling process in cold rolling. The fault appeared on one of the power unit driving a rotary machine, this machine can not track a reference speed given by another machine. The length of metal loop is then in continuous oscillation, this affects the product quality. Using a computerised data acquisition system, the main machine parameters have been monitored. The fault has been detected and isolated on basis of analysis of monitored data. Normal and faulty situation have been obtained by an artificial neural network (ANN) model which is implemented to simulate the normal and faulty status of rotary machine. Correlation between the product quality defined by an index and the residual is used to quality classification.

Mixed fault diagnosis in three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor using analysis of air-gap magnetic field	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							STEADY-STATE PERFORMANCE; FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; TRANSIENT ANALYSIS; ECCENTRICITY; ROTOR; HARMONICS; MACHINES; PREDICT; FORCES; MODEL	In this paper fault diagnosis of induction motor under mixed fault is carried out using precise analysis of the air-gap magnetic field based on time stepping finite element method. By feeding voltage instead of current density to the finite element computation part, the drawbacks of the application of finite element method in fault diagnosis of induction motor are overcome. Normally static eccentricity and broken rotor bars faults have been individually diagnosed in the published papers. Here diagnosis of the mixed fault, including static eccentricity and broken rotor bars, is introduced which is considered as a novel part of the present work. Precise analysis of magnetic field in the air-gap of a faulty induction motor is carried and performance of the motor is predicted. Taking into account the magnetic core saturation is another advantage of the present work. This is required in the transient analysis of a faulty motor.

And the experimental results show that the proposed methods are greatly superior to the currently used L10 bearing life prediction.

Afterwards, with the help of the model, the idea of intranet-based software "bus" for machine monitoring and fault diagnosis system was proposed, which is a criterion that specifies the data presentation, management and communication protocol. According to the difference of work mode, the information provider is divided into pusher and puller, the information applicant passively or actively receives the information correspondingly. Then, the technique has been applied to the information integration between the portable condition monitoring system and the online condition monitoring system, Results show that it have enough flexibility and expansibility, and can be applied to large-scale information integration of equipment condition information.

A neuro-fuzzy technique for diagnosing faults in rotating machinery	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY FOR MANAGING RISK, VOLS 1-3	Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering Water and Earth Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2006)	SEP 18-22, 2006	Estoril, PORTUGAL				LOGIC CONTROL	Malfunctions in machinery are often sources of reduced productivity and increased maintenance costs in various industrial applications. For this reason, machine condition monitoring has been developed to recognize incipient fault conditions. In this paper, the fault diagnostic problem is tackled within a neuro-fuzzy approach to pattern classification. An important practical issue for the applicability of any diagnostic tool is the transparency of the underlying classification model, to allow for a direct physical interpretation and inspection for validation purposes. In this view, besides the primary purpose of a high rate of correct classification, the proposed neuro-fuzzy approach strives for obtaining also a transparent classification model, i.e. readable and easily interpretable from the physical point of view. To this aim, appropriate coverage and distinguishability constraints on the fuzzy input partitioning interface are used to achieve the physical interpretability of the membership functions and of the associated inference rules. The efficiency of the approach is verified with respect to a literature problem and then applied to a case of motor bearing fault classification.

To predict them, a predictive maintenance approach has been developed. It consists of observing the machine during a determined working time and recording the evolution of one or more physico-chemical parameters, then making a diagnosis and developing a failure prediction mathematical model. Initially, we followed a defect of unbalance on four different points of the machine by a vibrator indicator during one year period. The value of the vibrator amplitude evolves with respect to time according to a well defined law (decreasing curve). Using the statistical methods and knowing the evolution curve of each followed point, we deduce a corresponding tendency curve (theoretical model) which allows to predict the remaining time before the alarm threshold value. The reliability of the prediction model is related to an optimum exploitation of the machine under the normal terms of employment, to a qualification of the follow-up personnel and to the use of the computer tool.

Extraction and aggregation of information from rapid developing condition monitoring systems, process control systems, and inspection reports, has given rise to the invention of a new measure named "Technical Condition Index" (TCI). The TCI is defined as the degree of degradation relative to design condition. The TCI is calculated and aggregated to different levels in the repairable system hierarchy. The paper presents a methodology to calculate the residual life of an Export gas compressor at the Troll Kollsnes natural gas treatment plant based on an array of stored TCI values and events. This array is used to determine the TCI-dependent parameters in a Weibull PHM distribution. Knowledge about the TCI-dependent parameters in the Weibull PHM distribution, and the TCI history, will be used to calculate the probability of survival of an additional time interval of length x.

SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VIBRATION MEASUREMENTS BY LASER TECHNIQUES: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Vibration Measurements by Laser Techniques	JUN 19-22, 2006	Ancona, ITALY	Italian Assoc Laser Velcimetry & Non Invas Diagnost, Univ Politecn March Dipt Meccan		Industrial Diagnostics; Laser Doppler Vibrometry; vibration analysis; speckle noise; kurtosis; Quality Control		Mechanical fault diagnostics for quality control of manufacturing appliances is often based on the analysis of machine vibrations. In the presence of mechanical faults, vibration signals comprise periodic impulses with a characteristic frequency corresponding to a particular defect. Vibrometers based on LDV (Laser Doppler Vibrometry) are an alternative to the traditional use of piezo-electric accelerometers, devices that are the most common and popular vibration transducers. Laser vibrometry is now an established technique for vibration measurements in industrial applications where non-contact operations are essential. Despite the advantages of LDV, speckle noise occurs when rough surfaces are measured and the. object is moving. Therefore, removal of speckle noise is a crucial point of a reliable system for diagnostics of mechanical faults. This paper deals with the analysis of vibration signals measured by a Laser Doppler Vibrometer from different electromechanical components such as compressors and electrical motors. The goal is to suppress the speckle-noise effect, coming both from the surface of the electro-mechanical components and its movement, in order to perform an automatic test for mechanical fault detection in the production line. First, data acquisition and its problems are introduced. Then, the chosen solution is presented. In particular, a statistical approach based on kurtosis is used for detection of speckle noise and selection of an undistorted region within the signal. The algorithm is composed of band-pass filtering, segmentation of the signal and computation of a scalar indicator KR (Kurtosis Ratio) for each signal segment, in order to detect outlying samples caused by speckle noise. Finally, real examples are shown to test the proposed method, and a tool for validation of signal databases is briefly presented.

This paper explores the possibility to adapt this method to the situation when the vibration data are available at one rotating speed only, which in real machines is generally the normal operating speed. It results that single speed fault identification can be successful, but does not allow to discriminate between different malfunctions that generate similar symptoms. Neverthless the identification results can be used to define corrective balancing masses.

Proportional model use the correlation among the elements in the lubricating oil to detect wear condition and occurring faults in the engine. Then the limit value of proportional model is established by analyzing a lot of spectrum data. In order to validate the availability and effect of proportional model, this paper apply proportional model to an engine and sampling the lubricating oil every 5 hours. Through analyzing the lubricating oil by spectrometer, we find that proportional model could find the abnormal wear information in spectrum data, give more accurate result of wear condition and give the fault form in the engine. The results from this paper prove that this method based on proportional model is applicable and available in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the engine.

Most methods of mechanical fault recognition depend on the large samples of the statistical properties (such as neural network). When training limited samples, it is difficult to guarantee getting a better classification. In response to the lack of rotary mechanical diagnostic samples, this paper takes the advantages of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in small sample classification for studying its application in small number of samples for rotary machine fault pattern recognition. For rotary machine's multi-class fault problem, we introduce three methods based on binary classifications: "one-against-all", "one-against-one", and "directed acyclic graph" SVM (DAGSVM) and then compare their performance in fault recognition. The experiments indicate that the SVMs has high adaptability for rotary machine fault diagnosis in the case of smaller number of samples and the "one-against-one" and DAG methods are more suitable for rotary machine fault diagnosis than the other.

If done correctly, CBM has the benefits such as reducing catastrophic failures, minimizing maintenance and logistical cost, maximizing system security and availability and improving platform reliability. A CBM system usually has four functional modules: feature extraction, diagnostics, prognostics and decision support. Among them, fault prognostics is the most important enabling technology. It is the most challenging research area which is so called crystal ball of CBM. But it has the potential to be the most beneficial one. A review of recent progress of fault prognostics is conducted with the emphasis placed on its algorithmic approaches. These approaches generally fall into four main categories, namely experience-based approaches, model-based approaches, knowledge-based approaches and data-driven approaches. Based on the analysis of some typical examples on each prognostic approaches, the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches are further discussed. Finally, the future challenges concerned with fault prognostics are also presented.

WT and wavelet ridge are very useful tools to analyze PQ disturbance signals, but invalid for nonlinear timevarying harmonic signals. CT can detect and identify voltage quality and frequency quality visually, i.e., according to the contour of CT matrix of PQ harmonic signals, the harmonies can be detect and identify to fixed, linear timevarying and nonlinear time-varying visually. It is helpful to choose appropriate WT to analyze harmonics. Simulations show the contours of CT can effectively detect harmonic disturbance occurrence time and duration. Finally, it is validated that the harmonies of the stator current fault signal of the bar-broken electric machine is nonlinear time-varying, and tend to stable status in a short time.

To improve fault diagnosis performance, it is essential to reduce the dimensionality of collected data. This paper presents a modified discrete binary ant colony optimization (MDBACO) to optimize discrete combinational problems, and then further combines it with SVM to accomplishing fault feature selection. The tests of optimizing benchmark functions show the developed MDBACO is valid and effective. The fault diagnosis results and comparisons of simulations based on Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) prove the feature selection method based on MDBACO and SVM can find the essential fault variables quickly and exactly, and greatly increases the fault diagnosis correct rates as irrelevant variables are eliminated properly.

To tackle this problem, we have studied anomaly detection and fault diagnosis methods for spacecraft systems based on machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) technology. In these methods, the knowledge or model which is necessary for monitoring a spacecraft system is (semi-)automatically acquired from the spacecraft telemetry data. In this paper we first overview the anomaly detection diagnosis problem in the spacecraft systems and conventional techniques such as limit-check, expert systems and model-based diagnosis.

Electron beam irradiation is relevant for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission due to the high electron radiation environment surrounding Jupiter. As an initial feasibility test, selected optical fiber components were exposed to dose levels relevant to the Jupiter environment. Three separate fiber types were used: one series consisted of pure silica core fiber, two other series consisted of different levels of Germania-doped fiber. Additionally, a series of fused silica Extrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometer (EFPI)-based fiber optic sensors and two different types of fiber optic connectors were tested. Two types of fiber coatings were evaluated: acrylate and polyimide. All samples were exposed to three different dose levels: 2 MRad, 20 MRad, and 50 MRad. Optical loss measurements were made on the optical fiber spools as a function of wavelength between 750 and 1750nm at periodic intervals up to 75 firs after exposure. Attenuation is minimal and wavelength-dependent. Fiber optic sensors were evaluated using a standard EFPI sensor readout and diagiostic system. Optical connectors and optical fiber coatings were visually inspected for degradation. Additionally, tensile testing and minimum bend radius testing was conducted on the fibers. Initial loss measurements indicate a low-level of induced optical attenuation in the fiber which recovers with time. The fiber optic sensors exhibited no observable degradation after exposure. The optical fiber connectors and coatings also showed no observable degradation. In addition to harsh environment survivability, fiber optic sensors offer a number of intrinsic advantages for space nuclear power applications including extremely low mass, immunity to electromagnetic interference, self diagnostics / prognostics, and smart sensor capability. Deploying fiber optic sensors on future space exploration missions would provide a substantial improvement in spacecraft instrumentation.

Fault classification and ground detection using support vector machine	TENCON 2006 - 2006 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-4	TENCON IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2006)	NOV 14-17, 2006	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				This paper presents a new approach for the fault classification and ground detection in transmission line in large power system networks using Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed method uses post fault current and voltage samples for 1/4(th) cycle (5 samples) from the inception of the fault as inputs to the SVM. SVM-1 is trained with current and voltage samples to provide faulty phase involved and SVM-2 is trained with peak of the ground current to provide the involvement of the ground in the fault process. The SVMs are trained with Gaussian kernel with different parameter values to get the most optimized classifier. The proposed method converges very fast and thus provides fast and accurate protection scheme for distance relaying.	[Samantaray, S. R.; Panda, G.] Natl Inst Technol, Roukela, India; [Dash, P.

Even though Web services are becoming more and more widespread as an emerging technology, it is hard to test Web services because they are distributed applications with numerous aspects of runtime behavior that are different from typical applications. This paper presents a new approach to testing Web services based on EFSM (Extended Finite State Machine). WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file alone does not provide dynamic behavior information. This problem can be overcome by augmenting it with a behavior specification of the service. Rather than domain partitioning or perturbation techniques, we choose EFSM because Web services have control flow as well as data flow like communication protocols. By appending this formal model of EFSM to standard WSDL, we can generate a set of test cases which has a better test coverage than other methods. Moreover, a procedure for deriving an EFSM model from WSDL specification is provided to help a service provider augment the EFSM model describing dynamic behaviors of the Web service. To show the efficacy of our approach, we applied our approach to Parlay-X Web services. In this way, we can test Web services with greater confidence in potential fault detection.

The C-method first tests each component separately for output and/or transfer faults, using one of the traditional test methods, then checks for composability, and finally tests the composite system for composition faults. To check for composability and to derive the test suite for the detection of composition faults, it is not required to construct the global state machine. Instead, all information is derived from the component state machines, which avoids a potential state explosion and lengthy test cases. Furthermore, the test suite checks for composition faults only. This substantially reduces the size of the test suite and thus the overall test effort.

The system is represented as two communicating complete deterministic finite state machines, an embedded component machine to be tested and a context machine that represents the remaining part of the system. The context is assumed to be fault free and the interactions between the component machines are observable. When an internal test can not be translated in the given context, we demonstrate how another test with the guaranteed fault detection power could be determined (if such a test exists) that can be translated in the given context.

ULTRASONIC 2ND; 3RD HARMONICS; GENERATION	Monitoring the incipient damage at the earliest possible stage is essential for predicting structural performance and remaining life of structural components. Existing prognostic methodologies incorporate conventional SHM and NDE techniques responsive to cracks and delaminations resulted from the irreversible material fracture and disintegration at the macro-scale. There is an increasing need for technologies that could allow for monitoring material degradation at the micro/meso scale before the onset of the macro-scale fracture. In this contribution, we report results of the real-time monitoring of the material micro/meso scale degradation using the nonlinear acoustic vibro-modulation technique. The technique explores nonlinear acoustic interaction of high frequency ultrasound and low frequency structural vibration at the site of the incipient damage. The indicator of the damage severity, nonlinear acoustic damage index (DI), was measured in real time during the strain-controlled three-point bending fatigue test of aluminum and steel specimens. Nondestructively, degradation of the specimen was revealed through the increase in the DI, which correlated well with the respective decrease in the specimen's stiffness. Destructive SEM examination confirmed sensitivity of the DI to the incipient micro/meso scale damage and advocated for utilizing the vibro-modulation approach for assessment of material degradation before fracture.

It is during the latter stage that the insidious process of cancer invasion of peritumoral tissue can and does take place. Vascular tumors grow rapidly allowing the cancer cells to establish a new colony in distant organs, a process known as metastasis. The metastatic cascade is a multistep process that involves the over-expression of proteolytic enzyme activity such as the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). uPA initiates the activation of an enzymatic cascade that primarily involves the activation of plasminogen and subsequently its matrix degrading protein plasmin. Degradation of the peritumoral tissue enables the cancer cells to migrate through the tissue and subsequently to spread to secondary sites in the body. In this chapter we consider a mathematical model of cancer cell invasion of extracellular matrix which focuses on the role of the urokinase plasminogen activation system. The model consists of a system of reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations describing the interactions between cancer cells, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA inhibitors, plasmin and the host tissue. That partial differential equations (naturally) focus on the spatio-temporal dynamics on the uPA system and its role in tissue invasion. The results obtained from the spatio-temporal systems, underscore the ability of rather simple models to produce complicated dynamics, associated with tumour heterogeneity and cancer cell progression and invasion.				mpokos@hotmail.com	LOLAS, GEORGIOS/D-5374-2015; LOLAS, GEORGIOS/AAE-6041-2019	LOLAS, GEORGIOS/0000-0002-2236-5209; 			Alberts B., 1994, MOL BIOL CELL, V3rd ed; Anderson A.

First, by selecting proper parameters, the power spectrum of fault signals are decomposed by wavelet analysis, which predigests choosing method of fault eigenvectors. Second, a method of fault diagnosis based on PNN is presented. The method uses Bayesian classifying and decision making theory to constitute the mathematic model of system, with Gauss function as activating function. The model possesses the characteristics of strong nonlinear processing and arti-interfering ability, by which the rotating machinery fault can be identified and diagnosed effectively. The fault set data are entered noises and both back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) and PNN are used to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery fault. The simulation results show that when the sample sets do not contain any noises or the noises are comparatively small, the diagnosis success rates of both BPNN and PNN are quite high. When noises rise, the diagnosis success rate of PNN is much higher than that of BPNN, which shows the PNN validity in anti-jamming ability and diagnosis success rate.

Therefore, most conventional signal processing method based on time invariant carried out in constant time interval are frequently unable to provide meaningful results. In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals such as speed up or speed down vibration signals effectively, the order bispectrum analysis technique is presented. This new method combines computed order tracking technique with bispectrum analysis. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then uses software to resample the data at constant angle increments. Therefore, the time domain transient signal is converted into angle domain stationary one. In the end, the resampled signals are processed by bispectrum analysis method. The experimental results show that order bispectrum analysis can effectively diagnosis the faults of the gear crack.

The Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are one type of large margin classifier based on statistical methods. With the property of dealing with high dimension data, studying small quality of samples and training large data sets, it is feasible to use it to make classifier. By using one-against-one strategy, construct it with different kernel functions, and select the best one for the classifier. The simulation results show that using polynomial function is superior to the others. Besides, compared with expert system and neural networks, SVMs have a better performance on recognizing patterns, capabilities of fault-tolerance and generalization.

It is expected that a desired time-frequency analysis method should have good computation efficiency, and have good resolution in both time domain and frequency domain. In this paper, the adaptive Gaussian chirplet distribution for an integrated time-frequency signature extraction of the machine vibration is presented. The adaptive Gaussian chirplet spectrogram is non-negative, has a high time-frequency resolution, and is free of cross term interference, so it offers the advantage of good localization of the vibration signal energy in the time-frequency domain.

We applied this technique to linear mixtures of simulated fault signals. The success separation inspired us to apply the technique to an experiment set-up where three known sources were used as an analogue of the real world in order to separate each source. Our goal was to remove the influence of the other machines and recur the vibration source in gearbox. The mixing model of signal transmission was investigated. The experiment results show that when the signal frequency is less than 100hz, it is appropriate to consider the mixing model of vibration sources as instantaneous model. The separation results by mean of FastICA algorithm show that we can separate the disturbing signal and inner source signals from the observation. The experiment results suggest that ICA is a promising method to enhance the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Some actual gearbox vibration signals are analyzed, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in monitoring and diagnosis of machine conditions, with the capability of early fault detection by extracting periodic impulses from gearbox vibration signals.

The structure of fault model expression was built which contains the classic field and admittable field of fault symptoms. The structure described the fault state was established which consists of the denotation of the fault state, the symptoms and the corresponding values. Normalized membership function and membership degree of a symptom were introduced to evaluate the possibility of the fault quantitatively. The biggest dependence rule was established to diagnose the fault. The multiple faults rule, which contains the difference field and the recognition field, was established to diagnose the multiple faults. The diagnosis example was taken to validate the method. The diagnosed result shows that the method presented can effectively be used to diagnose the complex machinery systems.

Firstly, output voltage signals under faulty conditions are obtained from analog circuits test points and noise is removed from signals with wavelet lifting transform. Then wavelet coefficients of output voltage signals are gained by wavelet lifting decomposition, and faulty feature vectors are extracted from the coefficients. After training the least squares wavelet support vector machines by faulty feature vectors, the least squares wavelet support vector machines model of the circuit fault diagnosis system is built. The simulation result shows the fault diagnosis method of the analog circuits with wavelet lifting transform and least squares wavelet support vector machines is effective.

J	Hadjicostis, CN				Hadjicostis, CN			Probabilistic detection of FSM single state-transition faults based on state occupancy measurements	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						discrete-event systems; fault detection; finite-state machines (FSMs); Markov models	DIAGNOSIS	This note discusses a probabilistic methodology for detecting single permanent or transient functional changes in the state-transition mechanism of a deterministic finite-state machine (FSM). The associated probabilistic detector observes the empirical frequencies with which different states are occupied and detects faults by analyzing the discrepancy between the observed state occupancy measurements and the expected frequencies. In addition to state occupancy measurements, the detector requires a statistical characterization of the input, but does not need to know the order with which states appear or the exact input sequence that is applied to the FSM. These features can be useful in settings where the input/state order may not be known due to synchronization, communication or other constraints.

The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other signals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place. In particular, such a review helps to avoid repetition of past work and gives a bird's eye view to a new researcher in this area.

The concept is to measure the differential leakage currents of each phase winding from the terminal box in a noninvasive manner to assess the insulation condition during motor operation. The conventional differential CTs used for phase fault protection can be replaced with high performance current sensors to measure the leakage current with higher accuracy. Indicators for insulation condition such as the capacitance and dissipation factor are calculated based on the measurements to provide a low cost solution for online insulation condition assessment. A simplified online insulation system model is derived for analysis and interpretation of the measured data. Experimental results on a 15-hp induction motor under simulated insulation degradation conditions show that the proposed technique is a very sensitive method capable of detecting incipient signs of insulation degradation.

J	Knight, AM; Bertani, SR				Knight, AM; Bertani, SR			Mechanical fault detection in a medium-sized induction motor using stator current monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						AC machines; bearings (mechanical); fault diagnosis; induction motors	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; FORCES	This paper presents the results of an experimental study of the detection of mechanical faults in an induction motor. As is reasonably well known, by means of analysis of combinations of permeance and magneto-motive force (MMF) harmonics, it is possible to predict the frequency of air gap flux density harmonics which occur as a result of certain irregularities in an induction motor. In turn, analysis of flux density harmonics allows the prediction of induced voltages and currents in the stator windings. Reviewing this theory, equations which may aid in the identification of mechanical faults are presented. These equations include both those which indicate eccentric conditions and those which have been suggested to help identify bearing faults. The development of test facility to create eccentricity faults and bearing fault conditions is described. This test facility allows rapid access to the motor bearings, allowing an investigation into the ability to detect faulted bearing conditions using stator current monitoring. Experimental test results are presented, indicating that it may be possible to detect bearing degradation using relatively simple and inexpensive equipment.

J	Zhao, F; Koutsoukos, X; Haussecker, H; Reich, J; Cheung, P				Zhao, F; Koutsoukos, X; Haussecker, H; Reich, J; Cheung, P			Monitoring and fault diagnosis of hybrid systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Bayesian mode estimation; data association; hybrid systems; monitoring and diagnosis; printing systems		Many networked embedded sensing and control systems can be modeled as hybrid systems with interacting continuous and discrete dynamics. These systems present significant challenges for monitoring and diagnosis. Many existing model-based approaches focus on diagnostic reasoning assuming appropriate fault signatures have been generated. However, an important missing piece is the integration of model-based techniques with the acquisition and processing of sensor signals and the modeling of faults to support diagnostic reasoning. This paper addresses key modeling and computational problems at the interface between model-based diagnosis techniques and signature analysis to enable the efficient detection and isolation of incipient and abrupt faults in hybrid systems. A hybrid automata model that parameterizes abrupt and incipient faults is introduced. Based on this model, an approach for diagnoser design is presented. The paper also develops a novel mode estimation algorithm that uses model-based prediction to focus distributed processing signal algorithms. Finally, the paper describes a diagnostic system architecture that integrates the modeling, prediction, and diagnosis components. The implemented architecture is applied to fault diagnosis of a complex electro-mechanical machine, the Xerox DC265 printer, and the experimental results presented validate the approach. A number of design trade-offs that were made to support implementation of the algorithms for online applications are also described.

J	So, HC; Ma, WK; Farina, A; Gini, F; Tsui, WY				So, HC; Ma, WK; Farina, A; Gini, F; Tsui, WY			On four suboptimal quadratic detectors for random signals	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						random signals; quadratic detectors	RADAR DETECTION; CLUTTER; VECTOR	This paper tackles the problem of detecting a random signal embedded in additive white noise. Although the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is the well-known optimum detector for this problem, it may not be easily realized in applications such as radar, sonar, seismic, digital communications, speech analysis and automatic fault detection in machinery, for which suboptimal quadratic detectors have been extensively employed. In this paper, the relationships between four suboptimal quadratic detection schemes, namely, the energy, matched subspace, maximum deflection ratio as well as spectrum matching detectors, and the LRT are studied. In particular, we show that each of those suboptimal detectors can approach the optimal LRT under certain operating conditions. These results are verified via Monte Carlo simulations.

J	Wu, JD; Chuang, CQ				Wu, JD; Chuang, CQ			Fault diagnosis of internal combustion engines using visual dot patterns of acoustic and vibration signals	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; visual dot pattern; internal combustion engine; drive axle shaft	ROTATING MACHINERY; ALGORITHM	An investigation of the fault diagnosis technique in internal combustion engines based on the visual dot pattern of acoustic and vibration signals is presented in this paper. Acoustic emissions and vibration signals are well known as being able to be used for monitoring the conditions of rotating machineries. Most of the conventional methods for fault diagnosis using acoustic and vibration signals are primarily based on observing the amplitude differences in the time or frequency domain. Unfortunately, the signals caused by damaged elements, such as those buried in broadband background noise or from smearing problems arising in practical applications, particularly at low revolution, are not always available. In the present study, a visual dot pattern technique is proposed to identify the acoustic emission and vibration signals for fault diagnosis in an internal combustion engine and drive axle shaft. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed system for fault diagnosis under various fault conditions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique is effective in the fault diagnosis of an internal combustion engine and drive axle shaft. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Purushotham, V; Narayanan, S; Prasad, SAN				Purushotham, V; Narayanan, S; Prasad, SAN			Multi-fault diagnosis of rolling bearing elements using wavelet analysis and hidden Markov model based fault recognition	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						discrete wavelet transform; impulses; hidden Markov model; bearing fault recognition; Mel frequency complex cepstrum	BALL-BEARING; VIBRATION; TRANSFORM; ENVELOPE	Due to the importance of rolling bearings as the most widely used machine elements, it is necessary to establish a suitable condition monitoring procedure to prevent malfunctions and breakages during operation. This paper presents a new method for detecting localized bearing defects based on wavelet transform. Bearing race faults have been detected by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Vibration signals from ball bearings having single and multiple point defects on inner race, outer race, ball fault and combination of these faults have been considered for analysis. Wavelet transform provides a variable resolution time-frequency distribution from which periodic structural ringing due to repetitive force impulses, generated upon the passing of each rolling element over the defect, are detected. It is found that the impulses appear periodically with a time period corresponding to characteristic defect frequencies. In this study, the diagnoses of ball bearing race faults have been investigated using wavelet transform. These results are compared with feature extraction data and results from spectrum analysis. It has been clearly shown that DWT can be used as an effective tool for detecting single and multiple faults in ball bearings. This paper also presents a new method of pattern recognition for bearing fault monitoring using hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Experimental results show that successful bearing fault detection rates as high as 99% can be achieved by this approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Knight, P; Cook, J; Azzam, H				Knight, P; Cook, J; Azzam, H			Intelligent management of helicopter health and usage management systems data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART G-JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						helicopter health and usage management systems (HUMS); fleet and usage management systems (FUMS); prognostics; prognostic health management (PHM); data fusion; data mining; vibration; condition monitoring		Helicopter health and usage management systems (HUMS) generate large amounts of data, which are downloaded to ground-based systems. The data are automatically examined on download for damage indications, which provide the immediate go/no-go response required by the aircraft operations management. This level of reactive fault detection and diagnosis is reasonably well understood and has been demonstrated to improve aircraft availability and airworthiness. To achieve further benefit and maintenance cost savings from HUMS, another level of analysis is required, leading to prognostics and predictive maintenance through intelligent management (IM) of the accumulated HUMS records. In collaboration with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Smiths has developed a suite of IM methods and has successfully applied them to gearbox seeded fault data. Working closely with the UK Ministry of Defence (UK MOD), Smiths has tested these methods on Chinook HUMS data, including an in-flight transmission bearing failure incident described in this article. The result is a high degree of earls anomaly detection and a clear view of the deterioration to failure. The objective of the MOD programme has been to apply IM tools to the enormous quantity of HUMS data being gathered, thereby enabling improved analysis capability, increased levels of automation, and more intelligent us D of resources. The article presents the results of the work carried out under both the CAA and the MOD programmes.

Experimental results verify the relationship between vibration analysis and MCSA. and identify the Presence Of outer raceway bearing defects in induction machines. This work also indicates that detecting fault frequencies by motor current is more difficult than detecting them by vibration analysis. The use of intensive resolution FFT is recommended in MCSA for detecting faults easily. Reinstalling a faulty bearing can alter the characteristic frequencies difficult to compare results from different bearings or even From the same bearing in different installations.

Primary load and engagement shear drivers (i.e., torque, speed, and clutch surface temperature) are modeled using a first principles approach. An extension of Archard's law is presented in which life usage is predicted by using multiple stochastic models to determine a wear coefficient for each applicable wear mechanism. These models consider the physical wear process, including debris-particle and protective-layer formation, using parameters such as surface roughness, particle size, and surface temperature. These stochastic variables are evaluated in a probabilistic framework, using statistical methods such as Monte Carlo and importance sampling, which consider both measurement and modeling uncertainty. Confidence interval prognostic results are provided to predict the RUL of the clutch throughout its limited life in near real-time.

The procedure uses the spectral lines that correspond to the slotting effect which causes harmonics in the machine air gap. These harmonic frequencies, which are about a few kHz occur in a part of the spectra which is not very dense compared to the one that corresponds to the low frequencies due to the supply or the rotor revolution speed. The considered components can also be detected in the radial magnetic field. owing out of the machine. It can be shown that specific faults lead to additional spectral lines which appear clearly near the original ones due to the slotting effect. Two faults, which can be detected with the same magnetic flux sensor, are presented in this paper: the first one corresponds to a broken rotor bar, the second one is a stator inter turn short circuit.

Based on a Singular value decomposition of matrix and Fuzzy C-means clustering, a discrete approach of continuous attribute values in a decision table, with continuous condition attribute values and discrete decision attribute values, has been proposed. Rough sets theory has been employed for diagnostic rule acquisition of rotating machinery with consideration of conflicting objects of decision table. A weak matching mode of objects with diagnostic rules has been proposed, with diagnostic conclusion and its belief degree obtained by comparing new objects with the standard diagnostic rules. An example at the end of this paper shows that the acquired rules have good merits of the ability of generalization and extension, and to some extent, improves classification level.

This paper presents a logistic regression based prognostic method for on-line performance degradation assessment and failure modes classification. System condition is evaluated by processing the information gathered from controllers or sensors mounted at different points in the system, and maintenance is performed only when the failure/ malfunction prognosis indicates instead of periodic maintenance inspections. The wavelet packet decomposition technique is used to extract features from non-stationary signals (such as current, vibrations), wavelet package energies are used as features and Fisher's criteria is used to select critical features. Selected features are input into logistic regression (LR) models to assess machine performance and identify possible failure modes. The maximum likelihood method is used to determine parameters of LR models. The effectiveness and feasibility of this methodology have been illustrated by applying the method to a real elevator door system.

Vibration analysis is a potential application field of this quite recent technique. Actually, BSS methods aim to retrieve unknown source signals from a set of their observations coming to a matrix of sensors, without necessarily having any prior knowledge about the sources. In monitoring and diagnosis purposes, bearing defects constitute a problem for manufacturers who aim at predicting those faults as well as potential engines breakdowns. These defects may be the unknown sources one wants to estimate from a set of recorded signals by a matrix of accelerometers placed close to the rotating machine. It has been shown that these vibration signals are wide-sense cyclostationary [[11] R.B.Randall, J. Antoni, S. Chobsaard, The relationship between spectral correlation and envelope analysis in the diagnostics of bearing faults and other cyclostationary machine signals, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing 15 (5) (2001) 945-962]. The new algorithm of BSS proposed in this work is based, precisely, on that property. Second-order statistics of such processes led us to a new separation criterion for blind source separation. The theoretical results of this study, simulation and experimental analysis are presented in here. Perspectives for future research conclude this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have developed a new algorithm based on a penalized mutual information criterion recently introduced in [El Rhabi et al., A penalized mutual information criterion for blind separation of convolutive mixtures, Signal Processing 84 (2004) 1979-1984] and which also allows to choose an optimal separator among an infinite number of valid separators that can extract the source signals in a certain sense according to the Minimal Distortion Principle. So, the minimisation of this criterion is easily done using a direct gradient approach without constraint on the displacements. Thus, our approach allows to restore directly the contribution of the sources to the sensor signals without post-processing as it is usually done. Finally, we illustrate the performances of our algorithm through simulations and on real rotating machine vibration signals. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Florkowski, M; Furgal, J				Florkowski, M; Furgal, J			A high-frequency method for determining winding faults in transformers and electrical machines	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article								Improvement of diagnostic methods of both power transformers and electrical machines is crucial considering the function they play in electrical networks and industry as well as the cost of those devices. High-frequency measurements are used more and more frequently as a diagnostic tool for the investigation of transformer and machine windings. They are also used for identifying winding faults. As a base are measurement results of frequency dependencies of the winding admittance or the transfer function. Therefore, relations between different kinds of winding faults and changes of frequency dependencies of winding admittances or transfer functions should be determined. Much research work is done in that field, which aims to determine the sensitivity of this method and to develop the recognition criteria with regard to the type and range of faults. This article presents the comparison of measurement results of the admittance performed on the medium-voltage transformer winding. The quantitative results of detecting deformations and dislocations of windings by means of frequency response analysis are described. Of particular importance is the early detection of winding failures in electrical machines, both during the manufacturing process and in operation. The results of investigations of winding faults in electrical machines of different construction are presented. The influence of turn-to-turn faults between adjacent winding wires on the admittance wave form has been also investigated. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.

The proposed approach is composed of two stages. The first stage is the detection and isolation of the failed component using a directional filter designed under a particular eigenstructure assignment. The second stage is represented by the reconfiguration mechanism which makes possible the compensation of the fault effects. This approach was applied to the web tension control of winding machine and gave good results for actuator fault accommodation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gazzarri, J; Schajer, G				Gazzarri, J; Schajer, G			Lumber surface profiling independent of bulk motion	HOLZ ALS ROH-UND WERKSTOFF			English	Article								A novel method is described to measure surface height profiles of lumber boards while they travel along a conveyor in a sawmill. Both surfaces of the board are identified independently, even on non-ideal conveyors where there are lateral motions relative to the sensors. Separate surface measurements are very useful for product quality control because each side of a piece of lumber is typically cut by a different tool. Therefore, such measurements open important new opportunities for machine fault diagnosis. The surface height profile measurement method uses multiple sequential sensors and a mathematical method based on linear inverse theory to separate surface profile information from lateral motions. The method was implemented using industrial-style laser sensors, and was effective both in the laboratory and in tests on the cant line of a large sawmill cutting dimension lumber.

J	Tan, WW; Huo, H				Tan, WW; Huo, H			A generic neurofuzzy model-based approach for detecting faults in induction motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						asynchronous rotating machines; fault detection; fuzzy neural networks	MACHINES	Many fault detection and diagnosis schemes are based on the concept of comparing the plant output with a model in order to generate residues. A fault is deemed to have occurred if the residue exceeds a predetermined threshold. Unfortunately, the practical usefulness of model-based fault detection schemes is limited because of the difficulty in acquiring sufficiently rich experimental data to identify an accurate model of the system characteristics. This paper aims at developing a generic neurofuzzy model-based strategy for detecting broken rotor bars, which is one of the most common type of faults that may occur in a squirrel-cage induction motor. A neurofuzzy model that captures the generic characteristics of a class of asynchronous motor is the key component of the proposed approach. It is identified using data generated by a simulation model that is constructed using information on the name plate of the motor. Customization for individual motors is then carried out by selecting the threshold for fault detection via an empirical steady-state torque-speed curve. Since data obtained from a practical motor are used to select the threshold and not to build a complete model, the objective of reducing the amount of experimental input-output data required to design a model-based fault detector may be realized. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the viability of the proposed fault detection scheme.

Many companies are investing in open source projects and lots of them are also using such software in their own work. But, because open source software is often developed with a different management style than the industrial ones, the quality and reliability of the code needs to be studied. Hence, the characteristics of the source code of these projects need to be measured to obtain more information about it. This paper describes how we calculated the object-oriented metrics given by Chidamber and Kemerer to illustrate how fault-proneness detection of the source code of the open source Web and e-mail suite called Mozilla can be carried out. We checked the values obtained against the number of bugs found in its bug database - called Bugzilla - using regression and machine learning methods to validate the usefulness of these metrics for fault-proneness prediction. We also compared the metrics of several versions of Mozilla to see how the predicted fault-proneness of the software system changed during its development cycle.

Today, markets increasingly require more customized products, with shorter life cycles. In response, manufacturing systems have evolved from mass production techniques, through flexible automation, and to mass customization to produce 'one-of-a-kind production' at mass production costs. This paper argues that manufacturing systems of the next generation will have to incorporate more flexibility and intelligence, evolving towards reconfigurable manufacturing systems. In particular, the concept of 'intelligence' becomes more relevant because of the need to maintain effective and efficient manufacturing operations with minimum downtime under conditions of uncertainty. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of the field of reconfigurable and intelligent machines. The relevant research issues for the development and introduction of reconfigurable machines tools are presented.

A subgroup of patients dies in the first 6 months and another subgroup lives a long period of time. Nowadays, no risk factors have been identified in order to determine how long a patient will survive. An empirical study for predicting the survival rate within the first 6 months after TIPS placement is conducted using a clinical database with 107 cases and 77 variables. Applications of Bayesian classification models, based on Bayesian networks, to medical problems have become popular in the last years. Feature subset selection is useful due to the heterogeneity of the medical databases where not all the variables are required to perform the classification. In this paper, filter and wrapper approaches based on the feature subset selection are adapted to induce Bayesian classifiers (naive Bayes, selective naive Bayes, semi naive Bayes, tree augmented naive Bayes, and k-dependence Bayesian classifier) and are applied to distinguish between the two subgroups of cirrhotic patients. The estimated accuracies obtained tally with the results of previous studies. Moreover, the medical significance of the subset of variables selected by the classifiers along with the comprehensibility of Bayesian models is greatly appreciated by physicians.

J	Huang, R; Xi, L; Lee, J; Liu, CR				Huang, R; Xi, L; Lee, J; Liu, CR			The framework, impact and commercial prospects of a new predictive maintenance system: intelligent maintenance system	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						predictive maintenance; intelligent maintenance system; Watchdog Agent (TM); Device to Business (D2B (TM)) platform; mass customised maintenance	MASS CUSTOMIZATION	With the development of information technology (IT), predictive maintenance technology integrated with IT is becoming increasingly popular. Recent developments in predictive maintenance applications reflect the need for further integration between factory floor and enterprise systems. This paper introduces a new predictive maintenance system, the intelligent maintenance system (IMS), which fuses infotronics technology to enable machine/product to achieve near-zero downtime performance through Device-to-Business (D2B (TM)) platform and Watchdog Agent (TM). The algorithm of Watchdog Agent (TM) and the architecture of proposed D2B (TM) platform were also analysed.

The knowledge incorporated algorithm takes advantage of the information on horizontal translation invariance in tangent direction of the instances in dataset. This essentially changes the representation of the input data while training the algorithm. These local translations do not alter the class membership of the instances in the dataset. The results on binary as well as multiple fault detection justify the use of knowledge incorporation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhan, YM; Jardine, AKS				Zhan, YM; Jardine, AKS			Adaptive autoregressive modeling of non-stationary vibration signals under distinct gear states. Part 1: modeling	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; BEARING FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; REGRESSION-MODELS; TIME-SERIES; ARIMA	Non-parametric time-frequency techniques are increasingly developed and employed to process nonstationary vibration signals of rotating machinery in a great deal of condition monitoring literature. However, their capacity to reveal power variations in the time-frequency space as precisely as possible becomes a hard constraint when the aim is that of monitoring the occurrence of mechanical faults. Therefore, for an early diagnosis, it is imperative to utilize methods with high temporal resolution, aiming at detecting spectral variations occurring in a very short time. This paper proposes three new adaptive parametric models transformed from time-varying vector-autoregressive model with their parameters estimated by means of noise-adaptive Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter and modified extended Kalman filter, respectively, on the basis of different assumptions. The performance analysis of the proposed adaptive parametric models is demonstrated using numerically generated non-stationary test signals. The results suggest that the proposed models possess appealing advantages in processing non-stationary signals and thus are able to provide reliable time frequency domain information for condition monitoring.

The known methods for checking experiments that are based on state identification are not applicable to unreduced machines. We propose the so-called State-Counting approach that is directly applicable to unreduced FSMs. The approach generalizes the idea of state identification in test generation methods for deterministic machines.

J	Diallo, D; Benbouzid, MEH; Hamad, D; Pierre, X				Diallo, D; Benbouzid, MEH; Hamad, D; Pierre, X			Fault detection and diagnosis in an induction machine drive: A pattern recognition approach based on concordia stator mean current vector	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						concordia transform; fault detection and diagnosis; induction motor; inverter; pattern recognition	MOTOR DRIVE	The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of fault detection and diagnosis in a three-phase inverter feeding an induction motor. The proposed approach is a sensor-based technique using the mains current measurement. A localization domain made with seven patterns is built with the stator Concordia mean current vector. One is dedicated to the healthy domain and the last six are to each inverter switch. A probabilistic approach for the definition of the boundaries increases the robustness of the method against the uncertainties due to measurements and to the PWM. In high-power equipment where it is crucial to detect and diagnose the inverter faulty switch, a simple algorithm compares the patterns and generates a Boolean indicating the faulty device. In low-power applications (less than 1 kW) where only fault detection is required, a radial basis function (RBF) evolving architecture neural network is used to build the healthy operation area. Simulated experimental results on 0.3- and 1.5-kW induction motor drives show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

The development of a simplified mathematical motor model allowed the establishment of the equivalent circuits of the motor, in d-q-O axes, in the presence of stator interturn short circuits. The use of the stationary reference frame, clockwise and counterclockwise synchronous reference frames, allows the extraction and manipulation of the information contained in the motor supply currents in a way that the effects introduced by the fault are easily isolated and measured. A severity factor is defined and the simulation and experimental results presented demonstrate its independence in relation to the working conditions of the motor, such as the load level and unbalances in the voltage supply system. Although the technique is here introduced for the diagnosis of stator faults, it is possible to extend its use for the diagnosis of other asymmetries such as broken rotor bars and air-gap eccentricity.

This paper takes an in-depth look at winding short circuits in this particular machine. Modeling and testing complement a theoretical analysis. Two cases need to be distinguished, one where a complete pole is shorted, and one where a few turns are shorted. Pole short circuits lead to torque reduction that can be easily compensated for with increased current. With few turns shorted, the impact on overall torque may actually be negligible, however, significant currents may circulate through the shorted turns, the worst case being with a single turn shorted with a zero resistance. These results are discussed with a view toward possible remediation schemes aside from simply turning off the faulted phase.

The proposed scheme is an offline method based on low flux stator core excitation that employs a new probe. An iron-core probe is placed in the wedge depression area of the stator and scanned axially to detect the variation in the measured flux due to a fault. Two fault indicators that provide clear indication on fault severity and location are proposed in this paper. A 120-MW ac machine stator was tested under a number of intentionally inserted fault conditions using portable field equipment recently developed. The experimental results show that the fault existence, location, and severity can be determined reliably using the proposed scheme. It is also shown that the fault detection sensitivity and reliability, inspection speed, and user convenience are significantly enhanced.

J	Athanasopoulou, E; Hadjicostis, CN				Athanasopoulou, E; Hadjicostis, CN			Probabilistic approaches to fault detection in networked discrete event systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						communication protocols; discrete event system (DES); distributed systems; finite-state machines (FSMs); Markov models; probabilistic fault detection	DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; NETS	In this paper, we consider distributed systems that can be modeled as finite state machines with known behavior under fault-free conditions, and we study the detection of a general class of faults that manifest themselves as permanent changes in the next-state transition functionality of the system. This scenario could arise in a variety of situations encountered in communication networks, including faults occurred due to design or implementation errors during the execution of communication protocols. In our approach, fault diagnosis is performed by an external observer/diagnoser that functions as a finite state machine and which has access to the input sequence applied to the system but has only limited access to the system state or output. In particular, we assume that the observer/diagnoser is only able to obtain partial information regarding the state of the given system at intermittent time intervals that are determined by certain synchronizing conditions between the system and the observer/diagnoser. By adopting a probabilistic framework, we analyze ways to optimally choose these synchronizing conditions and develop adaptive strategies that achieve a low probability of aliasing, i.e., a low probability that the external observer/diagnoser incorrectly declares the system as fault-free. An application of these ideas in the context of protocol testing/classification is provided as an example.

J	Tiwari, A; Tomko, KA				Tiwari, A; Tomko, KA			Enhanced reliability of finite-state machines in FPGA through efficient fault detection and correction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						fault tolerant FPGA design; FSM reliability; single event upset (SEU); soft errors		SRAM based FPGA are subjected to ion radiation in many operating environments. Following the current trend of shrinking device feature size & increasing die area, newer FPGA are more susceptible to radiation induced errors. Single event upsets (SEU), (also known as soft-errors) account for a considerable amount of radiation induced errors. SEU are difficult to detect & correct when they affect memory-elements present in the FPGA, which are used for the implementation of finite state machines (FSM). Conventional practice to improve FPGA design reliability in the presence of soft-errors is through configuration memory scrubbing, and through component redundancy. Configuration memory scrubbing, although suitable for combinatorial logic in an FPGA design, does not work for sequential blocks such as FSM. This is because the state-bits stored in flip-flops (FF) are variable, and change their value after each state transition. Component redundancy, which is also used to mitigate soft-errors, comes at the expense of significant area overhead, and increased power consumption compared to nonredundant designs. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach to implement the FSM using synchronous embedded memory blocks to enhance the runtime reliability without significant increase in power consumption. Experiments conducted on various benchmark FSM show that this approach has higher reliability, lower area overhead, and consumes less power compared to a component redundancy technique.

J	Liu, C; Ding, Y; Chen, Y				Liu, C; Ding, Y; Chen, Y			Optimal coordinate sensor placements for estimating mean and variance components of variation sources	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							MULTISTAGE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VARIATION PROPAGATION; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; SYSTEMS; MODEL	In-process optical coordinate measuring machines offer the potential to diagnose the sources of the variations that are responsible for product quality defects. Such a sensor system can thus help manufacturers to improve product quality and reduce process downtime. The effective use of sensor data in the diagnosis of the sources of variations depends on the optimal design of the sensor system, which is often also called the problem. of sensor placement. This paper addresses coordinate sensor placement for the diagnosis of dimensional variation sources in assembly processes. Sensitivity indices for the detection of the process mean and variance components are defined as the design criteria and are derived in terms of process layout and sensor deployment information. Exchange algorithms, originally developed for optimal experimental design, are revised and then used to maximize the detection sensitivity. A sort-and-cut procedure is proposed, which is able to significantly improve the algorithm efficiency of the current exchange routine. The resulting optimal sensor layout and its implications are illustrated in the specific context of a panel assembly process.

J	Sekhar, AS				Sekhar, AS			Identification of unbalance and crack acting simultaneously in a rotor system: Modal expansion versus reduced basis dynamic expansion	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						rotor; fault; identification; unbalance; crack		The vibration in rotating machinery is mostly caused by unbalance, misalignment, mechanical looseness, shaft crack, and other malfunctions. The diagnostics of rotor faults have been gaining importance in recent years. Many papers in the literature have dealt with single fault identification, but, normally, more than one fault can occur in a rotor. In the present study a model-based method is proposed for the on-line identification of faults in a rotor. The fault-induced change of the rotor system is taken into account by equivalent loads in the mathematical model. The equivalent loads are virtual forces and moments acting on the linear undamaged system to generate a dynamic behavior identical to that measured in the damaged system. The rotor has been modeled using the finite element method with unbalance and crack as the considered faults. Different shape expansion methods are compared for fault identification. The identification process is also simulated when both unbalance and crack are acting simultaneously on the rotor. The fault size and location have been identified while the nature and symptoms of the faults are ascertained using fast Fourier transform.

J	Rolo-Naranjo, A; Montesino-Otero, ME				Rolo-Naranjo, A; Montesino-Otero, ME			A method for the correlation dimension estimation for on-line condition monitoring of large rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							STATE-SPACE RECONSTRUCTION; VIBRATION FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; TIME-SERIES; SYSTEMS; PARAMETERS; ATTRACTORS; NOISE	In this paper, we introduce a robust method for the correlation dimension estimation in an automatic way for its implementation in on-line condition monitoring of large rotating machinery. The method is called Automatic-Attractor Dimension-Quantitative Estimation (A-AD-QE). It is based on a systemic analysis of the second derivative of the correlation integral obtained by the Grassberger and Procaccia algorithm. The A-AD-QE method concentrates its attention on the scaling region definition and it also has the possibility to analyse the geometrical structure of the obtained multidimensional second derivative of the correlation integral and its relation with the pseudo-phase portrait. The effectiveness of the introduced method was verified by means of the calculation of well-known analytic models as Lorenz attractor, van der Pol oscillator and Henon Map. Furthermore, the A-AD-QE method was applied to process real vibration signals of large rotating, machines. As a typical example we analysed four measurements, recorded at different points. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of the method in real vibration signal processing for this kind of machines. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze the optimal solution model and point out the limitations that prevent logic synthesis from yielding a minimal-cost monolithic CED implementation. We then propose a compaction-based alternative approach for restricted error models. The proposed method alleviates these limitations by decomposing the CED functionality into: compaction of the circuit outputs, prediction of the compacted responses, and comparison. We model the fault-free and erroneous responses as connected vertices in a graph and perform graph coloring in order to derive the compacted responses. The proposed method is first discussed within the context of combinational circuits, with zero detection latency, and subsequently extended to Finite State Machines (FSMs), with a constant detection latency of one clock cycle. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant hardware reduction over duplication-based CED, while detecting all possible errors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, ZK; Tse, PW; Chu, FL				Peng, ZK; Tse, PW; Chu, FL			An improved Hilbert-Huang transform and its application in vibration signal analysis	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET ANALYSIS; ROTOR SYSTEM; SPECTRUM	The vibration generated by industrial machines always contains nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Recently., a number of new methods have been proposed to analyse these signals. One of the promising methods is the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT). The HHT is derived from the principals of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the Hilbert Transform. When applying the HHT, first, the EMD will decompose the acquired signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The IMF is a kind of complete, adaptive and almost orthogonal representation for the analysed signal. Since the IMF is almost monocomponent, it can determine all the instantaneous frequencies from the nonlinear or non-stationary signal. Second, the local energy of each instantaneous frequency can be derived through the Hilbert Transform. Hence, the result is an energy-frequency-time distribution of the signal. Since applying the process of HHT is not computational intensive, the HHT becomes a promising method to extract the properties of nonlinear and non-stationary signal. However, after the completion of a thorough experiment, the result generated by the HHT has its deficiency. First, the EMD will generate undesirable IMFs at the low-frequency region that may cause misinterpretation to the result. Second, depends on the analysed signal, the first obtained IMF may cover too wide a frequency range such that the property of monocomponent cannot be achieved. Third, the EMD operation cannot separate signals that contain low-energy components. In this study, new techniques have been applied to improve the result of HHT. In the improved version of HHT, the wavelet packet transform (WPT) is used as preprocessing to decompose the signal into a set of narrow band signals prior to the application of EMD. With the help from WPT, each IMF derived from the EMD can truly become monocomponent. Then, a screening process is conducted to remove unrelated IMFs from the result. Both simulated and experimental vibration signals of having a rotary system with the fault of rubbing occurred have proven that the improved HHT does show the rubbing symptoms more clear and accurate than the original HHT. Hence, the improved HHT is a precise method for nonlinear and non-stationary signal analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Much debate focuses on the biological relevance and the need for identification of such biomarkers while less effort has been invested in devising standard procedures for sample preparation and storage in relation to model building based on complex sets of mass spectrometric (MS) data. Thus, development of standardized methods for collection and storage of patient samples together with standards for transportation and handling of samples are needed. This requires knowledge about how sample processing affects MS-based proteome analyses and thereby how nonbiological biased classification errors are avoided. In this study, we characterize the effects of sample handling, including clotting conditions, storage temperature, storage time, and freeze/thaw cycles, on MS-based proteomics of human serum by using principal components analysis, support vector machine learning, and clustering methods based on genetic algorithms as class modeling and prediction methods. Using spiking to artificially create differentiable sample groups, this integrated approach yields data that - even when working with sample groups that differ more than may be expected in biological studies -clearly demonstrate the need for comparable sampling conditions for samples used for modeling and for the samples that are going into the test set group. Also, the study emphasizes the difference between class prediction and class comparison studies as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different modeling methods.

J	Wakha, K; Majed, MA; Dasgupta, A; Pines, DJ				Wakha, K; Majed, MA; Dasgupta, A; Pines, DJ			Dual-stiffness sensor for damage detection, localization, and prognostics	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article							INCLUSION	The concept of a dual stiffness sensor that measures material degradation at the micromechanics scale and introduces damage variables to reflect average material degradation at a macromechanics scale is developed. The idea of a mechanical multifunctional dual stiffness sensor for in situ real-time stiffness and energy density measurements is motivated by Eshelby's equivalent inclusion theorem. A complete analytical derivation is presented and the use of a dual stiffness/energy sensor to diagnose damage and to determine the remaining life of structures is evaluated. A numerical verification using finite element analysis is presented, and the results indicate that the sensor can be used for diagnostics and prognostics of structures. A distributed array of sensors is used to determine :the onset and location of damage. Experimental results presented for uniaxial experimental tests under monotonic quasi-static loading conditions indicate that the concept can easily be implemented: For a sensor pair of known geometry and material properties, the Eshelby tensors are independent of the host: A methodology was thus developed to detect material properties of different hosts and was used' to predict accurately elastic material properties of diverse materials.

J	Paoli, A; Lafortune, S				Paoli, A; Lafortune, S			Safe diagnosability for fault-tolerant supervision of discrete-event systems	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						discrete-event systems; fault diagnosis; fault-tolerant control; supervision; finite state machine	DIAGNOSIS	The problem of achieving fault-tolerant supervision of discrete-event systems is considered from the viewpoint of safe and timely diagnosis of unobservable faults. To this end, the new property of safe diagnosability is introduced and studied. Standard definitions of diagnosability of discrete-event systems deal with the problem of detecting the occurrence of unobservable fault events using model-based inferencing from observed sequences of events. In safe diagnosability, it is required in addition that fault detection occur prior to the execution of a given set of forbidden strings in the failed mode of operation of the system. For instance, this constraint could be required to prevent local faults from developing into failures that could cause safety hazards. If the system is safe diagnosable, reconfiguration actions could be forced upon the detection of faults prior to the execution of unsafe behaviour, thus achieving the objective of fault-tolerant supervision. Necessary and sufficient conditions for safe diagnosability are derived. In addition, the problem of explicitly considering safe diagnosability in controller design, termed "active safe diagnosis problem", is formulated and solved. A brief discussion of safe diagnosability for tuned models of discrete-event systems is also provided. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ribeiro, B				Ribeiro, B			Support vector machines for quality, monitoring in a plastic injection molding process	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						fault detection and diagnosis; kernel learning methods; model selection; radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNS); support vector machines (SVMs)	NEURAL NETWORKS; PARAMETERS	Support vector machines (SVMs) are receiving increased attention in different application domains for which neural networks (NNs) have had a prominent role. However, in quality monitoring little attention has been given to this more recent development encompassing a technique with foundations in statistic learning theory. In this paper, we compare C-SVM and v-SVM classifiers with radial basis function (RBF) NNs in, data sets corresponding to product faults in an industrial environment concerning a plastics injection molding machine. The goal is to monitor in-process data as a means of indicating product quality and to be able to respond quickly to unexpected process disturbances. Our approach based on SVMs exploits the first part of this goal. Model selection which amounts to search in hyperparameter space is performed for study of suitable condition monitoring. In the multiclass problem formulation presented, classification accuracy is reported for both strategies. Experimental results obtained thus far indicate improved generalization with the large margin classifier as well as better performance enhancing the strength and efficacy of the chosen model for the practical cage study.

This paper describes an experimental investigation on spur gears in which natural pitting was allowed to occur. Throughout the test period, AE, vibration and spectrometric oil samples were monitored continuously in order to correlate and compare these techniques to natural life degradation of the gears. It was observed that the AE technique was the most sensitive in detecting and monitoring pitting.

A neural network requires a large amount of training data, which is impractical to generate using a production machine for real-time predictive maintenance system. Hence, a simulation model, which mapped the system parameters to the motion current signature, was developed. The accuracy of the system, to predict the changes in the value of the machine system parameter, is a direct function of the validity of the simulated data. Thus, the objective validation of the simulation model is important to ascertain that the simulation model is accurate with regards to its purpose.

J	Wang, H; Huang, Q; Katz, R				Wang, H; Huang, Q; Katz, R			Multi-operational machining processes modeling for sequential root cause identification and measurement reduction	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; VARIATION TRANSMISSION; VARIATION PROPAGATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Variation propagation modeling has been proved to be an effective way for variation reduction and design synthesis in multi-operational manufacturing processes. However previously developed approaches for machining processes did not directly model the process physics regarding how fixture, and datum, and machine tool errors generate the same pattern on part features. Consequently, it is difficult to distinguish error sources at each operation. This paper formulates the variation propagation model using the proposed equivalent fixture error concept. With this concept, datum error and machine tool error are transformed to equivalent fixture locator errors at each operation. As a result, error sources can be grouped and root cause identification can be conducted in a sequential manner The case studies demonstrate the model validity through a real cutting experiment and model advantage in measurement reduction for root cause identification.

J	Kim, DH; Kim, SH; Song, JY				Kim, DH; Kim, SH; Song, JY			Diagnosing the cause of operational faults in machine tools with an open architecture CNC	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						open architecture CNC; diagnosing causes; operational faults; machine tools; diagnostic models	FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; CONTROLLER; SCHEME	The conventional computerized numerical controller (CNC) of machine tools has been increasingly replaced by a PC-based open architecture CNC (OAC) that is independent of a CNC vendor. The OAC and machine tools with an OAC have led to a convenient environment in which user-defined applications can be efficiently implemented within a CNC. This paper proposes a method of diagnosing the cause of operational faults. The method is based on the status of a programmable logic controller in machine tools with an OAC. An operational fault is defined as a disability that occurs during the normal operation of machine tools. Operational faults constitute more than 70 percent of all faults and are also unpredictable because most of them occur without any warning. To quickly and correctly diagnose the cause of an operational fault, two diagnostic models are proposed : the switching function and the step switching function. The cause of the fault is logically diagnosed through a fault diagnosis system using diagnostic models. A suitable interface environment between a CNC and developed application modules is constructed to implement the diagnostic functions in the CNC domain. The results of the diagnosis were displayed on a CNC monitor for machine operators and transmitted to a remote site through a Web browser. The proposed diagnostic method and its results were useful to unskilled machine operators and reduced the machine downtime.

J	Ouyang, J; Yang, M; Yoshikawa, H; Zhou, YP				Ouyang, J; Yang, M; Yoshikawa, H; Zhou, YP			Modeling of PWR plant by Multilevel Flow Model and its application in fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						multilevel flow model (MFM); PWR type reactors; pressurized water reactor plant; fault diagnosis; human-machine interface system		The paper describes the application of Multilevel Flow Modeling (MFM)-a modeling method in means-end and part-whole way, in interface design of supervisory control of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) plant, and automatic real-time fault diagnosis of PWR accident. The MFM decomposes the complex plant process from the main goal to each component at multiple levels to represent the contribution of each component to the whole system to make clear how the main goal of the system is achieved. The plant process is described abstractly in function level by mass, energy and information flows, which represent the interaction between different components and enable the causal reasoning between functions according to the flow properties. Thus, in the abnormal status, a goal-function-component oriented fault diagnosis can be performed with the model at a very quick speed and abnormal alarms can be fully explained by the reasoning relationship of the model. In this paper, an interface design of the PWR plant is built by the conception of means-end and part-whole by using MFM, and several simulation cases are used for evaluating the fault diagnosis performance. The results show that the system has a good ability to detect and diagnose accidents timely before reactor trip.

J	Shi, DF; Qu, LS; Gindy, NN				Shi, DF; Qu, LS; Gindy, NN			General interpolated fast Fourier transform: A new tool for diagnosing large rotating machinery	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							SIGNALS; ANALYZER; FFT	Vibration monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machinery is an important part of a predictive maintenance program to reduce operating and maintenance costs. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis, the general interpolated fast Fourier transform (GIFFT) is introduced in this paper In comparison to present interpolated fast Fourier transform, this new approach can deal with any type of window functions and possesses high accuracy and robust performance, especially coping with a small number of sampling points. Then, for the purpose of rotating machinery diagnosis, the harmonic vibration ellipse and orbit is reconstructed based on the GIFFT to extract the features of faults and remove the interference from environmental noise and some irrelevant components. This novel scheme is proving to be very effective and reliable in diagnosing several types of malfunctions in gas turbines and compressors and characterizing of the transient behavior of rotating machinery in the run-up stage.

Specifically, vibration signals measured from a bearing test bed were decomposed into a number of frequency sub-bands, and key features associated with each sub-band were selected, based on the Fisher linear discriminant criterion. The key features were then used as inputs to a neural network classifiers for assessing the system's health status. Comparing to the conventional approach where statistical parameters from raw vibration signals are used, the presented approach enables higher signal-to-noise ratios and consequently, more effective and intelligent use of the available sensor information. leading to more accurate system health evaluation.

Performance characteristics of the drive system are obtained under normal operation through a discrete-time, lumped-parameter network model. The model is modified to accommodate a short circuit across certain number of turns on one stator phase. Fault current is introduced as an additional state variable in fault cases. A comparative study between system performance under healthy and faulty operations is conducted. Faulty performance is experimentally measured via a specialty wound machine at different operating conditions and various numbers of shorted turns. Good agreement between analytical and experimental results is obtained. Findings of this work can be used to develop fault detection schemes of the system under consideration.

SVM is powerful for the problem with small sampling, nonlinear and high dimension. A multi-layer SVM classifier is applied to fault diagnosis of power transformer for the first time in this paper. Content of five diagnostic gases dissolved in oil obtained by dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is preprocessed through a special data processing, and six features are extracted for SVMs. Then the multi-layer SVM classifier is trained with the training samples which are extracted by the above data processing. Finally, the four fault types of transformer are identified by the trained classifier. The test results show that the classifier has an excellent performance on training speed and reliability.

The objective of this analysis is to establish the possibility of using the estimation strategy signals for fault diagnosis in variable-speed electric drives. This strategy is based on the effect produced by inductance variation on the zero-sequence voltage, when exciting the motor with a predefined inverter switching pattern. Experimental results illustrate the feasibility of the proposal.

The method consists of an embedded model to identify gear meshing stiffness from measured gear torsional vibration, an inverse method to estimate crack size from the estimated meshing stiffness; a gear dynamic model to simulate gear meshing dynamics and determine the dynamic load on the cracked tooth; and a fast crack propagation model to forecast the remaining useful life based on the estimated crack size and dynamic load. The fast crack propagation model was established to avoid repeated calculations of FEM and facilitate field deployment of the proposed method. Experimental studies were conducted to validate and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for prognosis of a cracked gear. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, JD; Hung, RJ				Wu, JD; Hung, RJ			Design of an adaptive line enhancement system using a variable step-size affine-projection algorithm	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						adaptive line enhancement; fault diagnosis; affine-projection algorithm	PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; NOISE; VIBRATION; MACHINERY; SINUSOIDS; SIGNALS	This paper presents design of an adaptive line enhancement (ALE) system for improving sensor response using a variable step-size affine-projection algorithm (VSS APA). ALE is an adaptive technique that may be used to detect a periodic signal buried in a broadband noise background such as in rotating machinery fault diagnosis. However, most of the conventional methods for ALE system are based primarily on an adaptive filter with the least-mean-square (LMS) error algorithm. Unfortunately, convergence speed is limited when a filtering plant is varied, because the learning process of the adaptive algorithm fails to respond quickly enough to the changing operational conditions. This study proposed a VSS APA for improving both the convergence speed and the performance of the ALE system. Two applications were conducted to compare the pecformance of the proposed algorithm and various traditional adaptive filtering algorithms. The first application used the proposed ALE system to improve the response of a wheel speed sensor output signal; the other was used for reducing the background noise during rotating machinery fault diagnosis. Both the experimental results indicated that the ALE with VSS APA has an effective performance and convergence for both applications. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate representations of these faults enable the construction of constrained approximation models that can successfully overcome common problems such as over-smoothing. In this paper we review an existing method for detecting fault lines and present a new detection approach based on data triangulations and discrete Gaussian curvature (DGC). Furthermore, we show that if the fault line can be described non-parametrically, then accurate support vector machine (SVM) models can be constructed that are independent of the type of triangulation used in the detection algorithms. We shall also see that SVM models are particularly effective when the data produced by the detection algorithms are noisy. We compare the performances of the various new and established models.

J	Liu, B				Liu, B			Selection of wavelet packet basis for rotating machinery fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Wavelet packets provide a library of orthonormal bases and can therefore represent a signal in many different ways. This paper presents a method to select the orthonormal basis to represent vibration signals for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The selected basis is formed by two sets of basis functions for representation of the transients excited by localized faults and other signal components of interest, respectively. This method overcomes the limitation of the widely used Coifman and Wickerhauser's best basis algorithm in detection of transients hidden in large background vibration and is more effective in rotating machinery fault diagnosis especially in the early stage of fault development. In addition, differing from some existing studies, this method does not need training samples and is relatively easy to implement in practice. Applications in the analysis of gearbox and bearing vibration signals show that the proposed method performs better than the best basis algorithm. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TraceBack provides debugging information for production systems by providing execution history data about program problems (such as crashes, hangs, and exceptions). TraceBack supports features commonly found in production environments such as multiple threads, dynamically loaded modules, multiple source languages (e.g., Java applications running with JNI modules written in C++), and distributed execution across multiple computers. TraceBack supports first fault diagnosis-discovering what went wrong the first time a fault is encountered. The user can see how the program reached the fault state without having to re-run the computation; in effect enabling a limited form of a debugger in production code. TraceBack uses static, binary program analysis to inject low-overhead runtime instrumentation at control-flow block granularity. Post-facto reconstruction of the records written by the instrumentation code produces a source-statement trace for user diagnosis. The trace shows the dynamic instruction sequence leading up to the fault state, even when the program took exceptions or terminated abruptly (e.g., kill -9). We have implemented TraceBack on a variety of architectures and operating systems, and present examples from a variety of platforms. Performance overhead is variable, from 5% for Apache running SPECweb99, to 16%-25% for the Java SPECJbb benchmark, to 60% average for SPECint2000. We show examples of TraceBack's cross-language and cross-machine abilities, and report its use in diagnosing problems in production software.

However, the large amount of data generated by microarrays requires effective reduction of discriminant gene features into reliable sets of tumor biomarkers for such multiclass tumor discrimination. The availability of reliable sets of biomarkers, especially serum biomarkers, should have a major impact on our understanding and treatment of cancer. Results: We have combined genetic algorithm (GA) and all paired (AP) support vector machine (SVM) methods for multiclass cancer categorization. Predictive features can be automatically determined through iterative GA/SVM, leading to very compact sets of non-redundant cancer-relevant genes with the best classification performance reported to date. Interestingly, these different classifier sets harbor only modest overlapping gene features but have similar levels of accuracy in leave-one-out cross-validations (LOOCV). Further characterization of these optimal tumor discriminant features, including the use of nearest shrunken centroids (NSC), analysis of annotations and literature text mining, reveals previously unappreciated tumor subclasses and a series of genes that could be used as cancer biomarkers. With this approach, we believe that microarray-based multiclass molecular analysis can be an effective tool for cancer biomarker discovery and subsequent molecular cancer diagnosis.

Performance of the drive under normal and short-circuit conditions are obtained through classical lumped-parameter network models. Waveforms of the electromagnetic torque and summation of phase voltages are monitored to develop two independent diagnostic algorithms. Diagnostic indices derived from the characteristic waveforms using discrete Fourier transform (DFT) lead to identifying the number of shorted turns. Fault location is achieved through a different set of indices extracted by the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) are trained based on simulation results to automate the diagnostic process. ANFIS testing along with the good agreement between simulated and measured waveforms show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

The theoretical aspects underlying the use of this diagnostic technique are presented but a major emphasis is given to the integration of the diagnostic system into the digital-signal-processor (DSP) board containing the control algorithm. Taking advantage of the sensors already built in the drive for control purposes, it is possible to implement this diagnostic system at no additional cost, thus giving a surplus value to the drive itself. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to diagnose stator faults and demonstrate the possibility of its integration in the DSP board.

J	Ayhan, B; Chow, MY; Song, MH				Ayhan, B; Chow, MY; Song, MH			Multiple signature processing-based fault detection schemes for broken rotor bar in induction motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						broken rotor bar; discriminant analysis; fault diagnosis; induction motors; monitoring	DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES	The existence of broken rotor bars in induction motors can be detected by monitoring any abnormality of the spectrum amplitudes at certain frequencies in the motor current spectrum. It has been shown that these broken rotor bar-specific frequencies are settled around the fundamental stator current frequency and are termed lower and upper sideband components. Broken rotor bar fault detection schemes should depend on multiple signatures in order to overcome or reduce the effect of any misinterpretation of the signatures that are obscured by factors such as measurement noises and different load conditions. Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) provides an appropriate environment to develop such fault detection schemes because of its multi-input processing capabilities. The focus of this paper is to provide a new fault detection methodology for broken rotor bar fault detection and diagnostics in terms of its multiple signature processing feature and the motor operation partitioning concept to improve the overall detection performance. This paper describes two fault detection schemes within this methodology, and demonstrates that multiple signature processing is more efficient than single signature processing. The first scheme, which will be named the "monolith scheme," is based on a single large-scale MDA unit representing the complete operating load torque region of the motor, while the second scheme, which will be named the "partition scheme " consists of many small-scale MDA units, each unit representing a particular load torque operating region.

The hybrid approach unites real degradation measures with analytical, stochastic failure models to numerically compute the distributions and their moments. Two distinct models are shown to perform well when compared with simulated data. Moreover, results obtained from the second model are compared with empirically generated lifetimes of 2024-T3 aluminum alloy specimens. The numerical experiments indicate that the proposed techniques are useful for remaining lifetime prognosis in both cases.

J	Peng, Z; Kessissoglou, NJ; Cox, M				Peng, Z; Kessissoglou, NJ; Cox, M			A study of the effect of contaminant particles in lubricants using wear debris and vibration condition monitoring techniques	WEAR			English	Article						wear debris analysis; vibration analysis; machine condition monitoring; gearboxes; contaminant particles; lubrication	OIL	Vibration and wear debris analyses are the two main conditions monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. These two techniques have their unique advantages and disadvantages associated with the monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. When these techniques are conducted independently, only a portion of machine faults are typically diagnosed. However, practical experience has shown that integrating these two techniques in a machine condition monitoring program provides greater and more reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. The objective of this work is to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and wear debris analysis. This was achieved by investigating different operating conditions of an experimental rig, consisting of a worm gearbox driven by an electric motor. The worm gearbox was initially run under normal operating conditions as a comparative test. A series of tests were then conducted corresponding to lack of proper lubrication, and with different contaminant particles added to the various lubricants. Oil samples and vibration data were regularly collected. Numerical data produced by wear debris analysis were compared with vibration spectra, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the two condition monitoring techniques. The results from this paper have given more understanding on the dependent and independent roles of vibration and wear debris analyses in predicting and diagnosing machine faults.

J	Fructus, D; Clamond, D; Grue, J; Kristiansen, O				Fructus, D; Clamond, D; Grue, J; Kristiansen, O			An efficient model for three-dimensional surface wave simulations - Part 1: Free space problems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						surface waves; fully nonlinear; three-dimensional; boundary integral formulation; pseudo-spectral method; rapid Dirichlet to Neumann operator	BOUNDARY INTEGRAL METHOD; DEEP-WATER; NONLINEAR GRAVITY; COMPUTATION; INSTABILITY; STABILITY; DYNAMICS	An efficient numerical scheme for simulations of fully nonlinear non-breaking surface water waves in 3D is presented. The water depth is either shallow, finite or infinite. The method is based on a fast, rapidly converging, iterative algorithm to compute the Dirichlet to Neumann operator. This is evaluated by expanding the operator as a sum of global convolution terms and local integrals with kernels that decay quickly in space. The global terms are computed very quickly via FFT. The local terms are evaluated by numerical integration. Analytical integration of the linear part of the prognostic equations in Fourier space is obtained to machine precision. The remaining nonlinear components are integrated forward in time using an RK-scheme combined with a special step size control technique. This yields a very stable and accurate time marching procedure. Zeros-padding in the spectral space represents the anti-aliasing strategy. The method requires no smoothing. Illustration through examples show that the total energy is well conserved during the numerical simulations. The scheme is stable and accurate, even for very long time simulations of very steep wave events. The scheme is easily parallelizable. It propagates for example a Stokes wave of slope 0.2985 with a phase shift error of about 0.3 degrees after 1000 periods of propagation. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Roy, N; Ganguli, R				Roy, N; Ganguli, R			Helicopter rotor blade frequency evolution with damage growth and signal processing	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FATIGUE DAMAGE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MEDIAN FILTERS; FUZZY-LOGIC; LIFE; PREDICTION; PROGNOSIS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEM; MODEL	Structural damage in materials evolves over time due to growth of fatigue cracks in homogenous materials and a complicated process of matrix cracking, delamination, fiber breakage and fiber matrix debonding in composite materials. In this study, a finite element model of the helicopter rotor blade is used to analyze the effect of damage growth on the modal frequencies in a qualitative manner. Phenomenological models of material degradation for homogenous and composite materials are used. Results show that damage can be detected by monitoring changes in lower as well as higher mode flap (out-of-plane bending), lag (in-plane bending) and torsion rotating frequencies, especially for composite materials where the onset of the last stage of damage of fiber breakage is most critical. Curve fits are also proposed for mathematical modeling of the relationship between rotating frequencies and cycles. Finally, since operational data are noisy and also contaminated with outliers, denoising algorithms based on recursive median filters; and radial basis function neural networks and wavelets are studied and compared with a moving average filter using simulated data for improved health-monitoring application. A novel recursive median filter is designed using integer programming through genetic algorithm and is found to have comparable performance to neural networks with much less complexity and is better than wavelet denoising for outlier removal. This filter is proposed as a tool for denoising time series of damage indicators. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Venkatasubramanian, V				Venkatasubramanian, V			Prognostic and diagnostic monitoring of complex systems for product lifecycle management: Challenges and opportunities	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-14)	MAY 16-19, 2004	Lisbon, PORTUGAL			product lifecycle management; diagnostic systems; process hazards analysis; abnormal events management	STRATEGIES	Modern technological advances have resulted in a myriad of complex systems, processes and products. These increasingly complicated processes, systems and products pose considerable challenges in their design, analysis, manufacturing and management for successful operation and use over their lifecycles. In the process industries, for example, the maintenance and management of complex process equipment and processes, and their integrated operation, play a crucial role in ensuring the safety of plant personnel and the environment as well as the timely delivery of quality products. In the discrete parts industries, such as the auto industry, many product malfunctions are due to unanticipated dynamic interactions due to repeated use or misuse of components. These interactions thrive in complex systems when the combined effects of uncertainty and operational adversity are not properly addressed either in design or in operation. Given the size, scope and complexity of the systems and interactions, it is becoming increasingly difficult for plant personnel to anticipate, diagnose and control serious abnormal events in a timely manner. Hence, it should come as no surprise that human operators tend to make erroneous decisions and take actions which make matters even worse, as reported in the literature. All these cost the companies and consumers in billions of dollars every year in product lifecycle management. Businesses and federal organizations are increasingly required to manage their entire products' lifecycles to avoid costly failure or degradation in performance through service/maintenance, more robust design and control, and so on. These product lifecycle management (PLM) issues present us with both major challenges and opportunities. There exist considerable incentives in developing appropriate prognostic and diagnostic methodologies for monitoring, analyzing, interpreting and controlling such abnormal events in complex systems and processes. People in the process and product industries view this as the next major challenge in control systems research and application. In this paper, we will present an overview of these challenges and the opportunities. Recent progress has promising implications on the use of intelligent systems for product lifecycle management applications in the chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and discrete parts manufacturing industries.

J	Yang, BS; Lim, DS; Tan, ACC				Yang, BS; Lim, DS; Tan, ACC			VIBEX: an expert system for vibration fault diagnosis of rotating machinery using decision tree and decision table	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						expert system; diagnosis; decision tree; decision table; rotating machinery; vibration		This paper proposes an expert system called VIBEX (VIBration EXpert) to aid plant operators in diagnosing the cause of abnormal vibration for rotating machinery. In order to automatize the diagnosis, a decision table based on the cause-symptom matrix is used as a probabilistic method for diagnosing abnormal vibration. Also a decision tree is used as the acquisition of structured knowledge in the form of concepts is introduced to build a knowledge base which is indispensable for vibration expert systems. The decision tree is a technique used for building knowledge-based systems by the inductive inference from examples and plays a role itself as a vibration diagnostic tool. The proposed system has been successfully implemented on Microsoft Windows environment and is written in Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual C++. To validate the system performance, the diagnostic system was tested with some examples using the two diagnostic methods. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lin, WM; Lin, CH; Tasy, W				Lin, WM; Lin, CH; Tasy, W			Transformer-fault diagnosis by integrating field data and standard codes with training enhancible adaptive probabilistic network	IEE PROCEEDINGS-GENERATION TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION			English	Article							EXPERT-SYSTEM	A transformer-fault diagnosis system (TFDS) using a probabilistic neural network (PNN) and IEC/Cigre standard codes is proposed. Many artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been proposed before, however, the slow repeated iterative process and poor adaptation capability for structural data restrains the ANN applications. An effective and flexible PNN could overcome these drawbacks. In this paper, a PNN analyses the transformer's dissolved gas content to identify faults, while using the gas ratios of the oil and cellulosic decomposition to create training examples. Retraining can be done by adding new examples and new hidden nodes for easy adaptation without doing any computed iteration. The commonly used Excel was integrated to provide a convenient man-machine interface.

The conventional VMM requires the measured voltages, currents, and the signal of a rotor position sensor. The novel scheme presented in this paper alternatively works without a rotor position sensor. In particular, for low-inertia drives, accurate estimation of rotor position is required. The rotor-fault-related double-slip-frequency torque modulation causes a speed ripple with the same frequency. Consequently, low-inertia drives are exposed to higher speed ripples. In this case, it is not sufficient to estimate the mean value of the actual speed, only. Even the speed ripple has to be acquired to benefit from the accuracy of the employed models of the VMM. The proposed technique evaluates the signatures of an inherent rotor fault in order to determine the rotor position signal. The speed ripple can be obtained from the torque modulations that the models already compute. This way, an accurate rotor fault detection technique without rotor position sensor can be realized.

J	Kim, DH; Kim, SH; Koh, KS				Kim, DH; Kim, SH; Koh, KS			CNC-implemented fault diagnosis and web-based remote services	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						open architecture controller; CNC; fault diagnosis; remote services	FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; OPEN-ARCHITECTURE CONTROLLER; MACHINE	Recently, the conventional controller of machine-tool has been increasingly replaced by the PC-based open architecture controller, which is independent of the CNC vendor and on which it is possible to implement user-defined application programs. This paper proposes CNC-implemented fault diagnosis and web-based remote services for machine-tool with open architecture CNC. The faults of CNC machine-tool are defined as the operational faults occupied by over 70% of all faults. The operational faults are unpredictable as they occur without any warning. Two diagnostic models, the switching function and the step switching function, were proposed in order to diagnose faults efficiently. The faults were automatically diagnosed through the fault diagnosis system using the two diagnostic models. A suitable interface environment between CNC and developed application modules was constructed for the internal function of CNC. In addition, a suitable web environment was constructed for remote services. The web service functions, such as remote monitoring and remote control, were implemented, and their operability was tested through the web. The results obtained through this research could be a model of fault diagnosis and remote servicing for machine-tool with open architecture CNC.

Based on a signal model and a discussion on to what extent a good bearing monitoring method should trust it, we present several analysis tools for bearing condition monitoring and conclude that wavelets are especially well suited for this task. Then we describe a large-scale evaluation of several different automatic bearing monitoring methods using 103 laboratory and industrial environment test signals for which the true condition of the bearing is known from visual inspection. We describe the four best performing methods in detail (two wavelet-based, and two based on envelope and periodisation techniques). In our basic implementation, without using historical data or adapting the methods to (roughly) known machine or signal parameters, the four best methods had 9-13% error rate and are all good candidates for further fine-tuning and optimisation. Especially for the wavelet-based methods, there are several potentially performance improving additions, which we finally summarise into a guiding list of suggestion. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrated decision-making within these autonomous controllers can enhance the performance of these systems. In this paper, it is hypothesized that a significant improvement in performance can be realized by taking process control decisions in Conjunction with condition monitoring and machine maintenance decisions in a distributed environment. An architecture is proposed for unifying process control and condition-based maintenance scheduling. Sensory information indicative of the current condition of the machine is also provided to autonomous controllers to enable estimation of the remaining useful lifetime of the machine. Estimates of the remaining lifetime of the machine and the scheduled maintenance time are then used to adjust the set points for the operating parameters and modify the maintenance schedules for the maintenance crew, respectively. The proposed architecture is presented and exemplified using a case study of laser-based free-forming process. The results indicate that the architecture can adjust the operating parameters and develop new maintenance schedules based on the changes of the machine condition.

SVM is powerful for the problem with small sampling, nonlinear and high dimension. A multi-layer SVM classifier is applied to fault diagnosis of power transformer for the first time in this paper. Content of five diagnostic gases dissolved in oil obtained by dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is preprocessed through a special data processing, and six features are extracted for SVMs. Then, the multi-layer SVM classifier is trained with the training samples, which are extracted by the above data processing. Finally, the four fault types of transformer are identified by the trained classifier. The test results show that the classifier has an excellent performance on training speed and reliability.

J	Scoville, JT; Walker, ML				Scoville, JT; Walker, ML			Automatic fault-checking system on the DIII-D tokamak	FUSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Topical Meeting on the Technology of Fusion Energy	SEP 14-16, 2004	Madison, WI					Modern tokamaks are highly sophisticated devices consisting of a large number of state-of-the-art systems that must function in unison to obtain a successful plasma discharge. An unsuccessful discharge can result if one or more systems fail, and diagnosis in an efficient and timely manner can be difficult. The resulting reduction in tokamak availability and productivity can be expensive, justifying a significant effort for automated fault diagnosis. For the DIII-D tokamak, a software system has been used for the past 5 years to automatically monitor and test the performance of hundreds of tokamak systems. The Fault Identification and Communication System (FICS) is automatically triggered to run immediately after each tokamak discharge and report its results via a simple color-coded graphical user interface. In addition to saving the operator time, the significant advantage of FICS is its ability to detect insipient faults that could lead to future machine failures. It has been estimated that FICS has saved an average of one to two shots per day, which equates to approximately 5 % of all DIII-D pulses. The significant experience gained through the development and use of this post-discharge analysis tool also provides insight into future methods for on-line process monitoring of steady state devices.

However their on-site application is a rather difficult task as PD information is generally superimposed with electromagnetic disturbances. These disturbances affect negatively all known PD evaluation systems. Especially the detection and suppression of stochastically distributed pulse shaped disturbances is a major problem. To determine such disturbances fast machine intelligent recognition systems are being developed. Three different strategies based on digital signal processing are discussed in this paper, while focusing on time resolved neural signal recognition. The system investigated more closely is currently able to distinguish between PD pulses and disturbances with the disturbances' values being ten times higher than the peak values of the PD pulses. Therefore a measuring system acquires the input data in the VHF range (20-100 MHz). The discrimination of the pulses is performed in real time in time domain using fast neural network hardware. With that signal recognition system a noise reassessed phase resolved pulse sequence (PRPS) data set in the CIGRE data format is generated that can be the input source of most PD evaluation software. Optionally a noise reassessed analogue data stream can be generated that is suitable for any conventional PD measuring system.

Different from the traditional Fault Section Estimation methods, the proposed approach uses measurements available at the substation, circuit breaker and relay statuses. The data is analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique and the faults are classified according to the reactances of their path using a combination of support vector classifiers (SVCs) and feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). A practical 52 bus distribution system with loads is considered for studies, and the results presented show that the proposed approach of fault location gives accurate results in terms of the estimated fault location. Practical situations in distribution systems, such as protective devices placed only at the substation, all types of faults, and a wide range of varying short circuit levels, are considered for studies. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed method in practical distribution system fault diagnosis.

The methodology enables rapid root-cause diagnostics for faster ramp-up of reconfigurable systems through integration of the Reconfigurable Inspection Machine (RIM) and the Stream of Variations (SoV) methodology. The RIM enables reconfigurable, rapid, and accurate inspection using non-contact sensors while the SoV methodology is used to quickly analyze the measurements and identify the root-cause of the errors produced during machining. The feasibility of the industrial concept was experimentally validated. A machining error was introduced during machining of an engine head.

J	Marzi, H				Marzi, H			High-speed RT monitoring system using neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Embedded and Hybrid Systems Conference	MAY 11-13, 2005	Singapore, SINGAPORE			neural networks; condition monitoring; real-time fault diagnosis; LVQ		This paper describes a high-speed reconfigurable neural networks for monitoring operational status of automated machinery. Continuous operation of precision machines may change their system performance due to wear, deterioration, or failure. A Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) based technique is developed that is capable of monitoring system status accurately, and updating its knowledge base with new heuristic data. This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are initially available. In these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failures. A hard real-time system is designed and implemented. An early-waming system monitors sensitive parameters of pressure and current sensors. Their variations beyond a defined healthy threshold trigger a non-destructive testing, which produces transient signals. Correlating the transient pattern of a fault with a database of known failures determines the severity and degree of deterioration of the system. Vigorous tests on real machines indicated an accuracy of 92.3% for the LVQ based monitoring system.

J	Shi, WF; Tang, TH				Shi, WF; Tang, TH			The development and application of a marine power system simulator for marine engineer training	MARINE TECHNOLOGY AND SNAME NEWS			English	Article								For marine engineer training, marine power system analysis and fault diagnoses, a marine power system simulator (MPSS) is proposed here. It has been developed by applying system simulation techniques. The main techniques employed were marine power system modeling, microcomputer control, and local area network communication. Some functions and typical fault simulations produced with the MPSS are introduced. These operations are particularly useful for marine engineer training. A marine power system model is built by applying the power system dynamic stability theory. The power system model is the most important element in the simulator. The system model is made of a diesel engine generator, induction motor, power network, and so on. Many simulation results were obtained, such as starting the lubricating oil pump and a power network three-phase ground fault. Because the system offers online control, local area network communication, and human-machine interface of information, this MPSS is used extensively in marine engineer training where the standard is professional skill in marine electrical technology. The system has been used to meet the standards of the STCW78/95 international convention in many marine companies and training centers in China with good results.

Primary load and engagement shear drivers (i.e., torque, speed, and clutch surface temperature) are modeled using a first principles approach. An extension of Archard's law is presented in which life usage is predicted by using multiple stochastic models to determine a wear coefficient for each applicable wear mechanism. These models consider the physical wear process, including debris-particle and protective-layer formation, using parameters such as surface roughness, particle size, and surface temperature. These stochastic variables are evaluated in a probabilistic,framework, using statistical methods such as Monte Carlo and importance sampling, which consider both measurement and modeling uncertainty. Confidence interval prognostic results are provided to predict the RUL of the clutch throughout its limited life in near-real time.

J	Baruah, P; Chinnam, RB				Baruah, P; Chinnam, RB			HMMs for diagnostics and prognostics in machining processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						diagnostics; Hidden-Markov-models; process monitoring; prognostics; remaining useful life		Despite considerable advances over the last two decades in sensing instrumentation and information technology infrastructure, monitoring and diagnostics technology has not yet found its place in health management of mainstream machinery and equipment. This is in spite of numerous studies reporting that the expected savings from widespread deployment of condition-based maintenance (CBM) technology would be in the tens of billions of dollars in many industrial sectors as well as in governmental agencies. It turns out that a prerequisite to widespread deployment of CBM technology and practice in industry is cost efficient and effective diagnostics and prognostics. This paper presents a novel method for employing hidden Markov models (HMMs) for carrying out both diagnostic as well as prognostic activities for metal cutting tools. The methods employ HMMs for modelling sensor signals emanating from the machine ( or features thereof), and in turn, identify the health state of the cutting tool as well as facilitate estimation of remaining useful life. This paper also investigates some of the underlying issues of proper HMM design and training for the express purpose of effective diagnostics and prognostics. The proposed methods were validated on a physical test-bed, a vertical drilling machine. Experimental results are very promising.

Artificial neural networks have been used to detect machine faults for a number of years and shown to be highly successful in this application area. This paper presents a novel test technique for machine fault detection and classification in electro-mechanical machinery from vibration measurements using one-class support vector machines (SVMs). In order to evaluate one-class SVMs, this paper examines the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with that of multilayer perception, one of the artificial neural network techniques, based on real benchmarking data.

During early hardware bring-up, the ability, to run in a cycle-reprodueible manner on both hardware and VHDL proved invaluable in fault isolation and analysis. However, ADE is also capable of supporting high-performance applications and parallel test cases, thereby permitting us to stress the hardware to the limits of its capabilities. This paper also provides insights into system level and device-level programming of Blue Gene/L to assist dei;elopers of high-performance applications to more fully exploit the performance of the machine.

It avoids unexpected failure of a critical system. Approximately 30-40% of faults of induction motors are stator faults. This paper presents a comprehensive review of various stator faults, their causes, detection parameters/techniques, and latest trends in the condition monitoring technology. It is aimed at providing a broad perspective on the status of stator fault monitoring to researchers and application engineers using induction motors. A list of 183 research publications on the subject is appended for quick reference.

J	Yang, BS; Han, T; Hwang, WW				Yang, BS; Han, T; Hwang, WW			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on multi-class support vector machines	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fault diagnosis; support vector machine; rotating machinery; multi-class classification	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION	Support vector machines (SVMs) have become one of the most popular approaches to learning from examples and have many potential applications in science and engineering. However, their applications in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery are rather limited. Most of the published papers focus on some special fault diagnoses. This study covers the overall diagnosis procedures on most of the faults experienced in rotating machinery and examines the performance of different SVMs strategies. The excellent characteristics of SVMs are demonstrated by comparing the results obtained by artificial neural networks (ANNs) using vibration signals of a fault simulator.

J	Tan, CK; Mba, D				Tan, CK; Mba, D			Limitation of acoustic emission for identifying seeded defects in gearboxes	JOURNAL OF NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION			English	Article						acoustic emission; condition monitoring; gear fault diagnosis; gear defect identification	SPEED ROTATING MACHINERY	Acoustic Emissions (AE) is gaining ground as a Nonestructive Technique (NDT) for health diagnosis on rotating machinery. Vast opportunities exist for development of the AE technique on various forms of rotating machinery, including gearboxes. This paper reviews recent developments in application of AE to gear defect diagnosis. Furthermore, experimental results are presented that examine and explore the effectiveness of AE for gear defect diagnosis. It is concluded that application of AE to artificially seeded gear defect detection is fraught with difficulties, particularly for fault identification. In addition, the viability of the AE technique for gear defect detection by making observations from nonrotating components of a machine is called into question. Nevertheless, guidance is offered on applying the technique for monitoring the natural wear of gears.

Design: The selection criteria of the ACP journal Club for articles in internal medicine were the basis for identifying high-quality articles in the areas of etiology, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. Naive Bayes, a specialized AdaBoost algorithm, and linear and polynomial support vector machines were applied to identify these articles. Measurements: The machine learning models were compared in each category with each other and with the clinical query filters using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves, 11-point average recall precision, and a sensitivity/specificity match method. Results: In most categories, the data-induced models have better or comparable sensitivity, specificity, and precision than the clinical query filters. The polynomial support vector machine models perform the best among all learning methods in ranking the articles as evaluated by area under the receiver operating curve and 11-point average recall precision. Conclusion: This research shows that, using machine learning methods, it is possible to automatically build models for retrieving high-quality, content-specific articles using inclusion or citation by the ACP journal Club as a gold standard in a given time period in internal medicine that perform better than the 1994 PubMed clinical query filters.

GP has been applied to a variety of problems which are too wide to reasonably enumerate. As far as the authors are aware, it has rarely been used in condition monitoring (CM). In this paper, GP is used to detect faults in rotating machinery. Featuresets from two different machines are used to examine the performance of two-class normal/fault recognition. The results are compared with a few other methods for fault detection: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used in this field for many years, while support vector machines (SVMs) also offer successful solutions. For ANNs and SVMs, genetic algorithms have been used to do feature selection, which is an inherent function of GP. In all cases, the GP demonstrates performance which equals or betters that of the previous best performing approaches on these data sets. The training times are also found to be considerably shorter than the other approaches, whilst the generated classification rules are easy to understand and independently validate.

J	Li, ZN; Wu, ZT; He, YY; Chu, FL				Li, ZN; Wu, ZT; He, YY; Chu, FL			Hidden Markov model-based fault diagnostics method in speed-up and speed-down process for rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						hidden Markov model (HMM); fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; pattern classification; speed-up and speed-down process		It is very important to ensure that the large rotating machinery operates safely and reliably. The behaviour characteristics of the speed-up and speed-down process in a rotating machinery possess the distinct diagnostic value. The abundant information, non-stationarity, poor repeatability and reproducibility in the speed-up and speed-down process lead to the necessity to find the corresponding approach of feature extraction and fault recognition. The Hidden Markov model (HMM) is very suitable for modelling the dynamic time series, and has a strong capability of pattern classification, especially for a signal with abundant information, non-stationarity, poor repeatability and reproducibility. At the same time, HMM can process the random long sequences in theory. Based on these features, HMM is very suitable for the signal from the speed-up and speed-down process in rotating machinery. As a result, HMM is introduced to the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, and a new HMM-based approach of the fault diagnosis for the speed-up and speed-down process is proposed. The main idea of the proposed approach is that the feature vectors, which are obtained by the FFT, wavelet transform, bispectrum, etc., are used as fault features, respectively, and the HMMs as the classifiers to recognise the faults of the speed-up and speed-down process in rotating machinery. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This decomposition creates an opportunity for implementing distributed data mining where features are extracted from different wavelet packet bases and served as feature vectors for applications. This paper presents a novel approach for integrated machine fault diagnosis based on localised wavelet packet bases of vibration signals. The best basis is firstly determined according to its classification capability. Data mining is then applied to extract features and local decisions are drawn using Bayesian inference. A final conclusion is reached using a weighted average method in data fusion. A case study on rolling element bearing diagnosis shows that this approach can greatly improve the accuracy of diagnosis.

J	Peng, ZK; Chu, FL; Tse, PW				Peng, ZK; Chu, FL; Tse, PW			Detection of the rubbing-caused impacts for rotor-stator fault diagnosis using reassigned scalogram	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							RUB-IMPACT; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SYSTEM; LOCATION	Impacts generated from the surface of a stator rubbing against the surface of a rotor during its rotation is a common defective phenomenon which often occurs in a rotating machine. The rubbing often occurs at the positions with small clearances in rotating machinery. This defect may deteriorate rapidly and finally cause the catastrophic breakdown of the machine. It will not only interrupt services or production, but also lead to substantial economic loss. To further understand the rubbing-caused impacts, a detailed analysis is presented in this paper to explain the cause of rubbing, its occurrence and phenomenon if the severity of rubbing becomes serious. A comparison has also been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of monitoring the rubbing-caused impacts by using conventional scalograms and reassigned scalograms. The results show that when rubbing occurs, its impacts lead to an increase of magnitudes not only at the fundamental rotational frequency and its harmonies, but also at some high-frequency components. The more severe the rubbing, the higher and the more components at high frequencies. Both the simulated rubbing signals and experimental rubbing signals collected from a test rig have proven that the method of reassigned scalograms is more effective in measuring rubbing-caused impacts as it can provide a better concentration of impacts with less interference. Moreover, the exact occurrence time and frequency of impacts are also easier to be identified. In summary, the phenomenon of having more high-frequency components due to the increasing severity in rubbing, and the clear identification of impacts provided by reassigned scalograms, can definitely help a machine operator to detect the occurrence and determine the severity of rubbing occurring between the stator and the rotor of a rotary machinery.

J	Wu, JD; Huang, CW; Chen, JC				Wu, JD; Huang, CW; Chen, JC			An order-tracking technique for the diagnosis of faults in rotating machineries using a variable step-size affine projection algorithm	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; order tracking; VSS APA; adaptive filter; rotating machinery	PROCESS MODEL KNOWLEDGE; SIGNALS	This paper describes principles and applications of an adaptive order tracking diagnosis technique for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. An adaptive high-resolution order tracking method with a variable step-size affine-projection algorithm (VSS APA) is used to diagnose faults in the gear-set and centrifugal fan blades. In comparison with conventional order-tracking methods such as recursive least-square filtering algorithm, the proposed VSS APA technique has fast convergence speed for adaptive filtering process. The VSS APA-based order-tracking technique can overcome problems encountered in FFT based methods. The smearing problem is treated as the tracking of frequency-varying band-pass signals. Ordered amplitudes can be calculated with high-resolution adaptive filter algorithm after experimental implementations carried out to evaluate the proposed algorithm in gear-set and centrifugal fan blades defect diagnosis. The experimental result indicates that the proposed algorithm is effective in rotating machinery fault diagnosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bai, MS; Huang, JM; Hong, MH; Su, FC				Bai, MS; Huang, JM; Hong, MH; Su, FC			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery using an intelligent order tracking system	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								This research focuses on the development of an intelligent diagnostic system for rotating machinery. The system is composed of a signal processing module and a state inference module. In the signal processing module, the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and the Kalman filter are exploited to extract the order amplitudes of vibration signals, followed by fault classification using the fuzzy state inference module. The RLS algorithm and Kalman filter provide advantages in order tracking over conventional Fourier-based techniques in that they are insensitive to smearing problems arising from closely spaced orders or crossing orders. On the basis of thus obtained order features, the potential fault types are then deduced with the aid of a state inference engine. Human diagnostic rules are fuzzified for various common faults, including the single fault and double fault situations. This system is implemented on the platform of a floating point digital signal processor, where a photo switch and an accelerometer supply the shaft speed and acceleration signals, respectively. Experiments were carried out for a rotor kit and a practical four-cylinder engine to show the effectiveness of the proposed system in tracking the rotating order with precise inference.

This group of fish is facing a variety of impacts and conservation issues that are somewhat unique relative to more economically valuable and heavily managed fish species. Here, we present a brief series of case studies to highlight the threats such as migration barriers, flow regulation, environmental contamination, habitat degradation, exploitation and impacts from introduced (non-native) species that are facing catostomids in different regions. Collectively, the case studies reveal that individual species usually are not threatened by a single, isolated factor. Instead, species in general face numerous stressors that threaten multiple stages of their life history. Several factors have retarded sucker conservation including widespread inabilities of field workers to distinguish some species, lack of basic natural history and ecological knowledge of life history, and the misconception that suckers are tolerant of degraded conditions and are of little social or ecological value. Without a specific constituent group lobbying for conservation of non-game fishes, all such species, including members of the catostomid family, will continue to face serious risks because of neglect, ignorance, and misunderstanding. We suggest that conservation strategies should incorporate research and education/outreach components. Other conservation strategies that would be effective for protecting suckers include freshwater protected areas for critical habitat, restoration of degraded habitat, and design of catostomid-friendly fish bypass facilities. We believe that the plight of the catostomids is representative of the threats facing many other non-game freshwater fishes with diverse life-history strategies globally. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hadjicostis, CN				Hadjicostis, CN			Finite-state machine embeddings for nonconcurrent error detection and identification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						error recovery; fault tolerance; finite-state machines (FSMs); nonconcurrent error detection and correction; transient faults	FAULT-TOLERANCE; SUPERVISORY CONTROL; REDUNDANCY	In digital sequential systems that operate over several time steps, a state-transition fault at any time step during the operation of the system can corrupt its state and render its future functionality useless. Such state-transition faults are usually handled by embedding the given sequential system into a larger one, in a way that preserves the state evolution and properties of the original system while enabling an external mechanism to perform checks to detect, identify and correct errors in the encoded state of this redundant system. Checking is typically performed concurrently (i.e., at the end of each time step) and can potentially cause high power consumption or an overall slowdown in the system; more importantly, concurrent checking imposes significant reliability requirements on the error-detection/identification mechanism. In this paper, we develop a methodology for systematically constructing embeddings of finite-state machines so that the external mechanism can capture transient state-transition faults via checks that are performed in a nonconcurrent manner (e.g., periodically instead of every time step). More specifically, by characterizing nonconcurrent error-detecting/identifying capabilities in terms of state encoding constraints and redundant dynamics, the proposed approach can be used to construct a redundant version of the given finite-state machine (FSM) that allows the external mechanism to detect and identify errors due to past state-transition faults based on an analysis of the current, possibly corrupted FSM state. As a result, the checker in such designs can operate at a slower speed than the rest of the system which relaxes the stringent requirements on its reliability.

J	Lin, Y; Zhang, WJ				Lin, Y; Zhang, WJ			A function-behavior-state approach to designing human-machine interface for nuclear power plant operators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						design; framework; function-behavior-state model; human-machine interface; nuclear power plants		This paper presents an approach to human-machine interface design for control room operators of nuclear power plants. The first step in designing an interface for a particular application is to determine information content that needs to be displayed. The design methodology for this step is called the interface design framework (called framework). Several frameworks have been proposed for applications at varying levels, including process plants. However, none is based on the design and manufacture of a plant system for which the interface is designed. This paper presents an interface design framework which originates from design theory and methodology for general technical systems. Specifically, the framework is based on a set of core concepts of a function-behavior-state model originally proposed by the artificial intelligence research community and widely applied in the design research community. Benefits of this new framework include the provision of a model-based fault diagnosis facility, and the seamless integration of the design (manufacture, maintenance) of plants and the design of human-machine interfaces. The missing linkage between design and operation of a plant was one of the causes of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor incident. A simulated plant system is presented to explain how to apply this framework in designing an interface. The resulting human-machine interface is discussed; specifically, several fault diagnosis examples are elaborated to demonstrate how this interface could support operators fault diagnosis in an unanticipated situation.

J	Nahvi, H; Esfahanian, M				Nahvi, H; Esfahanian, M			Fault identification in rotating machinery using artificial neural networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						vibration analysis; rotating machinery faults; neural networks; fault identification		In this paper, an artificial neural network system is designed and employed for fault prediction of rotating machinery systems. Multi-layer feedforward networks, constituted of non-linear neurons, have been employed. A normalization scheme is implemented on the input and output vectors. The performance of the expert structure is optimized to encounter input data with different intensities and non-regular data. More than 40 rotating machinery faults are introduced into the algorithm. To train the network, the data in the vibration identification chart consisting of vibration signals of common rotating machinery faults are used. Computer software is developed to detect machinery faults by using the above techniques and is validated for fault detection of different machinery systems. It is found that the designed network is capable of identifing unknown faults in rotating machinery. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network algorithm is displayed by several tests.

A commonly used technique to generate test sequences for specifications described by the finite state machines is the Wp-method with the Reset technique, which frequently results in long test sequences. In this paper, we propose a bipartite graph approach to generate optimal test sequences for protocol conformance testing. Our approach significantly reduces the length of the test sequences required for conformance testing while maintaining the same fault detection capability.

It has been specifically designed for the detection of damages in large electrical machines where the prevention of faults can be achieved through the vibration monitoring in the low frequency range. This sensor has been optimized to achieve a minimum detectable acceleration amplitude of 0.05g in the frequency range 2-500Hz. Also, high robustness and stability is achieved with the use of hollow core fiber to create the interferometric low-finesse cavity. The sensor has been tested in experimental induction machine test-rigs showing good performance both in the detection of magnetic and mechanical nature vibrations.

However, the domain expert often has a good idea of what to expect in terms of input and output parameter values. If the expert can express these relationships in the form of rules, this would provide a resource too valuable to ignore. Fuzzy logic is used to handle the imprecision and vagueness of natural language and provides this additional advantage to a system. This paper investigates the development of a novel knowledge insertion algorithm that explores the benefits of pre-structuring RBF neural networks by using prior fuzzy domain knowledge and previous training experiences. Pre-structuring is accomplished by using fuzzy rules gained from a domain expert and using them to modify existing Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks.

In addition to their application in cancer class prediction and discovery, gene expression data can be used for the prediction of patient survival. Here, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address one of the major challenges in gene expression data analysis, the curse of dimensionality, in order to discriminate high risk patients from low risk patients. A discrete binary version of PSO is used for gene selection and dimensionality reduction, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) is implemented as the classifier. The experimental results on the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set demonstrate the effectiveness of PSO/PNN system in survival prediction.

Many different methods are currently used to extract markers from multiple data sources, including gene expression microarrays. This paper investigates the effect of outlier removal on the performance of one such biomarker selection method, Support Vector Machines (SVM). A simple method of outlier removal is employed as a preprocessing step before the data is used for SVM analysis. Both linear and radial basis kernels are used as well as four different normalization techniques. Results show that outlier removal increases the number of highly predictive genes as well as the number of poorly predicting genes. This result thus supports the use of outlier removal prior to biological marker identification via SVM analysis.

This paper focuses on the application of a supervised classification technique, support vector machines (SVM), to high dimensional microarrays for marker identification. A case study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is used here to demonstrate and test the ability of SVMs to identify real biological markers. SVMs are known to be suitable for high dimensional microarray data and are able to classify non-linear relationships in the data through the use of kernel functions specific to the datasets. This paper compares multiple SVM kernel functions, both linear and nonlinear, to determine which form is best suited for a particular dataset. Additionally, each SVM is tested across a range of parameters and normalization schemes to further identify a specific optimal classifier. Empirical results are then used to determine the optimum parameters for the SVM to efficiently find biologically important predictive markers for differentiation between RCC subtypes for the purpose of diagnosis and prognosis.

The IEPS comprises three major portions: a remote host, generic embedded devices (GEDs), and pluggable application modules. The remote host can receive data from GED for analyses, control, or prognostics. The GED can be easily embedded into diverse types of equipment to acquire equipment parameters. It has an open-standard application interface through which different prediction and analysis modules are allowed to plug in the prognostics system. The data pre-processing scheme is GUI-based and through composing data collection plans (DCPs). Specifically, the common equipment model (CEM) of equipment is collected to a graphic user interface through equipment self-description (ESD) in the GED. Then, the user can conveniently select the desired equipment parameters for the prognostics system to perform operations of analyses, control, and prediction. This paper also presents the design guide of the pluggable application modules for the user to follow to quickly develop a new PAM for equipment prognostics. By using the proposed data pre-processing scheme and pluggable application modules, the prognostics system can be generically used in diverse types of equipment without changing the system architecture.
