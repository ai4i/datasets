Zargham			Static Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Using Time Stepping Finite Element Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Magnetics Conference (INTERMAG)	MAY 04-08, 2008	Madrid, SPAIN			Fault diagnosis; permanent magnet synchronous motor; static eccentricity; time stepping finite element	VIBRATION	This paper introduces a new index for noninvasive diagnosis of static eccentricity in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM). Use of this index makes it also possible to precisely determine the eccentricity degree. The index is the amplitude of the harmonic components with a particular frequency pattern. Occurrence and increase of the fault degree cause the rise of amplitude of the harmonic components which can be used to diagnose the fault and determine its degree. To evaluate the ability of the proposed index for static eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, the correlation between index and eccentricity degree is calculated. Then a three-layer artificial neural network is employed to classify the current and torque profiles to one of the four possible classes of eccentricities. After all, a white Gaussian noise is added to the both measured current and torque and robustness of the proposed index is analyzed with respect to the noise variance. A PMSM under static eccentricity fault is modeled using time stepping finite element method. This modeling includes all geometrical and physical characteristics of the machine components, non-uniform permeance of the air gap and non-uniform characteristics of the PM material. Use of this precise modeling makes it possible to access the demanded signals for a very high precision processing.	[Ebrahimi, Bashir Mahdi; Faiz, Jawad; Javan-Roshtkhari, M.; Nejhad, A.

Robust fault detection and isolation technique for single-input/single-output closed-loop control systems that exhibit actuator and sensor faults	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							TRACKING ERROR SPECIFICATIONS; QUANTITATIVE FEEDBACK THEORY; RESIDUAL GENERATION; TOLERANT CONTROL; DESIGN; MODEL; QFT	An integrated quantitative feedback design and frequency-based fault detection and isolation (FDI) approach is presented for single-input/single-output systems. A novel design methodology, based on shaping the system frequency response, is proposed to generate an appropriate residual signal that is sensitive to actuator and sensor faults in the presence of model uncertainty and exogenous unknown (unmeasured) disturbances. The key features of this technique are: (1) the uncertain phase information is fully addressed by the design equations, resulting in a minimally conservative over-design and (2) a graphical environment is provided for the design of fault detection (FD) filter, which is intuitively appealing from an engineering perspective. The FD filter can easily be obtained by manually shaping the frequency response into the complex plane. The question of interaction between actuator and sensor fault residuals is also considered. It is discussed how the actuator and sensor faults are distinguished from each other by appropriately de. ning FDI threshold values. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated on a single machine infinite bus power system wherein a stabilised coordinate power system incorporating a robust FDI capability is achieved.

These problems cause malfunctions in rotating machinery and create strange vibrations coming from impact and friction. However, non-linear and non-stationary signals due to impact and friction are difficult to identify. Therefore, exact time and frequency information is needed for identifying these signals. For this purpose, a newly developed time-frequency analysis method, HHT (Hilbert-Huang Transform), is applied to the signals of partial rub and looseness from the experiment using RK-4 rotor kit. Conventional signal processing methods such as FFT, STFT and CWT were compared to verify the effectiveness of fault diagnosis using HHT. The results showed that the impact signals were generated regularly when partial rub occurred, but the intermittent impact and friction signals were generated irregularly when looseness occurred. The time and frequency information was represented exactly by using HHT in both cases, which makes clear fault diagnosis between partial rub and looseness.

The acoustic emission (AE) method is another important and effective signal in fault diagnosis of mechanical systems. In this paper, the AE signal is applied to diagnose the piston condition of the water hydraulic motor in a water hydraulic system. The AE signal is obtained under different flow rates and torques. The wavelet-based signal processing technique is used to analyze the fluid-borne vibration and structure-borne vibration (acoustic signal). The spectrum based on wavelet analysis is effective in analyzing the acoustic signals under specific frequency ranges, compared with the conventional power spectrum density (PSD). The results show root mean square (RMS) of the wavelet-based acoustic signal analysis is very effective for the fault diagnosis of piston cracks under the different flow rates and torques.	[Chen, H.

The principle of computing the asymptotically exact multicomponent sinusoidal model for an arbitrary signal by iterating Hilbert transform is introduced, and sonic properties of IHT are analyzed. Theoretical analysis for the generic two-component signal shows that there are limitations in the direct estimation of instantaneous frequencies via the phase signals of the previously obtained model. Therefore, a smoothed instantaneous frequency estimation (SIFE) method based on difference operator and zero-phase digital low-pass filtering is proposed, and then the accuracy and validity of this method have been proved by the simulation results. The analysis results of the mechanical fault signals show that the weak features of these signals can be efficiently extracted with the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bearing condition diagnosis and prognosis using applied nonlinear dynamical analysis of machine vibration signal	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; TIME-SERIES DATA; FAULT-DETECTION; SURROGATE DATA; DIMENSION; DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM	In this paper, we introduce a modified form of the correlation integral developed by Grassberger and Procaccia referred to as the partial correlation integral, which can be computed in real time. The partial correlation integral algorithm is then used to analyze machine vibration data obtained throughout a life test of a rolling element bearing. From the experimental results, the dimensional exponent (an approximation of the correlation dimension) as computed from the partial correlation integral algorithm tends to increase as time progresses and the useful remaining life of the bearing is decreasing. The dimensional exponents of a healthy bearing and a bearing close to failure are statistically different. We also propose a computational scheme for bearing condition monitoring (diagnosis and prognosis) using the dimensional exponent integrated with a surrogate data testing technique. As a result, we can characterize the condition of the bearing from the results of the surrogate data test and furthermore, we provide some preliminary evidence that the dimensional exponent can be used to predict the failure of rolling element bearings in rotating machinery from real-time vibration data.

With the help of it, the fault position and transient fault force could be identified for many local faults, including weak rubbing, transverse crack, coupling misalignment, and pedestal looseness. In this paper, the model-based identifying theory and its main procedure are studied. At first, a hybrid model combining a finite element model of rotor and rigid discs with online identified oil-film coefficients is adopted. Modal expansion and least square fitting is proposed to locate for fault position. The transient fault forces are then identified from transient residual vibration based on matrix operations. These approaches are successfully applied to the identification of the local rubbing fault occured on a simple rotor test rig with two discs.

The non-dimensional symptom parameters in time domain are defined for reflecting the features of time signals measured for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The synthetic detection index is also proposed to evaluate the sensitivity of non-dimensional symptom parameters for detecting faults. The practical example of condition diagnosis for detecting and distinguishing fault states of a centrifugal pump system, such as cavitation, impeller eccentricity which often occur in a centrifugal pump system, are shown to verify the efficiency of the method proposed in this paper.

FDI based on pattern recognition using Kalman prediction: Application to an induction machine	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Kalman state prediction; Induction motor; Fault detection and diagnosis; k-nn rule	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS	A pattern recognition technique associated with a new state estimator is developed in order to supervise electrical process. For this purpose. diagnostic features are extracted from current and voltage measurements for monitoring different operating modes. Then, a feature selection method is applied in order to select the most relevant features which define the feature space. In this frame, the classification is realized by a non-parametric method ("k-nearest neighbors" rule) with reject options. However, this method does not take into account the evolution of the operating modes. Thus, it is necessary to enhance the initial knowledge database. For that, it polynomial approach allows characterizing the intermediate states of each operating modes and an original use of Kahnan algorithm allows predicting the evolution of the partially known modes. A simple behavioral model is used to describe the evolution of the pattern vector. An estimation step provides the parameter of such model and a prediction step determines the future evolution of the pattern vector. This approach is illustrated on in asynchronous motor of 5.5 M in order to detect broken bars under any load level. The experimental results prove the efficiency of pattern recognition methods in condition monitoring of electrical machines. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Iwanski, G; Koczara, W				Iwanski, Grzegorz; Koczara, Wlodzimierz			Autonomous power system for island or grid-connected wind turbines in distributed generation	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL POWER			English	Article						distributed generation; variable speed generation; wind energy; standalone generation; grid synchronization; mains outage detection	STAND-ALONE	Modern power generation systems for wind turbines are often based on the rotor fed slip-ring machines. Power electronics convener provides the slip power, and also the reactive power for excitation of the generator during standalone operation. This way the isolated load can be supplied even if the grid has failed. Stator voltage in an autonomous operation is controlled using vectorial phase locked loop (PLL) structure: therefore the information about mechanical speed or angular position of the rotor is eliminated from the control method. The second PLL is also used for synchronization of the generated voltage with the grid voltage. Voltages synchronization is necessary for soft connection and protection of the supplied load front the rapid change of the supply voltage phase. The grid-connected doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) can be useful after grid fault: however, the mains outage detection rnethods are necessary for fast disconnection after grid failures.

J	Wu, JD; Liu, CH				Wu, Jian-Da; Liu, Chiu-Hong			Investigation of engine fault diagnosis using discrete wavelet transform and neural network	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						discrete wavelet transform; neural network; fault diagnosis; sound emission signal	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; SIGNALS; MOTORS	An investigation of a fault diagnostic technique for internal combustion engines using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and neural network is presented in this paper. Generally, sound emission signal serves as a promising alternative to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in rotating machinery when the vibration signal is not available. Most of the conventional fault diagnosis techniques using sound emission and vibration signals are based on analyzing the signal amplitude in the time or frequency domain. Meanwhile, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique was developed for obtaining both time-domain and frequency-domain information. Unfortunately, the CWT technique is often operated over a longer computing time. In the present study, a DWT technique which is combined with a feature selection of energy spectrum and fault classification using neural network for analyzing fault signal is proposed for improving the shortcomings without losing its original property. The features of the sound emission signal at different resolution levels are extracted by multi-resolution analysis and Parseval's theorem [Gaing, Z. L. (2004). Wavelet-based neural network for power disturbance recognition and classification. IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery 19, 1560-1568]. The algorithm is obtained from previous work by Daubechies [Daubechies, I. (1988). Orthonormal bases of compactly supported wavelets. Communication on Pure and Applied Mathematics 41, 909-996.], the "db4", "db8" and "db20" wavelet functions are adopted to perform the proposed DWT technique.

It helps plant operators in monitoring and diagnosing of abnormal situations in refining process of lubricating oil. The LUBRES structure, the knowledge base, and the inference machine are presented in detail. A new strategy is proposed for conflicts resolution - the sorting strategy of antecedents, and a selection strategy of knowledge rules in the memory knowledge base. Knowledge acquisition mechanism is based on an empirical knowledge table, while knowledge verification is carried out based on the directed graph approach. C++Builder and SQL Server 2000 have been used in developing the proposed system. LUBRES has been successfully implemented in Microsoft Windows Server environment. For I year, LUBRES has been used for monitoring and diagnosing of refining process of the lubricating oil. The industrial application of LUBRES proved its high reliability and accuracy.

New and innovative technologies must be developed and implemented to address these concerns. Condition-based maintenance requires that the health of critical components/systems be monitored and diagnostic/prognostic strategies be developed to detect and identify incipient failures and predict the failing component's remaining useful life. Typically, vibration and other key indicators onboard an aircraft are severely corrupted by noise, thus curtailing the ability to accurately diagnose and predict failures. This paper introduces a novel blind deconvolution denoising scheme that employs a vibration model in the frequency domain and attempts to arrive at the true vibration signal through an iterative optimization process. Performance indexes are defined and data from a helicopter are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The proposed metho uses the samples of three line currents for one cycle duration to accomplish this task. Initially, the features of the line currents are extracted by first level decomposition of the current samples using discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Subsequently, the extracted features are applied as inputs to a SVM for determining the fault zone (whether the fault is before or after the series capacitor, a observed from the relay point). The feasibility of the propose algorithm has been tested on a 300-km, 400-kV series compensate transmission line for all the ten types of faults through detailed digital simulation using PSCAD/EMTDC. Upon testing on more than 25 000 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle, prefault power transfer level, percentage compensation level, and source impedances, the performance of the developed method has been found to be quite promising.

Generally, the initial part of the composite's life is dominated by matrix cracking; the intermediate part by debonding/delamination and the final failure due to fiber breakage. The simulated hub loads under various damage levels are obtained using a comprehensive aeroelastic analysis of the composite rotor blade with physics based damage modes and are then linked with the life consumption of the blade using a phenomenological model. The SVM is used for classification of the useful life of the blade into three classes which are useful to decide the prognostic action. The performance of the blade damage detection system is demonstrated using simulated hub loads obtained using a two-cell airfoil section representing the stiff-inplane blade. The model based hub load variations are contaminated with noise to simulate the real data. It is observed that the SVM based damage detection system is more robust, reliable and easy to implement than the rotating frame measurement based methods.

J	Wang, W; Li, Q; Zhao, GJ				Wang Wei; Li Qiang; Zhao Guojie			Novel approach based on chaotic oscillator for machinery fault diagnosis	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Chaotic oscillator; Approximate entropy; Feature extraction; Rolling bearing; Fault diagnosis		Weak periodic signals can be detected by identifying the transformation of the chaotic oscillator from the chaotic state to the large-scale periodic state when a weak external periodic signal is applied. Approximate entropy and its two-dimensional expression which was proposed by our group have been proved to be an effective measure of the states of chaotic oscillator. This paper discusses and summarizes machinery fault diagnosis based on chaotic oscillator and approximate entropy and its engineering application. In practical engineering measurement, recorded data is generally a mixture of signal and noise, and interested weak signal is usually submerged in heavy noise. For example, the fault characteristic signals of rolling bearings are in low frequency band, and the useful signals are often buried in heavy noise and difficult to-be-detected. By using the characters of chaotic oscillator being sensitive to weak periodic signals, and approximate entropy being available in recognizing the change of chaotic oscillator, the fault feature could be extracted. Satisfactory results have been achieved when using the presented method to diagnose the fault of rolling bearings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Various signal-processing computation schemes such as time-frequency analysis and order tracking for signal analysis and pattern recognition purposes are implemented based upon the Borland C++ Builder graphical user interface. Thus machine fault diagnostic capability can be extended by using the socket application program interface as the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). In the study, the effectiveness of the developed remote diagnostic system is justified by monitoring a transmission-element test rig. A complete monitoring cycle including data acquisition, signal-processing, feature extraction, pattern recognition through the artificial neural networks, and online video surveillance, is demonstrated.

Fault degradation assessment of water hydraulic motor by impulse vibration signal with Wavelet Packet Analysis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault degradation assessment; water hydraulic motor; wavelet packet analysis; impulse vibration signal analysis; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test	PUMP HEALTH DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORM; NETWORKS	The machinery fault diagnosis is important for improving reliability and performance of systems. Many methods such as Time Synchronous Average (TSA), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based spectrum analysis and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) have been applied in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of mechanical system. The above methods analyze the signal in frequency domain with low resolution, which is not suitable for non-stationary vibration signal. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is a simple and precise technique in vibration signal analysis for machinery fault diagnosis. It has limited use and advantage to analyze the vibration signal with higher noise directly. In this paper, a new method for the fault degradation assessment of the water hydraulic motor is proposed based on Wavelet Packet Analysis (WPA) and KS test to analyze the impulsive energy of the vibration signal, which is used to detect the piston condition of water hydraulic motor. WPA is used to analyze the impulsive vibration signal from the casing of the water hydraulic motor to obtain the impulsive energy. The impulsive energy of the vibration signal can be obtained by the multi-decomposition based on Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and used as feature values to assess the fault degradation of the pistons. The kurtosis of the impulsive energy in the reconstructed signal from the Wavelet Packet coefficients is used to extract the feature values of the impulse energy by calculating the coefficients of the WPT multi-decomposition. The KS test is used to compare the kurtosis of the impulse energy of the vibration signal statistically under the different piston conditions. The results show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method to assess the fault degradation of the pistons in the water hydraulic motor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel recognition method for the shaft orbit based on Walsh transform and support vector machine is proposed. In the method, distance vector between the point on the shaft orbit and its center is first calculated. Then, the distance vector is transformed by Walsh matrix, and the Walsh spectrum obtained has property of invariance to rotation, scaling and translation. In the end, the Walsh spectrum, viewed as the feature of shaft orbit, is trained and tested by means of support vector machine. In addition, a comparison with the previous methods is performed, and experimental results are encouraging, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

Fault detection using transient machine signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						condition monitoring; vibration signal processing; feature extraction; novelty detection	NOVELTY DETECTION	This paper describes the development and testing of a strategy for vibration-based online detection of faults in a particular class of machinery. This machinery is defined by two basic characteristics that preclude it from the application of standard online condition monitoring systems. The first characteristic is the absence of historical fault data. The second characteristic is that the machine is in a constant state of transient operation. An example of such a machine is the swing machinery of an electromechanical excavator. The monitoring strategy presented here employs an anomaly detection scheme together with various methods of signal processing and feature extraction. Experiments are carried out using a laboratory apparatus to show the how various configurations of the system are able to detect different types of faults. The results indicate that this approach is effective and merits further investigation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamic eccentricity in squirrel cage induction motors - Simulation and analytical study of its spectral signatures on stator currents	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Diagnosis; Induction motors; Dynamic eccentricity; Principal slot harmonics; Flux density; Airgap permeance	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE; FAULTS; FAILURES	Most of faults in three-phase induction motors have relationship with airgap eccentricity. There are two forms of airgap eccentricity: static (SE) and dynamic (DE). According to the literatures, the well known signatures of dynamic eccentricity, on the stator current spectra, are sidebands around the principal slot harmonics (PSH). However, many other researches have shown that DE induces also spectral components around the fundamental, but few are reported on the sources and the causes of these components. In this direction and since it is difficult to study experimentally the DE separately from the SE; the present paper attempts to explain, analytically and by simulation, the generation process of all frequency components that are a function of only DE. For that reason, a detailed analytical study for three-phase induction motors working under DE is performed. This study is based on rotating field approach. A general theoretical analysis of the interaction between all harmonics of the eccentric airgap permeance and the stator and rotor MMF components is put forward. The simulation results, obtained from an accurate model, confirm the existence of specific frequency components around the fundamental, caused by the dynamic airgap eccentricity. The interactions between the DE and the inherent SE are also illustrated using this mathematical model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Sahraoui, M.; Ghoggal, A.; Zouzou, S.

J	Zhang, YW				Zhang, Yingwei			RETRACTED: Fault detection and diagnosis of nonlinear processes using improved kernel independent component analysis (KICA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Retracted article. See vol. 58, pg. 20858, 2019)	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article; Retracted Publication							NEURAL-NETWORK; IDENTIFICATION; PCA; ICA	In this article, the nonlinear dynamic process monitoring method based on kernel independent component analysis (KICA) is developed. Compared to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, KICA is unsupervised and available for fault detection. Hence, in this article, KICA is used to detect faults. Because the dimension of the feature space is far less than the rank of kernel matrix, a basis in feature space is selected. Specifically, the basis in feature space is first constructed based on the similarity factor of data in one group in this article. A contribution plot is impossible, because the nonlinear mapping function from input space into feature space is unknown. Therefore, KICA is difficult for nonlinear fault diagnosis. In this article, once a fault is detected, the kernel-transformed scores from improved KICA will be directly introduced as the inputs of SVM to diagnose the fault. The classification rate of SVM plus improved KICA is higher than the classification rate of SVM plus KICA when the same number of independent components (nICs) is selected. The reason is that the negentropy in improved KICA plus SVM could take into account the more-useful information of original inputs than that of original KICA plus SVM. The training time of SVM plus improved KICA is shorter than that of SVM plus KICA, because the former attenuates the expensive computation load. The proposed approach is applied to the fault detection and diagnosis in the Tennessee Eastman process and a wastewater treatment process (WWTP). Applications indicate that the proposed approach effectively captures the nonlinear dynamic in the process variables and shows superior fault delectability, compared to conventional methods.

Under normal, nonstressed circumstances, low cellular concentrations of Nrf2 are maintained by proteasomal degradation through a Keap1-Cul3-Roc1-dependent mechanism. A model for Nrf2 activation has been proposed in which two amino-terminal motifs, DLG and ETGE, promote efficient ubiquitination and rapid turnover; known as the two-site substrate recognition/hinge and latch model. Here, we show that in human cancer, somatic mutations occur in the coding region of NRF2, especially among patients with a history of smoking or suffering from squamous cell carcinoma; in the latter case, this leads to poor prognosis. These mutations specifically alter amino acids in the DLG or ETGE motifs, resulting in aberrant cellular accumulation of Nrf2. Mutant Nrf2 cells display constitutive induction of cytoprotective enzymes and drug efflux pumps, which are insensitive to Keap1-mediated regulation. Suppression of Nrf2 protein levels by siRNA knockdown sensitized cancer cells to oxidative stress and chemotherapeutic reagents. Our results strongly support the contention that constitutive Nrf2 activation affords cancer cells with undue protection from their inherently stressed microenvironment and anti-cancer treatments. Hence, inactivation of the Nrf2 pathway may represent a therapeutic strategy to reinforce current treatments for malignancy. Congruously, the present study also provides in vivo validation of the two-site substrate recognition model for Nrf2 activation by the Keap1-Cul3-based E3 ligase.

Feature-based classifier ensembles for diagnosing multiple faults in rotating machinery	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; feature selection; multi-objective genetic algorithms; ensemble; rotating machinery	ACCURATE; DIVERSE	Recent researches in fault classification have shown the importance of accurately selecting the features that have to be used as inputs to the diagnostic model. In this work, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is considered for the feature selection phase. Then, two different techniques for using the selected features to develop the fault classification model are compared: a single classifier based on the feature subset with the best classification performance and an ensemble of classifiers working on different feature subsets. The motivation for developing ensembles of classifiers is that they can achieve higher accuracies than single classifiers. An important issue for an ensemble to be effective is the diversity in the predictions of the base classifiers which constitute it, i.e. their capability of erring on different sub-regions of the pattern space. In order to show the benefits of having diverse base classifiers in the ensemble, two different ensembles have been developed: in the first, the base classifiers are constructed on feature subsets found by MOGAs aimed at maximizing the fault classification performance and at minimizing the number of features of the subsets; in the second, diversity among classifiers is added to the MOGA search as the third objective function to maximize. In both cases, a voting technique is used to effectively combine the predictions of the base classifiers to construct the ensemble output. For verification, some numerical experiments are conducted on a case of multiple-fault classification in rotating machinery and the results achieved by the two ensembles are compared with those obtained by a single optimal classifier.

J	Paoli, A; Lafortune, S				Paoli, Andrea; Lafortune, Stephane			Diagnosability analysis of a class of hierarchical state machines	DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						discrete event systems; fault diagnosis; statecharts; hierarchical finite state machines; diagnoser	DISCRETE-EVENT SYSTEMS; FAILURE DIAGNOSIS	This paper addresses the problem of fault detection and isolation for a particular class of discrete event dynamical systems called hierarchical finite state machines (HFSMs). A new version of the property of diagnosability for discrete event systems tailored to HFSMs is introduced. This notion, called L-1-diagnosability, captures the possibility of detecting an unobservable fault event using only high level observations of the behavior of an HFSM. Algorithms for testing L-1-diagnosability are presented. In addition, new methodologies are presented for studying the diagnosability properties of HFSMs that are not L-1-diagnosable. These methodologies avoid the complete expansion of an HFSM into its corresponding flat automaton by focusing the expansion on problematic indeterminate cycles only in the associated extended diagnoser.

J	Luo, JH; Pattipati, KR; Qiao, L; Chigusa, S				Luo, Jianhui; Pattipati, Krishna R.; Qiao, Liu; Chigusa, Shunsuke			Model-based prognostic techniques applied to a suspension system	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						interacting multiple models; model based prognostics; remaining life estimation; suspension system	STATE ESTIMATION; TRACKING; DIAGNOSIS	Conventional maintenance strategies, such as corrective and preventive maintenance, are not adequate to fulfill the needs of expensive and high availability transportation and industrial systems. A new strategy based on forecasting system degradation through a prognostic process is required. The recent advances in model-based design technology have realized significant time savings in product development cycle. These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). An Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage. Remaining-life prediction is performed by mixing mode-based life predictions via time-averaged mode probabilities. The solution has the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems.

J	Hofer, J; Fahringer, T				Hofer, Juergen; Fahringer, Thomas			Grid application fault diagnosis using wrapper services and machine learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing (ICSOC 2007)	SEP 17-20, 2007	Vienna, AUSTRIA	ACM SIGHH, ACM SIGWEB, ACM SIGSE, Networked European Software & Services Intitiat		grid; fault classiffication; fault diagnosis; machine learning		Quick and accurate identification of the root cause of failures is an important prerequisite for any reliable system. However with increasing Grid size and complexity, the manual diagnosis of application faults becomes impractical, tedious and time-consuming. So far there has been a lack of systematic and comprehensive studies in organization and classification of Grid faults. We address this gap with a multi-perspective Grid fault taxonomy precisely describing an incident using eight different characteristics. Based on that, we develop a pragmatic model-based technique for application-specific fault diagnosis using indicators, symptoms and rules. Customized wrapper services then apply this knowledge to reason about the root causes of failures. In addition to applying user-provided diagnosis models we demonstrate that given a set of past classified fault events it is possible to automatically extract new models through learning. We investigated and compared several supervised classification learning and cluster analysis algorithms for this purpose. Our approach was implemented as part of the Otho Toolkit, a framework for "service-enabling" legacy applications by synthesizing tailor-made wrapper service.

Environmental impacts and sustainability of degraded water reuse	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE WATER; WASTE-WATER; LAND APPLICATION; COASTAL BERMUDAGRASS; QUALITY; BIOSOLIDS; YIELD; SCALE; ZONES	Greater urban demand for finite water resources to meet domestic, agricultural, industrial, and recreational needs; increased frequency of drought resulting from erratic weather; and continued degradation of available water resources from point and nonpoint sources of pollution have focused attention on the reuse of degraded waters as a potential water source. However, short- and long-term detrimental environmental impacts and sustainability of degraded water reuse are not well known or understood. These concerns led to the organization of the 2007 ASA-CSSA-SSSA Symposium entitled Environmental Impacts and Sustainability of Degraded Water Reuse. Out of this symposium came a special collection of 4 review papers and 12 technical research papers focusing on various issues associated with the reuse of agricultural drainage water, well water generated in the production of natural gas from coalbeds, municipal wastewater and biosolids, wastewater from confined animal operations, urban runoff, and food-processing wastewater. Overviews of the papers, gaps in knowledge, and future research directions are presented. The future prognosis of degraded water reuse is promising, provided close attention is paid to managing constituents that pose short- and long-term threats to the environment and the health of humankind.

The proposed method is based on RF, a novel ensemble classifier which builds a number of decision trees to improve the single tree classifier. Although there are several existing techniques for faults diagnosis, the application research on RF is meaningful and necessary because of its fast execution speed, the characteristics of tree classifier, and high performance in machine faults diagnosis. The proposed method is demonstrated by a case study on induction motor fault diagnosis. Experimental results indicate the validity and reliability of RF-based diagnosis method.

Fault degradation assessment of water hydraulic components by noise signal with wavelet packet analysis	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						fault degradation assessment; water hydraulic motor; noise signal; wavelet packet analysis; continuous wavelet analysis	PRESSURE RIPPLE CHARACTERISTICS; SECONDARY SOURCE METHOD; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; PUMP; DIAGNOSIS	Vibration analysis contains the important information for the working condition of the mechanical system. It is the major method used in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of machinery. However, noise is widely recognized as one of the more characteristic aspects of hydraulic power system. The flow ripple generated primarily by motor/pump is the main source of acoustic signal. The characteristics of the noise from water hydraulic system have a close relation to the fault degradation of the pistons inside the water hydraulic motor. This paper studies the fault degradation of the piston in the water hydraulic motor by noise in the vibration signal. The fault degradation of the piston in the water hydraulic motor is introduced to acquire the vibration signal of the water hydraulic motor under different pressures. Wavelet packet analysis is applied to analyze the vibration signal to obtain the noise from the vibration signal of the water hydraulic motor. Continuous wavelet transform is used to analyze the noise within the specific frequencies.

Abrogation of T cell quiescence characterizes patients at high risk for multiple sclerosis after the initial neurological event	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						clinically isolated syndrome; gene expression	CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROMES; AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY; ANTIMYELIN ANTIBODIES; GENE-EXPRESSION; OSTEOPONTIN; PROGRESSION; CRITERIA; CONVERSION; DEFINITE	Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) refers to the earliest clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Currently there are no prognostic biological markers that accurately predict conversion of CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS). Furthermore, the earliest molecular events in MS are still unknown. We used microarrays to study gene expression in naive CD4(+) T cells from 37 CIS patients at time of diagnosis and after 1 year. Supervised machine-learning methods were used to build predictive models of disease conversion. We identified 975 genes whose expression segregated CIS patients into four distinct subgroups. A subset of 108 genes further discriminated patients in one of these (group 1) from other CIS patients. Remarkably, 92% of patients in group 1 converted to CDMS within 9 months. Consistent down-regulation of TOB1, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, was characteristic of group 1 patients. Decreased TOB1 expression at the RNA and protein levels also was confirmed in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Finally, a genetic association was observed between TOB1 variation and MS progression in an independent cohort. These results indicate that CIS patients at high risk of conversion have impaired regulation of T cell quiescence, possibly resulting in earlier activation of pathogenic CD4(+) cells.

Risk prediction models can be derived with many different statistical approaches. To compare them, measures of predictive performance are derived from ROC methodology and from probability forecasting theory. These tools can be applied to assess single markers, multivariable regression models and complex model selection algorithms. This article provides a systematic review of the modem way of assessing risk prediction models. Particular attention is put on proper benchmarks and resampling techniques that are important for the interpretation of measured performance. All methods are illustrated with data from a clinical study in head and neck cancer patients.

Application of classification methods in fault detection and diagnosis of inverter fed induction machine drive: a trend towards reliability	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MOTOR DRIVE	The aim of this paper is to present a method of detection and isolation of intermittent misfiring in power switches of a three phase inverter feeding an induction machine drive. The detection and diagnosis procedure is based solely on the output currents of the inverter. owing into the machine windings. The measured currents are transformed in the two dimensional frame obtained with the Concordia transform. The data are then treated by a time-average method. The results even promising lack of accuracy mainly in the fault isolation step. To enhance the fault detection and diagnosis by the use of the information enclosed in the data, a Principal Component Analysis classifier is applied. The detection of a fault occurrence is made by a two-class classifier. The isolation is a two-step approach which uses the Linear Discriminant Analysis; the first is to identify the faulty leg with a three-class classifier and the second one discriminates the faulty power switch. Both methods are evaluated with experimental data and pattern recognition method proves its effectiveness and accuracy in the faulty leg detection and isolation.

Fast diagnosis with sensors of uncertain quality	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; machine health testing; multihypothesis tracker (MHT); system testing	MULTIPLE-FAULT DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHMS	This correspondence presents an approach to the detection and isolation of component failures in large-scale systems. In the case of sensors that report at rates of 1 Hz or less, the algorithm can be considered real time. The input is a set of observed test results from multiple sensors, and the algorithm's main task is to deal with sensor errors. The sensors are assumed to be of threshold test (pass/fail) type, but to be vulnerable to noise, in that occasionally true failures are missed, and likewise, there can be false alarms. These errors are further assumed to be independent conditioned on the system's diagnostic state. Their probabilities, of missed detection and of false alarm, are not known a priori and must be estimated (ideally along with the accuracies of these estimates) online, within the inference engine. Further, recognizing a practical concern in most real systems, a sparsely instantiated observation vector must not be a problem. The key ingredients to our solution include the multiple-hypothesis tracking philosophy to complexity management, a Beta prior distribution on the sensor errors, and a quickest detection overlay to detect changes in these error rates when the prior is violated. We provide results illustrating performance in terms of both computational needs and error rate, and show its application both as a filter (i.e., used to "clean" sensor reports) and as a standalone state estimator.

Gas path prognostic analysis for an industrial gas turbine	INSIGHT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Condition Monitoring	JUL 15-18, 2008	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			gas turbine; engines; gas path prognostics		Gas turbine engines experience degradation over time that causes great concern to gas turbine users on engine reliability, availability and operating costs. Gas turbine diagnostics and prognostics is one of the key technologies to enable the move from time-scheduled maintenance to condition-based maintenance in order to improve engine reliability and availability and reduce life-cycle costs. This paper describes a prognostic approach to estimate the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines before their next major overhaul based on historical health information. A combined regression technique, including both linear and quadratic models, is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines. A statistic 'compatibility check' is used to determine the switch point from a linear regression to a quadratic regression. The developed prognostic approach has been applied to a model gas turbine engine similar to Rolls-Royce industrial AVON 1535 implemented with compressor degradation over time. The analysis shows that the developed prognostic approach has great potential to provide an estimation of engine remaining useful life before the next major overhaul for gas turbine engines experiencing a typical slow degradation.

In order to improve the fault detection ability of the original causal digraph method, a residual modification approach that takes into account the direction of different fault effects is presented. An improvement of the isolation capability of the original method, an inference mechanism between the arcs of the graph, is also proposed to locate process faults on the arcs. The results from the application show that the proposed method, compared to the conventional method, is able to detect the correct nodes and to identify the responsible arcs when the system is affected by a process fault.

However, the influence of background noise is a major issue in implementing this method. This paper introduces an effective monitoring approach to diesel engine combustion based on acoustic one-port source theory and exhaust acoustic measurements. It has been found that the strength, in terms of pressure, of the engine acoustic source is able to provide a more accurate representation of the engine combustion because it is obtained by minimising the reflection effects in the exhaust system. A multi-load acoustic method was then developed to determine the pressure signal when a four-cylinder diesel engine was tested with faults in the fuel injector and exhaust valve. From the experimental results, it is shown that a two-load acoustic method is sufficient to permit the detection and diagnosis of abnormalities in the pressure signal, caused by the faults. This then provides a novel and yet reliable method to achieve condition monitoring of diesel engines even if they operate in high noise environments such as standby power stations and vessel chambers.

J	Rasniewski, A				Rasniewski, Andrzej			Concurrent error detection for finite state machines implemented with embedded memory blocks of SRAM-based FPGAs	MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design	AUG 29-31, 2007	Lubeck, GERMANY	Drager		FPGA; embedded memory; finite state machine (FSM); concurrent error detection (CED); single event upsets (SEUs)	SELF-CHECKING; FAULT-DETECTION; DESIGN	We propose a cost-efficient concurrent error detection (CED) scheme for finite state machines (FSMs) designed for implementation with embedded memory blocks (EMBs) available in today's SRAM-based FPGAs. The proposed scheme is proven to detect each permanent or transient fault associated with a single input or output of any component of the circuit that results in its incorrect state or output. The experimental results obtained using our proprietary FSM synthesis tool show that despite the heterogeneous structure of the proposed CED scheme, the overhead is very low. For the examined benchmark circuits, the circuitry overhead in terms of extra EMBs is in the range of 6.3-56.3%, with an average value of 27.2%, whereas the combined overhead (EMBs and logic cells) calculated under pessimistic assumptions is in the range of 20.7-63.8%, with an average value of 32.2%. This compares favorably with the earlier proposed solutions applicable to conventional FSM designs based on gates and flip-flops for which an overhead exceeding 100% is quite typical.

Many monitoring techniques have been proposed for electrical machine fault detection and localization. In this paper, the feasibility of using a nonlinear feature extraction method noted as Kernel independent component analysis (KICA) is studied and it is applied in self-organizing map to classify the faults of induction motor. In nonlinear feature extraction, we employed independent component analysis (ICA) procedure and adopted the kernel trick to nonlinearly map the Gaussian chirplet distributions into a feature space. First, the adaptive Gaussian chirplet distributions are mapped into an implicit feature space by the kernel trick, and then ICA is performed to extract nonlinear independent components of the Gaussian chirplet distributions. A thorough laboratory study shows that the diagnostic methods provide accurate diagnosis, high sensitivity with respect to faults, and good diagnostic resolution.

The authors present the extreme learning machine (ELM), a novel good learning scheme much faster than traditional gradient-based learning algorithms, as a mechanism for clustering the pressure curves. However, it caused low accuracy for clustering pressure curves for hydraulic tube tester. In this paper, a multi-stage ELM is proposed to improve the accuracy of clustering. During the process of this new ELM, the input data were divided into several stages, then, every stage was analyzed independently. At last, this method has been used in hydraulic tube tester data. Compared with individual ELM, it has better function for considering the characteristics of input data.

On the basis of the specific distance criterion, a simple genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to evaluate and select the optimized features for induction motor fault classification. The selected features are applied to the decision tree and the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm in order to show the efficiency of the proposed feature selection method. The diagnostic results show that the optimal feature selection is useful to improve the fault diagnosis performance.

This paper uses support vector machines (SVMs) to diagnose faults, as it fits the small sample problem. To eliminate system disturbances and noise from the high levels of data, it then combines SVMs with a novel quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) algorithm to select the fault features. The proposed method is then tested using the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process and shown to be effective. In particular, it is demonstrated that QACO and SVMs can find the essential fault variables exactly, and will greatly improve the fault diagnosis performance of SVMs for a complex chemical process.

Surface roughness evolutions in sliding wear process	WEAR			English	Article						wear debris; surface morphology; wear rate; sliding wear process	2-BODY; MODEL; DISTRIBUTIONS; PARTICLES	Wear debris analysis is a technique for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. One key issue that affects the application of wear debris analysis for machine condition monitoring is whether the morphology of the wear particles accurately depicts their original states and the surface morphology of the components from which the particles separate. This study aimed to investigate the evolution of the surface morphology of wear debris in relation to change in the surface morphology of wear components in sliding wear process. Sliding wear tests were conducted using a ball-on-disc tester under proper lubrication and improper lubrication conditions. The study of the particle size distribution and the surfaces of both the wear debris and the tested samples in relation to the wear condition and the wear rates of the wear components were carried out in this study. The evolutions of the surface topographies of both the wear debris and the wear components as wear progressed were investigated. This study has provided insight to the progress of material degradation through the study of wear debris. The results of this research have clearly demonstrated that: (a) there is a good correlation of the surface morphology of wear debris and that of the wear components, and (b) the surface morphology of wear debris contains valuable information for machine condition monitoring.

J	Lee, K; Zhang, Y; Lee, SE				Lee, Kihoon; Zhang, Yu; Lee, Sang Eun			Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATM orthologue suppresses break-induced chromosome translocations	NATURE			English	Article							DOUBLE-STRAND BREAK; DNA-DAMAGE CHECKPOINT; TELOMERE LENGTH; MRE11 COMPLEX; GENOMIC INSTABILITY; BUDDING YEAST; S-PHASE; CHROMATIN; RECOMBINATION; REPAIR	Chromosome translocations are frequently associated with many types of blood-related cancers and childhood sarcomas. Detection of chromosome translocations assists in diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of these diseases(1); however, despite their importance to such diseases, the molecular mechanisms leading to chromosome translocations are not well understood. The available evidence indicates a role for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their origin(1-3). Here we develop a yeast-based system that induces a reciprocal chromosome translocation by formation and ligation of breaks on two different chromosomes. We show that interchromosomal end joining is efficiently suppressed by the Tel1- and Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2-dependent pathway; this is distinct from the role of Tel1 in telomeric integrity and from Mec1- and Tel1- dependent checkpoint controls. Suppression of DSB-induced chromosome translocations depends on the kinase activity of Tel1 and Dun1, and the damage-induced phosphorylation of Sae2 and histone H2AX proteins. Tel1- and Sae2-dependent tethering and promotion of 59 to 39 degradation of broken chromosome ends discourage error-prone NHEJ and interchromosomal NHEJ, preserving chromosome integrity on DNA damage. Our results indicate that, like human ATM, Tel1 serves as a key regulator for chromosome integrity in the pathway that reduces the risk for DSB-induced chromosome translocations, and are probably pertinent to the oncogenic chromosome translocations in ATM-deficient cells.

J	Wu, FJ; Qu, LS				Wu, Fangji; Qu, Liangsheng			An improved method for restraining the end effect in empirical mode decomposition and its applications to the fault diagnosis of large rotating machinery	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TRANSFORM; SPECTRUM; TIME; TOOL	The purpose of this paper is to introduce an improved slope-based method (ISBM) to restrain the end effect in empirical mode decomposition (EMD). With this method, non-stationary, nonlinear time series can be decomposed efficiently and accurately into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual trend. Furthermore, due to its robust end effect restraint ability, the ISBM provides an attractive alternative to the traditional end condition methods. For the purpose of mechanical fault diagnosis, the IMFs derived from the improved EMD are then used to extract the features of faults and remove the interference from environmental noise and some irrelevant components. Industrial case studies on large rotating machinery show that IMF derived from improved EMD is relatively easy to understand and especially useful for analysis of non-stationary, nonlinear time series.

Current, power, flux, etc are among these signals. Frequencies related to a broken rotor fault are slip dependent, therefore, correct diagnosis of fault - especially when obtrusive frequency components are present - depends oil accurate determination of motor velocity and slip. The traditional methods typically require several sensors that should be pre-installed in some cases. This paper presents a diagnosis method based oil only a vibration sensor. Motor velocity oscillation due to a broken rotor causes frequency components at twice slip frequency difference around speed frequency in vibration spectrum. Speed frequency and its harmonics as well as twice supply frequency, call easily and accurately be found in a vibration spectrum, therefore the motor slip call be computed. Now components related to rotor fault call be found. It is shown that a trained neural network - as a Substitute for an expert person - call easily categorize the existence and file severity Of a fault according to the features extracted From the presented method. This method requires no information about file motor internal structure and has been able to diagnose correctly in all the laboratory tests.

In order to increase the sensitivity of the residuals with respect to various faults, the structured residuals generated from both partial PCA and isolation-enhanced PCA are optimized. For the residual evaluation, the bootstrap technique is combined with the CUSUM method to achieve fast and robust detection. Three sensor faults and three actuator faults were studied using simulations employing a rigorous, first principles based, paper machine simulator.

These profiles are starting to be used as markers to improve prognosis or diagnosis of cancer, which implies that methods for automated supervised classification of arrayCGH data are needed. Like gene expression profiles, arrayCGH profiles are characterized by a large number of variables usually measured on a limited number of samples. However, arrayCGH profiles have a particular structure of correlations between variables, due to the spatial organization of bacterial artificial chromosomes along the genome. This suggests that classical classification methods, often based on the selection of a small number of discriminative features, may not be the most accurate methods and may not produce easily interpretable prediction rules. Results: We propose a new method for supervised classification of arrayCGH data. The method is a variant of support vector machine that incorporates the biological specificities of DNA copy number variations along the genome as prior knowledge. The resulting classifier is a sparse linear classifier based on a limited number of regions automatically selected on the chromosomes, leading to easy interpretation and identification of discriminative regions of the genome. We test this method on three classification problems for bladder and uveal cancer, involving both diagnosis and prognosis. We demonstrate that the introduction of the new prior on the classifier leads not only to more accurate predictions, but also to the identification of known and new regions of interest in the genome.

Support vector machines (SVM) is well known as intelligent classifier with strong generalization ability. Application of nonlinear SVM using kernel function is widely used for multi-class classification procedure. In this paper, building kernel function using wavelet will be introduced and applied for SVM multi-class classifier. Moreover, the feature vectors for training classification routine are obtained from transient current signal that preprocessed by discrete wavelet transform. In this work, principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA are performed to reduce the dimension of features and to extract the useful features for classification process. Hence, a relatively new intelligent faults detection and classification method called W-SVM is established. This method is used to induction motor for faults classification based on transient current signal. The results show that the performance of classificatiou has high accuracy based on experimental work. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rotor faults give rise to harmonic sideband currents and double slip frequency shaft torque oscillations, however. The total drive inertia thus influences the speed ripple which, again, influences the balance of the magnitudes of the lower and upper sideband current. Considering certain assumptions, the impact of the speed ripple on the current harmonics with respect to the stator and rotor fixed reference frame is investigated analytically. Additionally, the derived equations are applied to the Vienna Monitoring Method, a model-based rotor fault detection method.

J	Wadhwani, S; Gupta, SP; Kumar, V				Wadhwani, Sulochana; Gupta, S. P.; Kumar, Vinod			Fault classification for rolling element bearing in electric machines	IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						Condition monitoring; vibration analysis; bearing fault	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	Machines never break down by chance. Their operating condition gradually deteriorates and this gradual quantitative deterioration transforms into a failure, manifesting a qualitative change. When a fault takes place, some of the machine parameters are subjected to change. The change in the machine parameter depends on the degree of faults and the interaction with other parameters. In most cases, more than one parameter is subjected to change under abnormal conditions. If these machine parameters can be measured, they give information relating to a developing fault and then maintenance can be planned for the next available shutdown. Therefore, condition monitoring requires measurement to be taken from the machine on a continuous basis and is used to indicate the current working condition of that machine. There are a number of parameters that can be considered for monitoring the machine. For induction machines, monitoring parameters are terminal voltages, line currents, stack temperature of stator, rotor speed, torque, stator frame vibration, bearing vibrations, etc. ([1],[2],[3],[4]) This paper discusses the results of the laboratory investigations carried out on 10-hp cage induction motors to identify the machine health by monitoring. A data acquisition system, capable of recording vibration, line currents and line voltages, is designed and fabricated. The signals are sampled at a suitable sampling frequency using an add-on card and are saved in a computer for future use. The vibration signals are measured at a load end bearing of the test motor. The recorded vibration signals are then pre-processed both in time and frequency domain to extract the important features that contain the maximum fault information. The selected features are analysed for their class separation capability using the Fisher criterion. These features are then used as an input to the fault classifier. The fault classifier used in this study is the multi-layered perception trained with a back propagation algorithm. Two networks are trained independently, one with time domain parameters, module-TD, and the other with frequency domain parameters, module-FD. It is found that module-TD gives its best performance for incipient fault detection (100); however, for medium degree fault, it gives an 85 efficiency. The frequency parameter-based module gives a better performance for both the cases (98 and 95 respectively). However, a combination of the two can be used to enhance the decision ability of the system.	[Wadhwani, Sulochana] MITS, Dept Elect Engn, Gwalior 474008, India; [Gupta, S.

The four issues considered here include the following. (1) Can we characterize, a priori, the difficulty of fault classification via self-organizing maps? (2) Do data reduction techniques improve fault classification performance and enable the implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained digital electronic control units (DECUs)? (3) When does adaptive boosting, an incremental fusion method that successively combines moderately inaccurate classifiers into accurate ones, help improve classification performance? (4) How to synthesize classifier fusion architectures to improve the overall diagnostic accuracy? The classifiers studied in this paper are the support vector machine, probabilistic neural network, k-nearest neighbor, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and a physics-based single fault isolator. As these algorithms operate on large volumes of data and are generally computationally expensive, we reduce the data set using the multiway partial least squares method. This has the added benefits of improved diagnostic accuracy and smaller memory requirements. The performance of the moderately inaccurate classifiers is improved using adaptive boosting. These results are compared to the results of the classifiers alone, as well as different fusion architectures. We show that fusion reduces the variability in diagnostic accuracy, and is most useful when combining moderately inaccurate classifiers.

J	Gao, Q; Duan, C; Fan, H; Meng, Q				Gao, Q.; Duan, C.; Fan, H.; Meng, Q.			Rotating machine fault diagnosis using empirical mode decomposition	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						empirical mode decomposition; intrinsic mode function; fault diagnosis; rotating machine	HILBERT SPECTRUM; WAVELET ANALYSIS; DAMAGE DETECTION; VIBRATION; EMD; BEARINGS	In this paper, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based approach for rotating machine fault diagnosis is investigated. EMD is a new time-frequency analyzing method for nonlinear and non-stationary signals. By using EMD a complicated signal can be decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal. The IMFs, working as the basis functions, represent the intrinsic oscillation modes embedded in the signal. However, our research shows that IMFs sometimes fail to reveal the signal characteristics due to the effect of noises. Hence, combined mode function (CMF) is presented. With CMF, the neighboring IMFs are combined to obtain an oscillation mode depicting signal features more precisely. The adaptive filtering features of EMD and CMF are discussed, and the simulation signals are applied to test their performance. Finally, a practical fault signal of a power generator from a thermal-electric plant is analyzed to diagnose the fault by using EMD and CMF. The results show that EMD and CHF can extract the rotating machine fault characteristics and identify the fault patterns effectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pennacchi, P; Vania, A				Pennacchi, Paolo; Vania, Andrea			Diagnostics of a crack in a load coupling of a gas turbine using the machine model and the analysis of the shaft vibrations	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							PART 1; IDENTIFICATION; MISALIGNMENT	The diagnostics of malfunctions that can cause catastrophic failures has to be made in early stage in the industrial environment. Often flexible couplings are employed in industrial rotating machines when gearboxes and heavy thermal gradients are present. The hot and cold alignment of these couplings can be very different. Severe misalignments can generate cracks in the stub shafts, which can propagate in operating condition. Owing to the flexural flexibility of the load coupling, the shaft vibrations may be not noticeably affected by some typical symptoms that usually point out the presence of a crack, like twice per revolution harmonics in the vibration spectrum. Anyhow, suitable diagnostic strategies can detect clear fault symptoms, while model-based methods can confirm the occurrence of the shaft bow induced by the progressive yielding of a load coupling due to a crack. This paper shows as a model-based diagnostic methodology would have allowed a crack in a load coupling of a gas turbine to be identified before a serious failure happened by means of the shaft vibration analysis under operating conditions and rated speed.

This paper proposes a method to predict the future conditions of machines based on one-step-ahead prediction of time-series forecasting techniques and regression trees. In this study, the embedding dimension is firstly estimated in order to determine the necessarily available observations for predicting the next value in the future. This value is subsequently utilized for the predictor which is generated by using regression tree technique. Real trending data of low methane compressor acquired from condition monitoring routine are employed for evaluating the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method offers a potential for machine condition prognosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The system responses measured were accelerations and transmission errors. Acceleration measurements provide most of the information on bearing conditions, while transmission error measurements provide pertinent information on gear conditions. The measurements were carried out for several operating conditions (loads and speeds). System responses were processed in several analyzing domains (Time, Spectrum, and Cepstrum domains). The approach developed enables the detection and identification of combined faults and it can be applied to other types of rotating machines once the critical elements and their associated faults have been defined.

J	Chesnokov, YV				Chesnokov, Yuriy V.			Complexity and spectral analysis of the heart rate variability dynamics for distant prediction of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with artificial intelligence methods	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; prediction; heart rate variability; complexity; artificial neural networks; support vector machines	R INTERVAL DYNAMICS; AUTONOMIC TONE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; SPONTANEOUS ONSET; RESPIRATION; INITIATION	Objective: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a serious arrhythmia associated with morbidity and mortality. We explore the possibility of distant prediction of PAF by analyzing changes in heart rate variability (HRV) dynamics of non-PAF rhythms immediately before PAF event. We use that model for distant prognosis of PAF onset with artificial intelligence methods. Methods and materials: We analyzed 30-min non-PAF HRV records from 51 subjects immediately before PAF onset and at least 45 min distant from any PAF event. We used spectral and complexity analysis with sample (SmEn) and approximate (ApEn) entropies and their multiscale versions on extracted HRV data. We used that features to train the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to differentiate the subjects. The trained classifiers were further tested for distant PAF event prognosis on 16 subjects from independent database on non-PAF rhythm lasting from 60 to 320 min before PAF onset classifying the 30-min segments as distant or leading to PAF. Results: We found statistically significant increase in 30-min non-PAF HRV recordings from 51 subjects in the VLF, LF, HF bands and total power (p < 0.0001) before PAF event compared to PAF distant ones. The SmEn and ApEn analysis provided significant decrease in complexity (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001) before PAF onset. For training ANN and SVM classifiers the data from 51 subjects were randomly split to training, validation and testing. ANN provided better results in terms of sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and positive predictivity (Pp) compared to SVM which became biased towards positive case. The validation results of the ANN classifier we achieved: Se 76%, Sp 93%, Pp 94%. Testing ANN and SVM classifiers on 16 subjects with non-PAF HRV data preceding PAF events we obtained distant prediction of PAF onset with SVM classifier in 10 subjects (58 +/- 18 min in advance). ANN classifier provided distant prediction of PAF event in 13 subjects (62 +/- 21 min in advance). Conclusion: From the results of distant PAF prediction we conclude that ANN and SVM classifiers learned the changes in the HRV dynamics immediately before PAF event and successfully identified them during distant PAF prognosis on independent database. This confirms the reported in the literature results that corresponding changes in the HRV data occur about 60 min before PAF onset and proves the possibility of distant PAF prediction with ANN and SVM methods.

Asynchronous machine rotor fault diagnosis technique using complex wavelets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						asynchronous machines; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; monitoring; pattern recognition; wavelet transforms	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; INDUCTION-MOTOR; BROKEN BAR; STATOR	This paper introduces a novel approach for the detection of rotor faults in asynchronous machines, based on wavelet analysis of the stator phase current. To be more specific, the measured stator phase current is filtered through a complex wavelet. Theoretical analysis validates that the spectrum of the modulus of the result of the filtering is free from the fundamental supply frequency component, and the fault characteristics can be highlighted. This is advantageous, especially if the induction machine operates at low slip values, where the characteristic frequency components of the rotor fault are very close to the fundamental frequency component. At the same time, by matching the wavelet function to the frequencies of the faulty components, a narrow bandpass filter at the frequency region of the fault characteristic spectral components is obtained. Furthermore, in the context of this paper, features extracted using the proposed technique are used as input to a support vector machine classifier that is employed for the detection of the rotor fault. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

This model can simulate and predict the line current harmonics during healthy and faulty operation conditions. A lumped parameter model that considers every single coil in the stator and rotor as a separate electrical and magnetic circuit is proposed. Self and mutual inductances of the coils are estimated by means of the winding function approach (WFA), accounting for the most relevant space harmonics in the machine air gap. The commutation is modeled by using the real brush width and assuming that the brush-commutator contact resistance is a function uniquely of their contact area, which depends on the armature position. Short circuits between adjacent commutator bars are investigated. It is shown that the model achieves good accuracy, reproducing fairly well the armature current ripple for healthy and faulty operation of the machine.

A special degradation trace on the V-CEsat of the insulated-gate bipolar-transistor modules was observed by a power-cycling accelerated test, which was not reported in literatures. A prognostic system based on utilizing the aforementioned trace is then developed. The system consists of the hardware architecture and current adaptive-algorithm-based software architecture. In addition, this prognostic system hardly increases. the hardware cost on existing vehicle-driver system. An extensive simulation based on MATLAB/Simulink verifies the developed prognostic system.

The implemented method has a powerful line current noise suppression capability while detecting the fault signatures. Because the line current of inverter-driven motors involve low-order harmonies, high-frequency switching disturbances, and the noise generated by harsh industrial environment, the real-time fault analyses yield erroneous or fluctuating fault signatures. This situation becomes a significant problem when the signal-to-noise ratio of the fault signature is quite low. It is theoretically and experimentally shown that the proposed method can determine the normalized magnitude and phase information of the fault signatures even in the presence of noise, where the noise amplitude is several times higher than the signal itself. Since it has low computational burden, the developed algorithm is embedded to the motor control program without degrading drive performance. Therefore, it is implemented without any additional cost using readily available drive processor and current sensors.

Fault Modeling and detection capabilities for EFSM models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Conformance testing; extended finite-state machine (EFSM); fault modeling; finite-state machine (FSM); Session Initiation Protocol (SIP); timed EFSM; timers; Voice over IP (VoIP)		Inherent timing variables and constraints in communication protocols require new extended finite-state machine (EFSM) models to formally represent their behavior, particularly for test generation purposes. However, infeasible paths due to the conflicts among the timing condition and action variables in the timed EFSM models with the activation and expiration of concurrent timers complicate the test generation process. In a test measurement laboratory, such timers, if not properly taken into account by formal methods at the test generation step, can generate false results by failing correct implementations or, worse, passing faulty implementations. This paper analyzes the fault detection capability of the timed EFSM models introduced in our earlier work in the presence of multiple timing faults. It is proven that, for a class of timing faults, test sequences generated from our models can detect multiple occurrences of pairwise combinations of such faults.

Noninvasive fault monitoring of electrical machines by solving the steady-state magnetic inverse problem	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th Biennial COMPUMAG Conference on Computation of Electromagnetic Fields	JUN 24-28, 2007	Aachen, GERMANY	Int Compumag Soc		electrical machines; flux leakage; integral method; inverse problem; method of moments; noninvasive diagnosis		This paper proposes an original approach for detection, localization, and quantification of faults appearing in electrical machines. The used method in this work deals with the analysis of the external magnetic field of a machine. This approach is already known, but until now, classical methods only detect if a fault is present or not. Thus, we propose a new approach based on the theory of inverse problems. From magnetic measurements realized on sensors located around the machine, a numerical model of the machine is inverted to get the distribution of the flux in the air gap. Therefore, the analysis of this distribution can allow us not only to identify a faulty mode, but also to quantify its importance.	[Bui, V.

This technique is based on the branch trace exception feature available in the PowerPC processors family for debugging purposes. This technique traces the target addresses of program branches at run-time and compares them with reference target addresses to detect possible violations caused by transient faults. The reference target addresses are derived by a preprocessor from the source program. To enhance the error detection coverage, three other mechanisms, i.e., Machine Check Exception, System Trap Instructions and Work Load Timer are combined with the Branch Trace Exception mechanism. The proposed technique is experimentally evaluated on a 32-bit PowerPC microcontroller using software implemented fault injection (SWIFI) and Power Supply Disturbances fault injection (PSD). A total of 6,000 faults were injected in microcontroller to measure the error detection coverage of the proposed control flow checking technique. The experimental results show that this technique detects about 95.2% of transient errors in software implemented fault injection method and 96.4% of transient errors in power supply disturbances fault injection method.

J	Subrahmanya, N; Shin, YC				Subrahmanya, Niranjan; Shin, Yung C.			Automated sensor selection and fusion for monitoring and diagnostics of plunge grinding	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						grinding; process monitoring; machine learning; feature selection; sensor fusion; leave-one-out error; least squares support vector machine	CHATTER; WHEEL; WEAR; STATE	This paper deals with the development of an online monitoring system based on feature-level sensor fusion and its application to OD plunge grinding. Different sensors are used to measure acoustic emission, spindle power, and workpiece vibration signals, which are used to monitor three of the most common faults in grinding-workpiece burn, chatter, and wheel wear. Although a number of methods have been reported in recent literature for monitoring these faults, they have not found widespread application in industry as no single method or feature has been shown to be successful for all setups and for all wheel-workpiece combinations. This paper proposes a systematic approach, which allows the development and deployment of process-monitoring systems via automated sensor and feature selection combined with parameter-free model training, both of which are especially crucial for implementation in industry. The proposed algorithm makes use of "sparsity-promoting" penalty terms to encourage sensor and feature selection while the "hyperparameters" of the algorithm are tuned using an approximation of the leave-one-out error. Experimental results obtained for monitoring burn, chatter, and wheel wear from a plunge grinding test bed show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Lei, Y; He, ZJ; Zi, YY				Lei, Yaguo; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang			Application of a novel hybrid intelligent method to compound fault diagnosis of locomotive roller bearings	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						hybrid intelligent method; salient features; multiple classifier combination; compound fault diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFIER	To diagnose compound faults of locomotive roller bearings accurately, a novel hybrid intelligent diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. First of all, vibration signals are preprocessed to mine valid fault characteristic information. They are filtered and at the same time, they are decomposed by the empirical mode decomposition method and eight intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are acquired. The filtered signals and IMFs are further demodulated to obtain their Hilbert envelope spectrums. Second, six feature sets are extracted, and they are time- and frequency-domain statistical features of the raw and preprocessed signals. Then, each feature set is evaluated and a few salient features are selected from it by applying the improved distance evaluation technique. Correspondingly, six salient feature sets are obtained. Finally, the six salient feature sets are, respectively, input into six classifiers based on adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and genetic algorithm is employed to combine the outputs of the six ANFISs and to attain the final diagnosis result. The diagnosis results of the compound faults of the locomotive roller bearings verify that the proposed hybrid intelligent method may accurately recognize not only a single fault and fault severities but also compound faults.

In this article a denoising method of the measured signals is presented. Based on the optimization of wavelet multiresolution analysis, it uses the kurtosis as an optimization and evaluation criterion, several parameters were then selected. The experimental results show the validity of this method within the detection of several defects simulated on ball bearings. The various configurations, in which the signals were measured, allow leading to optimum conditions of its application. The application of WMRA on filtered signals allows better results than its application on wide bands signals or a simple band pass filtering.

Fault diagnostics of roller bearing using kernel based neighborhood score multi-class support vector machine	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						feature selection; decision tree; roller bearing; statistical features; multi-class support vector machine; fault detection	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS	Roller bearing is one of the most widely used rotary elements in a rotary machine. The roller bearing's nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature are to be extracted through some indirect means. Statistical parameters like kurtosis, standard deviation, maximum value, etc. form a set of features, which are widely used in fault diagnostics. Finding out good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing is often a problem. Selection of good features is an important phase in pattern recognition and requires detailed domain knowledge. This paper addresses the feature selection process using decision tree and uses kernel based neighborhood score multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) for classification. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer is captured for the following conditions: good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race faults. The statistical features are extracted therefrom and classified successfully using MSVM. The results of MSVM are compared with and binary support vector machine (SVM). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Periodic offline monitoring of the motor condition is usually performed in the industry, consuming production time and increasing cost. Broken rotor bars are among the most common failures in induction motors. Reported research projects give a broken-rotor-bar-detection methodology based on personal-computer implementation that is performed offline and requires an expert technician interpretation which is not a cost-effective solution. The novelty of this paper is the development of an automatic online diagnosis algorithm for broken-rotor-bar detection, optimized for single low-cost field-programmable gate-array (FPGA) implementation, which guarantees the development of economical self-operated equipment. The proposed algorithm requires less computation load than the previously reported algorithms, and it is mainly based on the discrete-wavelet-transform application to the start-up current transient; a further single mean-square computation determines a weighting function that, according to its value, clearly points the motor condition as either healthy or damaged. In order to validate the proposed algorithm, several tests were performed, and an FPGA implementation was developed to show the algorithm feasibility for automatic online diagnosis.

The method focuses on the study of an approximation signal resulting from the wavelet decomposition of the startup stator current. The presence of the left sideband harmonic is used as evidence of the rotor failure in most diagnosis methods based on the analysis of the stator current. Thus, a detailed description of the evolution of the left sideband harmonic during the startup transient is given in this paper; for this purpose, a method for calculating the evolution of the left sideband during the startup is developed, and its results are physically explained. This paper also shows that the approximation signal of a particular level, which is obtained from the discrete wavelet transform of the startup stator current, practically reproduces the time evolution of the left sideband harmonic during the startup. The diagnosis method proposed here consists of checking if the selected approximation signal fits well the characteristic shape of the left sideband harmonic evolution described in this paper. The method is validated through laboratory tests. The results prove that it can constitute a useful tool for the diagnosis of rotor bar breakages.

When a machine is connected to the line, the startup transient is characterized by large stator (and rotor) currents as well as by large slips (i.e., the rotor speed is significantly smaller than the excitation frequency). The stator current of machines with damaged rotors,includes large rotor speed dependent components during the startup transient. Such components, however, fade away or coincide with components not containing fault-related information (e.g., saturation-induced components) once the machine reaches steady state. Because of this, the startup transient provides an opportunity for performing diagnostics on the machine. This paper shows that the information contained in the startup transient signal can be effectively separated and detected using a complex vector wavelet transform.

Classification of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance breast lesions by support vector machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						breast imaging; classification; magnetic resonance; imaging (MRI); support vector machines (SVMs); visualization	NEURAL-NETWORKS; MR-MAMMOGRAPHY; IMAGES; DIAGNOSIS; CANCER; VISUALIZATION; SEGMENTATION; BRCA1	Early detection of breast cancer is one of the most important factors in determining prognosis for women with malignant tumors. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has been shown to be the most sensitive modality for screening high-risk women. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have the potential to assist radiologists in the early detection of cancer. A key component of the development of such a CAD system will be the selection of an appropriate classification function responsible for separating malignant and benign lesions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of variations in temporal feature vectors and kernel functions on the separation of malignant and benign DCE-MRI breast lesions by support vector machines (SVMs). We also propose and demonstrate a classifier visualization and evaluation technique. We show that SVMs provide an effective and flexible framework from which to base CAD techniques for breast MRI, and that the proposed classifier visualization technique has potential as a mechanism for the evaluation of classification solutions.

J	Hong, H; Liang, M				Hong, Hoonbin; Liang, Ming			A fractional calculus technique for on-line detection of oil debris	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						in-line oil debris sensor; non-invasive damage evaluation; on-line oil debris signature extraction; machine structural health monitoring; fractional calculus; signal processing		The quantity and size of the metallic debris falling off machine components due to fatigue, corrosion and pitting provide valuable information about the machine structural integrity. For this reason, in-line oil debris sensors have been widely adopted for on-line fault detection. However, the effectiveness of such sensors relies on how the acquired data are processed. The existing method for identifying debris or particle signatures is threshold based. Specifying a proper threshold is application dependent and knowledge demanding. Even if a 'proper' threshold can be determined, it is useful only when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. However, the signal is often contaminated by noise, making the threshold irrelevant. As such, we propose a fractional calculus technique consisting of two detectors to enhance the detection process. The first detector is used to extract the 'particle-like' waveform. Nevertheless, if the signal is weak, the signature obtained by this detector cannot be definitely classified as a true particle signature. The second detector is hence used to confirm or dismiss the signature authenticity depending on whether it can locate the three inflection points - a key feature of a particle signature. This technique does not require any threshold and therefore can avoid the difficulties present in the existing method. Both simulated and experimental results have shown that the proposed technique is robust in a noisy environment and can effectively detect small particles. Furthermore, this technique does not require additional filtering or de-noising steps, and signal processing can be simplified accordingly.

J	Bozchalooi, IS; Liang, M				Bozchalooi, I. Soltani; Liang, Ming			A joint resonance frequency estimation and in-band noise reduction method for enhancing the detectability of bearing fault signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						resonance frequency estimation; de-noising; wavelet filtering; wavelet parameter selection; smoothness index; spectral subtraction	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; WAVELET FILTER; KURTOSIS; DEFECTS; PROGNOSTICS; DIAGNOSIS	The vibration signal measured from a bearing contains vital information for the prognostic and health assessment purposes. However, when bearings are installed as part of a complex mechanical system, the measured signal is often heavily clouded by various noises due to the compounded effect of interferences of other machine elements and background noises present in the measuring device. As such, reliable condition monitoring would not be possible without proper de-noising. This is particularly true for incipient bearing faults with very weak signature signals. A new de-noising scheme is proposed in this paper to enhance the vibration signals acquired from faulty bearings. This de-noising scheme features a spectral subtraction to trim down the in-band noise prior to wavelet filtering. The Gabor wavelet is used in the wavelet transform and its parameters, i.e., scale and shape factor are selected in separate steps. The proper scale is found based on a novel resonance estimation algorithm. This algorithm makes use of the information derived from the variable shaft rotational speed though such variation is highly undesirable in fault detection since it complicates the process substantially. The shape factor value is then selected by minimizing a smoothness index. This index is defined as the ratio of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the wavelet coefficient moduli. De-noising results are presented for simulated signals and experimental data acquired from both normal and faulty bearings with defective outer race, inner race, and rolling element.

For obtaining more accurate time-frequency spectrum estimation, time-varying autoregressive method based on Kalman smoothing algorithm is utilized to realize parametric modeling of non-stationary signal so as to obtain high resolution time-frequency spectrum. Singular value decomposition (SVD) method is adopted to obtain the first left and right singular vectors of time-frequency spectrum. And by down sampling and preprocessing, these singular vectors are taken as feature vectors of time-frequency spectrum. Moreover, radial basis function (RBF) neural network is adopted to realize the automated classification. By classification of rolling element bearing in four kinds of different status, the results show that algorithm mentioned above can realize the automated and accurate diagnosis of bearing fault.

The recent developments in the field of nanoelectronics, with transducers progressively shrinking down to smaller sizes through nanotechnology and carbon nanotubes, are expected to result in innovative biomedical instrumentation possibilities, with new therapies and efficient diagnosis methodologies. The use of integrated systems, smart biosensors, and programmable nanodevices are advancing nanoelectronics, enabling the progressive research and development of molecular machines. It should provide high precision pervasive biomedical monitoring with real time data transmission. The use of nanobioelectronics as embedded systems is the natural pathway towards manufacturing methodology to achieve nanorobot applications out of laboratories sooner as possible. To demonstrate the practical application of medical nanorobotics, a 3D simulation based on clinical data addresses how to integrate communication with nanorobots using RFID, mobile phones, and satellites, applied to long distance ubiquitous surveillance and health monitoring for troops in conflict zones. Therefore, the current model can also be used to prevent and save a population against the case of some targeted epidemic disease.

J	Pusey, HC; Howard, PL				Pusey, Henry C.; Howard, Paul L.			An historical review of mechanical failure prevention technology	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								In April 1967, 42 engineers and scientists concerned with the troublesome and costly problems of mechanical failures met at the Office of Naval Research to form the Mechanical Failures Prevention Group (MFPG). The participants, who represented several government agencies and industries, met to develop a forum to exchange information and innovative ideas on methods to avoid or predict mechanical failures in a wide variety of vehicles, equipment and structures. This meeting was the genesis of a broad interdisciplinary society that has become and serves today as a powerful resource in the field of machinery failure prevention, analysis, diagnostics and prognostics. This article, an updated revision of a paper published in the proceedings of MFPT 50, describes the developments and progress in mechanical failure prevention technology, primarily over the last four decades. The principal sources for this overview are the proceedings of the 49 conferences of the MFPG, which has become the Society for Machinery Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT) and is an operating division of the Vibration Institute.

Detection of incipient faults in induction motors using FIS, ANN and ANFIS techniques	JOURNAL OF POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						induction motor; winding insulation; inter-turn short circuit; bearing wear; FIS; ANN; ANFIS	MONITORING TECHNIQUES; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL NETWORKS; INTERNAL FAULTS; BEARING WEAR; STATOR FAULT; FUZZY SYSTEM; INSULATION	The task performed by induction motors grows increasingly complex in modem industry and hence improvements are sought in the field of fault diagnosis. It is essential to diagnose faults at their very inception, as unscheduled machine down time can upset critical dead lines and cause heavy financial losses. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have proved their ability in detection of incipient faults in electrical machines. This paper presents an application of AI techniques for the detection of inter-turn insulation and bearing wear faults in single-phase induction motors. The single-phase induction motor is considered a proto type model to create inter-turn insulation and bearing wear faults. The experimental data for motor intake current, rotor speed, stator winding temperature, bearing temperature and noise of the motor under running condition was generated in the laboratory. The different types of fault detectors were developed based upon three different AI techniques. The input parameters for these detectors were varied from two to five sequentially. The comparisons were made and the best fault detector was determined.

J	Calis, H; Cakir, A				Calis, Hakan; Cakir, Abduelkadir			Experimental study for sensorless broken bar detection in induction motors	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						fault diagnosis; induction motor; broken rotor bar; spectral analysis; zero crossing instants	DIAGNOSIS	This study presents experimental results of sensorless broken bar detection in induction motors based on fluctuations of the stator current zero crossing instants before actual breakdown occurs. These fluctuations are sensed by a microcontroller (mu C), and transferred to a computer for monitoring the amplitude changes on specific frequency components using fast Fourier transformation algorithms. The motor current signal is also monitored for verification purposes. The main reasons of rotor faults are broken bars, end ring faults and bearing faults. Most recent efforts are focusing on current spectrum analysis, as the current signal is easily accessible for all induction motors. Instead of sampling motor current with a high resolution analog to digital converter, zero crossing instants are recorded as the waveforms cross zero. Fluctuations in the intervals between successive zero crossings of the three phase current waveforms are analyzed in the frequency domain. Broken bars and end ring breakages, supply unbalances, rotor eccentricities and shaft misalignment faults are distinguished by monitoring amplitude changes of the 2sf, f(r), and 2f spectral components, where s is the motor slip, f is supply frequency and f(r) is rotor speed. Appearance of only the 2sf component in zero crossing times (ZCT) of the signal spectrum implies rotor faults. The 2f component occurs only when supply is unbalanced or in the case of stator winding faults. Separation of these two faults is implemented by monitoring both components. In addition, when there is additional rotor eccentricity due to bearing deterioration or shaft misalignment, it is also necessary to monitor the f(r) fault signature component to distinguish mixed faults. It may be necessary to include additional signals such as motor vibration or temperature to extend the reliability of the fault detection system for critical machines. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, it is examined that the DSPM motor is a new class of fault-tolerant machines, a potential candidate for many applications where reliability and power density are of importance. Fault analysis is performed in a DSPM motor drive, including internal and external faults. Due to the fact that the experimentation on a true motor drive for such a purpose is impractical because of its high cost and difficulty to make, a new cosimulation model of a DSPM motor drive is developed using coupled magnetic and electric circuit solvers. Last, to improve the performance of a DSPM motor drive with an open-circuited fault, a fault compensation strategy is proposed. Simulation and experimental results are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed cosimulation method and the high performance of the fault-tolerant characteristic of DSPM motor drives.

Bearing problems are one major cause for drive failures. Their detection is possible by vibration monitoring of characteristic bearing frequencies. As it is possible to detect other machine faults by monitoring the stator current, a great interest exists in applying the same method for bearing fault detection. After a presentation of the existing fault model, a new detailed approach is proposed. It is based on the following two effects of a bearing fault: 1) the introduction of a particular radial rotor movement and 2) load torque variations caused by the bearing fault. The theoretical study results in new expressions for the stator current frequency content. Experimental tests with artificial and realistic bearing damage were conducted by measuring vibration, torque, and stator current.

Traditional fault detection methods are able to monitor the process and detect deterioration of the equipment after their degradation and malfunction occurs. This paper presents an intelligent technique based on a neural network (NN) that monitors the health of the equipment and forecasts faults by detecting any onset of failures. In this approach, an adaptive modular NN architecture that is capable of monitoring the health of industrial machines is introduced. This technique is applied to a subsystem of a machining center. The high accuracy of the technique is verified by extensive tests, resulting in over 99% precision.

J	Chan, A; McNaught, KR				Chan, A.; McNaught, K. R.			Using Bayesian networks to improve fault diagnosis during manufacturing tests of mobile telephone infrastructure	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						Bayesian network; fault diagnosis; manufacturing; intelligent system; intelligent user interface; decision support system	INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT-SYSTEMS; ROTATING MACHINERY; NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; EXPERT-SYSTEM; OPERATIONS	Intense competition and the requirement to continually drive down costs within a mature mobile telephone infrastructure market calls for new and innovative solutions to process improvement. One particular challenge is to improve the quality and reliability of the diagnostic process for systems testing of Global System for Mobile Communications and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System products. In this paper, we concentrate on a particularly important equipment type - the Base Transceiver Station (BTS). The BTS manages the radio channels and transfers signalling information to and from mobile stations (ie mobile phones). Most of the diagnostic processes are manually operated and rely heavily on individual operators and technicians' knowledge for their performance. Hence, there is a high cost associated with troubleshooting in terms of time and manpower. In this paper, we employ Bayesian networks (BNs) to model the domain knowledge that comprises the operations of the System Under Test, Automated Test Equipment (ATE), and the diagnostic skill of experienced engineers, in an attempt to enhance the efficiency and reliability of the diagnostic process. The proposed automated diagnostic tool (known as Wisdom) consists of several modules. An intelligent user interface provides possible solutions to test operators/technicians, captures their responses, and activates the automated test program. Server and client software architecture is used to integrate Wisdom with the ATE seamlessly and to maintain Wisdom as an independent module. A local area network provides the infrastructure for managing and deploying the multimedia information in real time. We describe how a diagnostic model can be developed and implemented using a BN approach. We also describe how the resulting process of diagnosis following failure, advice generation, and subsequent actions by the operator are handled interactively by the prototype system. The results from an initial survey are presented, indicating sizeable reductions in fault correction times for many fault types.	[McNaught, K.

Vibration signal measured from a defective rolling bearing is decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), with each IMF corresponding to a specific range of frequency components contained within the vibration signal. Two criteria, the energy measure and correlation measure, are investigated to determine the most representative IMF for extracting defect-induced characteristic features out of vibration signals. The envelope spectrum of the selected IMF is investigated as an indicator for both the existence and the specific location of structural defects within the bearing. Theoretical foundation of the technique is introduced, and its performance is experimentally verified.

A review on fault diagnosis of induction machines	LATIN AMERICAN APPLIED RESEARCH			English	Review						induction machines; fault detection and diagnosis	STATOR WINDINGS; ROTOR FAILURES; MOTORS	Different alternatives to detect and diagnose faults in induction machines have been proposed and implemented in the last years. These new alternatives are characterised by an on-line and non-invasive feature, that is to say, the capacity to detect faults while the machine is working and the capacity to work sensorless. These characteristics, obtained by the new techniques, distinguish them from the traditional ones, which, in most cases, need that the machine which is being analysed is not working to do the diagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to revise the main alternatives in the detection of faults in induction machines and compare their contributions according to the information they require for the diagnosis, the number and relevance of the faults that can be detected, the speed to anticipate a fault and the accuracy in the diagnosis.

Machine fault feature extraction based on intrinsic mode functions	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						machine fault feature extraction; intrinsic mode functions; amplitude acceleration energy; empirical mode decomposition	HILBERT SPECTRUM; EMD METHOD; DIAGNOSIS; DECOMPOSITION; BEARINGS; SIGNALS; DEFECT	This work employs empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose raw vibration signals into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that represent the oscillatory modes generated by the components that make up the mechanical systems generating the vibration signals. The motivation here is to develop vibration signal analysis programs that are self-adaptive and that can detect machine faults at the earliest onset of deterioration. The change in velocity of the amplitude of some IMFs over a particular unit time will increase when the vibration is stimulated by a component fault. Therefore, the amplitude acceleration energy in the intrinsic mode functions is proposed as an indicator of the impulsive features that are often associated with mechanical component faults. The periodicity of the amplitude acceleration energy for each IMF is extracted by spectrum analysis. A spectrum amplitude index is introduced as a method to select the optimal result. A comparison study of the method proposed here and some well-established techniques for detecting machinery faults is conducted through the analysis of both gear and bearing vibration signals. The results indicate that the proposed method has superior capability to extract machine fault features from vibration signals.

J	Li, Z; He, ZJ; Zi, YY; Jiang, HK				Li, Zhen; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang; Jiang, Hongkai			Rotating machinery fault diagnosis using signal-adapted lifting scheme	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						adaptive lifting scheme; fault diagnosis; vibration signal analysis	MESHING VIBRATION; WAVELET; TRANSFORM; DESIGN; GEARS	Wavelet transform has been widely used for vibration-based machine fault diagnosis. However, it is a difficult task to choose or design appropriate wavelet or wavelets for a given application. In this paper, a new signal-adapted lifting scheme for rotating machinery fault diagnosis is proposed, which allows us to construct a wavelet directly from the statistics of a given signal. The prediction operator based on genetic algorithms is designed to maximize the kurtosis of detail signal produced by the lifting scheme, and the update operator is designed to minimize a reconstruction error. The signal-adapted lifting scheme is applied to analyze bearing and gearbox vibration signals. The conventional diagnosis techniques and non-adaptive lifting scheme are also used to analyze the same signals for comparison. The results demonstrate that the signal-adapted lifting scheme is more effective in extracting inherent fault features from complex vibration signals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Avoidance of speckle noise in laser vibrometry by the use of kurtosis ratio: Application to mechanical fault diagnostics	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						laser vibrometer; speckle noise; kurtosis; rolling element bearing; universal electric motor; washing machine	CREST FACTOR; VIBRATION; DEFECTS; MOTORS	This paper presents a statistical technique to enhance vibration signals measured by laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV). The method has been optimised for LDV signals measured on bearings of universal electric motors and applied to quality control of washing machines. Inherent problems of LDV are addressed, particularly the speckle noise occurring when rough surfaces are measured. The presence of speckle noise is detected using a new scalar indicator kurtosis ratio (KR), specifically designed to quantify the amount of random impulses generated by this noise. The KR is a ratio of the standard kurtosis and a robust estimate of kurtosis, thus indicating the outliers in the data. Since it is inefficient to reject the signals affected by the speckle noise, an algorithm for selecting an undistorted portion of a signal is proposed. The algorithm operates in the time domain and is thus fast and simple. The algorithm includes band-pass filtering and segmentation of the signal, as well as thresholding of the KR computed for each filtered signal segment. Algorithm parameters are discussed in detail and instructions for optimisation are provided. Experimental results demonstrate that speckle noise is effectively avoided in severely distorted signals, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly. Typical faults are finally detected using squared envelope analysis. It is also shown that the KR of the band-pass filtered signal is related to the spectral kurtosis (SK). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, YJ; Tse, PW; Wang, XJ				Li, Yujun; Tse, Peter W.; Wang, Xiaojuan			Recovery of vibration signal based on a super-exponential algorithm	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BLIND DECONVOLUTION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; BEARING	Vibration-based analysis is an important technique in machine fault diagnosis. In complex machines, the vibration generated by a component is easily affected by the vibration of other components or is corrupted by noise from other sources. Hence, the fault-related vibration must be recovered from among those sources for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, a super-exponential algorithm (SEA) based on the single-input single-output (SISO) convolution mixing model is investigated to deconvolve the vibration signal of interest. Based on simulated vibration signals generated by a test bench in a laboratory and real signals generated by industrial machines, the characteristics of the SEA with skewness and kurtosis schemes are studied extensively for the recovery of signals with different statistical distributions. It is shown that the SEA with the skewness scheme is more suitable for the isolation of a vibration signal with an asymmetric distribution, whereas the SEA with the kurtosis scheme is more efficient for detecting a vibration with abrupt changes in its distribution. Furthermore, the effect of the equalizer length on the characteristics of the equalized signal is discussed. A performance curve that presents the equalization performance is defined, and a method that uses this curve to select the optimal equalizer length for successfully recovering the defect signal from the mixed signal is then proposed. The study presented in this paper thus shows that the SEA is a promising method for the recovery of vibrations in machine fault diagnosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Induction machine broken bar and stator short-circuit fault diagnostics based on three-phase stator current envelopes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						AC motor drive systems; broken bars; envelope detection and classification; fault diagnosis; induction machines (IMs); induction motors; interturn short circuits	MOTORS	A new method for the fault diagnosis of a broken rotor bar and interturn short circuits in induction machines (IMs) is presented. The method is based on the analysis of the three-phase stator current envelopes of IMs using reconstructed phase space transforms. The signatures of each type of fault are created from the three-phase current envelope of each fault. The resulting fault signatures for the new so-called "unseen signals" are classified using Gaussian mixture models and a Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier.

First, a modeling and simulation study concerning the occurrence of airgap eccentricity in three-phase induction motors is presented. For that purpose, the winding function approach is considered. Then, both simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A suitable fault-severity factor is also proposed as an indicator of the condition of the machine.	[Drif, M'hamed; Cardoso, A. J.

This paper focuses on a new approach for monitoring the condition of the stator insulation for failure-prone inverter-fed machines. The main concept of the proposed technique is to apply a dc and/or variable-frequency ac test voltage to the stator insulation using the inverter and to perform standard offline insulation tests whenever the motor is not operating. This allows the stator insulation to be tested more frequently as compared to offline tests performed once every three to six years during periodic maintenance. Two methods for testing the insulation with minimal modifications to the inverter circuit are proposed and verified experimentally. The results show that the proposed technique provides a simple low-cost solution for detecting stator insulation degradation at an early stage for reliable operation of inverter-fed machine systems, since the insulation condition can be monitored frequently. This does not only helps prevent forced outages and safety risks due to insulation breakdown but also helps perform maintenance in an efficient manner, since individual motor maintenance can be prioritized and scheduled based on its present condition.

J	Kim, S; Whitehead, EJ; Zhang, Y				Kim, Sunghun; Whitehead, E. James, Jr.; Zhang, Yi			Classifying software changes: Clean or buggy?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						maintenance; software metrics; software fault diagnosis; configuration management; classification; association rules; data mining; machine learning	SYSTEM; FAULTS	This paper introduces a new technique for predicting latent software bugs, called change classification. Change classification uses a machine learning classifier to determine whether a new software change is more similar to prior buggy changes or clean changes. In this manner, change classification predicts the existence of bugs in software changes. The classifier is trained using features ( in the machine learning sense) extracted from the revision history of a software project stored in its software configuration management repository. The trained classifier can classify changes as buggy or clean, with a 78 percent accuracy and a 60 percent buggy change recall on average. Change classification has several desirable qualities: 1) The prediction granularity is small ( a change to a single file), 2) predictions do not require semantic information about the source code, 3) the technique works for a broad array of project types and programming languages, and 4) predictions can be made immediately upon the completion of a change. Contributions of this paper include a description of the change classification approach, techniques for extracting features from the source code and change histories, a characterization of the performance of change classification across 12 open source projects, and an evaluation of the predictive power of different groups of features.

Sensorless speed estimation in induction motor drives by using the space vector angular fluctuation signal	IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article							AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATION; MACHINES	A sensorless speed estimation method for real-time application in induction motor drives under steady-state condition is proposed. Speed harmonic component in the space vector angular fluctuation (SVAF) signal, which is caused by both dynamic and static eccentricity, is used for speed estimation. The SVAF signal is obtained from the stator currents of the induction motor. The extraction of speed information using digital signal processing techniques is considered. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the validity of the speed estimation method on an induction motor driven by an inverter.

Fault-tolerant control in variable speed drives: a survey	IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article							INDUCTION-MOTOR DRIVES; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; DYNAMIC SIMULATION; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; STATOR FAULT; PWM INVERTER; DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; ECCENTRICITY	A survey on fault-tolerant control is presented for variable speed drives (VSD), mainly addressing DC and induction motors. Thus, fault diagnosis, accommodation and hardware reconfiguration are reviewed with application to VSD. First, the most common fault scenarios in these electrical machines are described. These conditions are analysed, and their implications and mathematical modelling are discussed. Next, the fault diagnosis strategies based on signal processing, model-based techniques and artificial intelligence are reviewed. Moreover, the diverse hardware reconfiguration schemes of power actuators with semiconductor failures are detailed. A key piece in any VSD is the control algorithm, which can be severely affected in a fault condition. Finally, the fault accommodation schemes suggested so far in the literature are illustrated.

J	Xu, RZ; Xie, L; Zhang, MC; Li, CX				Xu, Rong-Zhen; Xie, Le; Zhang, Min-Cong; Li, Cong-Xin			Machine degradation analysis using fuzzy CMAC neural network approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						degradation analysis; degradation index; fuzzy logic; neural network; cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC)	DIAGNOSIS	Traditionally, machine condition is described as a dichotomous problem: normal or failure. In fact, machines go through a series of degrading states until failure occurs. Degrading states do not make machines breakdown, but they do decrease performance reliability and increase the potential for faults and failures. In this paper, a neural network approach based on fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (FCMAC) is proposed to analyze machine degradation severity. Two kinds of situations are discussed: (1) machine signature from different levels of degradation severity are available to train the network; (2) machine signature from only normal perfect state are available to train the network. A degradation index is developed to reflect the degradation degree. The FCMAC network works as a 'classifier' or a 'condition discriminator' in these two situations. An example is presented to demonstrate this method and the results show that the FCMAC network is capable of ranking machine degradations quantitatively in both situations. With degradation analysis, maintenance activities can be implemented before failure eventually occurs, thus preventing fatal breakdowns more effectively.

J	Mahardika, M; Mitsui, K				Mahardika, Muslim; Mitsui, Kimiyuki			A new method for monitoring micro-electric discharge machining processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						micro-electric discharge machining; online monitoring; discharge pulses counting methods; discharge pulses energy; tool electrode vibration		Micro-electric discharge machining (mu-EDM) is a very complex phenomenon in terms of its material removal characteristics since it is affected by many complications such as adhesion, short-circuiting and cavitations. This paper presents a new method for monitoring mu-EDM processes by counting discharge pulses and it presents a fundamental study of a prognosis approach for calculating the total energy of discharge pulses. For different machining types (shape-up and flat-head) and machining conditions (mandrel rotation and tool electrode vibration), the results obtained using this new monitoring method with the prognosis approach show good agreement between the discharge pulses number and the total energy of discharge pulses to the material removal and tool electrode wear characteristic in mu-EDM processes. On applying tool electrode vibration, the machining time becomes shorter, because it removes adhesion. The effect of tool electrode vibration in order to remove adhesion can be monitored with good results. In order to achieve high accuracy, the tool wear compensation factor has been successfully calculated, since the amount of tool electrode wear is different in each machining type and condition. Consequently, a deeper understanding of the mu-EDM process has been achieved. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of component-level damage evolution models for mechanical prognosis	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						damage identification; prognosis; load identification; restoring forces; empirical damage evolution models	NONPARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION; INPUT MEASUREMENT; ABSENCE	This paper presents. component-level empirical damage evolution regression models based on loads and damage information that do for mechanical damage prediction what the Paris law does for predicting crack growth under fatigue loading. Namely, these regression models combine information about the current damage state and internal system loads to predict the progress of damage to failure. One of the drawbacks of Paris-like crack evolution laws is that localized information about the loading (stress) and damage (crack length) is required. In structural health monitoring applications, it is not feasible to instrument every potential crack initiation region to collect this localized information. The component-level damage evolution regression models developed here only require global measurements that quantify the damage and loading at the level of the component rather than at the site of damage. This paper develops damage evolution regression models for an automotive sway bar link undergoing axial fatigue loading with two different damage mechanisms at a weldment and at an electrical discharge machining notch. Restoring force diagrams are used to calculate the load indicators as damage progresses and transmissibility functions are used to calculate the damage indicator during tests to failure. A component-level load intensity factor (Delta K) is calculated during these tests so that the rate of damage accumulation can be used to predict the growth of damage and ultimate failure.

J	Cruz-Monteagudo, M; Cordeiro, MNDS; Borges, F				Cruz-Monteagudo, Maykel; Cordeiro, M. Natalia D. S.; Borges, Fernanda			Computational chemistry approach for the early detection of drug-induced idiosyncratic liver toxicity	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						chemoinformatics; computational prediction; drug development; early detection; idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity; quantitative structure-toxicity relationships	DESIGN MARCH-INSIDE; IN-SILICO; PROMISING APPROACH; FAILURE; HEPATOTOXICITY; HEPATITIS; QSAR; APPLICABILITY; OPTIMIZATION; TROGLITAZONE	Idiosyncratic drug toxicity (IDT), considered as a toxic host-dependent event, with an apparent lack of dose response relationship, is usually not predictable from early phases of clinical trials, representing a particularly confounding complication in drug development. Albeit a rare event (usually <1/5000), IDT is often life threatening and is one of the major reasons new drugs never reach the market or are withdrawn post marketing. Computational methodologies, like the computer-based approach proposed in the present study, can play an important role in addressing IDT in early drug discovery. We report for the first time a systematic evaluation of classification models to predict idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), artificial neural networks (ANN), and machine learning algorithms (OneR) in conjunction with a 3D molecular structure representation and feature selection methods. These modeling techniques (LDA, feature selection to prevent over-fitting and multicollinearity, ANN to capture nonlinear relationships in the data, as well as the simple OneR classifier) were found to produce QSTR models with satisfactory internal cross-validation statistics and predictivity on an external subset of chemicals. More specifically, the models reached values of accuracy/sensitivity/specificity over 84%/78%/90%, respectively in the training series along with predictivity values ranging from ca. 78 to 86% of correctly classified drugs. An LDA-based desirability analysis was carried out in order to select the levels of the predictor variables needed to trigger the more desirable drug, i.e. the drug with lower potential for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Finally, two external test sets were used to evaluate the ability of the models in discriminating toxic from nontoxic structurally and phannacologically related drugs and the ability of the best model (LDA) in detecting potential idiosyncratic hepatotoxic drugs, respectively. The computational approach proposed here can be considered as a useful tool in early IDT prognosis. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many features are extracted from these signals. The problem is how to find the good features among the feature set in order to receive reliable classifications. Based on specific distance criteria, a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to reduce the number of features by selecting optimized ones for fault classification purpose. A decision tree and multi-class support vector machine are used to illustrate the potentiality and efficiency of this selection method. Comparisons show that the diagnostic systems after selecting specific features perform better than the original system.

An incremental neural learning framework and its application to vehicle diagnostics	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						incremental learning; neural networks; vehicle diagnostics	NETWORK ARCHITECTURE	This paper presents a framework for incremental neural learning (INL) that allows a base neural learning system to incrementally learn new knowledge from only new data without forgetting the existing knowledge. Upon subsequent encounters of new data examples, INL utilizes prior knowledge to direct its incremental learning. A number of critical issues are addressed including when to make the system learn new knowledge, how to learn new knowledge without forgetting existing knowledge, how to perform inference using both the existing and the newly learnt knowledge, and how to detect and deal with aged learnt systems. To validate the proposed INL framework, we use backpropagation (BP) as a base learner and a multi-layer neural network as a base intelligent system. INL has several advantages over existing incremental algorithms: it can be applied to a broad range of neural network systems beyond the BP trained neural networks; it retains the existing neural network structures and weights even during incremental learning; the neural network committees generated by INL do not interact with one another and each sees the same inputs and error signals at the same time; this limited communication makes the INL architecture attractive for parallel implementation. We have applied INL to two vehicle fault diagnostics problems: end-of-line test in auto assembly plants and onboard vehicle misfire detection. These experimental results demonstrate that the INL framework has the capability to successfully perform incremental learning from unbalanced and noisy data. In order to show the general capabilities of INL, we also applied INL to three general machine learning benchmark data sets. The INL systems showed good generalization capabilities in comparison with other well known machine learning algorithms.

The expected fuel saving that can be obtained by removing the anomalies represents an important information for such a decision. This evaluation, called prognosis, is not trivial when several anomalies occur in the plant, mainly because the anomalies change the operating conditions of all the components. In this paper, a prognosis procedure based on a productive representation of the system is proposed and applied to a system constituted by a gas turbine and a heat recovery system. Two anomalies are simulated in the turbine and in the heat recovery steam generator. The procedure allows one to predict the additional fuel consumption caused by each anomaly, with an error of less than 5%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Stratigopoulos, HG; Makris, Y				Stratigopoulos, Haralarnpos-G.; Makris, Yiorgos			Error moderation in low-cost machine-learning-based analog/RF testing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						alternate testing; analog circuits; circuit testing; machine learning; RF circuits	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; TEST-GENERATION; CIRCUITS; ALGORITHMS	Machine-learning-based test methods for analog/RF devices have been the subject of intense investigation over the last decade. However, despite the significant cost benefits that these methods promise, they have seen a limited success in replacing the traditional specification testing, mainly due to the incurred test error which, albeit small, cannot meet industrial standards. To address this problem, we introduce a neural system that is trained not only to predict the pass/fail labels of devices based on a set of low-cost measurements, as aimed by the previous machine-learning-based test methods, but also to assess the confidence in this prediction. Devices for which this confidence is insufficient are then retested through the more expensive specification testing in order to reach an accurate test decision. Thus, this two-tier test approach sustains the high accuracy of specification testing while leveraging the low cost of machine-learning-based testing. In addition, by varying the desired level of confidence, it enables the exploration of the tradeoff between test cost and test accuracy and facilitates the development of cost-effective test plans. We discuss the structure and the training. algorithm of an ontogenic neural network which is embodied in the neural system in the first tier, as well as the extraction of appropriate measurements such that only a small fraction of devices are funneled to the second tier. The proposed test-error-moderation method is demonstrated on a switched-capacitor filter and an ultrahigh-frequency receiver front end.

In this paper, a new intelligent system, extended neurofuzzy (ENF) scheme, is proposed for real-time machinery condition monitoring. The monitoring reliability is improved by integrating the predicted machinery condition to fault diagnosis. The ENF scheme can perform both classification and prediction operations. The ENF classifier integrates the merits of several signal processing techniques for a more positive assessment of the machinery condition. The ENF predictor forecasts the machinery condition propagation trends. An interscheme training technique is proposed to improve the ENF system's adaptive capability to accommodate different operation conditions. The viability of this new monitoring system has been verified by experimental tests. Test results have shown that the developed ENF system is a robust condition monitoring tool that has good adaptive capabilities to accommodate different machinery conditions.

It is theoretically and experimentally shown that the fault signatures caused by the inverter harmonies are similar and comparable to those generated by the fundamental harmonic on the line current. Theoretically-derived extended relations including bearing fault, eccentricity, and broken rotor bar relations are found to match experimental results. Furthermore, it is observed and reported that the asymmetries on the rotor caused by broken rotor bars increase the amplitude of even harmonies. To confirm these claims, bearing, eccentricity, and broken rotor bar faults are tested and the line current spectrum of each faulty motor is compared with the healthy one. The proposed additional fault data are expected to contribute positively to the inverter-fed motor fault decision-making algorithms.

The method, however, does not always achieve good results when the speed or the load torque is not constant, because this causes variations on the motor-slip and fast Fourier transform problems appear due to a nonstationary signal. This paper proposes a new method for motor fault detection, which analyzes the spectrogram based on a short-time Fourier transform and a further combination of wavelet and power-spectral-density (PSD) techniques, which consume a smaller amount of processing power. The proposed algorithms have been applied to detect broken rotor bars as well as shorted turns. Besides, a merit factor based on PSD is introduced as a novel approach for condition monitoring, and a further implementation of the algorithm is proposed. Theoretical development and experimental results are provided to support the research.

J	Zhu, LM; Ding, H; Zhu, XY				Zhu, LiMin; Ding, Han; Zhu, XiangYang			Extraction of periodic signal without external reference by time-domain average scanning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						condition monitoring; machine-fault diagnosis; periodic signal; scanning; signal analysis; time-domain average	FAULT-DETECTION; WAVEFORMS; DIAGNOSIS; BEARING; MODEL	A novel signal-analysis technique that is capable of extracting periodic signals from noisy discrete-time observations without an additional external reference is presented. It is based on a derived formulation estimating the maximally allowable synchronous error for a given Attenuation threshold after the time-domain averaging. First, a continuous signal is reconstructed from the discrete samples by using cubic-spline interpolation. Second, the region that the signal fundamental frequency may lie in is finely discretized, resulting in a number of candidates of the fundamental-frequency estimate. Third, for each candidate, the continuous signal is synchronously sampled, and the resultant discrete sequence is processed with the time-domain average. Such an operation of repeated sampling and averaging is referred to as scanning. Finally, the obtained series of average waveforms and their amplitude spectra are depicted as two gray images to visualize the computational results, and the waveforms and spectra of interest are picked out for further analysis. Examples are given to confirm the validity of the approach to diagnose machine faults under complicated conditions.

J	Na, MG; Park, WS; Lim, DH				Na, Man Gyun; Park, Won Seo; Lim, Dong Hyuk			Detection and diagnostics of loss of coolant accidents using support vector machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article						genetic algorithm; loss of coolant accident (LOCA); support vector classification (SVC); support vector machine (SVM); support vector regression (SVR)	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; DESIGN	It is very difficult for operators to predict the progression of a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) because nuclear plant operators are provided with only partial information during e accident or they may have insufficient time to analyze the data despite being provided with considerable information. Therefore, its break location should be identified and the break size should be predicted accurately in order to provide the operators and technical support personnel with important and valuable information needed to successfully manage the accident. In this paper, support vector machines (SVMs) are used to identify the break location of a LOCA and predict the break size using the support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR), which are well-known application areas of SVMs. The SVR models to predict the break size were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The inputs to the SVMs are the time-integrated values obtained by integrating the measurement signals in a short time interval after a reactor scram. The results showed that the proposed algorithm identified the break locations of LOCAs without fault and predicted the break size accurately.

J	Wang, W				Wang, Wilson			An enhanced diagnostic system for gear system monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						enhanced diagnostic (ED) system; fault diagnosis; multistage printing machine; system state forecasting	FAULT-DETECTION; RULE WEIGHTS; FUZZY; PREDICTION; NETWORK	The detection of the onset of damage in gear systems (e.g., gearboxes) is of great importance to a wide array of industries. In this paper, an enhanced diagnostic (ED) system is developed for real-time gear system condition monitoring. A neurofuzzy (NF) paradigm is adopted for pattern classification of the features from the energy, amplitude, and phase domains. The diagnostic reliability is enhanced by properly integrating predicted future machinery states that are forecast by recurrent NF predictors. An online training technique is proposed to improve the classifier's adaptive capability to accommodate different machinery conditions. The viability of this new monitoring system has been verified by experimental tests under different gear conditions. This proposed ED system has also been applied for real-time condition monitoring in multistage printing machines. The primary application has demonstrated its reliability as an effective monitoring tool for both production quality control and maintenance planning.

The method consists of three stages. First, by investigating the specialty of AE signals, a biorthogonal wavelet with impact property is constructed using lifting scheme, and wavelet transform is carried out to separate AE components from the original signals. Second, Hilbert transform is adopted to demodulate signal envelope on wavelet coefficients and salient features indicating the tool state (i.e., normal conditions, slight breakage, and serious breakage) are extracted. Finally, tool conditions are identified directly through the recognition of these features by means of MD. Practical application results on a CNC vertical milling machine tool show that the proposed method is accurate for feature extraction and efficient for condition monitoring of cutting tools in end milling process.

Effects of any maintenance schedule are evaluated through a discrete-event simulation that utilizes predicted probabilities of machine failures in the manufacturing system, where predicted probabilities of failure are assumed to be available either from historical equipment reliability information or based on the newly available predictive algorithms. A Genetic Algorithm based optimization procedure is used to search for the most cost-effective maintenance schedule, considering both production gains and maintenance expenses. The algorithm is implemented in a simulated environment and benchmarked against several traditional maintenance strategies, such as corrective maintenance, scheduled maintenance and condition-based maintenance. In all cases that were studied, application of the newly proposed maintenance scheduling tool resulted in a noticeable increase in the cost-benefits, which indicates that the use of predictive information about equipment performance through the newly proposed maintenance scheduling method could result in significant gains obtained by optimal maintenance scheduling.

The ratio of fundamental zero sequence voltage to positive sequence voltage after switch-off was selected as the stator fault characteristic, which could effectively avoid the influence of the supply unbalance and the load fluctuation, and directly represent the asymmetry in the stator. Using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based on HHT, the zero sequence voltage after switch-off was decomposed and the fundamental component was extracted. Then, the fault characteristic can be acquired. Experimental results on a 4-kW induction motor demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

Time domain averaging across all scales: A novel method for detection of gearbox faults	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						rotating machineries; vibration analysis; wavelet analysis; signal processing; fault detection; gearbox	WAVELET TRANSFORM; VIBRATION SIGNALS	The vibration signal of a gearbox carries the signature of the fault in the gears. As such early fault detection of the gearbox is possible by analyzing the vibration signal using different signal processing techniques. Time synchronous averaging can extract the periodic waveforms of a noisy vibration signal, whereas Wavelet transformation is able to characterize the local features of the signal at different scales. This paper proposes a new technique, time domain averaging across all scales, which combines the time synchronous average and wavelet transformation together to extract the periodic waveforms at different scales from noisy vibration signals. The technique efficiently cleans up noise and detects both local and distributed faults simultaneously. A pilot plant case study is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.

A two-stage feature selection and weighting technique is adopted in this algorithm. Feature weights are computed via CDET according to the sensitivity of features and assigned to the corresponding features to indicate their different importance in clustering. Feature weighting highlights the importance of sensitive features and simultaneously weakens the interference of insensitive features. The new clustering algorithm is described and applied to incipient fault and compound fault diagnosis of locomotive roller bearings. The diagnosis result shows the algorithm is able to reliably recognise not only different fault categories and severities but also the compound faults, and demonstrates the superior effectiveness and practicability of the algorithm. Therefore, it is a promising approach to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.

J	Ren, N; Liang, J; Gu, B; Han, H				Ren, Neng; Liang, Jun; Gu, Bo; Han, Hua			Fault diagnosis strategy for incompletely described samples and its application to refrigeration system	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis (FD); refrigeration system; partial problem descriptions (PPD); similarity transformation matrix (STM); support vector machine (SVM)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Fault diagnosis (FD) plays a very important role in the operation and maintenance of mechanical system and equipment. Existing FD methods are not capable of effectively dealing with incompletely described samples. In this paper, a strategy for FD using the incompletely described samples is presented. It is actualized in two steps, namely the determination of the values of unknown features which is the key step of the presented FD strategy, and the utilization of the regenerated completely described samples to diagnose the system based on support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. And the first step is mainly implemented by the following three sub-steps: (1) with the help of domain knowledge, the similarity transformation matrix of partial problem description (PPD)-problems with incomplete feature description-is generated based on the historical database; (2) the unknown features of the samples are transformed to related known features, through which generates a new retrieval feature vector; (3) the values of unknown features are assigned by the optimal cases which can be retrieved by measuring and comparing similarities between the retrieval feature vector and the completely described samples in the historical database. Finally, the presented FD strategy was applied to a real refrigeration system, and achieved satisfying results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Measuring the condition of saline wetlands threatened by agricultural intensification	PEDOSPHERE			English	Article						agricultural landscape; desert; irrigation; Monegros; playa	MOJAVE DESERT; PLAYA-LAKES; INDICATORS; CALIFORNIA; MONEGROS; RECOVERY; REGION; USA	The saline wetlands, or "saladas", of Monegros Desert, NE Spain, contain biodiversity that depends on the establishment of a prognostic monitoring system that can warn of approaching irreversible damage. In the context of a lack of existing biodiversity inventories for the saladas, we determined their state of conservation and vulnerability using seven physical indicators: escarpment continuity, cropping, stone dumping, size, water occurrence, distance to roads, and proximity to irrigated areas. These features were combined into three meaningful indexes, i.e., conservation, current vulnerability, and future vulnerability, thus creating an assessment of the preservation or degradation of saladas in the context of encroaching. agricultural irrigation projects. The proposed indexes produced consistent results and showed that a great number of the Monegros wetlands were threatened, regardless of their size or frequency of water occurrence. Only 20% of the saladas studied were classified as being in a good or very good conservation, whereas 50% were in bad or very bad shape. A high current vulnerability was found for 60% of the saladas. For saladas located in land to be irrigated, we predicted that 73% would have a high or very high future vulnerability. Currently, 58% of the saladas were in bad or very bad condition and fully 65% of the saladas, variable in size, presented a bad or very bad prognosis.

Challenges and obstacles in the application of acoustic emission to process machinery	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						acoustic emission; condition monitoring; rotating equipment; machinery	WATERSHED HYDROLOGIC FUNCTIONS; POWER-GENERATION TURBINES; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; INCIPIENT CAVITATION; RELATIONAL DATABASE; DIESEL-ENGINES; TRIBOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; MONITORING TECHNIQUES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CYLINDER PRESSURE	Managing asset integrity is crucial for the cost-effective asset management of processing plants. Consequently, new techniques for detection and classification of incipient faults are continuously being sought by industry and developed by research and development professionals, both corporate and academic. Although acoustic emission (AE) testing for faults in static equipment has been used since the 1970s, its use as a monitoring technology for various machinery conditions has been poorly adopted by industry, despite a significant volume of work having been published over the past twenty years describing success in detecting numerous rotating and reciprocating machinery faults. Anecdotal evidence from industry suggests that many 'tried and failed'. The authors believe that this is because applying AE monitoring to industrial plant is fraught with poorly documented challenges, obstacles, and limitations that must be well understood and overcome before any reported results can be replicated. Thus, to enable potential users to approach AE monitoring with more realistic expectations, the current paper discusses several such problems and suggests some available techniques for their management. After an initial introduction on the basics of AE specifically applied to machinery monitoring, issues are divided into generic problems and application-specific challenges.

J	Muller, A; Suhner, MC; Lung, B				Muller, Alexandre; Suhner, Marie-Christine; Lung, Benoit			Formalisation of a new prognosis model for supporting proactive maintenance implementation on industrial system	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						proactive maintenance; prognosis; degradation; process approach; dysfunctional analysis; dynamic Bayesian network		The importance of the maintenance function has increased because of its role in keeping and improving system availability and safety, as well as product quality. To support this role, the maintenance concept has undergone several major developments that have led to proactive considerations mainly based on a prognosis process, which normally allows selection of the best maintenance action to be carried out. This paper proposes the deployment and experimentation of a prognosis process within an e-maintenance architecture. The deployment follows a methodology based on the combination of both a probabilistic approach for modelling the degradation mechanism and of an event one for dynamical degradation monitoring. The feasibility and benefits of this new prognosis process is investigated with an experiment using a manufacturing TELMA (TELe-MAintenance) platform supporting the unwinding of metal bobbins.

Regarding information content, we experimentally showed the effectiveness of functionally abstracted information without the benefits of sophisticated graphical presentation in various task situations. However, since it is obvious that the effects of the information display are also influenced by display formats (i.e., visual forms) as well as the information content, further research was required to investigate the effectiveness of visualized functionally abstracted information. For this purpose, this study conducted an experiment in complex process control tasks (operation and fault diagnosis). The experimental purposes were to confirm the effectiveness of the functionally abstracted information visualized with emergent features or peculiar geometric forms and to examine the additional effects of the visualization on task performance. The results showed that functionally abstracted information presented with sophisticated visual forms helped operators perform process control tasks in more efficient and safe way. The results also indicated the importance of explicit visualization of goal-means relation between higher and lower abstraction levels. Lastly, this study proposed a framework for designing visual forms for process control display. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On-line fault diagnostic system for proton exchange membrane fuel cells	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article						Bayesian network; fault diagnosis; fuel cell	BAYESIAN NETWORK; STACKS; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; PEMFCS; STATE; WATER	In this paper, a supervisor system, able to diagnose different types of faults during the operation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell is introduced. The diagnosis is developed by applying Bayesian networks, which qualify and quantify the cause-effect relationship among the variables of the process. The fault diagnosis is based on the on-line monitoring of variables easy to measure in the machine such as voltage, electric current, and temperature. The equipment is a fuel cell system which can operate even when a fault occurs. The fault effects are based on experiments on the fault tolerant fuel cell, which are reproduced in a fuel cell model. A database of fault records is constructed from the fuel cell model, improving the generation time and avoiding permanent damage to the equipment. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

NUMB is also an endocytic protein(2), and the NOTCH-NUMB counteraction has been linked to this function(3,4). There might be, however, additional functions of NUMB, as witnessed by its proposed role as a tumour suppressor in breast cancer(5). Here we describe a previously unknown function for human NUMB as a regulator of tumour protein p53 ( also known as TP53). NUMB enters in a tricomplex with p53 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HDM2( also known as MDM2), thereby preventing ubiquitination and degradation of p53. This results in increased p53 protein levels and activity, and in regulation of p53- dependent phenotypes. In breast cancers there is frequent loss of NUMB expression(5). We show that, in primary breast tumour cells, this event causes decreased p53 levels and increased chemoresistance. In breast cancers, loss of NUMB expression causes increased activity of the receptor NOTCH5. Thus, in these cancers, a single event - loss of NUMB expression - determines activation of an oncogene ( NOTCH) and attenuation of the p53 tumour suppressor pathway.

Detection and Diagnosis of Recurrent Faults in Software Systems by Invariant Analysis	11TH IEEE HIGH ASSURANCE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING SYMPOSIUM, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE High Assurance Systems Engineering Symposium	DEC 03-05, 2008	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Nanjing Univ, IEEE Reliabil Soc		system invariants; metric correlations; neural network; error detection; fault diagnosis		A correctly functioning enterprise-software system exhibits long-term, stable correlations between many of its monitoring metrics. Some of these correlations no longer hold when there is an error in the system, potentially enabling error detection and fault diagnosis. However existing approaches are inefficient, requiring a large number of metrics to be monitored and ignoring the relative discriminative properties of different metric correlations. In enterprise-software systems, similar faults tend to reoccur It is therefore possible to significantly improve existing correlation-analysis approaches by learning the effects of common recurrent faults on correlations. We present methods to determine the most significant correlations to track for efficient error detection, and the correlations that contribute the most to diagnosis accuracy. We apply machine learning to identify the relevant correlations, removing the need for manually configured correlation thresholds, as used in the prior approaches. We validate our work on a multi-tier enterprise-software system. We are able to detect and correctly diagnose 8 of 10 injected faults to within three possible causes, and to within two in 7 out of 8 cases. This compares favourably with the existing approaches whose diagnosis accuracy is 3 out of 10 to within 3 possible causes. We achieve a precision of at least 95%.

However, faults can also be introduced during system implementation; it is indispensable to detect protocol implementation flaws, yet due to the black-box nature of protocol implementation and the unavailability of protocol specification most of the approaches resort to random or manual testing. In this paper we propose a model-based approach for security flaw detection of protocol implementation with a high fault coverage, measurability, and automation. Our approach first synthesizes an abstract behavioral model from a protocol implementation and then uses it to guide the testing process for detecting security and reliability flaws. For protocol specification synthesis we reduce the problem a trace minimization with a Finite State Machine model and an efficient algorithm is presented for state space reduction. Our method is implemented and applied to real network protocols. Guided by the synthesized model our testing tool reveals a number of unknown reliability and security issues by automatically crashing the implementations of the Microsoft MSN instant messaging (MSNIM) protocol. Analytical comparison between our model-based and prevalent syntax-based flaw detection schemes is also provided with the support of experimental results.

It avoids the occurrence of unplanned down time of the machinery that causes serious damage and costly downtime. Several condition monitoring techniques have been applied to rotating machinery in order to improve the plant reliability and reduce the downtime. This paper aims to investigate the effectiveness of Acoustic Emission (AE) system for incipient detection of faults related to rotating machinery. A system that is developed to provide a test-bed for this concept is described. A real time AE measurement system is developed and tested. The acquired AE signatures are processed and analyzed using LABVIEW. Time and frequency domain analysis are performed to identify the exact faults in the machinery.

Data has been collected for leading indicators of failure for alloy systems including, Sn1Ag0.5Cu, Sn3Ag0.5Cu, Sn4Ag0.5Cu second-level interconnects under the application of cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. Methodology presented resides in the pre-failure space of the system in which no macro-indicators such as cracks or delamination exist. Systems subjected to thermo-mechanical damage have been interrogated for system state and the computed damage state correlated with known imposed damage. The approach involves the use of condition monitoring devices which can be interrogated for damage proxies at finite time-intervals. Interrogation techniques are based on non-linear least-squares methods. Various techniques including the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm have been investigated. The system's residual life is computed based on residual-life computation algorithms. Detection of system-state significantly prior to catastrophic failure can significantly impact the reliability and availability of electronic systems. Requirements for system availability for ultra-high reliability electronic systems are driving the need for advanced heath monitoring techniques for early detection of onset of damage. Traditional health monitoring methodologies have relied on reactive methods of failure detection often providing little on no insight into the remaining useful life of the system.

Closed loop control system synthesis of induction motor is based on symmetrical model of the machine. In case of induction machine operation with broken rotor bars, rotor speed pulsation is compensated by the control system. Simulation of Multiscalar Control with the fault machine shows that decoupling variables can be used as detection signals. Analysis of speed observer frequency response in open loop operation gives information about disturbance impact on estimation error. Further analysis indicates that machine asymmetry can affect stability of sensorless control system with speed observer.

The first method is a Coupled Magnetic Circuit Method (CMCM) and the second method is a Permeance Network Method (PNM) which allows taking into account the saturation effect on the fault signature. The simulation results show that by proper modeling of induction machine it is possible to detect the effect of inter-turn short circuit faults on the machine line currents. The effect of saturation on the machine line current signature is discussed. The detailed equations describing the performance of the machine in the two cases of modeling under inter-turns short circuit faults are presented.

Doubly fed induction generators need rotor position information for high performance control. As part of a multi-sensor fault tolerant generator system, fault tolerance of the position sensor is presented, using a position estimator. A known position estimator is improved and thoroughly described, including effects of machine saturation and iron losses. The fault detection and isolation is described and the reconfiguration from encoder to sensorless operation is shown. Measurements are provided and show good and fast results.

This fault can take place where the doubly-fed induction generator is a standard solution in wind power stations. For investigations an error-adoptable three phase machine model is derived and simulated. Furthermore the model is integrated in a wind energy plant model and simulated for a turn-to-turn fault in one rotor phase. Motor current signature analysis, wavelet transformation and the Luenberger observer are used for detection and are compared.

Firstly, wavelet coefficients of output voltage signals of power circuits under faulty conditions are obtained with wavelet lifting decomposition, and then faulty feature vectors are extracted from the disposed wavelet coefficients. Secondly, a boosting strategy is adopted to select faulty feature vectors automatically for LS-WSVM-based multi-class classifiers, QPSO is applied to select the optimal values of the regularization and kernel parameters of multi-class LS-WSVM. So the multi-class LS-WSVM ensemble model with boosting for the power circuits fault diagnosis system is built. The simulation result of push-pull circuits shows that the fault diagnosis method of the power circuits using LS-WSVM ensemble with QPSO is effective.

The type and prognosis of ischemic injury depends on the blood vessels involved, the underlying medical condition, and the swiftness with which the problem is brought to medical attention for diagnosis and treatment. Hyperspectral imaging has developed as a compact imaging and spectroscopic tool that can he used for different applications including medica diagnostics. In this paper, the application of hyperspectral imaging as a visual supporting tool to detect the intestinal ischemia during surgeries is evaluated. It will be useful for rapid diagnosing tissue abnormalities. The images are captured using an infrared hyperspectral camera (900-1700nm). Using hyperspectral images, the spectral signatures for normal intestine, clamped ischemic intestine and other abdominal organs are created. The high-dimensional data are compressed using wavelet transform and classified using support vector machine (SVM). The performance of this method is evaluated for detection of ischemic intestine in an abdominal surgery on a pig. The criteria to evaluate performance are based on false negative rate (FNR) and false positive rate (FPR). This technique is able to detect ischemic intestine with a small FPR and FNR.

Invited paper: Smart configurable wireless sensors and actuators for industrial monitoring and control	2008 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMMUNICATIONS, CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Symposium on Control, Communications and Signal Processing (ISCCSP 2008)	MAR 12-14, 2008	St Julians, MALTA	Univ Malta, IEEE		wirless sensors; intelligent monitoring; smart sensing; industrial control		Intelligent wireless sensor-based controls have drawn industry attention on account of reduced costs, better power management, ease in maintenance, and effortless deployment in remote and hard-to-reach areas. They have been successfully deployed in many industrial applications such as Maintenance, monitoring, control, security, etc. This presentation focuses on research that addresses the issues faced by instrumentation systems and predictive maintenance industrial applications and presents a design solution to cater to the issues faced by these applications. Instrumentation systems are either open or closed loop control systems formed using sensors and actuators with the objective of controlling certain parameters, or state of the system. The system elements are always in communication with each other, typically, requiring real-time performance and built-in fault-tolerance for communication/node failure - to return to a safe-state in a deterministic amount of time. Predictive-maintenance involves tracking physical state of equipment or machine, and to take action, if an acceptable or allowed state(s) is violated. Predictive-maintenance applications are not active all the time in Order to conserve energy. The sensors are either periodic or event-based; they wake up, check status and go back to sleep. In case of any violation, they raise an alarm or record the digression. They are very useful in keeping machine downtimes low and help locate the problem before the machine breaks down. Typical systems employ different types of sensors (eg., position, accelerometers, gyros, etc.) and actuators (e.g., motors) often deployed within the same network, having different capabilities, interfaces, and supporting different protocols for data and communications. Formation of systems from such diverse distributed sensor elements entails versatile control modules, which understand different sensor protocols and utilize them. In addition, the operational challenges are exacerbated when different RF links have to be used to satisfy the requirements of bandwidth, payload, delay, jitter, range, noise immunity and others (including cost) for communication. The Smart Sensor Platform discussed in this, presentation is an attempt to develop a generic platform with a "plug-and-play" capability to support hardware interface, payload and communications needs of multiple inertial and position sensors, and actuators/motors used in instrumentation systems and predictive maintenance applications. Communication is carried out using a RF link (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mote or RFID), in a point-to-point topology. The design also provides means to update operating and monitoring parameters, and thresholds as well as sensor and RF link specific firmware modules "over-the-air". It is composed of two main components - a sensor-wireless hardware interface and system integration framework, which facilitates the defining of interaction between sensors/actuators based on process needs. The intelligence necessary to process the sensor signals, monitor the functions against defined operational templates, and enable swapping of sensor and RF fink re! sides on the micro controller of the hardware interface. A variety of industrial motion sensors like gyroscopes, Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), linear position sensors, absolute and incremental encoders and Brush less DC motors, have been interfaced and successfully tested with the platform.

In the model, the quadratic programming problem is simplified as the problem of solving linear equation groups, and the SVM algorithm is realized by least squares method. When the LSSVM is used in fault diagnosis, it is presented to choose parameter of kernel function on dynamic, which enhances preciseness rate of diagnosis. The Fibonacci symmetry searching algorithm is simplified and improved. The changing rule of kernel function searching region and best shortening step is studied. The best diagnosis results are obtained by means of synthesizing kernel function searching region and best shortening step. The simulation results show the validity of the LSSVM model.

Lee et al. (2004) proposed to use kernel density estimation (KDE) to obtain the control limits. However, the KDE method is very sensitive to the choice of smoothing parameter. Therefore, this study utilizes the support vector machine (SVM) for process fault detection by taking information of ICA extracted statistics as inputs of SVM. The proposed method (named, ICA-SVM) will be implemented in the Tennessee Eastman Process. In which, several multivariate monitoring schemes such as PCA, ICA, modified ICA and ICA-PCA will be also compared to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method.

For any machine problems bearing suffers the consequences. It is therefore necessarily to monitor and diagnose the bearing health condition in order to avoid serious problems that can lead to catastrophic machine failure. Various condition monitoring techniques are used for detection of rotating machine faults. This paper demonstrates a method based on time analysis of an acoustic emission signals and bursts captured from bearing assembly. The capability of AE technique for detection of bearing abnormalities and defects at incipient stages is conducted. A real time AE measurement system is developed.

Accurate reliability forecasts can provide a good assessment of machine performance in order to execute predictive maintenance effectively. This paper investigates a methodology of applying support vector machines(SVMs) to predict reliability in computerized numerical control(CNC) machine tool of digital manufacturing system. SVM is capable to solve nonlinear regression and times series problems lie on conducting the structural risk minimization principle seeking to minimize an upper bound of the generalization error rather than minimize the training error. A real reliability data (for 42 suits) of CNC machine tool were employed as the data set. SVM can be trained to learn the relationship between past historical reliability indices and the corresponding targets, and then future reliability or failures can be predicted. The experimental results demonstrate that the SVM prediction model is a valid potential for predicting system reliability and failures.

Inspired from nature, a distributed artificial immune system with the normal model is proposed for detecting unknown non-selfs such as worms and software faults. Traditional approaches are used to learn unknown features and types of the unknown non-selfs, but the learning problem can not be solved for human immune system in short time, neither that for the machines. A new detecting approach is proposed with the normal model of the system, and the selfs of the system are represented and detected at first. Depending on strictness and completeness of the normal model, the selfs are known and the process for detecting the selfs is much easier and more accurate than that for the non-selfs. Not only the artificial immune system can detect the non-selfs, but also the system can eliminate the non-selfs and repair the damaged parts of the system by itself. Minimization of the non-selfs and maximization of the selfs show robustness of the artificial immune system, and robustness of the distributed artificial immune system can be reduced according to each independent module.

However, the observed signals do not suffice to this condition in the practical application. In view of this deficiency, a new mechanical source separation method based on nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) is proposed. The proposed method is compared with the linear BSS method of machine faults. The experiment result shows that the proposed method is very effective for nonlinear mixing mechanical sources. The linear BSS method of machine faults is only a special case of the proposed method. When source separation method based linear BSS cannot give a satisfactory separation performance, the nonlinear BSS method should be considered.

The finite element method is applied into establishing a three-dimensional temperature field for power transformer. Some issues about applying support vector machine (SVM) into power transformer fault diagnosis are further analyzed. In order to realize its state on-tine monitoring and the measuring data remote communication, an embedded on-line monitoring system composed of ARM and General Packet Radio Service is designed for the power transformer in this paper. Simulation experimental results show that the proposed fault diagnosis model has an excellent performance on training speed and correct ratio, and the developed embedded system can effectively monitor power transformer's state during its running. Therefore, it will change the existing maintenance and repair pattern for power transformer and realizes accurate fault diagnosis or forecasts.

The method to fault diagnosis of bearing based on EMD and envelope spectrum is presented. The methodology developed in this paper decomposes the original times series data in intrinsic oscillation modes, using the empirical mode decomposition. Then the envelope spectrum is applied to the selected intrinsic mode function IMF which stands for the bearing faults. The techniques are demonstrated by the experiments on a machine tool with a ball bearing under simulated crack on the inner race or outer race. The experimental results show that this method based on EMD and envelope spectrum can effectively diagnosis the faults of bearing.

In this paper, the Bayesian evidence framework is applied to select the optimal values of the regularization and kernel parameters of multi-class LS-WSVM classifiers. Also wavelet coefficients of output voltage signals of power circuits under faulty conditions are obtained with wavelet lifting decomposition, and then faulty feature vectors are extracted from the disposed wavelet coefficients. The faulty feature vectors are used to train the multi-class LS-WSVM classifiers, so the model of the power circuits fault diagnosis system is built. In push-pull circuits, this method is applied to diagnose the faults of the circuits with simulation; the results show that the fault diagnosis method of the power circuits with LS-WSVM within the Bayesian evidence framework is effective.

With the property of global optimal search of GA and the temporal-frequency localization of WNN, the networks could avoid failing into local infinitesimal values. Firstly, the original parameters of WNN is obtained by making use of the GA, and then the gradient descent algorithm is employed to train the WNN to speed up the training process, so that the drawback of lower speed for only using GA to train the WNN could be overcome. Finally, the improved WNN is applied to the fault diagnosis of piston compressor, in which the results show it is superior to the common WNN in the aspects of precision and convergence.

Firstly, the concept about probability Petri net is defined. It can calculate the occurred probability of the absent datum based on Bayesian theorem from the detected attributes. Secondly, for the complicated Petri nets will induce the combinatorial states expand quickly; the design of probability Petri nets is based on reduced sample set to abate the complexity of the model. In order to create the logical relation between condition attributes and the faults, Skowron default rule generation method is used to obtain diagnostic rules. And for the programmable design of the model, all diagnostic rules are transformed to a series of basic rules that is defined. Finally, the diagnostic process is discussed. The probability Petri nets model can educe the generant probability of faults based on the complemental information. And the logical consequence can be calculated by incidence matrix expediently. The design is proved to be availability by an example about rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

This method is attractive for many fields of applied sciences and engineering including medicine, telecommunication, audio processing, noise reduction or data processing, health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of machine. However, the results by the existing BSS algorithms are often not enough for the subsequent signals analysis, on account of the limited assumption on the mixture. models. In this paper, special improvements on the existing BSS algorithms were made, which made it possible to restore sources waveform more accurately. The validity of the new method was verified by several selected experiments, which further showed the potential of such technique in practice.

Actuator faults diagnosis for a class of nonlinear systems applied to electric motors drives	2008 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-12	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference 2008	JUN 11-13, 2008	Seattle, WA	IEEE			GEOMETRIC APPROACH; OBSERVABILITY; OBSERVERS	In this paper, the diagnosis of actuator faults is addressed for a class of nonlinear systems applied to electric motors drives. The residuals are synthesized using a modelbased strategy by applying a differential geometry perspective. According to the dynamic structure of the systems considered in this work, it is proved that the observability codistribution built for this class of systems can be independent of the state under certain conditions, so that the resulting coordinates transformations in the state and outputs spaces are linear mappings. Lastly, it is deduced that the dynamical properties of this class of systems are preserved by different electrical machines. Simulation results are illustrated for a three-phase induction motor application, where it is shown that in this case, the necessary conditions of geometric nature, results in necessary and sufficient conditions to isolate the studied faults. Moreover, in order to detect the actuator faults, it is suggested a directional residual evaluation to properly identify the fault present in the system.	[Espinoza-Trejo, D.

The wavelet transform can accurately localizes the characteristics of a signal both in the time and frequency domains and in a view of the inter relationship of wavelet transform between fractal theory, the whole and local fractal exponents obtained from wavelet transform coefficients as features are presented for extracting fault signals, which are inputted into radial basis function (RBF) for fault pattern recognition. The fault diagnosis model of aero-engine is established and the improved Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization technique is used to fulfill the network structure and parameter identification. By means of choosing enough samples to train the fault diagnosis network and the information representing the faults is input into the trained wavelet network, and according to the output result the type of fault can be determined. The robustness of exponent wavelet network for fault diagnosis is discussed. The practical multi-concurrent fault diagnosis for aeroengine vibration approves to be accurate and comprehensive. The method can be generalized to other devices' fault diagnosis.

The artificial neural networks are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The networks are tested using the remaining set of data. In this method the characteristic features of time and frequency domain vibration signals of the rotating machinery with normal and defective bearings have been used as inputs to the ANN. The features are obtained from direct processing of the signal segments using very simple preprocessing. Three different cases; healthy, inner race defect, and outer race defect is classified using the proposed algorithm. The obtained results indicate that using time-domain features can be effective in the diagnosis of various motor bearing faults quickly and with high precision.

Bearing are the common used elements in almost all rotating machinery. It causes the machine failure upon getting faulty. Therefore advance and effective inspection techniques are required to monitor and detect the bearing problems at incipient stages. This avoids catastrophic machine failure and costly unplanned shutdown. In this paper the acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system is established. It discusses a method based on time and frequency domain analysis of AE signals acquired from bearings assembly. A real time measurement system is developed. It utilizes LabVIEW to process and analyze the data to provide valuable information regarding the process being monitored.	[Elmaleeh, Mohammed A.

Thus, timely detection and diagnosis of induction motor bearing (IMB) is very crucial in order to prevent sudden damage. This paper proposes developing artificial neural network (ANN) model of IMB fault diagnosis by using Elman Network. The vibration signal obtained from Case Western Reserve University website are been used as input signal. During preprocessing stage, vibration signal have been converted from time domain into frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Enveloping method was then, used to eliminate the high frequency components from vibration signal. Subsequently, a set of 16 features from time and frequency domain were extracted. Furthermore, the distance evaluation technique is used in features selection in order to select only informative features.

This fault type cannot visibly influence on machine's normal performance and since the performance of a faulty machine with broken coils is similar to that of a healthy one with unbalance load, therefore detection of this kind of fault at the beginning is important. Normal and faulty machines are simulated using the parameters obtained by Finite element analysis (FEA). A massive harmonic content analysis of field and stator phase currents are performed and ultimately harmonic content of field current from 1(st) to 7(th) order (as parameters with maximum variations) are chosen as training signals for a feedforward ANN. Feedforward neural network is trained using the back propagation algorithm. This ANN-based fault detection system identifies the broken coil faults of the stator windings with proper convergence to desired target values.

Data collection and fusion creates an accurate prognostic prediction. To that end, Ridgetop has developed an extensible Prognostic Analysis System Platform and a companion Prognostics Telemetry Harness. With an Electro-Mechanical Actuator (EMA) as the focus, this paper describes the extensible architecture for a Prognostics Health Management (PBM) system providing State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life' (RUL) metrics. The key enabler is the Ridgetop Prognostics Telemetry Harness (RPM, which collects and preprocesses signals relating to the health of dynamically executing components and subsystems. With an ultimate target of 100% up-time, prognostics is an effective tool for managing the corrective early actions required to avoid costly down-time events. An example is detailed using a common EMA and further analysis explores the return-on-investment justifying prognostics adoption.(1,2).

Leakage fault detection method for axial-piston variable displacement pumps	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			MODEL	To address the lack of health monitoring for gas turbine engine accessory components, Sentient developed a promising fault estimation algorithm for axial-piston variable displacement pumps. The key to this success was the development of a physics-based nonlinear model of the system that includes three common types of fluid leakage faults. The modeling effort and simulation results provided the thorough knowledge needed to extract features from the system responses to detect the occurrence of faults. The nominal pump and the pump with a single piston replaced by three different machined pistons were tested to emulate varying stages of piston wear. The experiments demonstrated that the model was able to capture the dynamic behavior of the actual system. By considering several time and frequency domain metrics, a fault estimation method was developed that correctly identified the presence and severity of leakage faults, while using a fraction of the memory and computational resources of other model-based methods.(12).

However, the majority of the events that compromise mission success and equipment availability in military aircraft arise from the degradation or failures of engine accessory system components, such as valves, pumps, and actuators. Failure or statistical-based maintenance of these components fails to account for unanticipated and extreme operating scenarios, which are a major cause of unscheduled maintenance events. U.S. military systems are thus moving toward condition-based maintenance (CBM), wherein maintenance is performed as and when required, thus improving asset availability and contributing significantly to mission success.(1,2). The authors have developed low-overhead diagnostics and prognostics techniques, which would enable a shift toward CBM of engine accessory components. The current work focused on aircraft fuel and lubrication systems. Model-based and data-driven techniques were developed to provide reliable health assessments of hydraulic pumps and valves, which are essential components on these systems.

There are three fundamental problems that need to be address to accurately estimate RUL. First, health index data is noisy. Even with filtering, the HI can be difficult to trend. Second - a damage model is required address component degradation. Finally, a relationship between physical damage and measured health/condition needs to be established. This paper explores methodologies to de-noise vibration data, model damage propagation using Paris Law, and address inferred damage via condition indicators by using maintenance vs. safety of flight criteria to initiate repair activities.(12). The RUL prognostic is validated on established crack data, and testing on HUMS derived fault data.

Multivariate survival analysis (I): Shared frailty approaches to reliability and dependence modeling	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE		multivariate survival analysis; shared frailty model; dependent failure; common risks failure; common events failure; event-related dependence; network survivability; prognostic and health management (PHM); software reliability	FAILURE TIME DATA; MULTISTATE MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; REGRESSION; EVENTS	The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multistate modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multistate models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and computer science. In this article, we focus exclusively on shared frailty modeling. Shared frailty refers to the often-unobserved factors or risks responsible for the common risks dependence between multiple events. It is well recognized as the most effective modeling approach to address common risks dependence and, more recently, the event-related dependence. The only exclusion of dependence modeling for the frailty approach is the common events type, which is best addressed by multi-state modeling. We argue that shared frailty modeling not only is perfectly applicable for engineering reliability, but also is of significant potential in other fields of computer science, such as networking and software reliability and survivability, machine learning, and prognostics and health management (PHM).

A framework for prognostics and health management of electronic systems	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ARCHITECTURE	Prognostics and health management (PHM) of engineered systems have long been recognized as an important and integral part of reliable and safe performances of these systems, especially when their failures cause catastrophes. Blind system routine maintenance is no longer acceptable; it is both costly and inconvenient for system owners and/or users. Engineered systems, like humans, require health monitoring and management. We monitor the current health of these systems via diagnostics methods, and predict their future performance and remaining useful life via prognostics methods. Considerable research has been done on PHM with respect to mechanical systems, but the same is not true with regard to electronic systems. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it provides a review of PHM research with a focus on electronic systems. Second, it provides the context to identify a general PHM framework for electronic systems. The framework offers PHM guidelines to the research community in this area. The body of knowledge on PHM of electronic system fits well into the framework. The proposed framework draws on the authors' work on monitoring, diagnostics, and holistic product lifecycle via embedded sensors. The paper 1 2 presents the extensions to the present research work.

C	Line, JK; Krishnan, G			IEEE	Line, J. Kevin; Krishnan, Ganapathi			Managing and predicting intermittent failures within long life electronics	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Many studies have confirmed that electronic failure is not a static or random event, but a process of material changes. These changes may not cause loss of operation for the electronic system, even when the components are technically out of specification. This self-compensating aspect of electronics makes diagnostics of failures particularly difficult and contributes to the ubiquitous problem of cannot duplicate (CND) failures. In addition to self-compensation, degraded failure modes of components manifest in different operating conditions and 12 may offset one another depending on circuit configuration. With these considerations, VEXTEC is developing an intermittent fault reduction methodology which considers the material changes in the electronic components on the circuit board and provides a probability of true fault when a fault is detected by built in test (BIT). By modeling the electronics as a system rather than focusing on individual components, VEXTEC can model an entire circuit board with a standard library of models as part of the OEM's normal design cycle. The model is then used with the off board PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) system within a vehicle or other high reliability electronic system to predict the probabilities of intermittent failure. This modeling capability has far reaching effects on the diagnostics and prognostics of an electronic system. The operators can manage the fleet by risk rather than by guessing the level of degradation or when intermittent failures will occur. Organizations responsible for quality, maintenance and repair can minimize the impact of CND faults on the supply chain and on troubleshooting. ne order of components replaced during a fault event can even be prioritized according to the probabilities provided by this algorithm.

A Bayesian treatment of this problem provides an elegant and theoretically sound approach to the modem Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM)/Prognostic Health Management (PHM) paradigm. The application of the Bayesian techniques to regression and classification in the form of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), and to state estimation as in Particle Filters (PF), provides a powerful tool to integrate the diagnosis and prognosis of battery health. The RVK which is a Bayesian treatment of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used for model identification, while the PF framework uses the learnt model, statistical estimates of noise and anticipated operational conditions to provide estimates of remaining useful life (RUL) in the form of a probability density function (PDF). This type of prognostics generates a significant value addition to the management of any operation involving electrical systems.

The role of reliability data bases in deploying CBM+, RCM and PHM with TLCSM	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The total life cycle systems management [TLCSM] imperative for military systems holds the program manager accountable for "total system performance (hardware, software, and human), operational effectiveness, and suitability, survivability, safety, and affordability". Condition Based Maintenance Plus [CBM+], Reliability Centered Maintenance [RCM] and prognostic health management [PHM] for critical subsystems, such as propulsion, are considered essential program elements in meeting this responsibility for total life cycle sustainability. (1) A key enabler for CBM+, RCM and PHM is adequate and accessible reliability data bases [RDB] as a primary source of the information needed to design and develop cost effective system provisions for initial deployment of new or upgraded propulsion systems. In addition, cost effective sustainment of military propulsion systems implies continued maintenance and enhancement of RDB to address the inevitable emerging reliability issues that were neither anticipated nor detected during propulsion system design and development. The expectations of TLCSM and the resultant deployment of CBM+, RCM and PHM will place increasing demands on RDB in terms of data collected, archived and processed to provide actionable information for maintainers, engineers and leaders responsible for maintenance process and configuration management, and mission planners and operational leadership. The scope of RDB coverage will expand to include records of individual propulsion system usage and other variables affecting propulsion system reliability. Integration with associated cost and logistics data bases win facilitate CBM+ & RCM application. Advanced analysis tools will support proactive oversight of deviations from expected reliability using machine intelligence to alleviate information overload on RDB users. RDB will evolve based on, and supporting, advanced models of propulsion system reliability that are automatically updated in response to field data and provide timely and dependable forecasts of propulsion system reliability, maintenance effort and logistical requirements.

Integrated Intelligent Vehicle Management framework	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The success of NASA's exploration activities hinges on the ability to make space systems safer, more affordable, and more self-sufficient. As these missions expand to ever increasing distances from earth, the systems that support these missions will be required to become more self-sufficient. Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM) is an approach that supports vehicle self-sufficiency. The architecture presented in this paper integrates advanced computational techniques with technologies for spacecraft that can generate responses through detection, diagnosis, reasoning, and adapt to system faults in support of Integrated Intelligent Vehicle Management (IIVM). This paper presents an integrated Intelligent Vehicle Management (IIVM) concept which provides for the complete integration and management of all vehicle functions and subsystems 12 This research presents architecture for vehicle level interaction between subsystem functions and vehicle level functions. This paper presents an IIVM framework that encompasses all vehicle functions and subsystems. Furthermore, this paper presents vehicle management system interactions and subsystem management functions. Each of the subsystems have the following functions: performance, diagnostics, prognostics, monitoring, and control. This paper presents a framework which conceptualizes how these subsystems interact with the various system management functions. This is accomplished by supplying new information in real time to the vehicle avionics real-time to allow responses to vehicle subsystem failures and performance degradation. This framework can potentially achieve autonomous operation capabilities necessary to assure crew safety and mission safety. IIVM is a superset of what has traditionally been defined as Avionics, Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM/Integrated System Health Management, functions performed on the ground, and Autonomous Mission Management (AMM/Autonomous Flight Management. Each of these concepts focuses on only a portion of the total vehicle functional capabilities, and each of these concepts alone perform necessary, but incomplete and sometimes duplicative tasks. This paper presents an IIVM framework which is the combination of these functions into a single system which is My aware of the complete vehicle state, and is able to make decisions based on crew safety, mission objectives, and vehicle status, and can effect changes in the vehicle based on these decisions.

C	Kurien, J; R-Moreno, MD			IEEE	Kurien, James; R-Moreno, Maria Dolores			Costs and benefits of model-based diagnosis	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Over the past 20 years, there has been much work in the area of model-based diagnosis (MBD). By this we mean diagnosis systems arising from Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence approaches where a generic software engine is developed to address a large class of diagnosis problems [1], [2]. Later, models are created to apply the engine to a specific problem. These techniques are very attractive, suggesting a vision of machines that repair themselves, reduced costs for all kinds of endeavors, spacecraft that continue their missions even when failing, and so on. This promise inspired a broad range of activity, including our involvement over several years in flying the Livingstone and Livingstone 2 on-board model-based diagnosis and recovery systems as experiments on two spacecraft [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. While a great deal was learned through a variety of applications to simulators, testbeds and flight experiments, no project adopted the technology in operations and the expected benefits have not yet come to fruition. This led us to ask what are the costs of using MBD for the operational scenarios we encountered, what are the benefits, and how do we approach the question of whether the benefits outweigh the costs? How are missions today approaching fault diagnosis and recovery during operations? If we characterize the cost and benefits of using MBD, how would it compare with traditional ways of making a system more robust? How did expectations for MBD compare to benefits seen in the field and why? The literature does provide existing cost models for related endeavors such as integrated vehicle health management [8], [9], [10]. It also provides excellent narratives of why projects chose not to use MBD after considering it [11]. However, we believe that this paper is the first to unpack and discuss the cost, benefit and risk factors that impact the net value of model-based diagnosis and recovery. We use experience with systems such as Livingstone as an example, so our focus is on-board model-based diagnosis and recovery, but we believe many of the insights and remaining questions on the costs and benefits are applicable to other diagnosis applications. While the analysis is not yet mature enough to provide a quantitative model of when on-board model-based diagnosis would be an effective choice, it lays out the cost/benefit proposition and identifies several disconnects that we believe prevent adoption as an operational tool. While we do not suggest metrics for every cost, benefit and risk factor we identify, we do discuss where each factor arises in development or operations and how model-based diagnosis and recovery tends to leverage or exacerbate each. As such we believe the analysis is of use to those developing MBD or related techniques and those who may employ them. It also serves as one example of how honest expectations based on technical capability can come to differ from the net impact on customer problems. In this paper we present a cost/benefit analysis for MBD, using expectations and experiences with Livingstone as an example. We provide an overview of common techniques for making spacecraft robust, citing fault protection schemes from recent missions [12], [13]. We lay out the cost, benefit and risk advantages associated with on-board MBD, and use the examples to probe each expected advantage in turn. We conclude our analysis with a summary of our method for analyzing the costs and benefits in a particular domain, and encourage others to come forward with analyses of costs and benefits for fielded systems. Finally, we discuss related work both in terms of similar analyses and fielded systems.

So this paper presents a sequential diagnosis method for rolling bearing by a fuzzy neural network with the features of a vibration signal in time domain. The fuzzy neural network is realized with a developed back propagation neural network, by which the fault types of a bearing can be automatically distinguished on the basis of the possibility distributions of symptom parameters sequentially. The non-dimensional symptom parameters which reflect the features of signal measured for the diagnosis are also described in time domain. The faults that often occur in a bearing, such as the outer race flaw, inner race flaw, and roller element flaw, are used for the diagnosis. Practical examples of diagnosis for a rolling bearing used in rotating machinery are shown to verify the efficiency of the method.

Independent component analysis (ICA), as a statistical method, has the ability to segregate multiple-sources signals into independent signals. In this paper, a scheme to reduce the non-order noise for order tracking analysis in Computer Order Tracking(COT) based on ICA is presented, in which FastICA scheme is exploited to separate observed (mixed) signals into the order components and the non-order noise in the angular domain. The ambiguities of ICA are also solved in the scheme, which make it feasible to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis applications of rotating machinery. The approach is applied to simulation experiments. Analysis results give positive support to the presented approach.

This paper considers condition monitoring and diagnosis of mechanical and electrical faults in such a variable speed machine. A new condition monitoring technique is proposed in this paper, which removes the negative influence of variable wind in machine condition monitoring. This technique has a versatile function, able to detect both the mechanical and electrical faults in the wind turbine. Its effectiveness is validated by the experiments on a wind turbine condition monitoring test rig. Furthermore, a potential approach for diagnosing wind turbine drive-train mechanical faults using wind turbine generator electrical signals is introduced. The diagnosis of rotor imbalance in the wind turbine will be used as an illustrative example, heralding the detection of wind turbine electromechanical faults by power analysis. The paper offers a simpler and cheaper condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system for wind turbines.

As the community transitions from traditional preventive maintenance procedures to modern predictive or health-based management systems, areas such as efficient online monitoring and diagnosis schemes based on real-time observations have emerged as key research subjects for engineers. Most diagnostic systems require data from both healthy and faulty conditions in order to properly train their classification algorithms. However, in many situations, normal signals are acquired easily while fault samples are difficult to be gained. In this paper, we present a diagnosis scheme based on the Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM). Our modified LS-SVM algorithm is a One-Class Novelty Detector which can differentiate between a normal and faulty condition based only on the normal samples which are easily available. We diagnose a growing crack fault on a planetary gearplate mounted aboard a UH-60 Blackhawk aircraft using this approach.

This paper describes an approach to answer the question of where one should invest to achieve the greatest return in an iterative continuous improvement process. Key activities or process features that may yield return are the implementation of: Diagnostic and prognostic strategies for line replacement units (LRUs) in major platform subsystems. Maintenance, logistics and operations planning and management. Intermediate/depot test and repair strategies, implementation of infrastructure functions to move data off of the platform as well as capture crew and maintenance personnel input. This paper builds on earlier work in applying the Theory of Constraints as the core of a continuous improvement process to direct investments in legacy support systems. The paper casts fleet support as a process where throughput is beet readiness; inventory is the platforms, support equipment, spares and maintainers; and work in process is the current or predicted faults/degradations that must be addressed to return the platform to service requirements or opportunistically maintain its serviceability. In comparison to the earlier work, the process model has been improved and is more comprehensive. The fleet simulation tool that is used as the basis for examining potential bottlenecks and in estimating the return of TOC compliant improvement strategies (those that simultaneously increase throughput while reducing inventory and work in process) has been upgraded. Also, the role and use of an analysis/data mining tool to identify process bottlenecks based on fleet data are described. A defined and accepted approach for the systematic improvement of fleet support is made all the more crucial by the active involvement of multiple partners (that may include the customer) in ventures such as performance based logistics. It provides the common reference model to coordinate partner actions as well as estimate partner return on investment across organization (inter and intra) boundaries.

The authors present the integration of power supply characterization techniques into an automated test package as a depot-level use case and outline the development of O-level and embedded implementations in support of the verticality of test philosophy. We also discuss the future work efforts being pursued to implement the power supply HMS technology within the maintenance infrastructure, and to further enhance the technology through remaining useful life (RUL) studies and new techniques for accelerated test. Finally, a real-world cost benefit is presented for a critical avionic system to justify technology adoption due to its positive impact on availability, maintenance support and return on investment.

ISVDD constructs the recognizer of fault data by introducing an optimal sphere instead of the minimum sphere. The recognizer can sift out the fault data belonging to new unknown fault types and avoid erroneous diagnosis. A new method of fault diagnosis is given based on ISVDD and hierarchy structure SVMs for the multi-fault problem. Numerical experiments are performed on a real dataset. The results show that ISVDD can be used to pretreat the fault data effectively and that the new method of fault diagnosis has higher precision and can be used in practice.

Compact Fuzzy Rules Induction and Feature Extraction Using SVM with Particle Swarms for Breast Cancer Treatments	2008 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			NOTTINGHAM-PROGNOSTIC-INDEX; SELECTION; SYSTEM	Developing a treatment plan for breast cancer patient is a very complex process. In this paper, we propose a scheme of inducing fuzzy rules that characterise breast caner treatment knowledge from data. These fuzzy rules can augment the human experts in the process of medical diagnosis to select optimal treatment for patients. The proposed machine learning scheme applies the particle swarm optimisation technique (PSO) to the construction of an optimal support vector machine (SVM) model for the sake of inducing accurate and parsimonious fuzzy rules and simultaneously reducing input space dimensions, in which a new fittness function that regularises the importance ranks of features with misclassification rate is suggested. The SVM-based fuzzy classifier evades the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional breast cancer data space in the sense that the number of support vectors, which equals the number of induced fuzzy rules, is not related to the dimensionality. The experiments have shown that not only the classification performance achieved by the proposed fuzzy classifier outperforms the ones achieved by other methods in the literature, but also the input space dimension has been reduced greatly.

In this method, using Wavelet Transform (WT), the time-frequency based features of the current waveform up to 6.25 kHz are calculated. To extract the best feature set of the generated time frequency features, two methods including Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are used and then Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used as a classifier to distinguish the HIFs considering with and without broken conductor from other similar phenomena such as capacitor banks switching, no load transformer switching, load switching and harmonic loads considering induction motors, arc furnaces. The results show high accuracy of the proposed method in the detection task.	[Sarlak, M.; Shahrtash, S.

It also Investigates the fault compensation via topologies that are able to maintain the system operation for a period of time. With the proposed techniques it is possible to detect and identify the power switch in which the fault has occurred. Such detection requires the measurement of some voltages Differently from other schemes the proposed one allows, in some cases, full utilization of the dc-link. Simulated and experimental results verify the feasibility of proposed strategies. The results obtained so far indicate that it is possible to embed some fault-tolerant properties for the voltage-fed asynchronous machine drive system.	[da Silva, Edison R.

A Stator Core Quality Assessment Technique for Inverter-fed Induction Machines	2008 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Industry-Applications-Society Annual Meeting	OCT 05-09, 2008	Alberta, CANADA	Ind Applicat Soc		AC Machine; Condition Monitoring; Core Loss; Diagnostics; Eddy Current Loss; Hysteresis Loss; Induction Motor; Inter-laminar Insulation Failure; Inverter; Stator Core		Localized heating caused by damage in the laminations or inter-laminar insulation of the stator core increases the core losses and can lead to machine failure. Therefore, it is important to monitor the quality of the stator core for reliable and efficient operation of the machine. The methods currently available for core quality assessment are inconvenient since they require an outage and the machine to be disassembled or operated under no load conditions. In this paper, a new method for monitoring the quality of the stator core for inverter-fed machines without motor disassembly or operation is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to apply a set of test signals to assess the quality of the core whenever the motor is at standstill. A set of high frequency pulsating magnetic fields are produced using the inverter, and the power loss is observed as a function of field circumferential position to detect core problems. An experimental study on 10hp induction motor verifies that local inter-laminar core faults can be detected with high sensitivity. The proposed technique is expected to provide a simple solution for frequent stator core quality assessment without motor disassembly, motor operation, or additional hardware for reliable and efficient operation of inverter-fed induction machines.

Application of Piezoelectric Sensors to Rotor Fault Diagnostics in Squirrel-Cage Induction Machines	2008 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING, VOLS 1-5	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Industry-Applications-Society Annual Meeting	OCT 05-09, 2008	Alberta, CANADA	Ind Applicat Soc		Induction machines; fault diagnostics; rotor faults; vibration monitoring; rotor fault indices; piezoelectric sensors		In this paper, application of a piezoelectric vibration sensor to induction motor fault diagnostics is investigated. More specifically, a piezoelectric sensor is used to diagnose broken bar faults in squirrel-cage induction machines. The piezoelectric vibration sensor described in this paper offers a number of advantages when compared to other conventional vibration monitoring devices, such as accelerometers, velomitors, proximity probes, etc. These advantages can be summarized as follows: low cost, ease of implementation, and relatively high bandwidth. Use of a vibration signal as a medium for rotor fault diagnostics may result in a simplification of the diagnosis procedure, since both the fault index and the slip (speed) can be estimated from one signal. It is well known that rotor faults result in torque and possible consequent speed oscillations at twice the slip frequency, 2sf. These torque and speed oscillations/pulsations, in turn, produce detectable vibrations that can be utilized for purposes of rotor fault diagnostics. Moreover, radial forces produced as a result of such faults may result in increased vibration amplitude at the same, 2sf, frequency, which can further amplify the fault index, and hence make the proposed technique more reliable. Experimental results on broken bar diagnostics are presented here to demonstrate the validity and efficacy of this approach.	[Sizov, Gennadi Y.; Yeh, Chia-Chou; Demerdash, Nabeel A.

Traditionally, inter-turn faults are detected using negative sequence current and impedance. However, their effectiveness under supply unbalance conditions is questionable. Recently line current third harmonic (+3f) has also been used in an attempt to achieve this goal. But, issues such as inherent structural asymmetry and voltage unbalance also influence the +3f. In this paper, positive and negative sequence third harmonics (3f) of line current under different operating conditions have been explored by combining space and time harmonics. The suggested fault signature was obtained by removing residual components from tested quantities. Simulation and experimental results using one second of data indicate proposed 3f signatures are capable of very effectively detecting even single turn fault and distinguish it from voltage unbalance and structural asymmetry.

Mechanical imbalances and bearing faults account for a large majority of faults in a machine, especially for small medium size machines. Therefore their diagnosis is an intensively investigated field or research. Recently many research activities were focused on the diagnosis of bearing faults by current signal. Stator current components are generated at predictable frequencies related to the electrical supply and mechanical frequencies of bearing faults. However their detection Is not always reliable, since the amplitude of fault signatures in the current signal is very low. This paper compares the bearing fault detection capability obtained with vibration and current signals. To this aim a testbed is realized that allows to test vibration and current signal on a machine with healthy or faulty bearings. Signal processing techniques for both cases are reviewed and compared in order to show which procedure is best suited to the different type of bearing faults. The paper contribution is the use of a simple and effective signal processing technique for both current and vibration signals, and a theoretical analysis of the physical link between faults and current components including torque ripple effects. As expected because of the different nature of vibration and current, bearing fault diagnosis Is effective only for those fault whose mechanical frequency rate is quite low.

The paper focuses on two specific operating modes: 1) machines operated from inverters in the overmodulation region, and 2) machines operated from soft-starters during startup. In both cases, high frequency voltage components at well-defined frequencies are created. The negative sequence currents induced from these high frequency voltages are shown to contain accurate information on the level of asymmetry (fault) in the machine. This information is significantly richer than exists in other modes of operation, i.e., inverters working In the linear modulation region or soft-starters in the steady-state, and provides interesting opportunities to complement other diagnostic methods.

In this paper, a simple dynamic model of a single stage gearbox is used to show accurately the effect of the rotating input, output and mesh frequency components in the stator current signature for induction machine-based electromechanical systems. With this model, the influence of the transmission error and of the eccentricities of pinion and wheel is shown in the stator current spectrum and it gives an accurate location of the gearbox input and output rotating frequencies. In the same way, the influence of the pinion-wheel teeth contact stiffness variation, which is at the origin of the mesh frequency components in the stator current signature, is demonstrated even for a healthy gearbox. In order to validate the proposed model, a test-bed based on a wound-rotor 4kW three-phase induction machine connected to a gearbox has been used.

A reliable bearing fault diagnostic technique is critically needed in industries to recognize a bearing fault at its early stage so as to prevent system's performance degradation and malfunction. In this work, a genetic programming based feature reconstruction approach is proposed for bearing fault diagnostics. A new fitness measure is proposed to improve the GP operations in feature formulation. The original features are from the modified kurtosis ratio and the one-scale wavelet analysis. Investigation results show that the proposed method is an effective feature formulation tool; the reconstructed features are more robust against the variations in bearing geometry and operating conditions. The corresponding fault diagnostic reliability can be enhanced significantly. As a result, this work provides a promising technique and tool for bearing condition monitoring for real-world applications.

The harmonics in pulse-width-modulation (PWM) input voltage waveforms and EMI noise in ASD systems make bearing fault detection more difficult. The proposed method accomplishes bearing fault detection in ASD's by combining Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM in conjunction with the GA is applied to the rms values of the wavelet packet coefficients to obtain significant wavelet packet nodes which produce optimal classifiers for classifying both healthy and defective bearings in ASD systems.

Firstly, a calibrated camera will detect and track the milling and transmit the position data to a host computer. Secondly, a laser built-in thermometer will continuously read the temperature of the milling by following the milling based on the position data. Finally, the host computer will generate an alarm signal when the temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold.

However, the decoupling ability is often limited by both heavy computation and deficiency in information about rotary speeds or frequencies of complex mechanical systems. A new approach for removing crossing noise in VKOT is proposed in this paper to overcome these problems in traditional approach for crossing-noise decoupling. In the presented approach, independent component analysis (ICA) has been employed to remove the noise by the separation of independent components (ICs) before performing VKOT. The ambiguities of ICA are also solved in our scheme, which make it feasible to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis applications of rotating machinery. The approach is applied to simulation experiments. Analysis results give positive support to the presented approach.

Inspired by this observation, in this paper, a simple yet effective power efficiency estimation based health monitoring and fault detection technique is proposed for modular and reconfigurable robot with joint torque sensor. Power efficiency coefficients of each joint module are obtained using sensor measurements and used directly for health monitoring and fault detection. The proposed method has been experimentally tested on a modular and reconfigurable robot with joint torque sensing and a distributed control system.

The measured DC voltages in the DC line can not be used to detect system falut on account of the random noise effect. Firstly, consensus filter is used to filter the volts d.c. measured by multisensors. Then a fault observer is constructed using the output of the consensus filter to detect system faults. In order to classify the detected faults, DC voltage signals are selected to be transformed by using S transformation method and then fault samples composed of effective features are extracted. On this basis, we establish SVM fault diagnosis models, and compare performance of different models. Simulation results show the efficientcy of the proposed method.

Since the classification performance of DTSVM is closely related to its structure, Genetic Algorithm is introduced into the formation of Decision Tree, to cluster the multi-classes with maximum distance between the clustering centers of the two subclasses, so that the most separable classes would be separated at each node of Decision Tree.

C	Ferrarini, L; Brusa, R; Veber, C			IEEE	Ferrarini, Luca; Brusa, Roberto; Veber, Carlo			A pragmatic approach to fault diagnosis in hydraulic circuits for automated machining: a case study	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	AUG 23-26, 2008	Arlington, VA	IEEE			ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; FAILURE DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	The paper deals with the problem of fault detection and isolation in machining centers, which are the basis of FMS'. The problem is of paramount importance since an effective diagnostic system can lead to a significant increase in the autonomy of an automated system. The paper considers a special case study: an hydraulic circuit which blocks and unblocks the pallet on the rotary table in a machining centre. On the one hand, a practical approach is to insert suitable error handling functions inside the control model. This is extremely easy and efficient to discover non-nominal behaviors, but it is useless to identify the root causes of such behaviors (faults). On the other hand, theoretical approaches are able to automatically synthesize an observer that is able to detect a fault when diagnosability conditions apply. Unfortunately, the diagnosability conditions do not always apply in real industrial applications, where some diagnostics analysis should be done anyway. Dually, when applicable, diagnosability may depend upon other rare events or even on some other faults, which may impair its practical applicability. The paper investigates the pragmatic use of known theoretical techniques with the special aim at providing the human operator with all the possible information in real applications.

Differentiating data security and network security	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-13	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2008)	MAY 19-23, 2008	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Chinese Inst Elect, Chinese Inst Commun, Tsinghu Univ, Beijing Univ, Posts & Telecommun			CRYPTOGRAPHY	Data security, since antiquity, relies on cryptography. Cryptography is as good as the! inability of a person or a computing machine to "break" the generated cipher code. It has been demonstrated that this inability is temporary because some strong cryptographic methods that were believed to be unbreakable have been broken. Thus, as cryptography is seeking new and more difficult cryptographic venues, cryptoanalysts become increasingly sophisticated in breaking codes. However, both ciphertext and secret keys are transported over the communications network from where, with proper means, they can be harvested for analysis, and furthermore to impersonate a source, or cause service denial. Thus, in addition to hard ciphers for data encryption and sophisticated distribution methods, the network itself needs to be attack-hard and attack-smart. That is, the network should have appropriate mechanisms that monitor and detect attacks, intelligence that discriminates between degradations/failures and attacks, and also protocols for robust countermeasure strategies to outsmart the attacker. Thus, although "data security" deals with ciphering client-originating payload, "network security" deals with the secure transport of data. Because the latter is a relatively new topic, it requires more insight and particularly a thorough understanding of fault/degradation mechanisms and attack scenarios and how they distinguished. In this paper we outline data security and differentiate from network security. Additionally, we describe a method for detecting the channel signature and how it is used to discriminate between degradation/failure and attacks and thus enhance network security. Moreover, we describe a method for attack detection and countermeasure strategies.

Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques such as one class support vector machines (SVMs) have been introduced to overcome this difficulty. One class support vector machines model the normal or target data using non-linear surfaces in the input space while ignoring the anomalous data. Our approach to this problem is based on fitting a hyperellipsoid with a minimal effective radius, centered at the origin, around a majority of the data vectors in a higher dimensional space. We formulate this as a linear optimisation problem, which is advantageous in terms of its computational complexity. We demonstrate using real data from the Great Duck Island Project that our approach achieves better detection performance and flexibility in terms of parameter selection, compared to an earlier detection scheme using a quarter sphere SVM.

Since empirical studies show various faults of fuel oil system induces the variation of vibration signals, we propose to diagnose faults of marine main engine shaft using vibration signal from engine. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, a wavelet analysis method is used to characterize the power spectrum of the vibration signal. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most distinctive feature for faults diagnosis. Finally, the extracted features are fed into a set of pre-trained support vector machines (SVM) for fault diagnosis. Importantly, we use a cascade framework to organize a set of SVMs, for identifying different types of faults. Experimental results are presented to show that our proposed method is able to detect and identify different types of faults accurately.

The machinery has been required to run for longer periods of time and reliable operations. Because machine breakdowns and consequent down times severely affect the productivity of factories or the safety of products and process success depends on the reliability and the efficiency of related key components, the requirements for enhanced reliability of equipment are more critical than ever before. Firstly, this paper describes applying vibration theory to detect machinery fault via the measurement of vibration and voice monitoring machinery working condition. This paper proposes a useful way of vibration analysis and source identification in complex machinery. An actual experiment case study on a cold-roll press machine has been conducted in aluminum factory. Based on intensity measure, statistical and FFT frequency analysis methods, the experiment results indicate that fewer sensors and less measurement and analysis time can achieve condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and damage forecasting. As a result, lower in running operation and maintenance costs and increased in productivity and efficiency can be achieved.

The fundamental reason for this being the mismatch between the growing diversity and complexity of machinery and equipment employed in industry and the historical reliance on "point-solution" diagnostic systems that necessitate extensive characterization of the failure modes and mechanisms (something very expensive and tedious). While these point solutions have a role to play, in particular for monitoring highly-critical assets, generic yet adaptive solutions, meaning solutions that are flexible and able to learn on-line, could facilitate large-scale deployment of diagnostic and prognostic technology. We present a novel approach for autonomous diagnostics that employs model-based sequential clustering with hidden-Markov models as a means for measuring similarity of time-series sensor signals. The proposed method has been tested on a CNC machining test-bed outfitted with thrust-force and torque sensors for monitoring drill-bits. Preliminary results revealed the competitive performance of the method.

A unique hybrid prognostics and health management methodology combining both data-driven and physics-of-failure models is proposed for fault diagnosis and life prediction. The shortcomings of using data-driven and physics-of-failure methodologies independently are discussed. These approaches estimate future system health, based on a systems current health status, historical performance, and operating environmental conditions. Although these methodologies are applicable to legacy, current, and future electronics, and ranging from components to circuit assemblies and electronic products, the hybrid approach is preferred due to its capability to include potential failure precursor parameters with failure mechanism, thus improving accuracy in prognostic estimates. Various works on data-driven and physics-of-failure approaches to prognostics for electronics are summarized and a hybrid methodology case study is presented.

A set of over 3,400 image features, including textural and nuclear architecture based features, are extracted from a database of 48 breast biopsy tissue studies (30 cancerous and 18 benign images). Spectral clustering is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used (1) to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous images, and (2) to distinguish between images containing low and high grades of cancer. Classification is repeated using different subsets of features to compare their performance. The system achieves a 95.8% accuracy in distinguishing cancer from non-cancer using texture-based characteristics (Gabor filter features), and 93.3% accuracy in distinguishing high from low grades of cancer using architectural features. In addition, we investigate the underlying main-fold structure on which the different grades of breast cancer lie as revealed through spectral clustering. The manifold shows a smooth spatial transition from low to high grade breast cancer.

Vibration monitoring of mechanical characteristic frequencies related to the bearings is widely used to detect faulty operations. However, vibration measurement is expensive and can not always be performed. An alternative is to base the monitoring on the available electrical quantities e.g. the machine stator current which is often already measured for control and protection purposes. The bearing faults reveal the presence of mechanical load torque oscillations. A theoretical stator current model in case of load torque oscillations demonstrates the presence of phase modulation. Related sideband components appear in the current spectrum and can be used for detection. Experimental measurements show that their amplitudes are linked to the fault frequency by a transfer function including resonance. This singularity will be used to improve the detection efficiency. Fault detectors using the energy of stator current in specific frequency ranges are then proposed. The efficiency of indicators is studied on long and short data records of experimental current for different bearing faults.

First, a discontinuity of current signal, which is usually caused by switch open-circuit faults, is detected by the DWT, and then fault detection and isolation are processed by the SVM. The proposed method is verified by simulation results.

Rolling-element bearing defects inside a motor pump are the object of study. A dynamic model of the faults usually found in this context is presented. Initially a graphic simulation is used to produce the signals. Signal processing techniques, like frequency filters, Hilbert transform and spectral analysis are then used to extract features that will later be used as a base to classify the states of the studied process. After that real data from a centrifugal pump is submitted to the developed methods.	[Mendel, E.; Mariano, L. Z.; Drago, I.; Loureiro, S.; Rauber, T. W.; Varejao, F.

The main advantage of this choice is to discard the power limitation and permits high power fight-weight drives. This enable constructor to achieve higher traction speed and this area now is in permanent development. In this way, the security and reliability of the system becomes more important. The railway traction has a complex structure and the diagnosis of the electromechanical system based on non invasive electrical sensors becomes the interest of research in recent years. In this paper, a test-bed based on a real traction bogie is proposed to study machine current signature analysis for mechanical condition monitoring.

Asymmetrical Behavior of a Double-Fed Induction Generator: Modeling, Discrete Event Simulation and Validation	2008 IEEE MEDITERRANEAN ELECTROTECHNICAL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference-MELECON		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference	MAY 05-07, 2008	Ajaccio, FRANCE	IEEE		Wound-rotor induction machine; Fault detection; Discrete event simulator; Spectrum analysis		The aim of this paper is to present a discrete event simulation of a three-phase wound-rotor induction machine in order to show the efficiency of the proposed method to take into account the different winding unbalances. In fact, these machines are used in large power wind turbine generators in which the fault detection becomes more and more a serious issue. Early fault detection in the machine windings could be of great use for protection and predictive maintenance design. Therefore the classical abc reference frame model of the induction machine is translated in block-scheme to be interpreted by the discrete-event system simulator. The time-domain analysis is transformed in frequency-domain by interpolation to translate the discrete event magnitude in fixed sampling frequency and then application of normalized FFT to obtain the machine current spectrum. The technique is applied to a 5.5kW wound-rotor induction machine in normal operation and with winding (stator, rotor, stator+rotor) unbalances.

Gearbox Monitoring by Using the Stray Flux in an Induction Machine Based Electromechanical System	2008 IEEE MEDITERRANEAN ELECTROTECHNICAL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference-MELECON		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference	MAY 05-07, 2008	Ajaccio, FRANCE	IEEE		Flux; Current; Gears; Squirrel cage motors; Wound rotor motors; Induction machines; Mechanical systems; Monitoring; Spectrum analysis	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; MULTISTAGE GEARBOX; FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATIONS; SIGNALS; MOTORS	The aim of this paper is to analyze experimentally the stray flux spectrum of a three phase induction machine in an electromechanical system, in order to show how it is influenced by the gearbox behavior. The mechanical monitoring in the electromechanical systems has been mainly studied using vibration signals. Recently, some works have been performed in order to monitor the mechanical part by using the stator current spectrum. In this paper the effect of the gearbox behavior is observed in the stray flux by using the spectral signature given by the stator current which is produced by the torsional vibrations induced by the gearbox in normal operation. This study is performed on two different induction machines (squirrel-cage and wound rotor) sharing the same mechanical system.	[Fatemi, S. M. J. Rastegar; Henao, H.; Capolino, G.

This paper discusses how prognostics - the ability to predict the remaining useful life of an item - has become achievable and what this means for the world of reliability for the military. Current and developing prognostic techniques for digital and analog communication electronics are described including canary techniques, physics of failure models, health and usage monitoring systems, and statistical and parametric precursors for electronics.

Life (RUL) of electronic components before a failure occurs. This field, while immature, is increasingly important to Raytheon's customers. Raytheon must develop a common and synergistic strategy to address new prognostic requirements. For this reason, Raytheon established a Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) (formerly known as Health Management System) Technology Information Group (TIG) to coordinate these efforts. The PHM TIG identified the need for an Electronics Prognostics Reference Architecture (ePRA) to use in proposals and during the evaluation of new systems with prognostics requirements. With that need in mind the authors of this paper employed the Raytheon Enterprise Architecture Process' (REAP) to create an ePRA. A list of "must have" requirements for the ePRA were derived that enable its use across many Raytheon projects. Additionally, a list of quality attributes was created for the ePRA. Together these requirements and attributes led to the creation of supporting Department of Defense Architecture Framework(2) (DoDAF) views. While there are numerous evolutionary concerns in the area of electronics prognostics, compliance with and the evolution of this ePRA will position Raytheon well to rapidly respond to its customers' growing prognostics requirements. The evolution of prognostic systems will fortify Raytheon's customer focus by supplementing highly reliable products with RUL predictions. This will allow for "just in time" replacement of components, improvement within the logistics chain, and a reduction of down-time for the user in an increasingly mobile battlespace. The ePRA developed in this paper will guide the implementation and incorporation of electronics prognostics into Raytheon's products.

This is a 'proactive equipment maintenance capability enabled by using Health Management indications to predict a functional failure ahead of the event and take appropriate action." [1] PHM involves the collection and processing of precursors to failure data from fielded platforms for the purpose of mitigating failures before mission loss. Although communication systems and networks have mainly been used for mission execution, there is a growing need to communicate predictive system health data in order to mitigate field failures before they affect mission success. These new PHM data requirements include Remaining Useful Life and configuration data to be collected from all fielded products using various communication devices and networks. The following PHM communication challenges and proposed solutions are discussed in this paper: a. Collecting PHM data from field systems using Ad-hoc networks b. Mitigating bandwidth usage via data transformation techniques c.

Under a certain disturbance, the candidate critical cluster of power system is predicted and refreshed at each sampling step. The method identifies the loss of synchronism at each time step by observing the geometric characteristic of the post-fault trajectory of the generalized one-machine equivalent system. A new structure of the emergency control scheme relies on SIME (for Single Machine Equivalent). It is unnecessary to calculate the unstable equilibrium point and some limitations caused by the time-invariant assumption are also eliminated. Simulations are carried out on the IEEE 50 generator test system and a real power system. The results indicate that the proposed method has the features of reliability and effectiveness in preventing the system from the loss of synchronism.	[Xie, Huan; Zhang, Bao-Hui; Hao, Z. G.; Wang, C.

A time-domain based approach is used to detect the critical points in the coil current, which can be used by an intelligent system, human, or machine, to assess and predict the health of the breaker. The proposed algorithm is computationally inexpensive and can be easily embedded in a low cost microprocessor. Experimental data were used to verify the robustness of the algorithm. The method provides a practical extremum detection technique in a noisy environment, which can be extended for other digital signal processing applications in computer science and biomedical engineering.

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is used for the detection of specific frequency components that indicate eccentricity faults in a machine. More specifically, the modulus information of CWT is used for the extraction of the "faulty" frequency components.

Experimental tests were carried out on an induction motor with several faulty rotors and the obtained results corroborate the effectiveness of the instantaneous reactive power approach for the detection of broken rotor bars in inverter-fed induction motors. A suitable fault severity factor is also proposed as an indicator of the condition of the machine.	[Drif, M'hamed; Cardoso, A. J.

Detection of Air Gap Eccentricity in the Presence of Stator Inter-turn Fault of Inverter Fed Induction Machines	2008 IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-10	IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE RECORDS		English	Proceedings Paper	39th IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference (PESC 08)	JUN 15-19, 2008	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	IEEE			MOTOR	Online monitoring of air gap eccentricity using only current and voltage sensors is still considered most difficult during mains operation. At high dynamic inverter-fed operation it then becomes extremely challenging. The only industrially accepted method so far is the usage of the vibration spectrum obtained from extensive measurements. As has already been shown, the detection and exploitation of the machines transient phase reactance offers the possibility to determine machine asymmetries with high accuracy. The detection is realized by a transient stimulation of the machine with voltage pulses by the inverter as well as by measuring the reaction of the machine current. The stimulation can be either realized by a specific switching sequence of the inverter, or by using the pulses generated by the PWM in specific operating points. In the resulting detection signal however, all effects that influence the transient phase reactances superpose. Whereas the inherent influences like spatial saturation or slotting can be identified and eliminated, the air gap eccentricity and stator winding inter turn short circuit and especially their simultaneous occurrence need additional attention and signal processing. Measurements on specially manufactured machines are presented to show both the separated occurrence of air gap eccentricity and an inter tarn isolation fault in the stator windings, as well as their simultaneous incident. As both fault conditions have strong impact on the transient reactance their interaction has to be determined in all operating states to enable an accurate separation of both defects.

In spite of their robustness they do occasionally fail and their resulting unplanned downtime can prove very costly. Therefore, condition monitoring of electrical machines has received considerable attention in recent years. A suitable model enables motor faults to be simulated and the change in corresponding parameters to be predicted without physical experimentation. This paper presents a mathematical foundation and theoretical analysis of asymmetric stator faults in induction machines. A three-phase induction motor is simulated with simple differential equations. Experimental verification of excitation current under healthy. condition is given.

Demonstration of an ITER relevant Remote Handling Equipment for Tokamak close inspection	2008 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-3, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	SEP 22-26, 2008	Nice, FRANCE	IEEE, Robot Soc Japan, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Soc Instrument & Control Engineers, Inst Natl Rech Informat & Automat, CNRS, Inst Control, Robot & Syst				This work concerns the development of an ITER relevant advanced robotic systems for fusion reactor. The feasibitity demonstration will be performed on the thermonuclear experimental Tokamak: Tore Supra, located in Cadarache facilities. The manipulator developed. by the Interactive Robotics Unit of CEA-LIST will be used for close inspection intervention tasks in a Tokamak. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach with a 9.5 in cantilever length, high dexterity to move in a Torus shape environment and able to carry a 10kg payload on its end effector. As the robot must be introduced without breaking the machine conditioning, it has to cope with the vacuum and temperature constraints: Ultra High Vacuum (10(-6) Pa) and 120 degrees C in use, 200 degrees C during baking phase. This long reach multi-link carrier has 10 DOF (9 rotary joints and 1 prismatic joint). It is composed of 5 modules and a precise guiding and pushing system (the deployer) for a total weight of about 300 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the actuators. The severe operating conditions impose a selection of several vacuum and temperature technologies that have been tested, qualified or optimized to cope with the requirements. In September 2007, the Remote Handling Equipment deployment under atmospheric conditions in a real Tokamak environment (Tore Supra) enabled to qualify the entire prototype. The scenario has to be rehearsed under vacuum and temperature to achieve the complete feasibility demonstration of a Tokamak close inspection by means of a robotic equipment under real operating conditions. The demonstration is an important step in the project but further developments are or could be necessary to cope with 100% of the requirements toward a reliable industrial prototype. In particular, due to its size and weight, this large robot manipulator holds lots of elastic and geometric deformations. Thus its accuracy is a challenge. A mechanical model could be developed to take into consideration the flexibilities of the structure and by means of calibration, the model parameters could be identified and then integrated in a real time controller. Further advanced developments on the on line monitoring system are also necessary for operator assistance and fault detection.	[Keller, D.; Perrot, Y.; Friconneau, J.

The key to fault bearings diagnosis is feature extracting and feature classifying. Wavelet packet transform, as a new technique of signal processing, possesses excellent characteristic of time-frequency localization and is suitable for analyzing the time-varying or transient signals. Support vector machine is capable of pattern recognition and nonlinear regression. According to the frequency domain feature of rolling bearing vibration signal, energy eigenvector of frequency domain is extracted using wavelet packet transform method. Fault pattern of rolling bearing is recognized using support vector machine multiple fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that such method is available to recognize the fault pattern accurately and provide a new approach to intelligent fault diagnosis.

However, support for PHM is predicated on the articulation of clear business cases that quantify the expected cost and benefit of its implementation. The realization of PHM requires implementation at different levels of scale and complexity. The maturity, robustness, and applicability of the underlying predictive algorithms impact the overall efficacy of PHM within an enterprise. The utility of PHM to inform decision-makers within tight scheduling constraints and under different operational profiles likewise affects the cost avoidance that can be realized. This paper discusses the calculation of Return on Investment (ROI) for PHM activities and presents a case study conducted using a stochastic discrete event simulation model to determine the potential ROI offered by electronics PHM.

A key benefit of utilizing signal integrity parameters for PHM is that uncertainty is reduced as the very signals, their return paths, and their power and ground networks are used for monitoring deviations from expected normal behavior. Utilizing signal integrity parameters in a PHM implementation enables the health of system to be monitored from a signal point of view at the device, interconnect and transmission level. Utilizing jitter measurements, high-frequency losses are captured, and jitter (with respect to operational functions) is deterministic and bounded, thus reducing the complexity of PHM algorithms and enabling remaining useful life estimation. By selecting deterministic parameters for health monitoring, a fault signature and prognostics framework is considered to be achievable. Health monitoring of failure mechanisms, such as electromigration and electrostatic discharge, are discussed from a notional perspective.

The failure of these switches can reduce the efficiency of the system or lead to system failure. By identifying failure precursor parameters in IGBTs and monitoring them, a prognostics methodology can be developed to predict and avert failures. In this study, IGBTs aged by thermal-electrical stresses were evaluated in comparison with new components to determine the electrical parameters that change with stressing. Three potential precursor parameter candidates, threshold voltage, transconductance, and collector-emitter (ON) voltage, were evaluated by comparing aged and new IGBTs under a temperature range of 25-200 degrees C. The trends in the three electrical parameters with temperature were correlated to device degradation. A methodology is presented for validating these precursor parameters for IGBT prognostics.

Since Field Effect Transistors (FETs) are building blocks for the electronic systems and their components, the diagnosis and prognosis of potential FET system failures are critical to the flight and ground crew. In this paper, we developed an advanced prognostic methodology based on the Direct Drain Quiescent Current (IDDQ) testing technique for potential Field Effect Transistors (FETs) failures. To predict the Remaining useful life (RUL) of the FET-based devices, a thorough failure mechanism study for FETs was performed in order to select a subset of failure mechanisms that cause progressive degradation and relate with IDDQ signals. With the selected failure mechanisms, we utilized the symbolic dynamics-based method to perform the fault degradation status estimation and a novel Uncertainty Adjusted Prognostics (UAP) method to predict the RUL with uncertainty management. Finally, the prognostic methodology was verified using developed 2-D/3-D simulation models.

The approach is especially suitable for situations in which abundant run-to-failure data for an engineered system are available. Data from multiple units of the same system are used to create a library of degradation patterns. When estimating the RUL of a test unit, the data from it will be matched to those patterns in the library and the actual life of those matched units will be used as the basis of estimation. This approach is used to tackle the data challenge problem defined by the 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition, in which, run-to-failure data of an unspecified engineered system are provided and the RUL of a set of test units will be estimated. Results show that the similarity-based approach is very effective in performing RUL estimation.

Along with developing the fundamentals of being able to confidently predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the technology calls for fielded applications as it inches towards maturation. This requires a stringent performance evaluation so that the significance of the concept can be fully exploited. Currently, prognostics concepts lack standard definitions and suffer from ambiguous and inconsistent interpretations. This lack of standards is in part due to the varied end-user requirements for different applications, time scales, available information, domain dynamics, etc. to name a few issues. Instead, the research community has used a variety of metrics based largely on convenience with respect to their respective requirements. Very little attention has been focused on establishing a common ground to compare different efforts. This paper surveys the metrics that are already used for prognostics in a variety of domains including medicine, nuclear, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. It also considers other domains that involve prediction-related tasks, such as weather and finance. Differences and similarities between these domains and health maintenance have been analyzed to help understand what performance evaluation methods may or may not be borrowed. Further, these metrics have been categorized in several ways that may be useful in deciding upon a suitable subset for a specific application. Some important prognostic concepts have been defined using a notational framework that enables interpretation of different metrics coherently. Last, but not the least, a list of metrics has been suggested to assess critical aspects of RUL predictions before they are fielded in real applications.

Early Detection of Interconnect Degradation Using RF Impedance and SPRT	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Impedance; Interconnection; Prognostics; Reliability; SPRT; Time domain analysis		Many types of electronic products are now operating at higher frequencies or digital bit rates. At high frequencies, signal propagation is concentrated at the surface of interconnects, a phenomenon known as the skin effect. Degradation of interconnects, such as cracking of the solder joints due to fatigue or shock loading, also usually initiates at the surface and propagates inward. Therefore, even a small crack at the surface of an interconnect may change RF impedance and adversely affect the performance of high speed electronic circuits. Traditional methods used to monitor interconnect reliability are based on a measurement of DC resistance. But, more accurate and sensitive alternatives are required for monitoring the reliability of current and future electronic products. RF impedance analysis offers an improved means of sensing interconnect degradation. This study demonstrates the value of RF impedance measurements as an early indicator of physical degradation of solder joints compared to DC resistance measurements. Mechanical fatigue tests have been conducted with an impedance-controlled circuit board on which a surface mount component was soldered. Simultaneous measurements were performed of DC resistance and the time domain reflection coefficient as a measure of RF impedance while the solder joints were stressed. During the test, the RF impedance provided detectable failure precursors by the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), while the DC resistance remained constant with no precursors. Failure analysis revealed that the change in RF impedance resulted from a physical crack that initiated at the surface of the solder joint and propagated only part of the way across the solder joint. These test results indicate that the combination of RF impedance and the SPRT can serve as a non-destructive early indicator of solder joint degradation.

Traditional health monitoring methodologies have relied on reactive methods of failure detection often providing little or no insight into the remaining useful life of the system. In this paper, a mathematical approach for interrogation of system state under cyclic thermo-mechanical stresses has been developed for 6-different leadfree solder alloy systems. Data has been collected for leading indicators of failure for alloy systems including, Sn3Ag0.5Cu, Sn3Ag0.7Cu, Sn1Ag0.5Cu, Sn0.3Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi, Sn0.2Ag0.5Cu0.1Bi0.1Ni, 96.5Sn3.5Ag second-level interconnects under the application of cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. Methodology presented resides in the pre-failure space of the system in which no macro-indicators such as cracks or delamination exist. Systems subjected to thermo-mechanical damage have been interrogated for system state and the computed damage state correlated with known imposed damage. The approach involves the use of condition monitoring devices which can be interrogated for damage proxies at finite time-intervals. Interrogation techniques are based on derivation of damage proxies, and system prior damage based non-linear least-squares methods including the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The system's residual life is computed based on residual-life computation algorithms.

A Multivariate Statistical Analysis Technique for On-Line Fault Prediction	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		condition-based maintenance; fault detection; prognostics; health monitoring		This paper describes a generalized multivariate statistical analysis technique for prediction of impending failures in electronic and electromechanical equipment. This data-driven prognostic technique is useful in health-monitoring situations where equipment physical models are unavailable or of limited fidelity. Statistical analysis algorithms, integrated into a predictive fault detection (PFD) statistical analysis engine, operate on heterogeneous streams of data from sensors that monitor selected equipment structural and functional parameters. The statistical analysis engine processes input data in two stages - similarity testing followed by trend determination. The input stage algorithm extracts multidimensional feature data samples from the arriving sensor data streams. It then performs statistical comparisons of the feature data samples to corresponding feature patterns from equipment considered to be in nominal operating condition. The nominal-condition data may be obtained from equipment specifications, or it may be derived in situ from the sensor data streams. The algorithm maintains a set of scalar similarity metrics for the equipment being monitored, which it periodically compares with pre-computed thresholds. The thresholds may be adaptive, with values typically functions of the amount and variability of the feature data. The trend determination stage is triggered when a threshold value is exceeded. The trend determination algorithm projects trends of feature data from the similarity analysis onto the future. The automatic data trending computation for a given feature is performed by statistically analyzing a window of the feature data. This analysis addresses a collection of different characteristics of a well-fitting trend, which are then fused into a single trend result per data window. The statistical analysis engine applies the trending results to determine the most probable trend, which in the PFD context is related to the requirements for scheduling of equipment maintenance actions.

This paper addresses this problem by integrating several machine learning algorithms. The approach proposed relies on a classification system to determine the likelihood of component failures and to provide rough indications of remaining life. It then introduces clustering and SVM-based local regression to refine the time to failure estimations provided by the classification system. The paper illustrates the applicability of the proposed approach through a real world aerospace application and discusses data pre-processing requirements. The preliminary results show that the proposed method can reduce uncertainty in time to failure estimates, which in turn helps augment the usefulness of prognostics.

Such prediction on the time of loss of functionality is typically done on the basis of measurements of parameters representative of the SSC condition state and degradation process. Uncertainties from two different sources affect the prediction: randomness due to inherent variability in the SSC degradation behavior (aleatory uncertainty) and imprecision due to incomplete knowledge and information on the SSC stress and strength characteristics (epistemic uncertainty). Such uncertainties must be adequately represented and propagated in order for the prognostic results to have operative significance, e.g. in terms of maintenance and renovation decisions. This work illustrates an hybrid Monte Carlo and possibilistic method for the representation and propagation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, with reference to a case study of a component which is randomly degrading in time according to a stochastic fatigue crack growth model of literature. The crack depth is assumed as representative parameter of the component condition state and its limit value beyond which failure occurs is assumed to be affected by epistemic uncertainty, as represented by a possibility distribution.

The most basic methods model the component or system reliability using failure time data and conventional models such as the Weibull. When information pertaining to the operating condition and environmental stressors are available, stress-based techniques can be used. The third type of prognostics is termed effects-based. It is truly an individual based prognostics because it uses information as to how the individual component is affected by the usage condition. This paper presents a summary of the three prognostic types and describes the ongoing development of a MATLAB-based set of tools to facilitate prognostic model development. The application of models of each type is illustrated with the PHM Challenge data set. The paper shows the advantages of identifying a degradation parameter to provide for the use of effects-based prognostics.	[Coble, B.; Hines, J.

Prognostics Using Morphological Signal Processing and Computational Intelligence	2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Computational intelligence; morphological operations; pattern spectrum entropy; prognostics and health management	DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS APPROACH; DAMAGE EVOLUTION TRACKING; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REPRESENTATION; ENTROPY	A procedure is presented for monitoring and prognostics of machine conditions using computational intelligence (CI) techniques. The machine vibration signals are processed using morphological operations to extract an entropy based feature characterizing the signal shape-size complexity for assessment of machine conditions. An evolutionary average entropy of the system is introduced as the 'monitoring index' for prognostics of the system condition. The progression of the 'monitoring index' is predicted using CI techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR). The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark datasets. The prognostic effectiveness of the CI techniques has been illustrated through vibration dataset of a helicopter drivetrain system gearbox. The performances of ANFIS and SVR have been found to be better than RNN for the dataset used. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of damage/degradation and their progression.

These methods typically use threshold values to detect degradation and failures of the electrical interconnect. However, this approach does not consider the physics of failure of the component under test and is not sensitive enough to detect small changes in behavior. This paper presents a physics of failure based methodology that, combined with a sequential probability ratio test, overcomes the issues of the traditional approach. This new approach, called Maxima-SPRT, enables early detection of degradation and provides the information needed for the successful implementation of prognostic tools. The method is validated using an elastomer socket, a daisy chain package, and a test board assembly.

The United States is currently implementing license extensions of 20 years on many plants, and consideration is now being given to the concept of "life-beyond-60," a further period of license extension from 60 to 80 years and potentially longer. In almost all countries with NPPs, authorities are looking at some form of license renewal program. There is a growing urgency as a number of plants face either approvals for license renewal or shut down, which will require deployment of new power plants. In support of NPP license renewal over the past decade, various national and international programs have been initiated. This paper reports part of the work performed in support of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC's) Proactive Management of Materials Degradation (PMMD) program. The paper concisely explains the basic principles of PMMD and its relationship to advanced diagnostics and prognostics and provides an assessment of some the technical gaps in PMMD and prognostics that need to be addressed.

Embedded FPGA based induction motor monitoring system with speed drive fed using multiple wavelet analysis	2008 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL EMBEDDED SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems	JUN 11-13, 2008	La Grande Motte, FRANCE	IEEE		Embedded systems; FPGA; induction motor monitoring; discrete wavelet transform; speed drives		Preventive maintenance on machinery is one of the major concerns in industry. Induction motors represent 85% of the total power consumption in the world and several faults related to these motors that increase the power consumption are not easily detected; therefore, periodic fault monitoring is mandatory. There are several techniques for fault detection in induction motors being current analysis the most popular among others. This techniques are focused on the analysis of induction motors that are directly fed by the line and do not consider the induced effects due to speed drives. The novelty of this research is the proposal of a new technique, based on Discrete Wavelet Tranform for transient analysis at the motor start, for broken rotor bar detection on induction motors fed in both: directly and with speed drive. The contribution of the present work is the development of a Field Programmable Gate Array embedded system implementation of a broken rotor bar on-line monitoring system for a low cost embedded system approach. Results from experimentation show the overall system performance. It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology is efficient to detect the motor faults when directly or speed drive fed.

Especially, the hidden fault is usually easier to discover at engine run up/down. Order tracking is implemented by band pass filter in time frequency domain and time signal of desired order is reconstructed Compared to other existing order analysis methods, this technique is not only more intuitive and more powerful, and can also be applied where rotational speed information is not available. The experimental results show that the method is suitable for vibration response character extraction of rotating machinery.

Fractal dimension can quantitatively describe the non-linear behavior of vibration signal and can be used as features for fault diagnosis. Combining SVM and fractal theory, a novel fault diagnosis method for analog circuits based on SVM using fractal dimension is developed in this paper. Firstly, output voltage signals are obtained from circuit under test (CUT) and corresponding fractal gridding dimensions are calculated which constitutes the fault feature vectors; Subsequently, after training the SVM by faulty feature vectors, the SVM model of the circuit fault diagnosis system is built; Finally, the trained SVM classifier and is used to recognize and classify the unknown faults. Simulation results of diagnosing the Sallen-Key band pass filter circuit have confirmed that the proposed approach increases the fault diagnosis accuracy, thereby it may be considered as an alternative for the analog fault diagnosis.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a new. optimization method, which is motivated by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. The optimization method not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, in the study, the proposed PSO-SVM model is applied to fault diagnosis of turbo-generator, among which PSO is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of this method are validated by the results of fault diagnosis examples. Consequently PSO-SVM is a proper method in fault diagnosis of turbo-generator.

In fact, several neural networks have been applied to the detection of defects. Then, we used a selector which allows activating only one network at a time. In this case, the selected network detects only defects corresponding to the torque developed by asynchronous machine. Finally, the simulation results were presented to show the effectiveness of artificial neural networks for automatic fault diagnosis.

Static and Dynamic Rotor Eccentricity On-Line Detection and Discrimination in Synchronous Generators By No-Load EMF Space Vector Loci Analysis	2008 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POWER ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL DRIVES, AUTOMATION AND MOTION, VOLS 1-3	International Power Electronics Electrical Drives Automation and Motion SPEEDAM		English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion	JUN 11-13, 2008	Ischia, ITALY			Finite element analisys; Matrix of inductances; Rotor air-gap eccentricity fault; Synchronous Generators		In this paper a study about the different effects of static and dynamic rotor eccentricities on the external electric variables of a salient-pole synchronous generator is presented. Air-gap irregularities and related monitoring techniques have been studied in the past mainly about large hydro-generators (with practical applications), but similar problems have been recognized for on-board ship synchronous generators. These latter require a different approach, i.e. non-invasive monitoring. Static and dynamic rotor eccentricities were simulated in this work, for a ship-application sized generator, by using a dynamic model including inductances computed by parametric 3D FEM analysis of the faulty machine. Current, voltage, and no-load e.m.f. steady-state waveforms were analyzed by FFT and space-vector approach. No-load e.m.f. space vector is a sensitive fault indicator since its amplitude largely increases with the level of absolute eccentricity; furthermore, it is possible to discriminate the static eccentricity from the dynamic eccentricity utilizing the space vector loci ovality.

But AE signal of pipeline leak carry the non-stationary feature information. Therefore, one major problem is feature extraction of AE signal from noise and complexity in transmission. This paper analyzes the characteristics of AE signal to acquire effective waveform signal, applies wavelet package to construct and reconstruct signal, extracts feature vectors to set up training sample, and establishes a support vector machines (SVM) fault classifier to diagnosis. Experimental results show that the identification rate can be up to 100% for pipeline leak.

Data contains rich information about the machine, and acquiring knowledge from it or data mining in other words is considered as an effective way solving this problem. An algorithm based on rough set and genetic algorithm for feature reduction is proposed in this paper. Minimal assemble of necessary features i.e. reduct is computed, from which diagnosis rules can be generated. On the base of the rules discovered, an expert system for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is presented. It is a production rule-based expert system developed on CLIPS, and realized together with VC++ programming and SQL SERVER database. To validate the diagnosis system, an experiment is carried out in rotor test-bed and further improvement is pointed out.

An investigation of the behavior of faulty spectral components for different bandwidths of closed loop regulators is therefore necessary in order to evaluate the effectiveness of diagnostic indexes based on those variables. Simulation and experimental results are here presented to show the limits of two different approaches for fault detection. The first one based on current signature analysis and the second one based on rotor voltage signature analysis.

Condition Monitoring of Induction Motors Using Wavelet Based Analysis of Vibration Signals	2008 SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING SYMPOSIA, VOLS 1-5, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking	DEC 13-15, 2008	Hainan, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			MACHINE	Condition monitoring of machines has its roots in the human ECG analysis for detecting cardiac arrhythmias. Condition monitoring in industry is desirable for increasing machinery availability, reducing consequential damage, and improving the operational efficiency. This is very significant in industries that use heavy duty machines for various processes. A monstrous three-phase AC induction motor to drive a city water supply pump or very big, high power motors used in mills, huge generators for generating power in hydel plants etc. depict a few of them. Also,for safety and economic considerations, there is a need to monitor the behavior of motors working in critical production processes as well. This paper demonstrates how the condition Of an induction motor can be monitored by the analysis of the acoustic signal that represents the non-stationary vibration data. The analysis has been done using various signal processing algorithms and a robust fault detection scheme has been developed using the PSD (Power Spectral Density) concept in Wavelet Decomposition.

Among their many programs is the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) for high school aged students. Part of this competition is maintenance of the machine each team develops. To assist us this year and in future years, we developed a system to log every control system data point the robot controller records. Storing this information in a database allows us to review the data following a failure to diagnose the problem. It also give as an additional tool for assessing the robot's performance. In addition, the competition requires teams to ally with partners. For the elimination rounds, where the winners of the competition are decided, teams pick other teams to join them. Knowing the performance of other teams is key in this area. To this end, we developed a system to record team scoring performance along side our internal robot performance system.

This paper aim to set up an efficient and high accuracy model of HGS fault diagnosis by support vector machine (SVM) method. So far as now, the constructing N-class SVMs is still an unsolved research problem. The paper presents a new constructing method (the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine, DDAGSVM) in HGS fault diagnosis at the first time in order to obtain better results. The DDAGSVM operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision node of the DDAG. The last example results show that DDAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evaluate than either standard algorithms (Pairwise, Maxwin) in HGS fault diagnosis, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of algorithms.

The vibration waveform signal is the representation of the condition. If the fault occurs, under certain condition, it is possible that the fault information is not revealed in the vibration waveform, or submerged by other information. Under such circumstance, the fault diagnosis method based on the randomly extractive information of condition can not well differentiate these faults. However, the fault, in any case, is accompanied by some symptoms. Under a condition, the vibration information of the fault may appear decentralized and random, but when the whole process is taken into consideration, the rules stand out To describe the rule of changes in the vibration process, this paper proposes a new diagnosis method based on the process, with the information entropy (IE) matrix as its identification index.

First, the signals are decomposed in arbitrary minute frequency bands by use of wavelet packet analysis technique. Doing energy calculation in these frequency bands to from eigenvectors is more reasonable. And then a least squares support vector machine fault diagnosis model is presented. When the least squares support vector machine is used in fault diagnosis, the Fibonacci symmetry searching algorithm is simplified and improved. It is presented to choose parameter of kernel function on dynamic, which enhances preciseness rate of diagnosis. In the model, the nonsensitive loss function is replaced by quadratic loss function and the inequality constraints are replaced by equality constraints. The simulation results show the model can effectively diagnose machinery facility faults.

The stator current, rotor bar current and the end-ring current are calculated using the model respectively when the motor works at healthy state, one-broken-bar fault and adjacent two-broken-bar fault states. Aiming at the difficulty of determining the forced boundary condition, when traditionally solving the electrical machine stator or rotor temperature field, a two-dimensional model and a finite element model of a stator-rotor coupled temperature field over the whole cross section of a squirrel-cage induction motor are developed. The steady stator-rotor coupled temperature fields of the motor under rated load at the above three conditions are calculated respectively. The temperature rises of the motor operating at three conditions are compared and the influence of the number of broken bars on the motor temperature field is analyzed. The temperature field model can be applied to the temperature field analysis of other induction motors without axial cooling whether they are with healthy rotors or broken bars. The validity of models and the correctness of the calculated values are verified by experimental results derived from a prototype motor. From the variations of the motor electromagnetic field and temperature field, some valuable idea can be proposed to the broken bars fault diagnosis.

Extracting useful information from large text collections is therefore the goal of every organization that would like to take advantage of the experience encapsulated in those texts. Entering data using a free text style is easy, as it does not require any special training. However, unstructured texts pose a major challenge for automatic extraction and retrieval systems. Generally, deep levels of text analysis using advanced and complex linguistic processing are necessary that involve computational linguistic experts and domain experts. Linguistic experts are rare in engineering organizations, which thus find it difficult to apply and exploit such advanced extraction techniques. It is therefore desirable to minimize the extensive involvement of linguist experts by learning extraction patterns automatically from example texts. In doing so, the analysis of given texts is necessary in order to identify the scope and suitable automatic methods. Focusing on causality reasoning in the field of fault diagnosis, the results of experimenting with an automatic causality extraction method using shallow linguistic processing are presented.

The multi-resolution analysis technology is used to acquire the feature vectors which are applied to train and test the neural network. Feature extraction involves preliminary processing of measurements to obtain suitable parameters which reveal weather an interesting pattern is emerging. The feature extraction technique is needed for preliminary processing of recorded time-series vibrations over a long period of time to obtain suitable parameters. The neural network parameters are determined by means of the recursive orthogonal least squares algorithm. In network training procedure, much simulation and practical samples are utilized to verify and test the network performance. And according to the output result, the fault pattern can be recognized. The actual applications show that the method is effective for detection and diagnosis of rotating machine fault and the experiment result is correct.

Tool wear often results in chaotics on milling process. Little research has been carried out about the occurrence and detection of chaotic behavior in time series signal of tool vibration. In the paper the vibration acceleration signal based on the operating stages of tool wear is established for the analysis of the correlation dimension of the operating stages of tool wear. Correlation dimension is calculated to recognize the tool wear operating conditions. Finally some experimental results from the fractal characteristic show that there are distinct differences in the correlation dimension in different tool wear conditions and close the correlation dimension in same tool wear conditions. The correlation dimension not only can be used as important scientific basis for monitoring tool wear, but also complement of other characteristic picking up method.

Vehicle driven by operator may be considered as control system with driver as a controller and vehicle as controlled system. Driver efficiency depends on situation on the road, vehicle characteristic and psychical and physical driver features. The state space model of human operator formulation uses Pade approximations to model the time delays inherent in the human operator. Driver is included in road-vehicle driver system as feedback element. Parameters describing drives behaviour could be identified based on system model in frequency domain (from transmissibility) or in time domain (from correlation). The paper presents initial conception taking into consideration driver working in the tractor agricultural machine set model.

Monitoring rotating machinery is often accomplished with the aid of vibration sensors. Transforming this information into useful knowledge about the health of the machine can be challenging due to the presence of extraneous noise sources and variations in the vibration signal itself. This paper describes applying vibration theory to detect machinery fault, via the measurement of vibration and voice monitoring machinery working condition, also proposes a useful way of vibration analysis and source identification in complex machinery. An actual experiment case study has been conducted on a mill machine. The experiment results indicate that fewer sensors and less measurement and analysis time can achieve condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and damage forecasting. Further applications allow feedback to the process control on production line.

This paper analyses the merits and flaws of the existing transformer-fault-diagnosis methods, and then utilizes SVC (Support Vector Classification), one of branches of SVM (Support Vector Machine) which has many advantages like great generalization, effectively avoiding "over-learning" and being able to learn from small scale sample, to analyze transformers dissolved gas. Because of the nonlinear classification relationship between DGA and fault diagnosis, this paper unifies the DGA data, selects proper kernel function, solution, and parameters, formulates the SVC with best effect, sets up a two-floor fault diagnosis tree, and ultimately builds the transformer-fault-diagnosis model. Through the self-test and comparison with Three Ratio Method as well as BP neural network, it is improved that the model built in this paper remarkably enhances the accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis.

The ability to accurately predict the "health" or remaining useful life of the cryocooler has significant benefits from the viewpoint of ensuring that mission critical functions can be carried out with a high probability of success. The paper provides an overview and approaches used for the development of a Cryocooler Prognostic Health Management System (CPHMS) capable of assessing the cryocooler "health" from the viewpoint of the level of performance degradation and/or the potential for near term failure. Additionally, it quantifies the reliable remaining useful life of the cryocooler. While the proposed system is focused on the specific application to linear drive cryocoolers, especially for DoD, many of the attributes of the system can be applied to other specialized system hardware in both commercial and U.S. Government agency for situations where it is critical that all aspects of the hardware "health" and "remaining useful life" be fully understood. Several benefits of the health monitoring system are also described in the paper.

This paper propose a sequential fuzzy diagnosis method for condition monitoring of a rolling bearing used in a centrifugal blower by the possibility theory and a neural network. The possibility theory is used for solving the ambiguous problem of the fault diagnosis. The neural network is realized with a developed back propagation neural network. As input data for a neural network, the non-dimensional symptom parameters are also defined in time domain. Fault types of a rolling bearing can be effectively, sequentially distinguished oil the basis of the possibilities of the normal state and abnormal states at early stage by the fuzzy diagnosis approach. Practical examples of diagnosis are shown in order to verify the efficiency of the method.

Mexican hat wavelet kernel is intruded to enhance Kernel-PCA nonlinear mapping capability. The experimental data sets of rotor working under four conditions: normal, oil whirling. rub and unbalance are used to test the WKPCA method. The feature reduction results of WKPCA are compared with that of PCA method and KPCA method. The results indicate that WKPCA can classify the rotor fault type efficiently.

We have used an advanced and adapted version of the MIMO model (U. Karlsruhe, Germany) which is a sophisticated CFD model, to simulate the air concentrations at urban level with 10 m spatial resolution over the city of Las Palmas (Canary Islands, Spain). The CFD code receives the traffic emission data every second produced by a cellular automata model (CAMO). The integrated CFD model is called MICROSYS. This model is an Eulerian 3D tool which is running in diagnostic mode once every minute. The boundary conditions are obtained from the well-known MM5-CMAQ running over the city in prognostic mode. The MM5-CMAQ (OPANA V4) model is run with I km spatial resolution covering a domain of 16 x 16 km over the city. This system is operating in forecasting mode since 2004 and is operated over the Internet. The forecasting information for meteorology and air quality concentrations for the following 72 hours is used by MICROSYS to simulate the expected air concentrations at street level for the next three days. The system operates under daily basis and produces the detailed forecasting information at 6:00 GMT everyday. The Internet service includes a sophisticated VRML (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) tool to visualize in a 3D mode the air concentrations at street level by an Internet client. The VRML tool runs on the client server. We present also some comparative results related to the use of shared 64 bits memory machines and single 32 bits one-processor machines for CFD runs.

Particularly, uncertain failure thresholds in cumulative damage models are of primary interest in this study. Many degradation-based reliability approaches make use of a predefined deterministic value of the failure threshold. However, in real-world cases, the designer may not be aware of the precise critical degradation level. In such situations it is suitable to define the critical degradation level as a range of values having certain probabilities of being critical. If no prior information is available regarding the failure threshold; the critical value has to be estimated from experimental reliability data that are subject to uncertainty due to imperfect measurements and random deviations in reliability properties of the tested components. In these circumstances, it is desirable to model the critical threshold as a random variable. Otherwise, the model can be oversimplified since it neglects the failure threshold uncertainty, whose influence onto the reliability prediction can be significant. This paper presents uncertainty analysis regarding how variability in the failure threshold affects the reliability prediction in conjunction with cumulative damage models. Three types of cumulative damage models are investigated; these are a Markov chain-based model, a linear path degradation model, and a Wiener process with drift. Closed-form equations quantifying the threshold uncertainty propagation into the model prediction are given. A numerical example is presented to illustrate how the critical threshold uncertainty reshapes the predicted time-to-failure distribution, supporting the need for considering the critical threshold uncertainty in accurate reliability computations.

Nonparametric Model-Based Prognostics	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM, 2008 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	54th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium	JAN 28-31, 2008	Las Vegas, NV			Nonparametric regression; empirical modeling; prognostics		Equipment, process, and system prognostic techniques can be classified as belonging to one of three major classes of methods: 1) conventional reliability-based using failure times (Weibull), 2) population based with environmental considerations (e.g. proportional hazards modeling), and 3) individual based (e.g. general path model). A new individual-based prognostic algorithm, termed the path classification and estimation (PACE) model, has been developed and is based entirely on failure data. This model recasts the general path model (GPM), which is the foundation of the majority of the modem individual based prognosis algorithms, as a classification problem, where a current device's degradation path is classified according to a series of exemplar paths and the results of the classification are used to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the device. The requirement of the existence of a failure threshold is removed, thereby enabling the PACE to be applied to "real world" systems, where a single failure threshold is not likely to occur. If the failure threshold is known, simple formatting may be applied to the degradation paths such that they can be easily used with the PACE. The newly proposed method was applied to data collected from the hydraulic steering system of a drill used for deep oil exploration with the objective of detecting, diagnosing, and prognosing faults. The PACE was used to predict the RUL for several failure modes using actual data. For this work, a three tiered architecture was implemented, where conventional reliability methods were used to estimate the population-based RUL, PACE population-based prognosers were trained to map the cause of a failure mode to the RUL, and PACE individual prognosers were trained to map the effects of a failure mode to the RUL. It was found that the population based prognoser produced RUL estimates with large errors (75 hours) and uncertainties (261 hours). The individual prognosers were found to significantly outperform the population based prognoser, with errors ranging from 1.2 to 11.4 hours with 95% confidence intervals ranging from 0.67 to 32.02 hours.

This method permits in-situ assessment of system reliability under actual application conditions. The method uses sensor data with models that enable in-situ assessment of the deviation or degradation of a product from an expected normal operating condition (i.e., the system's "health") and the prediction of the future state of reliability. The implementation procedure of this approach includes failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis, data reduction and feature extraction from the life-cycle loads, damage accumulation, and assessment of uncertainty.

The study includes stable condition and speed transients in simulation and realistic experimental conditions. The stator current is analyzed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, which will generate a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Finally, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is used to compute the instantaneous frequencies resulting from the IMFs obtained from the stator currents. Moreover, the IMF 1 and IMF 2 have been analyzed by means of Wigner Ville distribution (WVD). Experimental laboratory results validate the analysis and demonstrate that this kind of time-frequency analysis can be applied to detect and identify short circuit failures in synchronous machines.

Fault analysis of non-uniform airgap length in frictionless linear induction motor drive	APEC 2008: TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL IEEE APPLIED POWER ELECTRONICS CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-4	Annual IEEE Conference on Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC 2008)	FEB 24-28, 2008	Austin, TX	IEEE				Application of linear induction machines (LIM) for electric propulsion have been investigated intensively in the past few decades. The advantages of LIM as applied in the propulsion system include easy maintenance, high acceleration/deceleration, and low cost to name a few. One of the active areas of research is aimed at combining the LIM with magnetically levitated system (Maglev) to achieve frictionless transportation system. Maintaining a uniform airgap is a prime goal in development of such system. Therefore timely detection of non-uniform airgap is an important task in this family of transportation systems. Using an experimental LIM and with the help of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), effect of non-uniform airgap length on the force and magnetic characteristics of LIM has been explored. Furthermore, the detection method for this type of fault has been developed to monitor airgap length of LIM for high speed frictionless propulsive applications.

The accuracy of these techniques depends on the loading conditions of the machine, the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectral components being examined, and the ability to maintain a constant speed. This paper presents a method for induction motor rotor fault diagnosis using wavelet analysis with higher signal to noise ratio under varying load conditions. It also includes an interactive technique to detect broken rotor bar in varying load conditions. The fault severity is derived by wavelet analysis of single-phase active one-cycle average power. Wavelet allows analyzing non-stationary waveform and one-cycle average power allows detecting fault characteristic frequency component under low load conditions without removing the fundamental component. Finally, the proposed method is verified from the experimental results of two induction motors with different configurations.

The proposed FAMDDA model is a conflict-resolving classifier that can perform stable and incremental learning while settling overlapping of hyper-rectangular prototypes of different classes in minimizing misclassification rates. The performance of FAMDDA is evaluated using a number of benchmark data sets. The results are analyzed and compared with those from FAM and a number of machine learning classifiers. The outcomes show that FAMDDA has a better generalization capability than FAM, and its performance is comparable with those from other classifiers. The effectiveness of FAMDDA is also demonstrated in an application pertaining to condition monitoring of a circulating water system in a power generation station.

Surya Prakasa			Artificial neural network approach for fault detection in rotary system	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						fault detection; neural networks; back propagation; adaptive resonance theory; rotary system	DIAGNOSIS	The detection and diagnosis of faults in technical systems are of great practical significance and paramount importance for the safe operation of the plant. An early detection of faults may help to avoid product deterioration, performance degradation, major damage to the machinery itself and damage to human health or even loss of lives. The centrifugal pumping rotary system is considered for this research. This paper presents the development of artificial neural network-based model for the fault detection of centrifugal pumping system. The fault detection model is developed by using two different artificial neural network approaches, namely feed forward network with back propagation algorithm and binary adaptive resonance network ( ART1). The training and testing data required are developed for the neural network model that were generated at different operating conditions, including fault condition of the system by real-time simulation through experimental model. The performance of the developed back propagation and ART1 model were tested for a total of seven categories of faults in the centrifugal pumping system. The results are compared and the conclusions are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Santosh			Artificial intelligence-based condition monitoring for plant maintenance	ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION			English	Article						artificial intelligence; deductive databases; condition monitoring		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain the development and testing of a condition-monitoring sub-module of an integrated plant maintenance management application based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, mainly knowledge-based systems, having several modules, submodules and sections. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is applicable to general purpose machinery. A maintenance knowledge base is developed from published information on maintenance management like handbooks, journals, conference proceedings, because of difficulty in accessing expert knowledge and information on actual machine problems, from experts in maintenance management. The knowledge-based engine comprises intelligent algorithms and software-generated pop-ups/alerts/alarms predictive tools. The expert system on an off-line basis, on a failure in the plant's machinery or deterioration in performance, will trigger fault diagnosis to detect the reason and give immediate advice to the maintenance group. Findings - Knowledge-based intelligent machine troubleshooting/maintenance software enables maintenance technicians to refer to custom-made, ready-to-use and easily upgradable maintenance software. Its benefits include: reduction in machine down-time, reduction in skill level for maintenance activities, ease of maintenance, speedy response and affordable cost. The paper collectively deals with the analysis of the state-of-the-art expert systems for diagnosis and maintenance of general-purpose industrial machinery. Research limitations/implications - The software is essentially for general purpose industrial machinery (stand-alone type) applications. For continuously operating machinery, the software has to be altered to accommodate continuous data through strategically mounted sensors. Practical implications - Knowledge based, ready-to-use, custom-built, maintenance management software application having many modules and sub-modules on various aspects of modern maintenance practices has direct application for shopfloor maintenance. Originality/value - A part of fully-fledged maintenance management application based on Al principles is discussed in the present paper. its benefits include: use of latest methodology - Al techniques for maintenance field, ready-to-install condition, vast and immediate access to maintenance management information, user-friendly and interactive modules, easily upgradable features for the application.

Evolutionary algorithm for feature subset selection in predicting tumor outcomes using microarray data	BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications	MAY 06-09, 2008	Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA		Georgia State Univ		GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; BREAST-CANCER; REDUCTION; SIGNATURE	Feature subset selection for outcome prediction is a critical issue in large scale microarray experiments in cancer research. This paper introduces an integrative approach that combines significant gene expression analysis, the genetic algorithm and machine learning for selecting informative gene markers and for predicting tumor outcomes including survival outcomes. In case of survival data, full use of individual's survival information (both censored and uncensored) is made in selecting informative genes for survival outcome prediction. Applications of our method to published microarray data on epithelial ovarian cancer survival and breast cancer metastasis have identified prognostic genes that predict individual survival and metastatic outcomes with improved power while basing on considerably shorter gene lists.

Delayed recovery of cardiovascular autonomic function after mitral valve surgery - Evidence for direct trauma?	BIOSIGNALS 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-INSPIRED SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL II			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Bio-Inspired Systems and Signal Processing	JAN 28-31, 2008	Funchal, PORTUGAL	Inst Syst & Technol Informat, Control & Commun, Univ Madeira, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Special Interest Grp Artificial Intelligence, Assoc Adv Artificial Intelligence		biosignal processing; baroreflex response; surgery		Baroreflex Sensivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV) have significant influence on the patients' prognosis after cardiovascular events. The following study was performed to assess the differences in the postoperative recovery of the autonomic regulation after mitral valve (MV) surgery and aortic valve (AV) surgery with heart-lung machine. 43 consecutive male patients were enrolled in a prospective study; 26 underwent isolated aortic valve surgery and 17 isolated mitral valve surgery. Blood pressure, ECG and respiratory rate were recorded the day before, 24h after surgery and one week after surgery. BRS was calculated according to the Dual Sequence Method, time and frequency parameters of HRV were calculated using standard methods. There were no major differences between the two groups in the preoperative values. At 24 h a comparable depression of HRV and BRS in both groups was observed, while at 7 days there was partial recovery in AV-patients, which was absent in MV-patients: p (AV vs. MV)<0,001. While the response of the autonomic system to surgery is similar in AV- and MV-patients, there obviously is a decreased ability to recover in MV-patients, probably attributing to traumatic lesions of the autonomic nervous system by opening the atria. Ongoing research is required for further clarification of the pathophysiology of this phenomenon and to establish strategies to restore autonomic function.

HT-RLS: High-Throughput web tool for analysis of DNA microarray data using RLS classifiers	CCGRID 2008: EIGHTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CLUSTER COMPUTING AND THE GRID, VOLS 1 AND 2, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE-ACM International Symposium on Cluster Cloud and Grid Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid	MAY 19-22, 2008	Lyon, FRANCE	IEEE			CANCER	Gene expression from DNA microarray data offers biologists and pathologists the possibility to deal with the problem of disease (e.g. cancer) diagnosis and prognosis from a quantitative point of view. Microarray data provide a snapshot of the molecular status of a sample of cells in a given tissue, returning the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Several mathematical methods from learning theory, such as Regularized Least Squares (RLS) classifiers or Support Vector Machines (SVM), have been extensively adopted to classify gene expression data. These methods can be useful to answer some relevant questions such as 1) what is the right amount of data to build an accurate classifier? 2) How many and which genes are correlated with a specific pathology? The computational analysis to statistically estimate the accuracy of the chosen models is particularly time consuming, burning several days of CPU time and without high-throughput or high-performance tools becomes practically unfeasible to obtain results in a reasonable time for biomedical community. We have implemented an independent, flexible and scalable platform, for a high-throughput large-scale microarray gene expression data analysis and classification, based on R tool for statistical computing. It integrates databases and computational intensive algorithms, based on RLS classifiers and a powerful web client for data training and graphical visualization of predicted results. Our platform provides statistically significant answers to the study of the gene expression by means of microarray data and supplying useful information to relevant questions in the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases in a reasonable time. The web resource is available free of charge for academic and non-profit institutions.	[De Meo, P.

Degradation state model-based prognosis for proactively maintaining product performance	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						maintenance; failure model; prognosis	MAINTENANCE; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM	Maintenance plays now a critical role in manufacturing for achieving important cost-savings and competitive advantage while preserving product conditions. It suggests moving from conventional maintenance practices to predictive strategy. indeed the maintenance action has to be clone at the right time according the component Remaining Useful Live (RUL) assessed by a prognosis process. The accuracy of the RUL is mainly depending on the relevance of the component degradation model used for prediction. In that way, this paper aims at discussing an efficient degradation model taking into account the operational conditions, the health monitoring and the maintenance actions. This model is based on discrete states associated with the degradation levels, and on a cumulative function modelling the transition time between successive states. The model is implemented by means of Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN). The feasibility and added value of such degradation models for prognosis is then highlighted through experimentations made on manufacturing TELMA platform. (c) 2008 CIRP.

The normalized pattern spectrum is defined by morphological openings and closings. The comparability of two kind, of pattern spectrum is measured by a similarity coefficient. Through computing similarity coefficient, the pattern identification is accomplished Analysis results show that normalized pattern spectrum has distinct advantages: no sensitive to image locality, image reversal, image scale. Shape representation of axis orbit is one of the most important methods on fault diagnosis of rotating machine. It is verified that axis orbits, with certain morphological processing before computing the normalized pattern spectrum, can be recognized effectively.

Based on the multi-resolution feature and time-frequency localization feature of Wavelet Transform, a method to extract fault characteristic signals by decomposing them into corresponding time-frequency segmentations is presented. The noise is attenuated, and the characteristic signals are amplified since of the different singularity feature in Wavelet Transform. At the time-frequency segmentations including higher order harmonic frequencies of fault vibration signals, the incipient fault characteristics are extracted efficaciously. The fault signals are denoised further more by a wavelet fuzzy threshold denoising constructed. Higher SNR is gained compared to traditional denoising methods. And the legible time and frequencies fault emerging of characteristic signals are extracted, which can be used to diagnose the position and fault degree combined with the energy of branch reconstruction of fault characteristic signals.

Signal singularities can be characterized by its wavelet transforms modulus. Real wavelets are generally adopted in analysis. In fact, analytic wavelet transform (AWT) only reflects positive frequencies of signal and its modulus oscillation is weaker than real wavelet transform (RWT), so signal singularities can be detected more accurately. Singularities detection and de-noise based AWT are applied to vibration signals of running machines. Signals are analyzed by this method sampled under several conditions in a main reducer performance test bed developed by us. Experiment results show that singularity detection using the modulus maximum of an analytic wavelet is better than that of a real wavelet. The fault feature can be distinguished from the reconstructing signals more easily, which makes for fault features extraction.

Attenuation of magnetic field components through an AC machine stator	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						measurement; electric machines; magnetism		Purpose - Non-intrusive magnetic measurements in AC machines are possible with small flat coils stuck on the external surface of the housing of a running motor. The aim of the paper consists in determining transmission coefficients able to give a direct relationship between the weak external flux density and the airgap one. Design/methodology/approach - An experimental approach shows that the decoupling principle can be applied. Transmission coefficients are determined separately for the stator yoke, the motor housing and the external air. Findings - For low frequencies and a housing made of steel, eddy current can be neglected. The transmission coefficient depends strongly of the mode (number of poles) of the rotating field. Conversely, for higher harmonic ranks, the additional attenuation caused by eddy currents in the housing does not practically depend on the mode but is strongly dependant on the frequency. Research limitations/implications - The transmission coefficients are determined considering a 2D electromagnetic model and several simplifying hypothesis. Experiments prove the validity of the proposed approach up to 550 Hz. Practical implications - Up to now, many fault detection systems are based on the presence of additional harmonics in the external magnetic field spectrum. With the knowledge of simple transmission coefficients, an analysis of the variation of the magnitude of critical spectrum lines is now possible for a more precise fault detection in AC machines. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the only alternative way for the interpretation of external field measurements consist in using a numerical method with a full model of the machine which takes a lot of computation time. The proposed transmission coefficients provide a faster method valid for most of the interesting spectrum lines.

Design/methodology/approach - The machine is modeled by using classical two-axis theory, and the equations are modified to take into account the stator inter-turn faults. A state space form of the system is presented for dynamic simulations. Findings - The machine model is global and can work in both normal and fault conditions due to a fictitious resistance in the winding circuit. Various simulation results have been presented indicating the fault instant and its corresponding effect. Validation is carried out by transient time finite element simulations. Originality/value - The model can serve as a step towards development of fault detection and diagnosis algorithms.

To better understand these requirements, we leverage a decision-making framework, composed by the cross product of the decision's time horizon and domain knowledge used by SC models. We use this framework to analyze how SC is used to perform anomaly detection, anomaly identification, failure mode analysis (diagnostics), estimation of remaining useful life (prognostics), on-board control, and off board logistics actions. We illustrate this concept with a case study in anomaly detection, based on different SC technologies.

Since then, many studies have explored different issues concerning FAM optimization, training and evaluation, e. g., model sensitivity to parameters, ordering strategy for the presentation of the training patterns, training method and method of predicting the classification accuracy. Other studies have suggested variants to FAM to improve its generalization capability or overcome the prime limitation of the model, which is category proliferation (i.e., model complexity that increases with data complexity). Category proliferation is pronounced in problems that are noisy or contain a large degree of class statistical overlapping. In many investigations, FAM was improved by incorporating elements of optimization theory, Bayes' decision theory, evolutionary learning, and cluster analysis. Due to its appealing characteristics, FAM and its variants have been applied extensively and successfully to real-world classification problems. Numerous applications were reported in, for example, the processing of signals from different sources, images, speech, and text; recognition of speakers, image objects, handwritten, and genetic abnormalities; and medical and fault diagnoses. When compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, FAM and its variants showed superior speed and ease of training, and in most cases they delivered comparable classification accuracy.

A comparison between Hybrid and Non-Hybrid classifiers in diagnosis of induction motor faults	CSE 2008:11TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering	JUL 16-18, 2008	Sao Paulo, BRAZIL	IEEE Comp Soc, TCSC, IEEE, Univ Sao Paulo, ICMC				Induction machines (IMs) play a essential role in industry and there is a strong demand for their reliable and safe operation. IMs are susceptible to problems such as stator current imbalance and broken bars, usually detected when the equipment is already broken, and sometimes after irreversible damage has occurred. Condition monitoring can significantly reduce maintenance costs and the risk of unexpected failures through the early detection of potential risks. Several techniques are used to classify the condition of machines. This paper presents a new case study on Hybrid and Non-Hybrid classifiers in on-line condition monitoring of induction motors. Advantages of the system include improved performer of fault classification. The database was developed through a simplified mathematical model of the machine considering the effects caused by asymmetries in the phase impedances of motors. A comparative analysis is presented for simulation using single classifiers (based on the neural networks, k-Nearest neighbor and Naive Bayes), Non-Hybrid classifiers (based on the Bagging and Boosting) and Hybrid (Stacking) approaches. Results demonstrate that the Non-Hybrid systems obtain the better results in comparison with the individual experiments.

Tasks were added to verify continuing correct operation of this central processing unit (CPU) under margin testing for supply voltage, ambient temperature, and clock frequency. Finally, an on-orbit diagnostic task was added so that any malfunctions of LOLA in lunar orbit can be identified as faults in, or not in, the CPU. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft will be launched to the Moon in 2009 with six scientific instruments including LOLA, each containing an embedded microprocessor to perform real-time subsystem control calculations. LOLA's CPU is a small, custom-designed processor, designed to meet the mission requirements while minimizing resources. This 8-bit machine is essentially code compatible with Intel's 8085 but is implemented in modem technology, an advanced, radiation-hardened 0.15 mu m gate array, with the only logic element types being a 4:1 multiplexor and a flip-flop. This paper explains the fundamental structure of the verification task, shows how particular instructions are verified, presents a high-coverage scheme for detecting inadvertent RAM alteration, describes subsystem testing of RAM, and reviews the results of the verification effort. Some infamous CPU design flaws from both the commercial industry and aerospace flight control systems are discussed.

Nonlinear knowledge in kernel machines	DATA MINING AND MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING	CRM Proceedings & Lecture Notes		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Data Mining and Mathematical Programming	OCT 10-13, 2006	Montreal, CANADA	CRM			BREAST-CANCER DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSIS	We give a unified presentation of recent work in applying prior knowledge to nonlinear kernel approximation [26] and nonlinear kernel classification [25]. In both approaches, prior knowledge over general nonlinear sets is incorporated into nonlinear kernel approximation or classification problems as linear constraints in a linear program. The key tool in this incorporation is a theorem of the alternative for convex functions that converts nonlinear prior knowledge implications into linear inequalities without the need to kernelize these implications. Effectiveness of the proposed approximation formulation is demonstrated on two synthetic examples as well as an important lymph node metastasis prediction problem arising in breast cancer prognosis. Effectiveness of the proposed classification formulation is demonstrated on two publicly available datasets, including a breast cancer prognosis dataset. Upon the introduction of prior knowledge, all these problems exhibit marked improvements over nonlinear kernel approximation and classification approaches that do not utilize such knowledge.

While the DMI is required to operate in a critical context, current DMIs have no safety requirements. This implies that the EVC may automatically stop the train whenever the DMI is suspected to misbehave, leading to delay of the train, inconvenience for passengers and consequent possible profit loss. For these reasons a DMI with higher safety requirements is worth to be taken into account, even if it implies higher costs. The SAFEDMI European project aims at developing (i) a DMI at Safety Integrity Level 2 (SIL 2) using off-the-shelf components and a simple hardware architecture to reduce costs, and (ii) a SIL 2 wireless communication support for maintenance. This paper describes the architecture of a DMI which satisfies these objectives. The main hardware and software characteristics will be shown, including the proposed error detection techniques and the related fault handling (characterized by a new operational mode that allows DMI to restart silently, thus reducing unexpected train stops).

Modulation and non-stationary existing in the signal generated by a faulty gearbox presents challenges to effective fault detection. In order to study the phenomenon of gear wearing, the vibration of a gearbox in a transmission shaft is measured by the order tracking method. Order tracking has the ability to detect the fault issue of gear wearing. Measured results indicate characteristic parameters of gear wearing. And compared with the tradition spectral analysis, the advantages of order tracking were presented in the paper. These measured data and analyzed results were the important guidance in the dynamic design, modification and operation management of transmission box.

The proposed approach first divides the matrix of wavelet coefficients into clusters that are centered around the discriminative coefficient positions identified by an unsupervised procedure based on the entropy value of coefficients from a set of representative signals. The features that contain the informative attributes of the signals are computed from the energy content of so obtained clusters. Then machine faults are diagnosed based on these feature vectors using a neural network. The experimental results from the application on bearing fault diagnosis have shown that the proposed approach is able to effectively extract important intrinsic information content of the test signals, and increase the overall fault diagnostic accuracy as compared to conventional methods.

Prognostic strategies can assist to detect, classify and predict developing faults, guarantee reliable, efficient and continuous operation of electric plants, and may even result in saving lives. In this paper, a recurrent neural network based strategy was developed for blade material degradation assessment and fatigue damage propagation prediction. Two Elman Neural Networks were developed for fatigue severity assessment and trend prediction correspondingly. The performance of the proposed prognostic methodology was evaluated by using blade material fatigue data collected from a material testing system. The prognostic method is found to be a reliable and robust material fatigue predictor.	[Yan, J.

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based oil measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the trees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%.

Wavelet-based fault classification scheme for a transmission line using a support vector machine	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						two-terminal transmission line; wavelet transform; support vector machine; feature extraction; fault classification accuracy; ground index	NEURAL-NETWORK; PROTECTION; TRANSFORM; LOCATION	This article presents a new approach for fault classification in a two-terminal overhead transmission line using a support vector machine classifier. Wavelet transform is used for the decomposition of measured signals and for extraction of the most significant features (feature extraction), which facilitates training of the SVM, particularly in terms of getting better classification performance (high accuracy). After extracting useful features from the measured signals, a decision of fault or no-fault on any phase or multiple phases of a transmission line is carried out using three SVM classifiers. The ground detection task is carried out by a proposed ground index. Two kernel functionspolynomial and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)have been used, and performances of classifiers have been evaluated based on fault classification accuracy. In order to determine the optimal parametric settings of an SVM classifier (such as the type of kernel function, its associated parameter, and the regularization parameter C), five-fold cross-validation has been applied to the training set. It is observed that an SVM with an RBF kernel provides better fault classification accuracy than that of an SVM with polynomial kernel. One of the key points of this article is the development of an automatic fault data generation model using PSCAD and its application for training and testing of SVMs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, extensive simulations have been carried out for different fault conditions with wide variations in the operating conditions and source impedances. It has been found that the proposed scheme is very fast and accurate, and it proved to be a robust classifier for digital distance protection.	[Bhalja, Bhavesh; Maheshwari, R.

This is primarily because complete prevention of all degradation of industrial materials is not possible, at least not in a realistic way. Consequently it is extremely important to detect degradation before machines start to loose their ability to function which may lead to harmful failures. Usually there is some kind of significant interval between the start of material degradation and failure; in other words, degradation usually progresses slowly with time. The problem is whether we can detect precursors of failure in the interval or not. If it is possible, we can have economic as well as safety related benefits because we are able to stop the machine before a functional failure and prevent an accident initiated by the failure of the machine. The benefits are not restricted to the nuclear power industry because it can be applied to any other heavy industry. There are many reasons why many conferences, such as ENDE, have been established to discuss and promote the progress of nondestructive inspection techniques. Whereas nondestructive inspection plays an important role in maintaining structural integrity and the performance of nondestructive inspection techniques should be enhanced in that sense, we need to regard it as one of several components composing "maintenance engineering." Moreover, although nondestructive inspection is a proactive measure of maintenance, it is not a predictive tool. In fact, it is effective for detecting existing defects and does not say anything about the temporal evolution of defects. On the other hand, a condition monitoring system can offer significantly more useful information as mentioned above. In this paper I would like to introduce the concept of maintenology as a new science and technology in contrast to conventional maintenance engineering and to present several important results on electromagnetic maintenance for nuclear power plants as condition monitoring techniques (CMT). In particular, the introduction of electromagnetic maintenance is expected to play a very promising role in abnormality predictions of many dynamic machines that are required to be inspected regularly by law. Application of the technique would change conventional wisdom in thinking that machines should be taken apart and inspected regularly based on regulations. In many cases, this TBM (time based maintenance) is not too conservative in achieving an optimal maintenance approach.

Data base comprises of Vibration and Acoustic Emission raw data obtained on site in a non intrusive way and follow up inspection data records in order to allow correlate particular faults with certain signal characteristics. The application of cepstrum filtering in raw Vibration data reveals certain signal characteristics suitable for accurate predictive maintenance purposes. Moreover, the use of kurtosis is introduced in fault characterization of raw Acoustic Emission data as a tool for health monitoring purposes and a timing signal per stroke of reciprocating machinery.									*AE WATT, GRD2200150014 AEWATT; KERKYRAS SC, 2003, 3 INT C EM TECHN NDT; KORN GA, 1968, MATH STAT MATH HDB S, P671; LYON RH, 1987, ASME WINT ANN M BOST; LYON RH, 1988, J SOUND VIBRATIO SEP; *RECIP AE, BE963491 RECIPAE	6	0	0	0	0	TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	LONDON	11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND			978-0-415-46476-5	PROC MONOGR ENG WATE			2008							171	175					5	Materials Science, Characterization & Testing	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Materials Science	BJN78	WOS:000266872100025					2022-02-14

However, the trend is to further analyse these data to take into account the aging and damage accumulation in order to better assess the reliability of the monitored systems, depending of their real environmental life profile. Thus, the aim is to make a diagnostic or health status of the systems and evaluate their remaining life for a predictive maintenance. This paper shows that normalized or standardized Life Assessment Monitoring Systems (LAMS) may be developed and used for very different applications of onboard and real-time PHM (Prognostics Health Management) approaches. The goal is to make use of common electronic components: microcontroller, memories and sensors. However, dedicated embedded software has been developed for environmental data computations to predict the life expectancy of systems. These LAMSs can use field return results or simulation results to make electronic prognostics, assess the length of cracks in hidden metallic structures or track the progression of a moving system with a GPS module and send regular reports and warnings by SMS through a GSM module.

J	Cheng, JS; Yu, DJ; Yang, Y				Cheng, Junsheng; Yu, Dejie; Yang, Yu			A fault diagnosis approach for gears based on IMF AR model and SVM	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HILBERT SPECTRUM; DECOMPOSITION; AMPLITUDE; SIGNALS	An accurate autoregressive (AR) model can reflect the characteristics of a dynamic system based on which the fault feature of gear vibration signal can be extracted without constructing mathematical model and studying the fault mechanism of gear vibration system, which are experienced by the time-frequency analysis methods. However, AR model can only be applied to stationary signals, while the gear fault vibration signals usually present nonstationary characteristics. Therefore, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which can decompose the vibration signal into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), is introduced into feature extraction of gear vibration signals as a preprocessor before AR models are generated. On the other hand, by targeting the difficulties of obtaining sufficient fault samples in practice, support vector machine (SVM) is introduced into gear fault pattern recognition. In the proposed method in this paper, firstly, vibration signals are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions, then the AR model of each IMF component is established; finally, the corresponding autoregressive parameters and the variance of remnant are regarded as the fault characteristic vectors and used as input parameters of SVM classifier to classify the working condition of gears. The experimental analysis results show that the proposed approach, in which IMF AR model and SVM are combined, can identify working condition of gears with a success rate of 100% even in the case of smaller number of samples.

These measurements are represented by the expression levels of thousands of genes in normal and tumor sample tissues. In this paper we present a two-phase algorithm for gene expression data classification. In the first phase, a novel gene selection method based on mixed-integer optimization is applied with the aim of selecting a small subset of cancer marker genes. In the second phase, a binary polyhedral classifier is used in order to label gene expression data. Computational experiments performed on three benchmark datasets indicate the usefulness of the proposed framework which is capable of competitive performances with respect to the best classification accuracy so far achieved for each dataset. Moreover, the classification rules generated are based on very few genes which, in our computations, can be credited as the most influential genes for tumor differentiation.

As vibration analysis in condition monitoring is still generally performed by highly trained professionals, the use of expert systems would allow a greater analysis throughput as well as enabling technicians to perform routine analysis. The development of an expert system for vibration analysis of fixed plant is discussed, as well as laboratory and industry testing. Unique to existing developments, the expert system incorporates triaxial and demodulated frequency and time domain vibration data analysis algorithms for high accuracy fault detection. The tests confirm the potential value of the expert system for both laboratory and on-site maintenance departments of large manufacturing and mineral processing plants.

Thus, it is very important and necessary to monitor and diagnose the running conditions and the faults of the hydro turboset for the safe and normal running of the electric power system. Fault diagnosis of the hydro turbine is a complicated process and requires a high level of expertise. In order to significantly reduce the cost consumed in the fault diagnosis, to increase the consistency of diagnosing decision-making, and to better utilize the turbine's management information resource, in this paper, an integrated Web-based expert system of the fault diagnosis has been developed for the hydro turbine of a power station. Moreover, it can be regarded as an advisory tool to those who have much technical experience and as a training tool for the less-experienced personnel who seek guidance and advice. This paper describes a research project aiming to develop a Web-based intelligent diagnosis system for the hydro turbine and discusses the process of the fault diagnosis and the difficulties involved in developing the system. The paper also includes several practical issues related to the architectures of the intelligent Web-based applications. The system is built on a three-tier architecture, including the following components: knowledge base, inference engine, knowledge administration interface, user interface, knowledge administration unit and integrated database. The expert system employs heuristic rules to diagnose the hydro turbine fault. Some issues on developing Web-based expert systems are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

But the overall and long-term tests are often with many costs. The grey model could forecast the long-term fault information from few short-term samples. During modeling, the grey model adopts a mean approximation to disperse the first order differential equation. The particle swarm optimization, as a multi-dimension search method is adopted here to find the optimal proportion point. The experiments show that the forecasting result of the optimized grey model is improved.

However, varying speed machinery faults detection is fraught with difficulties due to non-stationary machine vibration. Fixed time sampling cannot cope with the varying rotational frequency of the machine, resulting in increasing leakage error and spectral smearing. In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals during run-up and run-down of gears drive effectively, the angle domain average (ADA) technique is combined with the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), which is applied to vibration analysis of gear for the detection of failure. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then is re-sampled at constant angle increments. Therefore, the time domain non-stationary signal is converted into angle domain stationary one. In the end, the re-sampled signals are analyzed using continuous wavelet transform. The experimental results show that the presented method can effectively diagnose the faults of the gear crack.

It takes advantage of shift invariance of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform, non-Gaussian probability distribution for the wavelet coefficients and the statistical dependencies between a coefficient and its parent. So it can obtain higher SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) than common methods based on Discrete Wavelet Transform. Some actual auto transmission vibration signals are analyzed, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in monitoring and diagnosis of machine conditions, with the capability of early fault detection by extracting periodic impulses from auto transmission vibration signals.

Location Aware Mine Machinery for Productivity and Safety Improvements	FIRST INTERNATIONAL FUTURE MINING CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION 2008, PROCEEDINGS	AUSTRALASIAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY PUBLICATION SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Future Mining Conference and Exhibition	NOV 19-21, 2008	Univ New S Wales, Sydney, AUSTRALIA	OZ, Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold	Univ New S Wales			Flect management systems have been adopted by many open pit mines throughout the world and the resulting improvement in truck cycle times has been one of the most significant contributors to mine efficiency. Ongoing enhancements to fleet management systems such as interfaces for vital signs monitoring have given incremental efficiency gains. Each incremental improvement is another step towards a grand vision of a totally automated mine. A relatively new fleet management system is being integrated with two other technologies to provide a highly reliable platform for a networked information system which monitors mine machinery and production. The paper reviews the integration project, the features of the new mine site information network platform and the contribution to productivity and safety. The new fleet management system has a predictive truck dispatch algorithm. It also has a distributed database that replicates rapidly so that each machine in the fleet has an identical database, thereby making each machine aware of other machines' locations on the site. High precision systems for navigating and monitoring machinery such as drills, dozers, draglines and shovels provide individual machine operators with cockpit style real-time information to increase their operational efficiency. The integration of the new fleet management systems capabilities with the high precision systems that provide production information, machine vital signs data and operator information means that the mine operations and maintenance managers have real-time, access to the whole mine site's production data. Such a mine monitoring and reporting system is dependent on reliable wireless communications and reliable positions. Positions in fleet management and high precision systems for open pit mines are usually provided by global positioning system (GPS). Other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as Glonass, and in the future Galileo, will provide additional satellite cover; however, some parts of open pit mines do not have enough sky visibility for reliable GNSS positioning and so a new centimetre level wireless positioning system called Locata is being integrated with the fleet and high precision systems to augment and backup the GNSS positions. The final integrated system will provide the highest levels of reliable position-based information to all stakeholders in a mine's operation, ensuring gains in productivity and safety.

Wesley			An Integrated Fuzzy Inference-based Monitoring, Diagnostic, and Prognostic System for Intelligent Control and Maintenance	FOUNDATIONS OF GENERIC OPTIMIZATION, VOL 2: APPLICATIONS OF FUZZY CONTROL, GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND NEUTRAL NETWORKS	Mathematical Modelling-Theory and Applications		English	Article; Book Chapter						online monitoring; sensor calibration; empirical modeling; diagnostics; surveillance		With the advent of modern computation, intelligent control and maintenance systems have become a viable option for complex engineering processes and systems. Such control and maintenance systems can be generically described as being composed of 5 analysis steps: (1) predict the expected system signals from their measured values, (2) use the residual of the measured and predicted value to determine if the system is operating in a nominal or a degraded mode, (3) if the system is operating in a degraded mode, diagnose the fault, (4) prognose the failure by estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system, and (5) use the collected information to determine if an appropriate control or maintenance action should be performed to maintain the health and safety of the system performance. This chapter presents the development and adaptation of a single generic inference procedure, namely the nonparametric fuzzy inference system (NFIS), for monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. To illustrate the proposed methodologies, the embodiments of the NFIS are used to detect, diagnose, and prognose faults in the steering system of an automated oil drill. The embodiments of the NFIS were found to have similar performance to traditional algorithms, such as autoassociative kernel regression (AAKR) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN), for monitoring and diagnosis. The NFIS prognoser was also shown to estimate the remaining useful life of the steering system to within an hour of its actual time of failure.	[Garvey, Dustin R.; Hines, J.

To identify the location of faulty seams, thermal images taken by a thermo graphic device were used to determine the unique temperature distribution on the faulty seam. It was shown that the real-time inspection for detecting faulty area was possible by taking thermal images of the seams while the sheets were welded by a self-propelled heat-welding machine. This method is more efficient compared to the conventional inspection method as that the seam can be examined with the welding work.

J	Zimroz, R				Zimroz, R.			ADAPTIVE APPROACHES FOR CONDITION MONITORING OF MINING MACHINES	GOSPODARKA SUROWCAMI MINERALNYMI-MINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Adaptive system; open pit mine; diagnostic technique	FAULT-DETECTION; GEARBOX	Mining machines often work under non-stationary, Time-Varying Load Conditions (TVLC). The non-stationarity of load is mainly caused by the non-stationarity of technological process of mining (variation of external load caused by an operating bucket wheel, a time-varying stream of materials transported by conveyors, etc.). Taking into account variation of external load, complex mechanical structure of diagnosed object, enviromental impact, high level of internal/external interference, possibility of multi-faults appearance (in different location, development stage, nature of damage, i.e. distributed/localised, etc.) condition monitoring becomes a serious task. Indeed, diagnostics of wear, and especially of local damages (for example related to tooth crack/breakage) is complicated and unfortunately even proffesional diagnostics systems are sometimes not able to recognize it. In author's opinion one of possible reasons is that diagnostic systems are closed, with rigid rules of signal processing and reasoning. For example for such unique machines like bucket wheel excavator there is a need for more individual approaches. In this paper an attempt of generalization of requirements for such diagnostic system is presented. First assumption is that condition monitoring should be adaptive at signal preprocessing level, diagnostic feature extraction level and finally, at diagnostic reasoning level. As a practical results of research carried out in this field following issues will be presented: adaptive signal pre-processor (adaptive filter) for local damage detection in gearboxes and bearing (G, B), adaptive subsystem for local damage detection (G, B), adaptive subsystem of diagnostic reasoning for local damage diagnostics (G), adaptive subsystem of diagnostic reasoning for geared wheel cooperation assesment (G). It will be illustrated by examples based on industrial data captured from mining machines during normal (non-stationary) operation, namely two stage gearbox used in driving unit for belt conveyor transportation, complex gearbox with damaged planetary stage (bucket wheel excavator), bearing used in pulleys (belt conveors).

Therefore, it is critical to develop state awareness models that can accurately capture-the damage states and predict remaining useful life based on current and future loading conditions. In the current research, a structural health monitoring (SHM) and prognosis framework is being developed for heterogeneous material systems. The objective of this paper is to present some of the experimental components of this work. In the experiments preformed, the use of a pitch catch method using piezoelectric transducers for both the actuator and sensor were employed for collecting information on the damage status. The focus of this work is to quantify damage within the sample by relating parameters in the sensor signal to damage intensity. Good correlation has been observed in several tests between damage level and wave attenuation. These results are confirmed using off-the-shelf NDE techniques.

To address this issue, most previous works have taken two-stage strategies where unclear data are detected using an anomaly detection algorithm in the first stage while the rest of data are classified into learned classes using a classification algorithm in the second stage. In this studio we propose Anomaly Detection Support Vector Machine (ADSVM) which unifies classification and anomaly detection. ADSVM is unique in comparison with the previous work in that it addresses the two problems simultaneously We also propose a multiclass extension of ADSVM that uses a pairwise voting strategy. We empirically present that ADSVM outperforms two-stage algorithms in application to an real automobile fault dataset, as well as to UCI benchmark, datasets.				r-fujimaki@bx.jp.nec.com					Asuncion A., 2007, UCI MACHINE LEARNING; BISHOP CM, 1994, IEE P-VIS IMAGE SIGN, V141, P217, DOI 10.1049/ip-vis:19941330; CHANDOLA V, 2007, 07017 U MINN COMP SC; Chang C.

This paper presents the application of the Pony method for deriving these components from the measured data. It is known that the Pony's method is sensitive to noise and takes a long computation time by increasing of the length of the data. In order to enhance its performance, pretreatments, including frame transformation, frequency shifting and decimation, are employed before using the Pony's method. Finally, the fundamental sequence components, figured out by using the Pony's method, are put into a neural networkto calculate the indicator for diagnosis. The proposed technique is verified by applying to diagnose the stator fault in a three-phase induction motor.

Our work is based on a residual generation scheme, where the prediction of a model for process normal behavior is compared against measured process values. The residuals may indicate the presence of a fault. The model consists of a general statistical inference engine operating on discrete spaces, and represents the maximum entropy joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probabilities. The joint pmf is a rich model that, once learned, allows us to address inference tasks, which can be used for prediction applications. In our case the model allows the one step-ahead prediction of process variable, given its past values. The relevant dependencies between the forecast variable and past values are learnt by applying an algorithm to discover discrete bayesian network structures from data. The parameters of the statistical engine are also learn by an approximate method proposed by Yan and Miller. We show the performance of the prediction models and their application in power systems fault detection.

It is strong to solve the problem with small sample, nonlinear and high dimension. The fundamental theory of DGA (Dissolved Gas Analysis, DGA) and fault characteristic of transformer is firstly researched in this paper, and then the disadvantages of traditional method of transformer fault diagnosis are analyzed, finally, a new fault diagnosis method using multi-class support vector machines (M-SVMs) based on DGA theory for transformer is put forward. Then the fault diagnosis model based on M-SVMs for transformer is established. At the same time, the fault diagnosis system based on M-SVMs for transformer is developed. The system can realize the acquisition of the dissolving gas in the transformer oil and data timely and low cost transmission by GPRS (General Packet Radio Service, GPRS). And it can identify out the transformer running state according to the acquisition data. The test results show that the method proposed has an excellent performance on correct ratio. And it can overcome the disadvantage of the traditional three-ratio method which lacks of fault coding and no fault types in the existent coding. Combining the wireless communication technology with the monitoring technology, the designed and developed system can greatly improve the real-time and continuity for the transformer' condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

According to the discussions above, this paper proposes control architecture of service robot based on artificial psychology. In this control architecture, the robot can obtain the cognition of environment through sensors, and then be handled with intelligent model, affective model and learning model, and finally express the reaction to the outside stimulation through its behavior. For better understanding the architecture, hierarchical structure is also discussed. The control system of robot can be divided into five layers, namely physical layer, drives layer, information-processing and behavior-programming layer, application layer and system inspection and control layer. This paper shows how to achieve system integration from hardware modules, software interface and fault diagnosis. Embedded system GENE-83 10 is selected as the PC platform of robot APROS-1, and its primary memory media is CF card. The artris and body of the robot are constituted by 13 motors and some connecting fittings. Besides, the robot has a robot head with emotional facial expression, and the bead has 13 DOFs. The emotional and intelligent model is one of the most important parts in human-machine interaction.

In the PLC-device controlled manufacturing line, PLC-program holds place of underlying component. It becomes controlling mechanism. The level of automation in the production line relies on control mechanism practiced In the modern manufacturing, PLC devices can handle whole production line given that structured and smart PLC-program is executed.

Based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the Hilbert-Huang method can obtain a true instantaneous frequency representation of a signal. The analytical background of the HHT is introduced, and its effectiveness is experimentally evaluated using vibration signal. The experiment data of typical vibration faults signal were analyzed by the method, and the result shows that the proposed method can not only reveal the time-frequency features of vibration signal but also extrude components of low energy. Therefore, it is a very effective tool to diagnose the early faults of rotor system. And it provides new means for state detection and fault diagnosis of rotating machine.

In the new method, the RNS algorithm is used to generate the detector (non-self) as the unknown fault samples, which are used as input to SVM algorithm for training purpose. The problem, lacking the training samples, is solved to use the new method on the conventional classification algorithm. At last, this hybrid approach is compared against SVM algorithm through the experiment to classify the Iris data set. The classification correct rate of the new method is above 90%, so it is valid to the fault diagnosis.

Random forests-based fault diagnosis is treated as a Pattern Recognition problem, based on measurements and feature selection. Two different types of inserting randomness to the frees are studied, based on different theoretical assumptions. The classifier is compared against other Machine Learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Classification and Regression Trees, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbor. The performance of the prediction model reaches a level of 97% in terms of precision and recall, improving the existing state-of-the-art levels achieved by Neural Networks by a factor of 1.5%-2%. Furthermore, emphasis is given on the pre-processing phase, where feature selection and outliers identification is carried out, in order to provide the basis of a high performance automated diagnostic system. The conclusions derived are of more general interest and applicability.

Firstly, the vibration signals are decomposed to several wavelet coefficients. The energy of every, coefficient and the singularity values (SV) of the coefficient matrix are extracted Two type entropies means the Shannon entropy and Renyi entropy are, calculated of the energy and SV distribution. Secondly, a maximum relevance and minimum redundant (mRMR) method based on the mutual information and the greedy search technique are employed to select the optimal feature subsets for gear fault classification. A cross-validation method based on the LS-SVM is proposed to determine the number of features that the optimal subset contained Application to practical gear fault diagnosis showed that the proposed techniques provide a more effective and fast approach to gear fault diagnosis.

Bearing damages cause a torque oscillations as well as a disturbance in the velocity signal which can be detected by a mechanical measurements. These fluctuations will be reflected on the stator currents and cause a phase modulation. Where, the idea to exploit the instantaneous frequency in order to find informations related to the defect. An experimental data were used to verify the validity of the different techniques. Data were collected through an accelerometer sensor to measure the mechanical vibrations, an optical encoder fixed on rotor shaft and by electrical measurements. The results, in presence of natural raceway bearing fault, illustrate the very good performance of the proposed methods.

However, if the load torque is oscillating, or it is a function of the rotor position, the current spectrum will contain spectral components which coincides with the components produced by rotor faults. Thus, rotor fault detection in these loads, such as compressors and other reciprocating loads, is very difficult. A new strategy for broken rotor bar diagnosis in single-phase induction motors is presented in this paper. This strategy is based on the analysis of the auxiliary winding voltage. The proposed strategy allows the diagnostic of rotor faults even with pulsating load torque. Simulation and experimental results are presented.

An important issue in such effort is the modeling of the induction machine (IM) including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity.

These signatures are given by the complex spectrum modulus of the line current. In order to make the diagnostic, a genetic algorithm is used to keep the amplitude of all faulty lines. Moreover, the fuzzy logic approach allows us to conclude to the load level operating system as to inform the operator of the rotor fault severity. Experimental results proof the performance of this method under various load levels and various fault severities. The conclusion resulting from this study is highlighted and proves the efficiency of the suggested approach.

Vibration monitoring of mechanical characteristic frequencies related to the bearings is widely used to detect faulty operations. However, vibration measurement is expensive and can not always be performed. An alternative is to base the monitoring on the available electrical quantities e.g. the machine stator current which is often already measured for control and protection purposes. This work investigates another detection approach using estimated variables such as mechanical rotating speed. Considering that bearing faults induce load torque oscillations, a theoretical stator current model in case of load torque oscillations demonstrates the presence of phase modulations. Then, a theoretical estimated rotor flux and speed model in case of load torque oscillations demonstrates the presence of harmonics related to load torque oscillations. These components appear in the estimated speed spectrum and can be used for detection purposes. Measurements show that speed spectral energy is modified in specific frequency ranges corresponding to bearing faults. A fault detector is then proposed. The efficiency of the indicator is studied on long data records of measurements for different operating conditions. The investigated indicator proves that the detection of bearing faults is ensured by using estimated mechanical speed.

The developed system allows testing the behavior of an electrical machine for different load types. Several typical loads in which the torque depends of time or speed are implemented. In this way, using this tool it is possible to study the dynamic behavior of an electrical machine. It is also used to study induction machine fault diagnosis under different load types. The remote laboratory is based on an I/O interface controller and client-server architecture. To implement this system the software package MATLAB was used.	[Pires, V.

With electrical motors at the center of most processes, prognostics are best accomplished during motor operation. However, since disruption of the process is rarely possible, often systems must be de-energized during scheduled outages before they can be maintained. Predictive maintenance techniques offer a viable solution to this dilemma. As a result, predictive maintenance has been the subject of many recent technical papers. Nonintrusive continuous monitoring of critical systems is emerging as the best method to maximize reliability and uptime with minimal impact on the plant process operation. This paper discusses the importance of predictive maintenance for industrial process applications and investigates a number of emerging technologies that enable this approach, including online energy efficiency evaluation and continuous condition monitoring. The paper gives an overview of existing and future technologies that can be used in these areas. Two methods for bearing fault detection and energy efficiency estimation are discussed. The paper concludes with focus on one pilot installation at Weyerhaeuser's Containerboard Packaging Plant in Manitowoc, Wisconsin USA, where the site is realizing benefits from a new and novel approach.

Every level of the organization can have an impact on OEE - positive, and negative. This paper discusses how remote monitoring and expert diagnostic support fill the need to improve OEE by supporting operations, maintenance, engineering and management. These programs assure assets are in operation longer, machines perform at or above design production speed for a given product and ultimately delivering more saleable product. This is accomplished by reducing or eliminating instances of unscheduled down time, reducing the duration of such down time, increasing the effectiveness, availability and value of support resources, increasing quality by optimizing system performance and by delivering Return On Investment (ROI) to management. Real-world Pulp & Paper industry case examples are used to demonstrate how remote monitoring and expert diagnostic support programs actually affect ROI for existing users. These case examples range from predictive failures of simple devices to deep dive (in-depth), system design, performance and product issue analyses and resolutions.

Fault detection and diagnosis in the early stages of damage is necessary to prevent their malfunctioning and failure during operation. Vibration monitoring is the most widely used and cost-effective monitoring technique to detect, locate and distinguish faults in rolling element bearings. This paper presents an algorithm using feed forward neural network for automated diagnosis of localized faults in rolling element bearings. Normal negative log-likelihood value and kurtosis value extracted from time-domain vibration signals are used as input features for the neural network. Trained neural networks are able to classify different states of the bearing with 100% accuracy. The proposed procedure requires only a few input features, resulting in simple preprocessing and faster training. Effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using the bearing vibration data obtained experimentally.	[Sreejith, B.; Verma, A.

J	Ge, M; Xu, YS; Du, RX				Ge, Ming; Xu, Yangsheng; Du, Ruxu			An intelligent Online monitoring and diagnostic system for manufacturing automation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						automation; feature extraction; intelligent manufacturing; pattern recognition; similarity measure	MULTIPLE-FAULT DETECTION; HAAR-TRANSFORM	Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in modern manufacturing automation is of great practical significance. It improves quality and productivity, and prevents damage to machinery. In general, this practice consists of two parts: 1) extracting appropriate features from sensor signals and 2) recognizing possible faulty patterns from the features. Through introducing the concept of marginal energy in signal processing, a new feature representation is developed in this paper. In order to cope with the complex manufacturing operations, three approaches are proposed to develop a feasible system for online applications. This paper develops intelligent learning algorithms using hidden Markov models and the newly developed support vector techniques to model manufacturing operations. The algorithms have been coded in modular architecture and hierarchical architecture for the recognition of multiple faulty conditions. We define a novel similarity measure criterion for the comparison of signal patterns which will be incorporated into a novel condition monitoring system. The sensor-based intelligent system has been implemented in stamping operations as an example. We demonstrate that the proposed method is substantially more effective than the previous approaches. Its unique features benefit various real-world manufacturing automation engineering, and it has great potential for shop floor applications. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the problem of detecting the complicated sheet-metal processes faults in a high success rate but also applies to the real-world practices. Existing systems adopt traditional approaches fast but cannot adapt to various cases and achieve a diagnosis purpose. Using hidden Markov models and the newly developed support vector techniques, this paper proposes three approaches and develops intelligent learning algorithms to model manufacturing operations. The novel similarity measure criterion is able to implement the signal patterns comparison, overcoming the time-shifting phenomenon. The approach of modular architecture and hierarchical architecture has been presented in the software coding for the recognition of multiple faulty conditions. The sensor-based hardware design facilitates the online condition monitoring system. In this paper, we mathematically characterize the process signal features. We then develop the HMM-based modular fault diagnosis system which makes the modification expansion easy in practice. The hierarchical SVM-based fault diagnosis system uses a small-size training sample but achieves a high successful rate, and overcomes the overfitting and difficulties in structure design of the learning machine. The similarity measure approach using support vector techniques requires training sample sets produced under normal operating conditions and, thus, makes it more feasible than other techniques. Meanwhile, this approach overcomes the time-shifting. The proposed system provides important technologies and valuable reference for research areas and an innovation to manufacturing automation. The system works well in most applications; however, in some cases, certain parameters have to be tuned manually, for example, the parts of the signals to be modeled. The next step is to develop the system so it can learn human skills and set parameters automatically. In the short term, it is important to research ways to improve the system's intelligent online learning.

A neural network degradation model for computing and updating residual life distributions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						degradation modeling; neural network; reliability; vibrations	VIBRATION; SIGNALS	The ability to accurately estimate the residual life of partially degraded components is arguably the most challenging problem in prognostic condition monitoring. This paper focuses on the development of a neural network-based degradation model that utilizes condition-based sensory signals to compute and continuously update residual life distributions of partially degraded components. Initial predicted failure times are estimated through trained neural networks using real-time sensory signals. These estimates are used to derive a prior failure time distribution for the component that is being monitored. Subsequent failure time estimates are then utilized to update the prior distributions using a Bayesian approach. The proposed methodology is tested using real world vibration-based degradation signals from rolling contact thrust bearings. The proposed methodology performed favorably when compared to other reliability-based and statistical-based benchmarks. Note to Practitioners-We propose a neural-network-based degradation model that estimates utilizes real-time sensory signals to estimate the failure time of partially degraded components. The proposed model has been tested and validated on rolling element bearings by using real-time vibration signatures to estimate their failure times. In order to implement, one must first identify the sensory information that is correlated with the underlying degradation process. Next, a sample of components, similar to the one being monitored is tested. Degradation-based sensory information are acquired and stored along with the corresponding operating times of each acquisition. A group of neural networks are trained using supervisory training protocols. Each neural network is trained to identify the degradation pattern of one component in the sample. This is achieved by training the network to identify the operating time corresponding to each sensory signature that is input to the network. Sensory signals from similar components operating in the field are then input to the network model and used to predict the failure time based on the latest degradation state of the component being monitored. Steps 1-4 outline the details of the implementation. The sensory-updating methodology is used to continuously update the failure time predictions as subsequent real-time signals are acquired.

J	Kumar, A				Kumar, Ajay			Computer-vision-based fabric defect detection: A survey	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Review						automated visual inspection (AVI); fabric defect detection; industrial inspection; quality assurance; textile inspection	AUTOMATED VISUAL INSPECTION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SURFACE INSPECTION; MACHINE VISION; FAULT-DETECTION; QUALITY-CONTROL; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; LOCAL DEFECTS; TEXTURE; FOURIER	The investment in an automated fabric defect detection system is more than economical when reduction in labor cost and associated benefits are considered. The development of a fully automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection algorithms. The inspection of real fabric defects is particularly challenging due to the large number of fabric defect classes, which are characterized by their vagueness and ambiguity. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect fabric defects and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and/or describe these algorithms. This paper attempts to present the first survey on fabric defect detection techniques presented in about 160 references. Categorization of fabric defect detection techniques is useful in evaluating the qualities of identified features. The characterization of real fabric surfaces using their structure and primitive set has not yet been successful. Therefore, on the basis of the nature of features from the fabric surfaces, the proposed approaches have been characterized into three categories; statistical, spectral and model-based. In order to evaluate the state-of-the-art, the limitations of several promising techniques are identified and performances are analyzed in the context of their demonstrated results and intended application. The conclusions from this paper also suggest that the combination of statistical, spectral and model-based approaches can give better results than any single approach, and is suggested for further research.

In this paper, the relationships between the electric input signals and the mechanical and fluid-dynamic signals have been analyzed with the aim to evaluate the possibility to design an online and nonintrusive monitoring and diagnostic system based only on electric signal processing. As the second main purpose of this paper, the same methodology, which can also be applied to the characterization and comparison of the WJ plants' components, has been tested on the characterization and the following comparison of water orifices (the orifice is one of the most important components for the WJ technology due to the energy transformation which takes place inside) to validate the proposed approach.

The problem of which tests must be executed in what sequence to ensure in the shortest possible test time that the system works, which is the test-sequencing problem, was already solved by Pattipati et al. for the diagnosis of systems during operation. Test-sequencing problems during the development and manufacturing phases of systems, however, require a different approach than the test-sequencing problems during operation. In this paper, the test problem description and algorithms developed by Pattipati et al. are extended to solve test-sequencing problems for the development and manufacturing of manufacturing systems. For a case study in the manufacturing process of an ASML lithographic machine, it is shown that solving a test-sequencing problem with this method can reduce the test time by 15% to 30% compared to experts that solve this problem manually.

J	Li, LX; Hadjicostis, CN; Sreenivas, RS				Li, Lingxi; Hadjicostis, Christoforos N.; Sreenivas, Ramavarapu S.			Designs of bisimilar Petri net controllers with fault tolerance capabilities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						bisimulation equivalence; fault tolerance; Petri nets; redundant Petri net controllers	FINITE-STATE MACHINE; SYSTEMS	This paper proposes an approach for providing tolerance against faults that may compromise the functionality of a given controller modeled by a Petri net. The method is based on embedding the given Petri net controller into a larger (redundant) Petri net controller that retains the original functionality and properties, and uses additional places, connections, and tokens to impose invariant conditions that allow the systematic detection and identification of faults via linear parity checks. In particular, this paper considers two types of redundant Petri net controllers: 1) nonseparate redundant Petri net controllers have the same functionality as the given Petri net controller and allow for fault detection and identification, but do not necessarily retain the given controller intact; and 2) separate redundant Petri net controllers are a special case of the nonseparate redundant controllers that retain the given Petri net controller intact but enhance it with additional places to enable fault detection and identification. The work in this paper obtains complete characterizations of both types of redundant controllers along with necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be bisimulation equivalent to the given original Petri net controller. In addition, this paper discusses how each type of redundant controllers can be designed to have desirable fault detection and identification capabilities. When the bisimulation equivalence requirement is not directly enforced, nonseparate redundant controllers can potentially have advantages over separate ones (e.g., they can use fewer connections to detect and identify the same number of faults). An example of a Petri net controller for a production cell and its fault tolerance capabilities using separate and nonseparate embeddings is used to illustrate the approach.

Transmission line distance relaying using machine intelligence technique	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT CLASSIFICATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; WAVELET TRANSFORMS; PROTECTION; ALGORITHM; SELECTION; LOCATION	A new approach for distance relaying of transmission line using machine intelligence technique such as support vector machine (SVM) is presented. The proposed SVM technique is used for faulty phase selection and ground detection in different fault situations that occur on large power transmission line. Post-fault current and voltage samples for one-fourth cycle (five samples) are used as inputs to SVM 1, which provide output for faulty phase selection. SVM 2 is trained and tested with zero-sequence components of fundamental, third and fifth harmonic components of the post-fault current signal to provides the involvement of ground in the fault process. The polynomial and Gaussian kernel SVMs are designed to provide the most optimised boundary for classification. The total time taken for faulty phase selection and ground detection is 10 ms (half cycle) from the inception of fault. Also the proposed technique is tested on experimental set-up with different fault situations. The test results are compared with those of the radial basis function neural network and were found to be superior with respect to efficiency and speed. The classification test results from SVMs are accurate for simulation model and experimental set-up, and thus provide fast and robust protection scheme for distance relaying in transmission line.

Application of support vector machines for fault diagnosis in power transmission system	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS	Post-fault studies of recent major power failures around the world reveal that mal-operation and/or improper co-ordination of protection system were responsible to some extent. When a major power disturbance occurs, protection and control action are required to stop the power system degradation, restore the system to a normal state and minimise the impact of the disturbance. However, this has indicated the need for improving protection co-ordination by additional post-fault and corrective studies using intelligent/knowledge-based systems. A process to obtain knowledge-base using support vector machines (SVMs) is presented for ready post-fault diagnosis purpose. SVMs are used as Intelligence tool to identify the faulted line that is emanating and finding the distance from the substation. Also, SVMs are compared with radial basis function neural networks in datasets corresponding to different fault on transmission system. Classification and regression accuracies are is reported for both strategies. The approach is particularly important for post-fault diagnosis of any mal-operation of relays following a disturbance in the neighbouring line connected to the same substation. This may help to improve the fault monitoring/diagnosis process, thus assuring secure operation of the power systems. To validate the proposed approach, results on IEEE 39-Bus New England system are presented for illustration purpose.	[Ravikumar, B.; Thukaram, D.; Khincha, H.

Previous research has led to the development of detection systems that use vibration, temperature, and pressure as its measurement gauges. We introduce a novel approach where sound is used for fault prediction by creating the sound peak code method. The sound peak code can be attached to a machine like a bar code, and it can immediately find the normal or abnormal operation of a power plant machine. This method requires the development of an algorithm that satisfies three requirements.

Sensor-driven prognostic models for equipment replacement and spare parts inventory	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						degradation modeling; replacement models; spare parts inventory; condition monitoring	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE; DEGRADATION MODELS; POLICIES; OPTIMIZATION; FAILURE; SYSTEM	Accurate predictions of equipment failure times are necessary to improve replacement and spare parts inventory decisions. Most of the existing decision models focus on using population-specific reliability characteristics, such as failure time distributions, to develop decision-making strategies. Since these distributions are unaffected by the underlying physical degradation processes, they do not distinguish between the different degradation characteristics of individual components of the population. This results in less accurate failure predictability and hence less accurate replacement and inventory decisions. In this paper, we develop a sensor-driven decision model for component replacement and spare parts inventory. We integrate a degradation modeling framework for computing remaining life distributions using condition-based in situ sensor data with existing replacement and inventory decision models. This enables the dynamic updating of replacement and inventory decisions based on the physical condition of the equipment.

In this algorithm, both feature weighting and sample weighting are considered, and an optimal cluster number is automatically determined by the cluster validity index. Feature weights are learnt via FFNN based on the gradient descent technique, and sample weights are computed by using the distribution density function of a sample. Feature weighting and sample weighting highlight the importance of sensitive features and representative samples, and simultaneously weaken the interference of insensitive features and vague samples.

The influences of the asymmetrical whirling motions are studied using the back EMF of a search coil, which enables the detection of motor faults. The analysis results of the rotor eccentricity could be obtained by comparing the characteristics of motors fabricated with normal and irregular air gaps, and the validity is verified from the experimental results. The simulation and experimental results can be useful for the online faults detection monitoring system of induction machines.

Precise diagnosis and prognosis are crucial to reduce the high death rate. In this paper we present a framework for automatic malignancy grading of fine needle aspiration biopsy tissue. The malignancy grade is one of the most important factors taken into consideration during the prediction of cancer behavior after the treatment. Our framework is based on a classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The SVMs presented here are able to assign a malignancy grade based on preextracted features with the accuracy up to 94.24%. We also show that SVMs performed best out of four tested classifiers.

The trends are organized into three major types of prognostic models: failure data models, stressor models, and degradation models. Methods in each of these categories are presented and examples are given. Additionally, three particular computational prognostic approaches are considered; these are Markov chain-based models, general path models, and shock models. A Bayesian technique is then presented which integrates the prognostic types by incorporate prior reliability knowledge into the prognostic models. Finally, the article also discusses the usage of diagnostic/prognostic predictions for optimal control.	[Hines, J.

The visibility opens up new challenging issues for improving the efficiency of vehicle operations. One of the most challenging problems arising during the middle of life (MOL) of vehicles is the predictive maintenance on engine oil. For this, in this study, we focus on developing a predictive algorithm to estimate the quality of the engine oil of a vehicle by analyzing its degradation status with mission profile data. For this purpose, we specify the relations between indicators of engine mission profiles and oil quality indicators using principal component analysis and regression method. Then, we develop a heuristic algorithm for estimating the value of a quality indicator of engine oil based on them. To evaluate the proposed approach, we carry out a case study and computational experiments. Significance: This study deals with a prognostic maintenance approach for vehicle engine oil, which recently has been highlighted as a cost-effective method using product status data provided by emerging technologies.

In this paper, a new method, which combines the Adaptive Redundant Second-Generation Wavelet (ARSGW) and the Hilbert transform, is proposed. The ARSGW is applied to reveal the transient components of the signal in time domain clearly. Then the Hilbert transform is used to extract fault features of rolling bearing from the wavelet packets. The analysis results of the vibration signals from the experiment and the machine tool spindle show that the proposed method can detect the faults of the rolling bearing effectively.

Dimensional quality characteristic of work-piece is first monitored by wavelet-based SPC charts. And then, power spectrum analysis is used to extract abnormal feature signal if abnormal change is detected. Basing on this, a correlated model is established to calculate correlation coefficient between abnormal change and its fault sources, and synthesised diagnosis is provided to determine the importance level of these fault sources. At last, a running example is given to verify the proposed methodology.

In this paper, we describe an M2M middleware that we have developed for a facility management application. Facility management is a time and labour-intensive service industry, which can greatly benefit from the use of M2M technologies for automating business processes. The need to manage diverse facilities motivates several requirements, such as predictive maintenance, inventory management, access control, location tracking, and remote monitoring, for which an M2M solution would be useful. Our middleware includes software modules for interfacing with intelligent devices that are deployed in customer facilities to sense real-world conditions and control physical devices; communication modules for relaying data from the devices in the customer premises to a centralized data center; and service modules that analyze the data and trigger business events. We also present performance results of our middleware using our testbed and show that our middleware is capable of scalably and reliably handling concurrent events generated by different types of M2M devices, such as RFID tags, Zigbee sensors, and location tracking tags.

This advanced signal processing technique combining wavelet analysis and bispectral techniques allows the detection and characterization of non-Gaussian and non-stationary signals with time resolution and the discrimination linear processes from nonlinear ones. In the present investigation, application of this new technique to detect and identify an induction machine's rotor faults by measuring vibration data and analyzing the nonlinearity of the machine, due to the fact that damaged or faulty machines often generate highly nonlinear signals. The usefulness and statistical robustness of this approach are confirmed in the experiment. The results and analysis indicate that this novel signal processing technique can be effectively applied to motor rotor fault detection.

However, all existing methods can only prioritize test cases to a single queue. Once there are two or more machines that participate in testing, all exiting techniques are not applicable any more. To extend the prioritization methods to parallel scenario, this paper defines the prioritization problem in such scenario and applies the task scheduling method to prioritization algorithms to help partitioning a test suite into multiple prioritized subsets. Besides, this paper also discusses the limitation of previous metrics and proposes a new measure of effectiveness of prioritization methods in a parallel scenario. Finally, a case study is performed to illustrate the algorithms and metrics presented in this article.

With a personal digital assistant (PDA) phone, the machine status and machining data of CNC machines can be monitored in wired and wireless environments, including the environments of IMT2000 and Wireless LAN. Moreover, CNC machines can be controlled anywhere and anytime. The concept of the anywhere-anytime controlling and monitoring of a manufacturing system was implemented for u-Manufacturing in this study. In this concept, the communication between the CNC controller and the PDA phone was successfully performed anywhere and anytime for the real-time monitoring and control of CNC machines. In addition, the interface between the CNC controller and the developed application module was implemented by object linking and embedding for process control (OPC) and shared CNC memory. For communication, the design of a server content module within the target CNC was based on a TCP/IP. Furthermore, the client content module within the PDA phone was designed with the aid of embedded c++ programming for mobile communication. For the interface, the monitoring data, such as the machine status, the machine running state, the name of the numerical control (NC) program, the alarm and the position of the stage axes, were acquired in real time from real machines with the aid of the OPC method and by sharing the CNC memory. The control data, such as the start, hold, emergency stop, reserved start and reserved stop, were also applied to the CNC domain of the real machine. CNC machines can therefore be controlled and monitored in real time, anywhere and anytime. Moreover, prompt notification from CNC machines to mobile phones, including cellular phones and PDA phones, can be automatically realized in emergencies.

In order to realize a real-time and convenient diagnosis and satisfy the requirement of advanced maintenance of an elevator system, this paper proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis approach of induction motor for elevator traction machine using a developed decision fusion system. First, the basic knowledge of fusion techniques is briefly introduced which consists of classifier selection and decision fusion. Then a developed decision fusion system is presented. Next, four fusion algorithms-majority voting, Bayesian belief, multi-agent and modified Borda count-are employed for comparison in a real-world diagnosis experiment of a faulty elevator motor system. Based on the satisfactory results shown in the experiment, a big potential in real-world application is presented that is effective and cost saving only by analyzing stator current signals using proposed decision fusion system.

J	Cempel, C				Cempel, Czeslaw			FORECASTING THE GLOBAL AND PARTIAL SYSTEM CONDITION BY MEANS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL CONDITION MONITORING METHODS	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED MECHANICS			English	Article						condition monitoring; multidimensional observation; singular value decomposition; generalized fault symptoms; grey models; forecasting		Machines have many faults which evolve during their operation. If one observes some number of symptoms during the machine operation, it is possible to capture fault oriented information. One of the methods to extract fault information from such a symptom observation matrix is to apply the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), obtaining in this way the generalized fault symptoms. The problem of this paper is to find if the total damage symptom, being a sum of all generalized symptoms is the best way to infer on machine condition or is it better to use the first generalized symptom for the same purposes. There were some new software created for this purpose, and two cases of machine condition monitoring considered, but so far it is impossible to state that one of the inference methods is better. Moreover, it seems to the author that both inference methods are complimentary for each other, and should be used together to increase the reliability of diagnostic decision.

It gives us new challenging issues for improving the efficiency of asset operations. One of the most challenging problems is the predictive maintenance that makes a prognosis of the asset status via a remote monitoring, predicts the asset's abnormality, and executes suitable maintenance actions such as repair and replacement. In this study, we will develop a prognostic decision algorithm to take suitable maintenance actions by analyzing the degradation status of an asset. To evaluate the proposed approach, we carry out a case study for a heavy machinery.

During its service life a structure degrades due to deterioration and wearing down. These processes should be estimated in advance for the purpose of a provident life cycle management. With respect to the deterioration processes of reinforced concrete structures several mechanisms of concrete attack and reinforcing steel corrosion, repairing measures such as coatings included, have to be regarded. In the contribution the state and potentials of different forecasting models are presented with respect to the application in life cycle management systems. Such models can either be based on process oriented transport/reaction formulations or on constitutive engineering models, both being able to take reliability into account if the scatterings of the variables are known.

One key figure in machine availability is Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE), which is affected by the wear of machine components from both regular use and singular environmental conditions. This paper presents an approach to derive strategies for load-dependent interventions based on the diagnosis and prognosis of the component state, leading to a high level performance with a reliable forecast of machine and component failure in specific working environments.

And the Statistical Learning Theory begins to be widely focused on as a novel small sample statistic method, which has been mostly applied to pattern recognition, fault detection, time series prediction and so on. This paper creates a new method for reliability evaluation derived from Statistical Learning Theory. By constructing Support Vector Machine with analog reasoning, and solving linear operator equation, the probability density of product can be evaluated directly and then the product reliability index can be obtained. Compared with the traditional way, this method can apparently increase the accuracy and generalization ability of reliability evaluation within limited samples. Finally, this paper presents the bridge of a certain heavy special vehicle as an example to testify the efficiency of this method, and uses the accelerated life test of the vehicle bridge to estimate its reliability.

In this chapter, a fault detection method is developed based on a state observer model for a milling machine in a CNC machining center. The CNC machining center is treated as ail uncertain linear system. To obtain more information, a robust observer is designed based oil the uncertain linear model. Subsequently, this model is used as a state (tool wear) estimator, and fault diagnosis is carried out using two-variable information. The approach can be used for the detection of faults arising from the malfunction of a sensor or an actuator.	[Tan, K. K.; Huang, S.; Lee, T. H.; Putra, A. S.; Teo, C.

This work describes a methodology using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), organized in a binary tree structure to classify the extent of a growing crack in lug joints. A lug joint is a common aerospace 'hotspot' where fatigue damage is highly probable. The test specimen was instrumented with surface mounted piezoelectric transducers and then subjected to fatigue load until failure. A Matching Pursuit Decomposition (MPD) algorithm was used to preprocess the sensor data and extract the input vectors used in classification. The results of this classification scheme show that this type of architecture works well for categorizing fatigue induced damage (crack) in a computationally efficient manner. However, due to the nature of the overlap of the collected data patterns, a classifier at each node in the binary tree is limited by the performance of the classifier that is higher up in the tree.

On this basis we can form the symptom observation matrix (SOM) intended for condition monitoring. On the other hand we know, that contemporary complex machines may have many modes of failure, so called faults. The paper presents a method for the extraction of fault information from the symptom observation matrix by means of singular value decomposition (SVD) in the form of generalized fault symptoms. As the readings of the symptoms can be unstable, the moving average of the SOM was applied with success. The attempt to assess the diagnostic contribution of primary symptom was undertaken, and also some approach to connect SVD methodology with neural nets is considered. These possibilities are illustrated in the paper by processing data taken directly from the vibration condition monitoring of the machine.

There have been previous attempts to solve this problem by using artificial neural networks and others methods. In this paper, a novel algorithm named MISEN (Mutual Information based Selective Ensemble) is proposed to improve diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. MISEN is compared with the general case of bagging and GASEN, a baseline method, namely Genetic Algorithm Based Selective ENsemble, on UCI data sets.

The method aimed at optimal covering for each class, and constructed some complicated geometry bodies (CGBs) to cover one class samples distributing in the feature space approximately. The rolling bearing was studied by GL-based method in this paper, firstly, energy spectrum was extracted for features by wavelet packet transform, and then the feature vectors data was done topological analysis to construct CGBs for each class by the training algorithm of geometrical learning; secondly, the independent test set was tested by the identification algorithm of geometrical learning. On the condition of experiment, the fault patterns and its grades (from gently to severity) could be identified correctly. Moreover, the identification ability of the GL-based method was compared with that of Supper Vector Machine (SVM), the experimental results showed that GL-based method performed better than SVM.

However, some defects can be produced by the automatic manufacturing process during the assembly of the individual components, Among others, inter-turns short-circuit, turn to earth short-circuit and open-winding can result from the rotor insertion inside the stator. The main problem with these kind of faults is that the motor can operate but there is a high probability of motor breakdown in the near future. In this work, the above fault conditions are analyzed and an electromagnetic field and thermal monitoring method is proposed.

Aimed at solving this problem, first, a 1-DISVM is proposed, in which a coefficient is introduced to adjust decision curve region. Compared to 1-SVM, 1-DISVM inherits the ability to find outliers but gains improved classification accuracy by the coefficient adjusting. Based on 1-DISVM, an unsupervised learning multi-class classification model is also built. By means of small quantity of fault samples, the model improves classification performance by getting rid of the influence from wrong samples. Then the experiment is implemented by applying the considered approaches in gear-box fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that, the presented method achieved precise classification for two-class (normal and fault) data identification.	[Liu, G. J.; Liu, X.

As the best available time-frequency method so far, the wavelet transform still can not fulfill the rolling bearing fault detection task very well since it has some inevitable deficiencies. The wavelet neural network (WNN) approach is developed for rolling bearing fault detection due to it's fault tolerance and capacity for self-organization. In practical applications, the wavelet neural network's performance in rolling bearing fault detection is showed through experimental case studies. The simulated result shows that the wavelet neural network approach is effective to distinguish the state of the rolling bearing and suitable to diagnose rolling bearing fault.

Predictive maintenance of ball bearings for machine rotating with arbitrary velocity profiles	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA 2008: INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING, VOLS. 1-8			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering	SEP 15-17, 2008	Leuven, BELGIUM	Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mech Engn				Recent research and development on servomotor technology and on their control system push forward the application of these devices as electric cams in a large numbers of industrial applications, such as example motion control system for packaging machineries. Performances of these devices are much higher than the mechanical solutions for machine motion, in terms of precision and operational speed, and, of Course, in time required to reconfigure the motion profile. However, classical approaches to the ball bearing diagnosis that use analysis of vibration signals are not longer applicable, as they have been developed on the hypothesis of drive constant speed. In fact, in most of the current industrial application, the control system drives the motor to follow a complex and cyclic (i.e. motor shaft reverses its motion direction at each operational cycle) non constant speed motion profile. In those application, even Computed Order Tracking [I I (COT), which is the main fault bearing diagnosis technique used in non-constant velocity applications, fails to detect incipient faults, as highlighted by Fyfe and Munck In [2]. This paper presents a new procedure that modifies the COT to be Successfully applicable to the diagnosis problem of ball bearings in variable speed motion applications.

Fault appears with each passage of rolling elements on the degraded surface of bearing and we can simulate it by shocks having a direct impact on the shaft speed of the machine. Where, the idea to exploit the speed in order to find information related to the defect. An experimental data were used to verify the validity of the method. Data were collected through an accelerometer sensor attached to the machine above the defective bearing to measure the mechanical vibrations and through an optical encoder fixed at the free end of the shaft gives the angular position of the rotor shaft. Instantaneous frequency analysis, in the presence of natural raceway bearing fault, illustrates the very good performance of the proposed method in the detection of bearing faults. The results are corroborated by an envelope analysis.

The discrete observation of this 'would be' symptom vector creates so called symptom observation matrix (SOM). Using as a next the singular value decomposition (SVD) for the given SOM, one can extract the generalized fault symptoms describing the fault evolution in a given case. Using the symptom reliability concepts further, and the grey system forecast methodology, it is possible to asses the generalized symptoms limit value and measured symptoms diagnostic contribution. In this way one call establish the needed dimensionality of symptom observation matrix, and moreover assess the residual system life. However, doing this we have to establish new criteria for the dimensionality of SOM, based not on the number of symptoms in use, but the quality of diagnostic decision. This concept was verified in the paper using the data taken from real cases of vibration condition monitoring practice.

In this algorithm, the OCSVM with two-layer thresholds can separate outliers into non-boundary support vectors and real abnormal samples. And the detector can be updated Online adaptively without real abnormal samples as they are removed in future training sets. Meanwhile, Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm for OCSVM is introduced to improve its training efficiency. Applying the DTODA to the analysis of a turbopump historical vibration data, it showed that the algorithm can detect the faults of the turbopump very well without any false alarm. And the Computation is fast enough to assure DTODA's ability for real-time fault detection.

To increase the signal-noise-ratio, a novel method based on the statistic rule is brought forward to determine the threshold of each order of wavelet space and the decomposition level adaptively. The binary discrete wavelet transform is used to acquire effective eigenvectors. The fuzzy diagnosis equation based on correlation matrix is used to classify the fault modes. The network structure is obtained by establishing the fault diagnosis model of turbo-generator set and using the improved least squares algorithm. Also the robustness of fault diagnosis equation is discussed in this paper. The faults are input into the trained diagnosis equation by means of choosing enough samples to train the fault diagnosis equation and the information representing. The type of fault can be determined according to the output result. The experiment results show that multi-concurrent fault for stator temperature fluctuation and rotor vibration can be diagnosed effectively by this new method and the diagnosis result is correct.

The current spectrum of the induction machine for locating characteristic fault frequencies is used in MCSA. The spectrum is obtained using a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) that is performed on the signal under analysis. The fault frequencies occur in the motor current spectra are unique for different motor faults. However FFT does not always achieve good results with non-constant load torque. Other signal processing methods, such as Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet transforms techniques may also be used for analysis. These techniques are capable of revealing aspects of data like trends, breakdown points, discontinuities in higher derivatives, and self-similarity which are not available in FFT analysis. In the present paper, the comparisons of various techniques are discussed to analyze the experimental results obtained.

FLANK WEAR; TOOL; SYSTEM; SOUND	A filter is used to remove undesirable frequency information from a dynamic signal. This paper shows that noise nuisance can be effectively removed from a machining signal when applying the Z-filter filtering technique to extract the desired spectra components. The Z-filter can be applied as the noise of the operation that being studied can be determined. The noise components were initially identified from the sound produced by the operation of machine components itself such as hydraulic system, motor, machine environment condition and etc. By correlating the noise components with the measured machining signal, the filtered signal which was less interfered with the noise can be obtained. As a result, the interested components of the measured signal were extracted. The elimination of noise is very important for fault diagnosis where in common, the noise will change the original signal feature that can deteriorate the useful sensory information.	[Nuawi, M.

Based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the Hilbert-Huang method can obtain a true instantaneous frequency representation of a signal. The analytical background of the HHT is introduced, and its effectiveness is experimentally evaluated using vibration signal. The experiment data of typical vibration faults signal were analyzed by the method, and the result shows that the proposed method can not only reveal the time-frequency features of vibration signal but also extrude components of low energy. Therefore, it is a very effective tool to diagnose the early faults of rotor system. And it provides new means for state detection and fault diagnosis of rotating machine.

Because the operating mode of a machine affects the physical response and hence the diagnostic parameters, real-time information regarding the operating mode is likely to improve the performance of an online fault detection system. This paper proposes a method for automated duty cycle classification to augment the performance of vibration-based online condition monitoring systems for applications such as gearboxes, motors, and their constituent components. Experimental work is carried out on the swing machinery of an electromechanical excavator, which demonstrates how such a method might function on actual dynamic signals gathered from an operating machine. Several variations of the system are tested.	[Timusk, Markus A.] Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada		Timusk, MA (corresponding author), Laurentian Univ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.

The application of acoustic emission (AE) for rotating machine fault diagnosis is gained as a complementary tool; however, limitations in the successful application of the AE technique have been partly due to the difficulty in processing, interpreting and classifying the acquired data. The experimental investigation reported in this paper is centred on the application of the AE technique for identifying the seal rubbing on the rotor rig. An experimental test rig was designed to simulate the 200MW gas turbine rotor shafts. On the rig different degrees rubbing-impact on the seal is performed. The AE transducer and the vibration acceleration transducer are set on the bearing block. Comparisons between AE and vibration analysis over a range of speed and different degrees rubbing-impact are presented. In fact there are so many sources of AE that the successful identification of rubbing-impact signal is very important. Account for the characteristics of acoustic emission signals the wavelet transform is employed to analyze the AE signal. The wavelet transform can decompose the AE signals in time and wavelet scale domains, and catch the differences in these waves. It enables to distinguish the rubbing-impact from other sources. It is concluded that AE offers earlier fault detection and improved identification capabilities than vibration analysis, allowing the user to monitor the rubbing-impact degrees of the rotor system, unachievable with vibration analysis.

Fault diagnosis of an industrial machine through neuro-fuzzy sensor fusion	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 10, PTS A AND B: MECHANICS OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	NOV 10-16, 2007	Seattle, WA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers				In this paper a neuro-fuzzy approach of multi-sensor fusion is developed for a fault diagnosis system. The approach is validated by applying it to a machine called the Iron Butcher, which is used in industry for the removal of heads in fish prior to further processing for canning. An important goal of this approach developed in this paper is to make an accurate decision of the machine condition by fusing information from different sensors. Specifically, sound, vibration and vision measurements are acquired from the machine using a microphone, an accelerometer and a digital CCD camera, respectively. Next, the sound and vibration signals are transformed into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). A feature vector from the FFT frequency spectra is defined and extracted from the acquired information. Also, a feature based vision tracking approach--the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)--is applied to the vision data to track the object of interest (fish) in a robust manner. In the diagnosis process, a candidate fish is detected and tracked. Sound, vibration and vision features are extracted as inputs for the neuro-fuzzy fault diagnosis system. A four-layer neural network including a fuzzy hidden layer is developed to analyze and diagnose any existing faults. By training the neural network with sample data for typical faults, six crucial faults in the fish cutting machine are detected precisely. In this manner, alarms to warn about impending faults may be generated as well during the machine operation. Developed approaches are validated using computer simulations and physical experimentation using the industrial machine.

In this paper, a recurrent neural network based strategy was developed for material degradation assessment and fatigue damage propagation prediction. Two Elman Neural Networks were developed for fatigue severity assessment and trend prediction correspondingly. The performance of the proposed prognostic methodology was evaluated by using blade material fatigue data collected from a material testing system. The prognostic method is found to be a reliable and robust material fatigue predictor.

A Prediction based on neural network is a new approach to realize the state predicting. The present neural networks predicting models are comparatively poor in adaptability to environment and in predicting accuracy, therefore, a new rotary machine online state forecasting method based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and neural network (NN) was presented. GA was used for dynamical optimizing the structure parameters of BP network to obtain the optimal network structure. A training algorithm combining GA with BP was adopted to avoid the local minimum and to heighten the learning precision. The state predicting results for hydraulic pump indicate that the predicting model purposed may dynamically optimize the structure parameters in accordance with different conditions, and gained satisfactory results.

To ensure proper functionality of complex systems, advanced technologies for performance diagnosis and control are being incorporated into engineering designs, which requires an ever-increasing number of sensors and measurement devices. Nevertheless, a sensor just as any other dynamic system, degrades and fails. A faulty sensor may cause process performance degradation, process shut down, or even a fatal accident because it is no longer able to deliver accurate information about the monitored(1) system. Therefore, it is essential to assess sensor performance to ensure system reliability. In this paper a method is proposed to detect, isolate, and compensate sensor degradation. The numerical algorithm for subspace state space system identification is used to track the changes of the time constants and gains of the sensor and the monitored system. Without imposing requirements for redundant sensors and measurement devices, this method utilizes the fact that sensor readings depict dynamic characteristics of the sensors as well as those of the monitored system.

Failure of a lubricant often results in accelerated metal wear and the release of wear debris in the lubricant. Early detection of abnormal metal wear is important for fault detection and failure prevention. An electrochemical cell can be operated in a lubricating fluid in such a way that the operating characteristics of the cell can provide an indication of the chemistry of the fluid. For example, certain ions in the fluid, such as wear metal ions, will react to particular potential values applied to electrodes in the electrochemical cell. By applying a changing potential across the electrodes in an electrochemical cell and observing the resulting current it is possible to detect and identify the ionic species present in the lubricating fluid. The objective is to provide real-time monitoring of lubricating fluids using an in situ sensor to detect and diagnose conditions leading to machinery failure. A series of experiments have been conducted to confirm the ability of an electrochemical cell to detect wear metal ions in lubricating fluids extracted from machinery. Additional tests have been conducted to test the hypothesis that the presence and amount of wear metal ions corresponds to the type and amount of wear particles in the fluid. Initial laboratory tests have established a positive correlation with wear particles detected in used lubricating oil with ion presence determined using ion chromatography. The results reported indicate that a small, real-time multi-element sensor with an electrochemical cell will be able to detect wear metal ions and provide an early indication of unusual material wear. This capability may provide an early warning of atypical wear patterns and provide a cue to an operator or service engineer indicating the type of fault occurring and the specific component experiencing wear or early failure.

COMBINING LEAD FUNCTIONS AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR PREDICTING FAILURES ON AN AIRCRAFT ENGINE	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2008, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	53rd ASME Turbo Expo 2008	JUN 09-13, 2008	Berlin, GERMANY	Int Gas Turbine Inst, ASME				The increasing demand for performance and durability of advanced aerospace systems has increased the need for health management of these systems. Effective health management involves seamless integration of failure diagnostics, failure prediction, part life estimation, and maintenance logistics. These capabilities have only partially been implemented in current health management systems. Hence the effectiveness of current management systems has not achieved its potential. To achieve the goal of effective prognostic and health management (PHM), promising technologies from various disciplines must be integrated. One of these technologies is logistic regression. In this method, aircraft engine takeoff data is combined with control system fault information and by introducing lead times prior to the fault. Lead times of 1, 7, 14, and 30 days were analyzed using logistic regression on the difference from expected thermodynamic values. The resulting equations give probability of failure over time. An example using real engine data from GE-F414 engines to predict engine stall and anti-ice valve failures are presented. The results show good predictability of these events between a week and a month in advance. For example, for the event of an imminent anti-ice valve failure, the true-negative fraction was 99.6% and the positive-predictive value was 93.1%. This methodology can be combined with an engine health monitoring (EHM) system to provide prognostic failure predictions. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were evaluated as an additional measure of the quality of the predictions. These ROC curves show that there is prognostic value with this approach. This methodology can be updated and refined with additional data. As the results get more refined, the reliability of the fleet can increase, costs can be reduced, and safety increased.

Current methods rely on the monitoring of synchronous response of the machine during its transient or normal operation. Very little progress has been made in developing robust techniques to detect subtle changes in machine condition caused by rotor cracks. It has been demonstrated that the crack-induced changes in the rotor dynamic behavior produce unique vibration signatures. When the harmonic excitation force is applied to the cracked rotor system, nonlinear resonances occur due to the nonlinear parametric excitation characteristics of the crack. These resonances are the result of the coexistence of a parametric excitation term and different frequencies present in the system, namely critical speed, the synchronous frequency, and excitation frequency from the externally applied perturbation signals. This paper presents the application of this approach on an experimental test rig. The simulation and experimental study for the given rig configuration, along with the application of active magnetic bearings as a force actuator, are presented.

One of the reason is the reduced set of instruments that monitor this procedure. It is cumbersome to adjust lubrication and steam valves while controlling the speed and dynamic stability. In order to get the turbo-compressor out of a high vibration zone, it is important to be able to predict instabilities associated to the start-up process. Thus, it is necessary to have a measurement system with the ability of fault detection, especially at early stages of fault appearance. In this way, the start-up time can be significantly reduced. Although recent developed diagnosis methods use information from different sources and measurements, data structures are not designed to carry predictive information related to the turbo-compressor health. Therefore, it is important to extract early warning signals related to instability conditions. Vibration signals during machine start-up are non-stationary in nature, and conventional techniques, such as Fourier transforms and time series analysis, have difficulties to extract the full features of the vibrations signature. In this paper, the features of start-up vibrations in rotational systems like those found in turbo compressors are investigated by time-frequency analysis, and appropriate analysis of the transient vibration during compressor start-up is presented.

The system provides both strain and corrosion measurements in a package a few mils thick. This combination of data can provide critical assessments of structural health, leading to prediction of failure. The MEMS sensors are permanently installed on a high-valued structure, such as a building, bridge or aircraft, and are connected to a data acquisition node. Data transmission and downloading will use a ZigBee wireless chip, a self-organizing network that has low power requirements. The sensor network provides a low-cost, non-intrusive way to detect failures, or to signal ahead of time that preventative maintenance needs to be undertaken to prevent more expensive replacement in the future. Corrosion Health Monitoring Systems and Prognostics are key elements in assuring the performance and reliability of high value, critical structures. Analatom has developed a multiplexed system that obtains data from a variety of sensors with real-time intelligent algorithms to detect, monitor and predict corrosion rates. Second generation Neural Networks have shown that total state event-shifts within non-linear systems can now be modeled, wherein concurrent, multiple and often interacting sensor signal signatures enhance and amplify this modeling process such that hidden interactions and element dependencies are clarified and understandable. Analatom has developed such a second generation Neural Network architecture whereby multiple and multi-layered element interactions can be evaluated, grouped and monitored. This enhancement now enables CBM monitoring and tracking to reflect local regions of negative impact which arise from multiple and interacting states of degradation.

Over 2000 will be upgraded and remain in service beyond the year 2040. They must remain affordable, available, and safe while experiencing escalating operational tempos in increasingly harsh environments. Army helicopters are complex machines that were designed to experience discrete flight regimes defined by combinations of flight maneuvers and configurations. Army helicopter structural maintenance, overhaul, and retirement are scheduled based upon conservatively derived design flight hours. In reality, many Army helicopter structural components are retired for reasons other than fatigue at flight hours that fall short of design goals. The gap between design assumptions, operational usage, and maintenance actions is bridged by monitoring actual operations to identify damaging flight regimes, refine scheduled maintenance, and predict unscheduled maintenance. Structural discrepancies and maintenance actions are correlated to operational usage to establish safety, reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) trends. The time each airframe and component is exposed to damaging flight regimes and operational environments are recorded, evaluated, and correlated with the predetermined, but constantly refined, RAM trend database. Predictive methods identify improved aircraft operations and maintenance planning.

The effective eigenvectors are acquired by binary discrete orthonormal wavelet transform based on multi-resolution analysis (MRA). These feature vectors then are applied to a SOLAR system for training and testing. SOLAR system has three advantageous over a typical neural network: data driven learning, local interconnections and entropy based self-organization.

By means of choosing enough practical samples to verify the proposed network performance and the information representing the faults is inputted into the trained network, and according to the output result the type of fault can be determined.

After the keystone of support vector machines was introduced, three kinds of support vector multi-classification methodology were proposed. The constitution and characteristic of each method was introduced, and the three kinds of methods were used in practical circuit fault diagnosis. Through the comparison of their performance in the practical fault diagnosis, the serial support vector machine is much better than the other two methods in the aspect of the classification velocity and precision.

The effective eigenvectors are acquired by binary discrete orthonormal wavelet transform based on multi-resolution analysis. These feature vectors then are applied to a recognition system for training and testing. recognition system has three advantageous over a typical neural network: data driven learning, local interconnections and entropy based self-organization. The synthesized method of recursive orthogonal least squares algorithm and improved Givens rotation is used to fulfill the combined network structure and parameter initialization. By means of choosing enough practical samples to verify the proposed network performance and the information representing the faults is inputted into the trained network, and according to the output result the type of fault can be determined. Simulation results and actual applications show that the method can effectively diagnose and analyze the multi-concurrent vibrant fault patterns of aeroengine and the diagnosis result is correct. The method can be generalized to other rotating machines' fault diagnosis.

Medium voltage motors are common drivers for most applications in the process sector. Predictive maintenance activities are of paramount importance for assuring effective machine performance in a specified time horizon. The identification of the periodic test interval plays a major role in achieving a safety integrity target. This paper presents a mathematical model, based on discrete step-wise Markov processes, predicting the probability of the machine failure depending on the periodic test interval. The 'health state' of the machine is depicted by a bulk index, called integrity level (IL), currently used by several companies. The model has been built and tested on a large maintenance database involving 111 motors from four facilities.

It is regulated in the technological requirement Japanese guideline and the electric equipment technology standard that the country provides. The islanding detection device detected purpose install for blackout due to the accident occurrence of the earth fault and the short-circuit in the utility line. When the islanding detection device detects the power blackout, it is necessary to stop the photovoltaic generation system immediately. If the photovoltaic generation system is not immediately stopped that electricity comes to charge the utility power line very at risk. We had already known that the islanding detection device can't detect the islanding phenomenon, if is there the induction machine load in the loads. Authors decided to investigate the influence that the inducement machine load gave to the islanding detection device. The result was confirmed the induction machine load had changed from the state of the electric motor into the state of the generator And, the induction machine load that had entered the state of the generator changed into the electric motor driven at a synchronous speed and maintained the frequency. It was clarified not to be able to detect the islanding phenomenon because the frequency was maintained by the influence of the inducement machine load driven at a synchronous speed. The induction machine load was not able to be substituted by linear loads of an inductivity load and a capacitive load, etc. and was able to be confirmed from these results at the same time.

Design/methodology/approach - Investigations into the possibilities for automatically detecting gap-faults in a friction stir lap weld were conducted. Force signals were collected from a number of lap welds containing differing degrees of gap faults. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine whether these signals could be used to develop an automatic fault detector/classifier. Findings - The results demonstrate that the frequency spectra of collected force signals can be mapped to a lower dimension through discovered discriminant functions where the faulty welds and control welds are linearly separable. This implies that a robust and precise classifier is very plausible, given force signals. Research limitations/implications - Future research should focus on a complete controller using the information reported in this paper. This should allow for a robotic friction stir welder to detect and avoid faults in real time. This would improve manufacturing safety and yield. Practical implications - This paper is applicable to the rapidly expanding robotic FSW industry. A great advantage of heavy machine tool versus robotic FSW is that the robot cannot supply the same amount of rigidity. Future work must strive to overcome this lack of mechanical rigidity with intelligent control, as has been examined in this paper. Originality/value - This paper investigates fault detection in robotic FSW. Fault detection and avoidance are essential for the increased robustness of robotic FSW. The paper's results describe very promising directions for such implementation.

Survival prediction is often accomplished by the TNM system that involves only three factors: tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. This prediction from the TNM has been limited, mainly because other potential prognostic factors are not used in the system. Based on availability of large cancer datasets, it is possible to establish powerful prediction systems by using machine learning procedures and statistical methods. In this paper, we present a clustering based approach to develop prognostic systems of cancer patients. Our method starts with grouping combinations that are formed using levels of factors recorded in the data. The dissimilarity measure between combinations is obtained through a sequence of data Partitions produced by multiple clusterings. This dissimilarity measure is then used with a hierarchical clustering method in order to find clusters of combinations. Prediction of survival is made simply by using the survival function derived from each cluster Our approach admits multiple factors and provides a practical and useful toot in outcome prediction of cancer patients. A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for lung cancer patients.

The wavelet analysis can accurately localize the features of transient signal in time-frequency domains. The wavelet transform technology is appropriate for processing of fault signals consisting of short-lived, high-frequency components closely located in time as well as long duration components closely spaced in frequency. In a view of the inter relationship of wavelet decomposition theory, the crucial components as features are inputted into radial basis function for fault pattern recognition. In order to acquire the network parameters, the improved Levenberg-Marquardt optimization technique is used for training process. By choosing enough samples to train wavelet network, the fault pattern can be determined according to the output results. Also, the robustness of wavelet network for fault diagnosis is discussed. The applied results show that the proposed method call improve the performance for real-time monitoring of vibration fault.

A model of transformer diagnosis based on SVM is present in this paper in which it uses the grid search method based on cross-validation to determine model parameters. Taking into account the compactness characteristics of DGA data, the fuzzy C.-means (FCM) clustering method is adopted to pre-select samples achieved. It solves the problem of long time expended on model parameters determined, and enhances a certain promotion of the model extension ability.

The faults of rotating machinery considered in this study include imbalance, misalignment, looseness and imbalance combined with misalignment conditions. When such faults occur, they usually induce non-stationary vibrations to the machine. After measuring the vibration signals, the wavelet packets transform is applied to these signals. The fractal dimension of each frequency bands is extracted and the box counting dimension is used to depict the failure characteristics of the vibration signals. The failure modes are then classified by a radial basis function neural network. An experimental study was performed to evaluate the proposed method and the results show that the method can effectively detect and recognize different kinds of faults of rotating machinery.

Soft Margin Training for Associative Memories: Application to Fault Diagnosis in Fossil Electric Power Plants	SOFT COMPUTING FOR HYBRID INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter								In this paper, the authors discuss a new synthesis approach to train associative memories, based on recurrent neural networks. They propose to use soft margin training for associative memories, which is efficient when training patterns are not all linearly separable. On the basis of the soft margin algorithm used to train support vector machines, the new algorithm is developed in order to improve the obtained results via optimal training algorithm also innovated by the authors, which are not fully satisfactory due to that some times the training patterns are not all linearly separable. This new algorithm is used for the synthesis of an associative memory implemented by a recurrent neural network with the connection matrix having upper bounds on the diagonal elements to reduce the total number of spurious memory. The scheme is evaluated via a full scale simulator to diagnose the main faults occurred in fossil electric power plants and taking into account three different cases.

Life cycle design of machines and devices is nowadays gaining ground rather quickly; users want that machines and devices operate with a high level of accuracy and reliability and with as few outages as possible.

In this paper, a solution is proposed for partial reduced FSMs with distinguishing sets, and either with or without reset feature. Sufficient conditions for a sequence to be a checking sequence for such FSMs are formulated. Based on these conditions, a method to generate checking sequence is elaborated. The results of an experimental comparison indicate that the proposed method produces shorter checking sequences than existing methods in most cases. The impact of using the reset feature on the length of checking sequence is also experimentally evaluated.

Firstly, the given signal is decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by EMD. Choose the first several energy-dominating IMFs, and extract their wavelet packet features, respectively. So, a series of feature sub-spaces are obtained base on each of IMFs, respectively. Then, BT-SVM based weak node classifiers are trained in each of feature subspaces corresponding to each of IMFs. Finally, based on the energy proportion of each of IMFs, strong node classifier is obtained by weighted fusion of these weak node classifiers. The experiment part, the application in fault diagnosis of diesel engine shows the feasible and efficient ability of the proposed method.

The use of artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks has been recently introduced to this subject and the results from such applications prove their potential in making accurate prognosis. This paper presents a review of feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) development and furthermore it illustrates their application by the use of two cases studies from Italian and Greek underground projects, where the TBM performance is modelled. The results obtained show that the developed ANNs can efficiently generalise the TBM behaviour in their respective geotechnical environment, having a reliable, effective and consistent performance.

Investigations and mathematical simulation on decentralized anaerobic treatment of agricultural substrate from livestock farming	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ADM 1; agricultural wastes; anaerobic treatment; mathematical simulation	CATTLE MANURE; DIGESTION; MODEL; ADM1	Anaerobic processes are widely used for treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater as well as agricultural substrates. In contrast to the aerobic methods, they are frequently more cost-efficient, they have a lower surplus sludge production, and the reactors can be run with higher volumetric loads and thus smaller volumes. In the paper presented both experimental data and the application of the Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 for agricultural substrate from livestock farming will be described. A 3,500 L reactor with mesophilic operation and loaded with cattle manure was examined with respect to its COD degradation, gas production, and gas composition. Results revealed a reduction of 30-35% COD and a biogas production of 287 L(Biogas)/kg(VS) when operated with a specific loading rate of 3.6 kg(VS)/(m(3).d). After calibration of the ADM 1, which was based predominantly on the acetate uptake rate (k(ac.m) = 3.6g/(g.d)), the disintegration constant (k(Dis) = 0.05d(-1)) and the exact determination of the influent COD fractions contained in the agricultural substrate, it was possible to simulate the measured data of the plant in excellent quality. For future application of the ADM 1 as part of control strategies a sensitivity analysis was carried out. The analysis based on the SVM slope technique has been done to identify highly sensitive biochemical parameters. These are, amongst others, the acetate uptake rate, the disintegration constant, the biomass decay rates and the half saturation constant for ammonia inhibition. Sensitivity analysis of the inflow COD fractions ( proteins, carbohydrates, lipids and inert) showed the necessity of detailed measurements for the prediction of the gas flow and composition as well as for prognosis of inhibitions in the anaerobic process. For cattle manure especially the fractions of inert material and carbohydrates should be observed carefully. Due to the high content of NH(4)-N in manure the protein fraction is not as sensitive as the two mentioned above.

Unlike conventional diagnostic approaches, in this method instead of focusing on system residuals at one or a few operating points, diagnosis is done by analyzing system behavior patterns over a window of operation. It is shown how this approach can loosen the dependency of diagnostic methods on precise system modeling while maintaining the desired characteristics of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tools (fault isolation, robustness, adaptability, and scalability) at a satisfactory level. As an example, the method is applied to fault diagnosis in HVAC systems, an area with considerable modeling and sensor network constraints.

The field data including the high/low pressures and the high/low temperatures of refrigerants are measured in a practical system. PNN analyses the refrigerants' pressures/temperatures of air-conditioning systems to monitor the operation conditions of compressor and identifies the abnormal status, while using the ratio of refrigerants' pressures/temperatures to create training data-set. PNN method is suitable for application in a dynamic environment by using new data-set and new hidden without doing any computed iteration. The commonly used EXCEL was integrated to provide a convenient man-machine interface.

Here, we report on a specific prognostic study on stroke patients and describe how we explored the prediction performance of our model. We considered two practically highly relevant generalization aspects, namely, the model's performance in patients recruited at a later time point (temporal transportability) and in medical centers different from those used for model building (geographic transportability). To estimate the accuracy of the model, we investigated classical internal validation techniques and leave-one-center-out cross validation (CV). Prognostic models predicting functional independence of stroke patients were developed in a training set using logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests (RFs). Tenfold CV and leave-one-center-out CV were employed to estimate temporal and geographic transportability of the models. For temporal and external validation, the resulting models were used to classify patients from a later time point and from different clinics. When applying the regression model or the RFs, accuracy in the temporal validation data was well predicted from classical internal validation. However, when predicting geographic transportability all approaches had difficulties. We observed that the leave-one-center-out CV yielded better estimates than classical CV. On the basis of our results, we conclude that external validation in patients from different clinics is required before a prognostic model can be applied in practice. Even validating the model in patients recruited merely at a later time point does not suffice to predict how it may fare with regard to another clinic. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

One way of increasing the dependability is through improved maintenance and failure management. The collection and processing of information to ascertain the condition of railway infrastructure allows remedial action to be undertaken in a more efficient manner. This paper describes the development of a condition monitoring system based on pattern recognition for detecting and diagnosing point machine failures. It is shown that initially, when data is acquired from a point machine, it is difficult to detect faults. However, upon the application of a moving average filter, fault conditions can be more straightforwardly detected and diagnosed. Using data collected from a set of points under test it is shown that all potentially tested failure modes can be successfully detected and diagnosed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Advanced signal processing and fault diagnosis in condition monitoring	INSIGHT			English	Article						higher; real and complex order derivatives; vibration analysis; linguistic equations; fuzzy logic and condition monitoring		Advanced signal processing methods combined with automatic fault detection enable reliable condition monitoring even when long periods of continuous operation are required. The parameters x((3)) and x((4)) are very suitable for the condition monitoring of slowly rotating bearings, as although the acceleration pulses are weak and occur at long intervals, the changes in acceleration are rapid and become emphasised upon differentiation of the signal x((2)). Grounds for the need of x((-11)) signals, ie integration of displacement n times with respect to time, have been indicated. In addition, derivatives where the order is a real number alpha or a complex number (alpha+beta i have been developed. These signals can be utilised in process or machine operation by combining the features obtained from the derivatives. The importance of each derivative is defined by weight factors. Dimensionless indices are obtained by comparing each feature value with the corresponding value it? normal operation. These indices provide useful information on different faults, and even more sensitive solutions can be obtained by selecting suitable features. Widely used root-mean-square values are important in many applications, but the importance of the peak values increases in slowly rotating machines. Further details can be introduced by analysing the distributions of the signals. The features are generated directly from the higher order derivatives of the acceleration signals, and the model can be based on data or expertise. The intelligent models extend the idea of dimensionless indices to nonlinear systems. Variation with time can be handled as uncertainty by presenting the indices as time-varying fuzzy numbers. The classification limits can also be considered fuzzy. The reasoning system will produce degrees of membership for different cases. Practical long-term tests have been performed e.g. for fault diagnosis in bearings, cogwheels, gear boxes, electric motors and supporting rolls, and for cavitation in turbines and pumps.

J	Cao, JJ; Zhang, PL; Ren, GQ; Fu, JP				Cao Jianjun; Zhang Peilin; Ren Guoquan; Fu Jianping			Decentralized and overall condition monitoring system for large-scale mobile and complex equipment	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS			English	Article						condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; micro control unit; information fusion		It is an urgent project to realize online and overall condition monitoring and timely fault diagnosis for large-scale mobile and complex equipment. Moreover, most of the existing large-scale complex equipment has quite insufficient accessibility of examination, although it still has quite a long service life. The decentralized and overall condition monitoring, as a new concept, is proposed from the point of view of the whole system. A set of complex equipment is divided into several parts in terms of concrete equipment. Every part is processed via one detecting unit, and the main detecting unit is connected with other units. The management work and communications with the remote monitoring center have been taken on by it. Consequently, the difficulty of realizing a condition monitoring system and the complexity of processing information is reduced greatly. Furthermore, excellent maintainability of the condition monitoring system is obtained because of the modularization design. Through an application example, the design and realization of the decentralized and overall condition monitoring system is introduced specifically. Some advanced technologies, such as, micro control unit (MCU), advanced RISC machines (ARM), and control area network (CAN), have been adopted in the system. The system's applicability for the existing large-scale mobile and complex equipment is tested.

In this paper, an approach is developed for cutting force control of CNC machine. Several linear models are identified based on different working conditions. A dominant model plus uncertain terms is derived from these model set, to yield the necessary and key information from the system. Subsequently, it is used as a state estimator, and robust control is carried out by using the observed variables and cutting force. The developed approach is applied to a milling machine center. Examples taken from experimental tests shown that the developed approach is effective for the uncertain CNC machine. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Electronic prognostics - A case study using global positioning system (GPS)	MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY			English	Article								Prognostic health management (PHM) of electronic systems presents challenges traditionally viewed as either insurmountable or otherwise not worth the cost of pursuit. Recent changes in weapons platform acquisition and support requirements have spurred renewed interest in electronics PHM, revealing possible applications, accessible data sources, and previously unexplored predictive techniques. The approach, development, and validation of electronic prognostics for a radio frequency (RF) system are discussed in this paper. Conventional PHM concepts are refined to develop a three-tier failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The proposed method identifies prognostic features by performing device, circuit, and system-level modeling. Accelerated failure testing validates the identified prognostic features. The results of the accelerated failure tests accurately predict the remaining useful life of a commercial off the shelf (COTS) GPS receiver to within +/- 5 thermal cycles. The solution has applicability to a broad class of mixed digital/analog circuitry, including radar and software defined radio. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Feng, K; Mao, WS; Yuan, ZQ; Yu, T				Feng, Kang; Mao, Wang Shu; Yuan, Zhu Qing; Yu, Tan			Study of an onboard information platform for a grain combine harvester	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						combine harvester; fault diagnosis; GPS; GSM; precision agriculture; yield estimation	YIELD MONITORING-SYSTEM	Wheat is the main grain crop in China. The planted area has increased to more than 300 million mu (about 20 million ha) and the rate of machinery harvest has reached about 80%. It is difficult to provide accurate information of wheat yield per mu in different areas. This makes national macro-management and safeguarding food security difficult. The combine harvester onboard information platform studied in this paper has two functions. First, it detects geographical information, harvested area and crop yield per mu and, second it reports the state of the harvester and diagnoses faults. The information platform provides service information for the driver which improves reliability. In addition, it can send this information to an information centre through a GSM (mobile phone) message module, and this centre can forward the information to Government administration and research institutes through the network. The onboard information platform cored with SCM 8OC196 confirms geographical information of the harvester by GPS (,global positioning system) to create an electronic map of the harvest area with actual harvest width and distance of travel. With measurements taken when unloading the grain, crop yield per mu can be calculated and the running status of the harvester as well as fault diagnosis through monitoring sensors can be appraised. Experiment shows that the measurement accuracy of harvest area and thus of yield per mu is about 95%.

In this work, a MultiLabel approach that makes use of support vector machines as the learning algorithm is employed to arrange a novel fault diagnosis system (FDS). The FDS is trained to address a difficult control case study from industry widely studied in the literature, the Tennessee Eastman process. Successful results have been obtained when diagnosing up to four simultaneous faults. These results are very promising since they have been obtained by just using simple training sets consisting of single faults, thus proving a very high learning capacity.

Such biosignatures are important for vaccine validation and to provide risk stratification to a population such as for the identification of individuals who are exposed to biological or chemical agents and who are at high risk for developing an infection. The research goal is to detect broad based biosignature models and is initially focused on developing effective computer-augmented pathology tied to animal models developed at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Using lung tissue from infected and naive mice, feature extraction from images of the tissue under a specialized microscope, and Bayesian networks to analyze the data sets of features, we were able to differentiate normal from diseased samples and viral from bacterial samples in mid to late stages of infection. This effort has shown the potential effectiveness of computer-augmented pathology in this application. The extended research intends to couple analysis of serum, microarray analysis of organs, proteomic data and the pathology. The rational for the current invasive procedure on animal models is to facilitate the development of data analysis and machine learning techniques that can eventually be generalized to the task of discovering non-invasive and early stage biosignatures for human models.

Development of an expert system for fault diagnosis in scooter engine platform using fuzzy-logic inference	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; fuzzy logic inference; adaptive order tracking; acoustic emission	ORDER-TRACKING TECHNIQUE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ALGORITHM	In the present study, a fault diagnosis system using acoustic emission with an adaptive order tracking technique and fuzzy-logic interference for a scooter platform is described. Order tracking of acoustic or vibration signal is a well-known technique that can be used for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Unfortunately, most of the conventional order-tracking methods are primarily based on Fourier analysis with the revolution of the machinery. Thus, the frequency smearing effect often arises in some critical conditions. In the present study, the order tracking problem is treated as the tracking of frequency-varying bandpass signals and the order amplitudes can be calculated with high resolution. The order amplitude figures are then used for creating the data bank in the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis system. A fuzzy-logic inference is proposed to develop the diagnostic rules of the data base in the present fault diagnosis system. The experimental works are carried to evaluate the effect of the proposed system for fault diagnosis in a scooter platform under various operation conditions. The experimental results indicated that the proposed expert system is effective for increasing accuracy in fault diagnosis of scooters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jamieson, GA				Jamieson, Greg A.			Ecological interface design for petrochemical process control: An empirical assessment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						graphical user interfaces; petroleum industry; process control; man-machine systems	OPERATOR ADAPTATION; INFORMATION; DIAGNOSIS	Abnormal events in process plants cost the petrochemical industry billions of dollars annually. In part, these events are difficult to deal with because contemporary interfaces do not adequately inform operators about the state of the process. Laboratory simulator studies have shown that, in comparison with contemporary interfaces, ecological interfaces can lead to more effective monitoring and control behavior. However, ecological interfaces derived from work-domain analysis differ from more traditional human-centered interfaces that use a task analysis to inform the design process. A companion paper demonstrated an ecological interface that integrates both work-domain- and task-based information. A second ecological interface was created, drawing exclusively from the traditional work-domain-based analysis. Professional operators used the novel interfaces in an industrial petrochemical process simulator to monitor for, diagnose, and respond to several types of process events. Operators using the work-domain-based ecological interface completed trials more quickly and executed fewer control actions than their counterparts using the current process displays. Operators using the integrated (task- and work-domain-based) ecological interface also showed these benefits and, in addition, showed improved fault diagnoses and better performance scores. The implications and opportunities for introducing ecological interfaces into industrial control rooms are discussed.

The model is validated by prediction of false alarms (also known as false positives, type 1, or alpha errors) in the left generator shaft of a Sikorsky helicopter UH-60, using the Goodrich health and usage management system (HUMS). The paper presents one of the first approaches based on applying discriminant analysis for prognostics of avionic systems, specifically in the context of identifying false positives within the next I or 2 h. In practice, predictions for the next 2 It are sufficient as typical helicopter flight schedules and durations are such that up to 2 h advance notice is most useful. This is an important contribution because drive train components of helicopters are normally very robust with very rare failures; therefore, the cost of unnecessary preventive maintenance based on false alarms is very high.

Diagnostics of induction machines with incipient rotor cage faults using the neutral voltage	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-IREE			English	Article						incipient fault; broken rotor bars; induction machine; neutral voltage; diagnosis	BROKEN BARS	Most of rotor related faults in three phase induction motors are due to broken rotor bars and end rings. The approach used in this paper to detect incipient broken rotor bars is based on the analysis of the voltage taking place between the supply and the stator neutrals. Broken rotor bars cause asymmetries in the mutual inductance of the machine, which give rise to harmonic components in the neutral voltage. In this work a theoretical analysis is proposed in order to depict all harmonic components related to the rotor detects. The examination of these harmonics shown to enclose reliable information on the condition of the machine, from which a generalized formula has been developed. Experimental and simulation results obtained confirm the aforementioned study. Copyright (C) 2007 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

J	Yang, Y; Yu, DJ; Cheng, JS				Yang, Yu; Yu, Dejie; Cheng, Junsheng			A fault diagnosis approach for roller bearing based on IMF envelope spectrum and SVM	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						fault diagnosis; roller bearing; IMF envelope spectrum; EMD; SVM	VIBRATION	Targeting the modulation characteristics of roller bearing fault vibration signals, a method of fault feature extraction based on intrinsic mode function (IMF) envelope spectrum is proposed to overcome the limitations of conventional envelope analysis method. By utilizing the proposed feature extraction method, the disadvantages of conventional envelope analysis method such as the chosen of central frequency of filter with experience in advance, looking for spectral line of fault characteristic frequencies in envelope spectrum and so on could be overcome. Firstly, the original modulation signals are decomposed into a number of IMFs by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Secondly, the ratios of amplitudes at the different fault characteristic frequencies in the envelope spectra of some IMFs that include dominant fault information are defined as the characteristic amplitude ratios. Finally, the characteristic amplitude ratios serve as the fault characteristic vectors to be input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and the work condition and fault patterns of the roller bearings are identified. Since the recognition results are available directly from the output of the SVM classifiers, the proposed diagnosis method provides the possibility to fulfill the automatic recognition to machinery faults.

J	Pennacch, P; Vania, A; Bachschmid, N				Pennacch, Paolo; Vania, Andrea; Bachschmid, Nicolo			Increasing the robustness of fault identification in rotor dynamics by means of M-estimators	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						robust estimation; m-estimator; identification; diagnostics; rotor dynamics; unbalance	LARGE ROTATING MACHINERY; MODAL REPRESENTATION; SUPPORTING STRUCTURE; LEAST-SQUARES; SYSTEM	One of the most common problems in rotor dynamics is the identification of faults and model-based methods are often used for this purpose. In some applications, the least-squares (LS) estimate is used to find out the position and the severity of impending faults on the basis of experimental vibration data of rotating machinery. Anyhow LS are not very robust with respect to possible outliers (noise and gross errors) in the experimental data and to inaccuracies in the model. The introduction of weights in the LS algorithm has proven to be effective in increasing the robustness and successful experimental cases, both on test rigs and on real machines, are reported in literature. However, the arbitrary choice of the weights is normally based on operators' experience. In this paper, an improvement is presented by introducing a method that is robust in itself, the M-estimate, which allows defining automatically the weights. This method is general and can be applied in every problem of regression or estimation, not necessarily related to rotor dynamics. The fundamental theoretical aspects are introduced in the first part, while several experimental test cases are presented by means of fault identification on a test rig and on a gas turbo generator in the second part of the paper. The obtained results highlight the increasing of the accuracy allowed by M-estimate. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Design of intelligent fault diagnostic system (FDS)	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION			English	Article						FDS; fault diagnostic; real-time operation support; maintenance analyzer	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; WAVELET ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; PLANTS	This research work presents useful framework and mechanism for integrated fault diagnostic system, or FDS. The proposed system is composed of three major subsystems: fault detection, root cause and consequence analyzer, and maintenance analyzer. Learning mechanisms are proposed to extract knowledge about deviations/failure modes from real time process and equipment monitoring data. Fault semantic network is proposed to represent failure modes and fault propagation models as integrated with process and equipment models. Qualitative rules are defined and associated with fault semantic networks for practical Actual maintenance findings are used to tune training data for more accurate fault detection and root cause and consequence analysis. Case study is used to illustrate the proposed idea.
