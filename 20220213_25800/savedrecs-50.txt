Measurement of the resulting high-frequency negative-sequence current (or alternatively of the negative-sequence impedance) is used to detect turn faults at an incipient stage. Though sharing the same physical principles of similar techniques applied to,line-connected machines' the use of a high-frequency signal will be shown to present important advantages, such as providing the same performance almost independently of the fundamental excitation frequency, and drastically reducing the sensitivity to the working condition of the machine, i.e., torque and flux levels.

The DDAS consists of a vehicle diagnostic agent and a number of signal diagnostic agents,each of which is reponsible for the fault diagnosis of one particular, signal using either a single or multiple signals depending on the complexity of signal faults. Each signal diagnostic agent is developed using common framework that involves signal segmentation, a utomatic signal feature extraction and selection, and machine learning. The signal diagnostic agents can concurrently execute their tasks; some agents possess information concerning the cause of faults for other agents, while other agents merely report symptoms. Together, these signal agents present a full picture of the behavior of the vehicle under diagnosis to the vehicle diagnostic a of diagnostics agent DDAS provides three levels decisions: signal-segment fault, signal fault, and vehicle fault. DDAS is scalable and versatile and has been implemented for fault detection of electronic control unit (ECU) signals; experiment results are presented and discussed in this paper.

J	Baydar, N; Ball, A				Baydar, N; Ball, A			Detection of gear failures via vibration and acoustic signals using wavelet transform	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Vibration analysis is widely used in machinery diagnostics and the wavelet transform has also been implemented in many applications in the condition monitoring of machinery. In contrast to previous applications, this paper examines whether acoustic signal can be used effectively along vibration signal to detect the various local faults in gearboxes using the wavelet transform. Two commonly encountered local faults, tooth breakage and tooth crack, were simulated. The results from acoustic signals were compared with vibration signals. The results suggest that acoustic signals are very affective for the early detection of faults and may provide a powerful tool to indicate the various types of progressing faults in gearboxes.

J	El-Ghamry, MH; Reuben, RL; Steel, JA				El-Ghamry, MH; Reuben, RL; Steel, JA			The development of automated pattern recognition and statistical feature isolation techniques for the diagnosis of reciprocating machinery faults using acoustic emission	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							KNOCK DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION	This work presents techniques which can be used for the diagnosis of faults in reciprocating machines. The techniques are generic in nature but the applications considered here concentrate on the interrogation of acoustic emission (AE) signals acquired from three types of reciprocating machine under normal running and with various fault conditions. Analysis of the signals in the time domain enables identification of machine timing, which can then be used to isolate automatically those parts of the signal associated with specific mechanical events. Various statistical feature isolation and pattern recognition techniques are then used on a selected time window of the signal to identify machine fault conditions. The applications considered demonstrate the generic nature of this approach, which could be applied to the monitoring of many types of machines and faults using a variety of sensor data. The ultimate aim of the work, of which this paper is a part, is to provide a means of on-line automatic monitoring of reciprocating machines using AE without recourse to any additional sensors.

An efficient condition monitoring scheme is capable of providing warning and predicting the faults at early stages. The monitoring system obtains information about the machine in the form of primary data and through the use of modern signal processing techniques; it is possible to give vital information to equipment operator before it catastrophically fails. The suitability of a signal processing technique to be used depends upon the nature of the signal and the required accuracy of the obtained information. Therefore, in this paper, signals obtained from the monitoring system are treated with different processing techniques with suitably modified algorithms to extract detailed information for machine health diagnosis. In this study, on-line analysis of the acquired signals has been performed using c(+ +), while MATLAB has been used to perform the off-line analysis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Benbouzid, MEH; Kliman, GB				Benbouzid, MEH; Kliman, GB			What stator current processing-based technique to use for induction motor rotor faults diagnosis?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						induction motor; rotor fault diagnosis; stator current	SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; MACHINES	In recent years, marked improvement has been achieved in the design and manufacture of stator winding. However, motors driven by solid-state inverters undergo severe voltage stresses due to rapid switch-on and switch-off of semiconductor switches. Also, induction motors are required to operate in highly corrosive and dusty environments. Requirements such as these have spurred the development of vastly improved insulation material and treatment processes. But cage rotor design has undergone little change. As a result, rotor failures now account for a larger percentage of total induction motor failures. Broken cage bars and bearing deterioration are now the main cause of rotor failures. Moreover, with advances in digital technology over the last years, adequate data processing capability is now available on cost-effective hardware platforms, to monitor motors for a variety of abnormalities on a real time basis in addition to the normal motor protection functions. Such multifunction monitors are now starting to displace the multiplicity of electromechanical devices commonly applied for many years. For such reasons, this paper is devoted to a comparison of signal processing-based techniques for the detection of broken bars and bearing deterioration in induction motors. Features of these techniques which are relevant to fault detection are presented.

The topic has attracted researchers to work in during the past few years because of its great influence on the operational continuation of many industrial processes. Correct diagnosis and early detection of incipient faults result in fast unscheduled maintenance and short down time for the machine under consideration. It also avoids harmful, sometimes devastative, consequences and helps reduce financial loss. Reduction of the human experts involvement in the diagnosis process has gradually taken place upon the recent developments in the modern artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy and adaptive fuzzy systems, and expert systems are good candidates for the automation of the diagnostic procedures. This present work surveys the principles and criteria of the diagnosis process. It introduces the current research achievements to apply AI techniques in the diagnostic systems of electrical machines and drives.

Being dependent on both stator and rotor currents, the torque is very sensitive to faults in the rotor. Through a comparative study using a detailed machine model and the standard dq model, the paper shows that the characteristic frequencies generated by a particular fault are preserved even if the standard dq model is used for estimation of air-gap torque. This is validated through a practical hardware implementation for online spectrum estimation of air-gap torque using TMS320C31, where several faulted cage rotors were used for study.

A mathematical transformation is defined and applied to the classical abc model equations. All parameters which affect this new model can be known online. This makes the model very useful for control algorithms and fault detection and isolation algorithms. The model is checked by comparing simulation data with actual data obtained from laboratory experiments.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						blind source separation (BSS); denoising; fault detection; monitoring; rotating machines	SIGNAL SEPARATION; STABILITY	Blind source separation (BSS) is a general signal processing method, which consists of recovering from A finite set of observations recorded by sensors, the contributions of different physical sources independently of the propagation medium and without any a priori knowledge of the sources. Recently, these methods paved a new way for the monitoring or the diagnosis of mechanical systems in, a working environment. Actually, We show that BSS allows recovering the vibratory information issued from a single rotating machine working in a noisy environment by freeing the sensor signal from the contribution of other working machines. In that way, BSS can be used as a pre-processing step for rotating machine fault detection and diagnosis.

These machines are structurally very robust and are a primary source of motive power and speed control where de machines cannot be used. For closed-loop control of these machines, sensorless speed estimation is usually preferred. Among the current estimation techniques available for speed-sensorless induction motor drives, speed measurement based on rotor-slot-related harmonic detection in machine line current happens to be a prominent one. While these harmonics can be strong in certain kinds of machines, some other machines may exhibit very weak rotor slot harmonics that can be obscured by noise Skewing, slot shapes and types, structural unbalances, etc., also have a prominent effect on the detectability of these harmonics. This paper attempts to investigate this problem based on the interaction of pole pairs, number of rotor bars, and stator winding. Although the analysis and experimental results have been mainly provided for three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors, single-phase and slip-ring induction motors have also been addressed. Further, it has been shown that eccentricity-related fault detection could also be easily accommodated with this kind of speed detection technique at no or negligible extra cost when certain motors are selected.

However, for closed-loop drives, the power supply is a regulated current source and, hence, the-motor voltages must also be monitored for fault information. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network scheme for turn-fault detection in line-connected induction machines is extended to inverter-fed machines, with special emphasis on closed-loop drives. Experimental results are provided to illustrate that the method is impervious to machine and instrumentation nonidealities, and that it requires lesser data memory and computation requirements than existing schemes, which are based on data lookup tables.

Due to the destructive and rapidly propagating nature of insulation failure, it is critical to detect turn faults in an early stage to prevent further damage to the motor. The motor nonidealities such as the variation in the supply voltage unbalance, slip-dependent influence of inherent motor asymmetry, and measurement errors must be taken into account in order to reliably detect a turn fault in its incipient stage. Simulation and experimental results on a 5 hp induction machine are given to confirm the validity of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed turn fault detection scheme is simple and is capable of providing reliable fault detection that is immune to the motor nonidealities.

The work presented here focuses on detecting errors in the transformer coupled power (TCP) measurement and pressure sensor, though the method has potential for several other sensors. To improve the detection sensitivity, we used real-time machine input estimation, and compared it against actual recipe settings instead of employing - the raw rf signals directly. For a main etch process on a Lam TCP 9400SE, +/- 10% relative deviations in TCP measurement, or +/- 25% in pressure, can be detected with high accuracy: Detection probability P-D approximate to 1 and false alarm rate P-F approximate to 0 for both.

J	Cheng, LC; Kwok, KE; Huang, B; Li, P				Cheng, LC; Kwok, KE; Huang, B; Li, P			Improved threshold for the local approach in detecting faults	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; PAPER	Fault detection and isolation (FDI) has become a critical issue for increasing availability, reliability, and production safety in industrial process monitoring. While model-based FDI methods rely on the mathematical model and input-output data of a process to perform detection, the local approach is a new model-based FDI method that aims to detect slight changes of parametric properties of a system. Robustness with respect to model uncertainties is an important issue for the local approach. To reduce false alarms caused by the estimation error of process parameters, a new algorithm is proposed to recalculate the threshold based on the original threshold and covariance matrix of the estimated parameters. A similar algorithm is also provided to recalculate the threshold to reduce false alarms due to regular parameter fluctuations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is shown by simulation studies on a papermaking cross-direction control system.

This study concerns the detection of different land degradation stages in semi-arid grassland areas in the upper Mbuluzi-river catchment (Kingdom of Swaziland). It has been carried out within the framework of an interdisciplinary EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated water resources management system (IWRMS) for water resources analyses and prognostic scenario planning in semi-arid catchments of Southern Africa (Flugel et al., 2001 URL: http://www.iwrms.uni-jena.de/download/Eu-reports/report_final.pdf). Within this more general framework, particular attention was focused on the determination of high-resolution morphometric parameters for detailed erosion process studies, as well as on the derivation of relationships between vegetation cover and bare soil. The latter has subsequently been used to delineate the vegetation cover density and C-factor values for erosion models such as the revised universal soil loss equation. The examples from Southern Africa show that the methods applied are able to identify areas affected by different types of erosion. Furthermore, it is possible to estimate the parameters for a subsequent erosion modelling. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Lee, YJ; Mangasarian, OL; Wolberg, WH				Lee, YJ; Mangasarian, OL; Wolberg, WH			Survival-time classification of breast cancer patients	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						breast cancer; support vector machines; multicategory classification	DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE	The identification of breast cancer patients for whom chemotherapy could prolong survival time is treated here as a data mining problem. This identification is achieved by clustering 253 breast cancer patients into three prognostic groups: Good, Poor and Intermediate. Each of the three groups has a significantly distinct Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Of particular significance is the Intermediate group, because patients with chemotherapy in this group do better than those without chemotherapy in the same group. This is the reverse case to that of the overall population of 253 patients for which patients undergoing chemotherapy have worse survival than those who do not. We also prescribe a procedure that utilizes three nonlinear smooth support vector machines (SSVMs) for classifying breast cancer patients into the three above prognostic groups. These results suggest that the patients in the Good group should not receive chemotherapy while those in the Intermediate group should receive chemotherapy based on our survival curve analysis. To our knowledge this is the first instance of a classifiable group of breast cancer patients for which chemotherapy can possibly enhance survival.

Experimental results concerning fault detection in an induction motor are presented as an example illustrating how the immune-based system operates, discussing its capabilities, drawbacks, and future developments.

A complicated machining system usually contains multiple stages. When the workpiece passes through multiple stages, machining errors at each stage will be accumulated and transformed onto the workpiece. Differential motion vector, a concept from the robotics field, is used in this model as the state vector to represent the geometric deviation of the workpiece. The deviation accumulation and transformation are quantitatively described by the state transition in the state space model. A systematic procedure that builds the model is presented and an experimental validation is also conducted. The validation result is satisfactory. This model has great potential to be applied to fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complicated machining processes.

J	Deshpande, VS; Modak, JP				Deshpande, VS; Modak, JP			Maintenance strategy for tilting table of rolling mill based on reliability considerations	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						reliability centred maintenance; rolling mill		Reliability centred maintenance (RCM) is a new strategic framework for ensuring that any asset continues to perform, as its users want it to perform. RCM is a process used to determine the maintenance requirement of any physical asset in its operating context. RCM process entails asking seven questions about each of the selected assets. It makes use of two documents namely, RCM information worksheet and RCM decision worksheet. RCM decision diagram integrates all the decision processes into a single strategic framework. RCM concept developed by US commercial airlines industry has been successfully implemented by Military, Navy, Nuclear power plants, electric power generation and distribution undertakings and several other sectors. These projects have been carried out in the United Kingdom, The Republic of Ireland, the United States, Hong Kong, Australia, Spain and Singapore. The fact that people has enthusiastically received RCM at all levels and has enabled users to achieve some remarkable successes in all of these countries, suggests that it can be universally employed. Literature review indicates that RCM approach is not conventionally applied in process industries in India. Presently, predictive maintenance (PDM) approach along with conventional preventive maintenance is used in continuous/process industries. This approach if implemented in totality will increase the production cost to a large degree and make the production uneconomical. Similarly breakdown maintenance (BDM) approach cannot be applied in such industries as each breakdown involves huge costs. REM approach is a compromise between PDM and BDM approach for optimising the cost and ensuring the availability of machine. The RCM approach has been applied to the tilting table system of rolling mill for the research work reported in this paper. In the present study, preventive maintenance tasks suggested for power transmission subsystem, guiding and transportation subsystem and hydraulic subsystem in tilting tables are 14 scheduled on-condition tasks, 10 scheduled on-restoration tasks, seven scheduled discard task. Whereas for 14 failure modes no scheduled maintenance has been proposed. Existing maintenance schedule for tilting tables indicates the maintenance action as and when required. Hence RCM based schedule specifies that additional preventive maintenance tasks need to be executed as compared to none initially. Cost incurred for this can be offset from the savings accrued from reduction in loss of production due to repetitive breakdowns. The methodology of RCM adopted in western industries cannot be applied as it is to Indian industries because of labour oriented nature, partially computerised information systems, non-availability of the information about cost of loss of production due to breakdown and age-reliability pattern of equipment, insufficient maintenance database. These problems can be overcome by development of sound MMIS, formulation of RCM review group and imparting suitable training to acquire the relevant skills in RCM. Thus RCM methodology can be applied to Indian industry for reduction of breakdowns as well as optimisation of preventive maintenance cost. This can further boost up the prospects of Indian industry to offer the products at globally competitive prices. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of these sensors, conductivity sensors are particularly susceptible to biofouling, which gradually degrades sensor response and corrupts critical data. Several weeks may pass before degradation is visibly detected. Since the onset time of biofouling is unknown, an indeterminate amount of measurement data is corrupted. To speed detection and minimize data loss, we develop automatic biofouling detectors based on machine learning approaches for these conductivity sensors. We demonstrate that our detectors identify biofouling at least as reliably as human experts. In addition, these detectors provide accurate estimates of biofouling onset time. Real-time detectors installed during the summer of 2001 produced no false alarms yet detected all episodes of sensor degradation before the field staff.

J	Benbouzid, MEH				Benbouzid, MEH			The H-G diagram model for induction motors analysis: Theoretical approach and applications	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						induction motor; H-G diagram; parameter identification; thermal monitoring; saturation; diagnosis	REFERENCE ADAPTIVE SYSTEM; FIELD-ORIENTED CONTROL; ROTOR RESISTANCE; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; DRIVE SYSTEMS; MACHINES; IDENTIFICATION; SATURATION; SENSITIVITY; OBSERVER	This article presents theory and applications of a practical approach for induction motors modeling under temperature and saturation effects. This approach is based on the so-called H-G diagram that is established from the induction motor measurement analysis of the active and reactive power consumption for each operating point. In practice, this diagram is a circle plotted in the complex plane. The distinct feature of this circle is its diameter that is time-varying with the induction motor temperature and saturation states. In fact, these two effects are both interfering and conjugate, and only an online plotted circle will allow taking them into account. Since the H-G diagram is characterized by three parameters, especially the rotor ones, it constitutes an interesting tool to achieve the identification of online motor parameters. This possibility has led us to apply this diagram for induction motor control and faults diagnosis, especially in the rotor. Moreover, it can easily be applied for modeling saturation, which will refine the control and diagnosis processes. Computer simulations and experimental tests, carried out on a 4-kW and a 0.75 four-pole squirrel cage induction motors, provide an encouraging validation of the H-G diagram. applications. The results obtained clearly point out the distinct features, simplicity and accuracy, of the proposed approach.

J	Muller, GH; Landy, CF				Muller, GH; Landy, CF			A novel method to detect broken rotor bars in squirrel cage induction motors when interbar currents are present	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						ac machines; failure analysis; fault diagnosis; induction machines; monitoring; prediction methods; rotating machines; spectral analysis; vibration measurement; windings	CONNECTORS; DIAGNOSIS; FAULTS	The paper details the theoretical and experimental investigation into the axial force produced by broken rotor bars on copper cage rotors. It introduces interbar current theory and the overall fault progression of broken rotor bars. The paper also presents a mathematical model showing that interbar currents interact with stator flux to produce a force in the axial direction. To substantiate the model, the paper provides experimental results on several motors having broken rotor bars. The experimental results verify the frequencies postulated in the mathematical model. The measurements also show that these components are load dependent and due to interbar currents in the rotor. The experimental results suggest a new method to detect for broken rotor bars based on the presence of interbar currents. This method may be used to aid the existing methods used today.

With the proposed techniques it is possible to detect and identify the power switch in which the fault has occurred. Such detection requires the measurement of some voltages and is based on the analytical model of the voltage source inverter. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed techniques. The results obtained so far indicate that it is possible to embed some fault-tolerant properties for the voltage-fed asynchronous machine drive system.

Yet humans like many other animals are able to integrate effortlessly the multitude of cues arriving at their ears, and to derive coherent percepts and judgments about the different attributes of each source. This facility to analyze an auditory scene is conceptually based on a multi-stage process in which sound is first analyzed in terms of a relatively few perceptually significant attributes (the alphabet of auditory perception), followed by higher level integrative processes that organize and group the extracted attributes according to specific context-sensitive rules (the syntax of auditory perception) [1]. The sound received at the two ears is processed for attributes including source location, acoustic ambience, and source attributes such as tone and pitch, timbre and intensity. Decades of physiological and psychoacoustical studies [2,3] have revealed elegant strategies at various stages of the mammalian auditory system for the representation of the signal cues underlying auditory perception. This information has facilitated the development of biophysical models, mathematical abstractions, and computational algorithms of the early and central auditory stages with the aim of capturing the functionality, robustness' and enormous versatility of the auditory system [4]. Numerous groups have implemented such algorithms in software and hardware, and have evaluated them by comparing their performance,to, human performance and against a range of robustness and flexibility requirements. Furthermore, these auditory-inspired processing strategies have-been utilized in a wide range of applications including acoustic diagnostic monitoring systems for machines and manufacturing processes, battlefield acoustic signal analysis, sound analysis and recognition systems, robust detection and recognition of multiple. interacting faults, and detection and recognition of underwater transients and weak signals in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in acoustically-cluttered environments [5,6]. We-shall briefly review the auditory encoding of various sound attributes to illustrate the. above ideas. We shall specifically focus on the percept of sound timbre: what acoustic cues are most intimately correlated with it? How are they represented at various stages of the auditory pathway? And how the abstracted auditory signal processing algorithms and representations can be applied to measure speech intelligibility, to describe musical timbre and to analyze complex auditory scenes?

J	Samanta, B; Al-Balushi, KR				Samanta, B; Al-Balushi, KR			Artificial neural network based fault diagnostics of rolling element bearings using time-domain features	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							DRILL WEAR; CLASSIFICATION	A procedure is presented for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings through artificial neural network (ANN). The characteristic features of time-domain vibration signals of the rotating machinery with normal and defective bearings have been used as inputs to the ANN consisting of input, hidden and output layers. The features are obtained from direct processing of the signal segments using very simple preprocessing. The input layer consists of five nodes, one each for root mean square, variance, skewness, kurtosis and normalised sixth central moment of the time-domain vibration signals. The inputs are normalised in the range of 0.0 and 1.0 except for the skewness which is normalised between -1.0 and 1.0. The output layer consists of two binary nodes indicating the status of the machine-normal or defective bearings. Two hidden layers with different number of neurons have been used. The ANN is trained using backpropagation algorithm with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANN is tested using the remaining set of data. The effects of some preprocessing techniques like high-pass, band-pass filtration, envelope detection (demodulation) and wavelet transform of the vibration signals, prior to feature extraction, are also studied. The results show the effectiveness of the ANN in diagnosis of the machine condition. The proposed procedure requires only a few features extracted from the measured vibration data either directly or with simple preprocessing. The reduced number of inputs leads to faster training requiring far less iterations making the procedure suitable for on-line condition monitoring and diagnostics of machines.

J	Alexandru, M				Alexandru, M			Analysis of induction motor fault diagnosis with fuzzy neural network	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								The online diagnosis of an electrical drive is the first step towards the application of an effective predictive maintenance plan on such electrical machines. The analysis of residual features corresponding to instrumentation faults of an induction motor lead to the design of a faults classification system. The training set is obtained by a faulted machine dynamical model as simulator. Two neuro-fuzzy structures will be conceived to learn the exact input-output relation of the fault detection process for induction motor, using measured data. The first neuro-fuzzy architecture maps the residuals into two classes: one of fixed direction residuals and another of faults belonging to velocity sensor. The second adaptive neuro-fuzzy network will provide updated membership functions of the sets of fixed oriented residuals that better describe the fault diagnosis map.

Different methods of fault identification have been developed and used effectively to detect the machine faults at an early stage using different machine quantities, such as current, voltage, speed, efficiency, temperature and vibrations. One of the principal tools for diagnosing rotating machinery problems has been the vibration analysis. Through the use of different signal processing techniques, it is possible to obtain vital diagnostic information from vibration profile before the equipment catastrophically fails. A problem with diagnostic techniques is that they require constant human interpretation of the results. The logical progression of the condition monitoring technologies is the automation of the diagnostic process. The research has been underway for a long time to automate the diagnostic process. Recently, artificial intelligent tools, such as expert systems, neural network and fuzzy logic, have been widely used with the monitoring system to support the detection and diagnostic tasks.

J	McInerny, SA; Dai, Y				McInerny, SA; Dai, Y			Basic vibration signal processing for bearing fault detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION			English	Article						beirings envelope analysis; fault detection; kurtosis; spectral analysis		Faculty in the College of Engineering at the University of Alabama developed a multidisciplinary course in applied spectral analysis that Was first offered in 1996. The course is aimed at juniors majoring in electrical, mechanical, industrial, or aerospace engineering. No background in signal processing or Fourier analysis is assumed; the requisite fundamentals are covered early in the course and followed by a series of laboratories in-which the fundamental concepts are applied. In this paper, a laboratory module on fault detection in rolling element bearings is presented. This module is one of two laboratory modules focusing on machine condition monitoring applications that were developed for this course. Background on the basic operational characteristics of rolling element bearings is presented, and formulas given for the calculation of the characteristic fault frequencies. The shortcomings of conventionat vibration spectral analysis for the detection of bearing faults is examined in the context of a synthetic vibration signal that students generate in MATLAB. This signal shares several key features of vibration signatures measured on bearing housings. Envelope analysis and the connection between bearing fault signatures and amplitude modulation/demodulation is explained. Finally, a graphically driven software utility (a set of MATLAB in-files) is introduced. This software allows students to explore envelope analysis using measured data or the synthetic signal that they generated. The software utility and the material presented in this paper constitute an instructional module on bearing fault detection that can be used as a stand-alone tutorial or incorporated into a course.

J	Wang, LT; Kannatey-Asibu, E; Mehrabi, MG				Wang, LT; Kannatey-Asibu, E; Mehrabi, MG			A method for sensor selection in reconfigurable process monitoring	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							FUZZY NUMBERS	Sensor selection is important for process monitoring. Each time a machining system is reconfigured, the corresponding monitoring system needs to be re-designed for effective detection of the faults of interest. To accomplish this, a sensor selection methodology is proposed in this paper Fuzzy theory is utilized for the multi-criteria decision-making process. Evaluation criteria are selected based on a thorough study of fault characteristics. Under subjective criteria, the ratings of different sensors are evaluated using linguistic terms, which are converted to trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Under objective criteria, the fuzzy performance of each sensor is obtained directly from its specifications. The suitable sensor or sensors can be selected by aggregating and ranking the fuzzy numbers. Sensor selection in the turning process is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

J	Wang, WJ; Lin, RM				Wang, WJ; Lin, RM			The application of pseudo-phase portrait in machine condition monitoring	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							CORRELATION DIMENSION; FAULT-DETECTION; TIME-SERIES; PARAMETERS; SYSTEMS; ORDER	This paper presents a robust phase space reconstruction method based on singular value decomposition technique and its applications to large rotating machine and gear system condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. The singular value decomposition is used to determine the effective embedding space and to reduce the noise level of a measured vibration signal. Following the singular value decomposition, a pseudo-phase portrait can be obtained in the effective embedding space. This pseudo-phase portrait is then used to extract qualitative features of machine faults. Experience has shown that when one compares the pseudo-phase portraits obtained under different machine conditions, it is often possible to detect major differences due to different dynamic and kinematic mechanisms. In the case of gear system condition monitoring, correlation dimension has been introduced to evaluate these differences in order to obtain more accurate and reliable diagnosis. The pseudo-phase portrait is conceptually simple and has been found to be sensitive to some fault types. It is promising therefore that such pseudo-phase portraits can be used to realize real-time, online computer-aided diagnosis of machine faults. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A number of crack-detection technologies are currently available that are expected to achieve this objective at some level. To assess the effectiveness of each of these technologies, a seeded-fault test will be conducted on the TF-41 fan-stage disk. Using the Electro-Discharge Machining (EDM) process, a single crack-like feature (the EDM notch) was introduced at a specific location on the disk and the disk was speed cycled. Prior to the actual test, an analytical effort was accomplished to evaluate crack growth and residual strength characteristics of the disk. This was done to optimize the test plan. The results were used to select the optimum location and size of the seeded fault and estimate the number of speed cycles that would be needed before the seeded fault reaches the critical size, i.e., a crack-size corresponding to high likelihood of a disk burst. This paper discusses the analyses performed, the results obtained and the final test planning. Specific technical areas discussed include 3-D fmite-element stress analysis, stress intensity computations, 3-D crack propagation and residual strength calculations. Predictive results from the model-based analyses including sensitivity analyses are presented. This paper presents a concept on how crack detection technologies might be incorporated as part of an overall prognostic system for bladed-disk assemblies. The detection technologies in conjunction with the model-based prognostic algorithms for bladed-disk assemblies hold the promise of reducing operational risk and saving maintenance costs by allowing the maintenance personnel to shift to a condition-based maintenance paradigm rather than the traditional time-based maintenance practice.

Consistency between DT and OT is necessary to ensure that DT understands the operational implication of BIT indications and the effect of these indications on fleet maintainers and aircraft availability. Currently, the BIT metrics and their definitions are well defined; however, the criterion for scoring BIT indications as relevant for BIT fault detection, BIT fault isolation, or BIT false alarms is not well documented in Department of Defense instructions or in military or commercial standards. Several Naval aircraft platforms have addressed BIT scoring ground rules, as they apply to the individual platform; however, there are no general guidelines for this purpose. In addition, the maintenance concept of the aircraft and how the BIT indications are mechanized to support this concept needs to be integrated into the BIT evaluation criteria for each weapon system. Depending on the maintenance concept (i.e., fault isolation to the Weapons Replaceable Assembly (WRA) or Shop Replaceable Assembly (SRA)), the BIT reporting scheme and its human-machine interface design would need to be thoroughly considered when scoring the BIT indications during testing. Furthermore, a database that is tailored to the BIT reporting scheme will be essential for determining BIT performance. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how BIT is generally utilized in Naval aviation, to define common BIT definitions, to provide guidelines for scoring BIT indications, and to provide guidance on re-scoring indications when corrective actions are implemented to correct deficiencies.

C	Logan, KP			IEEE; IEEE	Logan, KP			Prognostic software agents for machinery health monitoring	2003 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-8	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 08-15, 2003	BIG SKY, MT	IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, Aerosp Corp, Analog Interfaces, AstroExpo com, Caltech, JPL, Circle Mt Co, Gandalf Associates, LLC, GEB Software Technologies, Missile Defense Agcy, NASA, Panasonic, SpectrumAstro, Superior Solut, TechLink				Increasing levels of machinery automation for systems health monitoring are providing operators with larger amounts of raw data. However, transforming massive amounts of data into information useful for effective condition-based maintenance (CBM) remains an arduous task. New technology is needed to continually monitor machinery, to identify impending failures, and to accurately predict its remaining useful life. Prognostic software agents can satisfy this growing need as higher levels of machinery automation raise the cost requirements of continuous monitoring beyond the levels of human and company feasibility. Software agent technologies that can automatically perform useful work as human assistants and can readily be integrated into existing automation system environments, represent viable tools to improve machinery reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Software agents can be used to clone human intelligence, perform human-like reasoning, and interact with human clients. Agents can perform tedious, repetitive, time-consuming, or analytically complex tasks on behalf of people who may not have the time or requisite skills to perform these tasks themselves. Agents can serve as expert assistants in monitoring, troubleshooting, and predicting failures in complex machinery processes. Imparting intelligent processing functions into software agents will allow maintenance organizations to leverage valuable "corporate" knowledge across geographically distributed machinery plants, such as aircraft or ship fleets. Agents can be distributed when and where needed to enhance fleet operations, performance, and readiness. Their intelligence can be upgraded remotely. The human-agent team can provide higher levels of productivity at practically the same cost as that of just the human resource alone. This paper describes intelligent prognostic software agents for real-time machinery monitoring applications. The main functions of the prognostic agent include machinery performance assessment, historical data archiving, automated trending analysis, alarm prediction, fault prediction, and prognostic event logging. The prognostic software agent is a generic tool for maintenance personnel to implement CBM. It predicts future machinery faults and determines when maintenance should be carried out. By predicting machinery problems before they occur, unexpected breakdowns can be avoided. In the absence of significant trends, equipment overhaul periods may be rationally extended, thereby eliminating unnecessary maintenance work. The ability to predict future maintenance requirements leads to improved maintenance planning and cost management. Maintenance and repair decisions can be tied to actual plant operating conditions based on the severity of degrading trends and predicted plant problems.

Existing health monitoring systems, such as the Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) for NAVSEA, enable the diagnosis of mission critical problems using fault detection and diagnostic technologies. These technologies, however, have not specifically focused on the automated prediction of future condition (prognostics) of a machine based on the current diagnostic state of the machinery and its available operating and failure history data. Current efforts are focused on developing a generic architecture for the development of prognostic systems that will enable "plug and play" capabilities within existing systems. The designs utilize Open System Architecture (OSA) guidelines, such as OSA-CBM (Condition Based Maintenance), to provide modularity and reusability of the software modules. One such implementation, which determines the optimal water wash interval to mitigate gas turbine compressor performance degradation due to salt deposit ingestion, is the focus of this paper. The module utilizes advanced probabilistic modeling and analysis technologies to forecast the future performance characteristics of the compressor and yield the optimal Time To Wash (TTW) from a cost/benefit standpoint. This paper describes the developed approach and architecture for developing prognostics using the gas turbine module.

The model-based effort described here is focused on prognostics for primary and secondary batteries. However, this approach can also be applied to other electrochemical energy sources such as fuel cells for performance monitoring. This method is based on accurate modeling of the transport mechanisms within the battery that requires careful development of the electrochemical models. These models have been used to develop new features to be used to assess the condition of the battery. Data fusion of feature vectors is used to develop inferences about the state of the system. The resulting output and any usage information available about the battery is then evaluated using hybrid automated reasoning schemes consisting of neural network, fuzzy logic, and decision theoretic methods. The focus of this paper is on model identification and data fusion of the monitored and virtual sensor data. In addition to modeling the main electrochemical processes, modeling of competing failure mechanisms is incorporated. Since these mechanisms dictate the remaining useful life of the battery (i.e., state-of-life) their proper identification is a critical step for prognostics. Also, data fusion processing can be used to associate the monitored and feature data to the different critical mechanisms. Examples using test data from various types of batteries such as lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, and lithium chemistries are also presented.

In particular, AE related to bearing stress from seeded fault testing conducted at Pratt and Whitney for Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM) for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF)program, AE data related to pre-fire stress from testing conducted in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center, and other potential AE data sources, are reviewed. All data were acquired with the same Robust Laser Interterometer (RLI) Research and Development (R&D) system. Selected integration considerations are outlined and examined, over the total AE environment, the correlations between and among typical measurement points and the particular stress interest, the applicability of developing appropriate databases and "a priori knowledge," fiber-optic implementation flexibility, and system growth potential. While remaining work is required for both the RLI system refinements and the development of the necessary supporting analytical tools, it has been determined that an IHM system based upon RLI technology provides a viable choice for comprehensive machinery health monitoring.

An important issue in such effort is the modeling of the induction machine including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, a new and simpler approach for the modeling of induction machines with rotor asymmetries is employed in the simulation and analysis of an induction motor with rotor asymmetries. Simulation and Finite Element Analysis results are presented to support the proposed approach.

The use of this new technique, which was recently proposed by the authors for the diagnosis of inter-turn short circuits, is extended for the detection and classification of different types of faults. Each fault causes a different disturbance or introduces different components in the motor supply currents. Based on the multiple reference frames theory, by choosing a proper reference frame, it is possible to transform each one of these current components to a d-q frame. In these d-q reference frames, those current harmonics will appear as constants, thus being easily measured, extracted or manipulated. Because each fault causes a different disturbance, the multiple reference frames technique can easily discriminate between different faults. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique for the diagnosis of stator, rotor, and airgap eccentricity faults in three-phase induction motors. Moreover, due to the operating philosophy of the multiple reference frames technique, its integration into the control system of a DTC induction motor drive is a straightforward task and is briefly addressed at the end of the paper.

Current-based condition monitoring offers significant economic savings and implementation advantages over vibration-based techniques. This method begins by filtering the stator current to remove most of the significant frequency content unrelated to bearing faults. Afterwards, the filtered stator current is used to train an autoregressive signal model. This model is first trained while the bearings are healthy, and a baseline spectrum is computed. As bearing health degrades, the modeled spectrum deviates from its baseline value; the mean spectral deviation is then used as the fault index. This fault index is able to track changes in machine vibration due to developing bearing faults. Due to the initial filtering process, this method is robust to many influences including variations in supply voltage, cyclical load torque variations, and other (non-bearing) fault sources. Experimental results from 10 different bearings are used to verify the proficiency of this method.

When the motor is disconnected from the supply no currents flow in the stator windings and the voltages measurable at its terminals are due to flux produced by rotor currents. When the rotor is healthy, the voltages measured at motor terminals are almost sinusoidal because of the symmetry of rotor windings. When there are broken rotor bars, the magneto-motive force (m.m.f.) generated by rotor windings results distorted, and some particular harmonics, contained in the voltages induced in the stator windings, increase their amplitudes. The diagnostic technique is based on monitoring these voltage harmonics and analyzing the space vector of the voltages induced in the stator windings via MUSIC pseudo-spectrum and Short-Time MUSIC (STMUSIC) time-frequency pseudo-representation. The MUSIC algorithm is based on the eigen-analysis of the autocorrelation matrix, and permits to evidence the principal harmonic frequencies of the signal and decrease the noise influence, thus allowing a better detection of the broken rotor bars. The results obtained using MUSIC and STMUSIC algorithm have been compared experimentally with those obtained by FFT and STFFT respectively, and two different sized induction motors have been tested, to demonstrate the superiority of the former approach. Differently from most of the diagnostic techniques already proposed in the technical literature, the proposed approach is effective regardless the load condition of the machine, source characteristics and iron saturation.

Initially, the stray flux is analyzed in a point outside the machine using the Biot-Savart law, taking into account the effect of the end-windings for the stator and the end-ring segments for the rotor squirrel-cage. The theoretical results are compared with experimental measurements on a healthy induction machine and on a faulty one under stator and rotor defects. The experimental tests have validated the analytical formula for the frequency of the harmonic components in the stray flux under stator and rotor electrical faults.

The proposed scheme is an off-line method based on low flux stator core excitation that employs a new probe. An iron-core probe is placed in the wedge depression area of the stator and scanned axially to detect the variation in the measured flux due to a fault. Two fault indicators that provide clear indication on fault severity and location are proposed in this paper. A 120MW AC machine stator was tested under a number of intentionally inserted fault conditions using a portable field equipment recently developed. The experimental results show that the fault existence, location, and severity can be determined reliably using the proposed scheme. It is also shown that the fault detection sensitivity and reliability, inspection speed, and user convenience are significantly enhanced.

In this technique, stator currents and voltages are used as inputs to compute and subsequently observe the rotor magnetic field orientation, which has a more significant " swing-like " pendulous oscillation in case of broken-bar faults than in healthy operation. It will be shown here that the range of this "pendulous oscillation" is a function of the number of broken-bars. Also in this technique, it was found that an inter-turn shorted stator-winding fault, which exhibits similar pendulous oscillation, could be distinguished from rotor broken-bar faults through the use of a variance index. In order to validate this method, experimental evidence is given here for several broken-bar cases in a 2-hp, 3-phase, 2-pole, squirrel cage induction machine.

We show that feeding the machine with special excitation signals (Discrete Interval Binary Sequence(DIBS) and Multisine), it is possible to excite with low frequency resolution the faulty modes by analyzing the current spectrum and the dispersion flux captured by a flux sensor. The method presented is general and may be applied to the induction machine whilst in rotation or at standstill. It is based on broadband excitation signals which are able to excite the faulty modes of devices under tests. Experimental measurements are made both on healthy and faulty machines and the comparison gives a difference in the flux and current machine signatures which is basically the most commonly used method of fault detection.

Most of these models are very application specific. None of them, however, seems to be completely adequate for the purpose of fault diagnosis. This is because for noninvasive detection technique such as Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA), one has to detect different frequency components in the line current of the machine. Since saturation is present to a certain extent in almost any machine, incorporating it in the model creates a condition to analyze and detect symptomatic harmonics in the line current spectra that may arise due to the interaction of saturation with a specific fault. The present paper attempts to create such a model. The model uses modulation of air gap permeance in order to emulate saturation. Modified winding function approach (MWFA) has been used to model the induction machine since the air gap becomes non uniform in presence of saturation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, certain high frequency harmonics that can be predicted theoretically, are shown to be present in the line current of the simulated machine. Experimental results also confirm the presence of these harmonics. The author plans to use this model in future for fault analysis.

Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) can be used for rotor and stator defects. These include stator current harmonics at frequencies (1 +/- 2s)f and also determining the negative sequence component of current space vector. Recently, deceleration tests which possibly can remove several drawbacks of MCSA have been proposed for rotor and stator fault diagnosis. This paper attempts to compare the MCSA-based diagnostic procedures with the results obtained using the deceleration tests. Experimental results show that although the deceleration test does not provide clear information on rotor defects, it provides a diagnostic index directly related to the percentage of shorted turns. This diagnostic index can be used to validate the MCSA-based diagnostic procedure.

Both stator winding fault and broken rotor bar detection is covered. Measurement of the resulting high frequency negative sequence current is shown to be capable of detecting both types of faults at their incipient stage. Though sharing similar physical principles to techniques applied to line-connected machines, the use of a high frequency signal is shown to provide important advantages for inverter fed machines, such as providing the same performance and drastically reduced sensitivity to the working condition of the machine, i.e. torque and flux levels, and fundamental excitation frequency.

The system encompasses the following steps: image and attitude recording aboard an aircraft, image preprocessing and transfer to ground, further image processing for extracting the traffic data and aggregation of traffic data and their input into newly developed simulation and prognosis tools to close the gaps between overflights. The system is completed by an open interface to service companies that support end users with traffic information and recommendations. The technological challenges were on the software side the development of appropriate fast image processing methods and new traffic simulation and prognosis tools and on the hardware side the integration of all components and subsystems to a working complete system. A major aim of the project was the comparison of the new approach with established methods of traffic monitoring w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. For validating the complete LUMOS concept and its implementation a flight campaign was performed by the DLR-Institute of Transport Research and the other project partners in the area of Berlin in May 2003. First results of comparison of airborne and conventional traffic measurements are presented in this paper. Besides DLR, the. following partner collaborate within LUMOS: IQ-Wireless, ScanDat, Teltec Telematik, BLIC, Fraunhofer Institute of Computer Architecture and Software Technology and Forschungs- und Anwendungsverbund Verkehrssystemtechnik Berlin (FAV).

The wavelet analysis is used to extract feature spectra of multi-fault state from measured vibration signal for the diagnosis. Excellent symptom parameters for distinguishing fault states are automatically generated by GP. Because the value of symptom parameter calculated to express the feature of the vibration signal fluctuates even if machine state doses not change, fuzzy diagnosis is necessary. After obtaining the excellent symptom parameters by GP called GP-SPs, the membership functions of GP-SPs are needed for fuzzy diagnosis. We also discuss the identification method of membership function of symptom parameters using probability theory and possibility theory, and show the inference method for identifying fault types. The methods proposed in this paper are verified by applying them to the diagnosis of rolling bearing in multi-fault state.

Using windows is one important way to improve bispectrum estimation and appropriate window function can reduce the variance and suppress noise, but sidelodes in spectrum of window functions will result in spectrum leak. Thus it is one urgent problem needed to be solved for application of bispectrum that how to find one appropriate 2-D window. In this paper one new 2-D combined lag window is constructed by Hanning-Poisson window without sidelobes, which then is used for non-parametric bispectrum estimation instead of rectangle window. In the end simulation is done on QPC signals encountered in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The results demonstrate that using the constructed window function can restrain spectrum leak and reduce the variance of estimation better than single windows, like rectangle window.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		Support Vector Machine; fuzzy theory; risk function; fault diagnosis		The concept of risk is introduced and a fuzzy judge based SVM (FJ-SVM) is put forward. Fuzzy theory is applied to improve the algorithm of SVM, the judge probability for fault is increased and diagnosis is more sensitive to fault. So the probability of mistaking fault for nature is decreased and the slight fault of facility can be identified correctly and timely. It is very important for improving the security of facility in the process. In this paper, the diagnosis example of working status in turbine axletree and the classification results are given to prove the feasibility of this algorithm. The algorithm of fuzzy samples based SVM (FS-SVM) is compared with FJ-SVM to indicate the rationality of FJ-SVM.

Extracting these essential variables and monitoring them will improve the process monitoring performance. In this paper, An integrated framework for process monitoring and fault diagnosis is presented, which combines independent component analysis (ICA) for feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM) for identification of different fault source. ICA is used to determine the projection coefficient matrix which represents the features characterizing the current operating condition. Multiple support vector machines well-trained use the projection coefficient matrix as their inputs to identify the faults. The method is proved to be effective by the application to monitoring of Tennessee Eastman process.

By using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) theory, the method that singular spectrum characteristic based on the reconstructed attractor track matrix is proposed to increase the signal noise ratio (SNR), then detection of abrupt information and early rub-impact detection of rotating machinery based on SVD is further proposed. Based on the concept of singular entropy, the problem that reasonable selection of the order for noise reduction in singular spectrum is solved. This method has been applied to the experiment of fault diagnosis. The experiment suggests that it is a simple and effective way to increase the SNR and emphasize the fault characteristic of the original vibrant signals, It makes the signals in time domain after noise reduction more clear, and it will increase the precision of fault diagnosis for equipment and provide for machinery fault diagnosis with an effective tool.

The additional excitation consists on a predefined inverter-switching pattern applied while the fundamental excitation is canceled. This excitation has been previously used to implement a position estimation strategy. This strategy obtains information about the rotor position from the machine saliencies effects over the zero sequence voltage. The air-gap eccentricity is a saliency that depends on the rotor position. For such reason, it also produces changes over the zero sequence voltage. In order to evaluate the feasibility of this proposal, a multiple coupled circuit model of the Induction Motor is used. Experimental results that validate the proposal are also presented.

This methodology is based on the integration of Petri nets for diagnosis (BPN) and Bayesian networks. After that, the integration among detection/treatment of faults and the "normal" processes (represented by Petri Nets, PN) is possible. This integration allows us to develop a fault tolerant supervisor, which considers all the processes in the same structure. A case study of a fault tolerant AGV is considered. Finally, a simulation tool for edition and analysis of models with these characteristics is introduced.

This monitoring prevents the occurrence of unthreaded yarns due to yarn break, and thus avoids the decrease on productivity. On the other hand, more information concerning the knitting process is desirable, because it allows the evaluation of possible future malfunctions and detection of faults. The classical device which is usually used to accomplish the first task does not have the necessary technology to accomplish the second task. The purpose of this paper is to present research that is being carried out to develop a different sensor device, capable of complying with both objectives and thus successfully replace the present system, which is used solely to detect lack or exceeding force applied to the yarn. Furthermore, the solution suggested is a low cost one, allowing its installation in every feeder as the present solution. Some considerations are made concerning the problems that this approach present and the dynamical behaviour for different configurations of the system is discussed.

So it has more powerful frequency resolution than wavelet transform and is better for machinery fault diagnosis such as hydro-generator with higher frequency vibration signal But its algorithm is too complex to be used in real-time diagnosis system which can greatly increase the reliability of machinery facility running. In order to simplify the algorithm of wavelet package and reduce the need of memory in real-time system during signal decomposition,one novel lifting scheme of wavelet package is put forward which can quickly decompose signal and extract fault information while collecting signal. With optimization of the program structure of the algorithm on DSP the scheme can realize online monitoring and real-time diagnosing of machinery fault. Experiment shows that this algorithm of lifting wavelet package runs well in a real-time fault diagnosis system of hydro-generator.

In order to reduce the loss arising by such bacteria, it is very important to diagnose the abnormal states in time. We provide a new method of fault diagnosis, i.e. combination the nonlinear principal component analysis with support vector machines, which may not only extract the main monitor variables from many monitor variables, but also obtain decision function with excellent generalization performance from limited samples of fault.

Starting from the standard definition of diagnosability of discrete event systems, which deals with the problem of detecting the occurrence of an unobservable event using the available observations on the system, the problem of performing the detection before the system executes a forbidden string is introduced. For example, this constraint could he required to prevent local faults from developing into failures that could cause safety hazards. This idea results in a new language property for discrete event systems called safe diagnosability. Necessary and sufficient conditions to test this language property are presented. Moreover, the problem of explicitly taking into account safe diagnosability as a requirement in system design is discussed.

In this paper, we develop a methodology for systematically constructing redundant finite-state machines so that an external checker can capture transient state-transition faults via checks that are performed in a non-concurrent manner (e.g., periodically). More specifically, the proposed approach allows the checker to detect and identify errors due to past state-transition faults based on an analysis of the current, possibly corrupted FSM state. As a result, the checker in such designs can operate at a slower speed than the rest of the system which relaxes the stringent requirements on its reliability.

It is commonly known that the unattended use of a drill bit until it reaches the ultimate failure can potentially damage to machine tool and work-piece resulting in considerable down time and productivity loss. Thus there is a need for such tools to save high maintenance costs in case of the catastrophic failure. A system in drilling that can estimate tool life in terms of the number of hole to failure as condition monitoring techniques in the form of a digital display is significantly beneficial. In this paper, a tailor-made novel feed forward network is proposed to predict tool life in terms of the number of holes to failure. These involved the development of predictive model, test rig design and a digital display to assist engineers with on-line tool life. To entitle the network to cater for various cutting conditions, a knowledge base as training and testing data have to be generated on the experimental data in a comprehensive working range of drilling. Consequently, the experiments were performed in thirty-two cutting conditions based on the combination of three basic cutting parameters, which are feed rate, spindle speed and drill diameter. The neural networks were trained and the architecture of networks was appropriately selected by benchmarking the Root Mean Square error (RMS). The results of the novel network, Optimisation layer by layer (OLL), have shown the ability to accurately predict the number of holes to failure with a 100% success rate at both training and testing stages. To highlight OLL predictive capability, a brief comparison with Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is carried out.

The new analytic displays and metrics are illustrated using data obtained on a LAM 4520XL at STMicroelectronics as part of a SEMATECH EPIT beta test evaluation. The DNC represents a comprehensive modeling environment that uses as its input extensive process chamber information and history of the time since maintenance actions occurred. The DNC uses a neural network to predict multiple quality output metrics and a closed-loop risk-based optimization to maximize process quality performance while minimizing overall cost of tool operation and machine downtime. The software responds in an advisory mode on a wafer-to-wafer basis as to the optimal actions to be taken. In this paper, we present three specific instances of patterns arising during wafer processing over time that signal the process or equipment engineer to the need for corrective action: either a process setpoint adjustment or specific maintenance actions. Based on the controller's recommended corrective action set with the overall risk reduction predicted by such actions, a metric of corrective action "urgency" can be created. The tracking of this metric over time yields different pattern types that signify a quantified need for a specific type of corrective action. Three basic urgency patterns are found: 1. a pattern in a given maintenance action over time showing increasing urgency or "risk reduction" capability for the action; 2. a pattern in a process variable specific to a given recipe indicating a chronic request over time to only adjust the variable setpoint either above or below the cur-rent target; 3. a pattern in a process variable existing over all recipes processed through the chamber indicating chronic request to adjust the variable setpoint in either or both directions over time. This pattern is a pointer to the need for a maintenance action that is either corroborated by the urgency graph for that maintenance action, or if no such action has been previously taken, a guide to the source of the equipment malfunction.

A new strategy based on forecasting of system degradation through a prognostic process is required. The recent advances in model-based design technology have realized significant time savings in product development cycle. These advances facilitate the integration of model-based diagnosis and prognosis of systems, leading to condition-based maintenance and increased availability of systems. With an accurate simulation model of a system, diagnostics and prognostics can be synthesized concurrently with system design. In this paper, we will develop an integrated prognostic process based on data collected from model-based simulations under nominal and degraded conditions. Prognostic models are constructed based on different random load conditions (modes). Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) is used to track the hidden damage. Remaining life prediction is performed by mixing mode-based life predictions via time-averaged mode probabilities. The solution has the potential to be applicable to a variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to aerospace systems.

There are many process parameters need to monitor and control in order to make the microbiological fermentation process successful. So it is important to fault diagnose for microbiological fermentation sensor. In this paper we provide a new method for fault diagnosis of microbiological fermentation, i.e. two relevance vector machines which are viewed as observer and classifier respectively. The observer is applied to estimate release rate of carbon dioxide to gain residual sequence. The classifier is applied to the residuals. The results of experiment demonstrate this method can effectively diagnose instrument fault.

One solution is to give the expert access to the machine remotely with the addition of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based diagnostics software to assist with the decision making process. Our research is based on such a system, which combines modern communications with intelligent diagnostics software, Accessibility to process machines can now be global with the promise of predictability to the diagnosis It is fell the importance of this research work cannot be overstated with the constantly moving worldwide manufacturing base and the real situation of the machine designers being based in a different country to their customer.

Time-frequency representations comprise the natural signal-processing tool traditionally used for representing such non-stationary signals. The methods used in this analysis are based on the second order statistics of a signal. This paper discusses the use of higher order time frequency methods in the context of a condition monitoring application. The paper outlines the two classes of higher order representations: the L-Wigner distribution and the sliced Wigner higher order distribution. The use of higher order distributions introduces the possibility of non-oscillating cross-terms, a. problem not encountered in conventional bilinear time-frequency methods. Techniques for reducing these cross-terms are presented. The paper compares the performance of bilinear and higher order time-frequency methods using synthetic data and vibration signals measured on the engine block of the passenger car for identification of the dynamic characteristics of the engine valve train system.

The positions and shapes of this kernel can be adjusted according to the characteristics of the analyzed signal. This kernel has two advantages, the first is that the processing time of the signal is shorter than that of the adaptive kernel, the second is that it may analyze a large class of signals. In the fault diagnosis of the machine, this kernel can change its parameters with the change of the rotating machine motion so as to extract the harmonic components and process the speed-up stage of the rotating machine. The result of the simulation and real example analysis demonstrates that this kernel is practical and effective.

The study focuses on rub vibration fault mechanism of a radial bearing with an excessive clearance when bearing system stiffness was changed. The paper gives the case history: radial bearings were often damaged because of vibration faults encountered during loading of a H type centrifugal compressor train. The effect of the dynamic load on the bearing stiffness and the rotor-bearing system critical speed were discussed, the high vibration occurred at a threshold load, the exact one half sub-harmonic vibration and reverse-procession faults were caused by rotor to stator rubs, which were induced by bearings with an excessive clearance. These studies and diagnosis based engineering improvement can be used for reference for. design of high-speed turbo machinery.

Traditionally, refrigerator production companies have used the auditory system of a skilled person for health monitoring. However, a skilled person cannot check all the compressors on a production line. If sampled compressor is judged as faulty, thousands of compressors which are manufactured at that time and place are regarded as faulty; thus, money is lost. In order to save costs, it is necessary to check all the compressors in the production line. To do so, we installed a controlled vibration measurement system and real time signal analysis to check faulty or healthy compressors. The signal processing tools used for feature extraction for pass or fail of the compressor are spectral density analysis, weighted Wigner-Ville distribution, time domain analysis and wavelet analysis, and signal processing for pattern analysis for pass or fail in a neural network. The result of the application has been very successful, and currently the system is working very well on the production line. This paper presents the whole history for health monitoring of the reciprocating compressor in a refrigerator. The work is in cooperation with LG Electronics Company.

It formulates the fault detection as an inverse problem and the optimized method is used to solve it. The presented method needs merely on-line measured vibration data of several monitor points but not of whole nodes of rotor, and the machine need not to be stopped.

The multifractal spectrum, also called singularity spectrum, calculated by the wavelet transform modulus-maxima (WTMM) method is a comprehensive reflection of the distribution of the singularities of signals. In this paper, the WTMM method for multifractal spectrum is introduced, and the multifractal spectra are used to analyze the experimental data of rub-impact, oil whirl, coupling misalignment and imbalance faults. The results show that the vibration signals of the rub-impact have the strongest singularity; the signals of the coupling misalignment are the next and the signals of the imbalance have the weakest singularity. It means that some features can be extracted from the multifractal spectra for fault diagnosis.

While errors may affect more than one state/output bit, not all combinations of state/output bits constitute potential erroneous cases for a given fault model. Therefore, it is possible to compact them without loss of error information. Thus, concurrent error detection is performed through hardware that predicts the values of the compacted state/output bits and compares them to the actual values of the FSM. In order to minimize the incurred hardware overhead, a randomized algorithm is proposed for selecting the minimum number of required parity functions.

Most prognostics methods promoted in the literature for on-line estimation of remaining useful life or reliability utilize trending or forecasting models in combination with mechanistic or empirical failure definition models. In the absence of sound knowledge for the mechanics of degradation and/or adequate failure data, it is not possible to establish practical failure definition models. However, if there exist domain experts with strong experiential knowledge, one can establish fuzzy inference models for failure definition. This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy approach for performing prognostics under such circumstances. The proposed approach is evaluated on a cutting tool monitoring problem. In particular, the method is used to monitor high-speed-steel drill-bits used for drilling holes in stainless steel metal plates. The study reveals very promising results.

However, carrying out an effective predictive maintenance plan, information about current machine conditions must be made known to the decision-maker. In this paper, a new method of obtaining maintenance information has been proposed. By integrating traditional reliability modeling techniques with a real-time, on-line performance estimation model, machine reliability information such as hazard rate and mean time between failure (MTBF) can be calculated. Essentially, this paper presents an innovative method to synthesize low level information (such as vibration signals) with high level information (like reliability statistics) to form a rigorous theoretical base for better machine maintenance.

The primary goals of this field are to provide information regarding structural performance capability, damage assessment, and even structural prognosis, all of which may potentially reduce the ownership costs associated with the maintenance and operation of the structure. Much of the research has largely taken a vibration-based approach, whereby the structural dynamic response to either ambient or applied loading is analyzed for changes in certain characteristic "features" that serve as appropriate damage indicators. Many of the features proposed have involved parameters derived from a modal analysis of the structure, e.g., resonant frequencies, mode shapes, damping, strain energy, flexibility, etc. In this work, we present features taken from measured attractors of the structure. System characterization (including damage detection) by means of geometric invariants, such as attractor(s), is potentially a powerful generic approach which does not rely on implicit assumptions in an underlying model, e.g., linearity. The structure is excited with a chaotic oscillator, and the combined chaotic excitation dynamics and structural response may be thought of as the "filtering" of chaotic data: the structure acts as a "filter" through which the chaotic signal is processed so that small changes to the structure (ostensibly due to damage) will serve to alter the degree to which the signal is filtered. We develop the attractor property trajectory prediction error as a candidate feature and evaluate its utility in detecting clamping force degradation on a continuous metal beam.

Predictive maintenance is a new branch in maintenance research field, and it can cut down a large number expenses that cost in prevent maintenance, and reduce the time of stop machines. The key problem of fault prediction is to acquire state data of the equipment continuously, build the system state reliability models according to the state data, and to determine the equipment whether failure or not in next time via the models. System on chip(SOC) is a small system and its cost is lower than normal test system. So it is suited for a BIT system for fault prediction. In this paper, the construction of SOC is discussed; fault prediction method and the key problems are described in detai.

As a common learning method, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is derived from the SLT. Here we were done some analogical experiments of the rotor broken bar faults of induction motors used, analyzed the signals of the sample currents with Fourier transform, and constructed the spectrum characteristics from low frequency to high frequency used as learning sample vectors for the SVM. After a SVM is trained with learning sample vectors, so each kind of the rotor broken bar faults of induction motors can be classified. Finally the retest is demonstrated, which proves that the SVM really has preferable ability of classification. In this paper we tried applying the SVM to diagnose the faults of induction motors, and the results suggested that the SVM could yet be regarded as a new method in the fault diagnosis.

This is due to a combination of the complexity of the patterns, the distortions which are an inevitable result of the flimsy and elastic nature of the product and the small random, but acceptable, minor deviations from the nominal pattern at the scale of the individual knitted loops. This paper describes research into a system, exploiting mechatronic principles and machine vision technology, to provide high-speed, and high sensitivity automated fault detection, with a minimum of false alarms.

Experimental results show that a wavelet-based estimator is an effective method for extracting the symptoms of a bearing fault under such conditions.

Diagnosis can help to avoid unplanned standstill, to make possible to run an emergency operation in case of a fault or to keep the time to repair short in case of a fault. For the voltage source inverter several faults are possible. In this paper, these faults and their diagnosis are covered. Possible faults and remedial stategies are listed. It is enumerated, which faults in today's standard protection systems are diagnosed. The main faults, in general not covered in these systems, are the transistor open circuit fault and the dc bus capacitor fault. In these fields diagnosis methods are under reseach. Some of the various reports of research groups in this field are outlined here as a survey with respect to function and properties.

Since it is well recognize that side band harmonics around the fundamental are good candidates for electrical fault detection in three-phase induction machine, the magnitude evaluation of these harmonics is a tricky problem especially with non-sinusoidal power supply. The idea is to excite more these harmonics without high torque quality deterioration and to evaluate their magnitude for rotor fault detection and localization. The technique is presented and applied on a 11kW-230V/400V-50Hz-4 poles three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine.

However, the exploitation of the high frequency or transient properties of the machine can advantageously be used to obtain additional information on the state variables of the machine like flux or rotor position or detection of possible fault conditions. Especially for the estimation of the flux or rotor position in induction machines the practical performance of the resulting control is strongly influenced by the lamination design. Modern design tools for induction machines only consider the fundamental wave and only few effort has been made until now to investigate the interaction of the fundamental wave design and the transient electrical behavior. This work is focused on these interactions. A transient simulation of the machine based on a magnetic equivalent circuit model including lamination material hysteresis is applied to ascertain the connection between saturated areas in the lamination material and the signals obtained from the evaluation of the machines transient electrical step response. To verify this connection as well as to quantify the influence measurements were performed on different machines with specific lamination design each concentrated on dominant saturation in a different area like tooth or yoke in the stator as well as in the rotor. A comparison of the simulation and measurement results of the machines at varying flux and load levels is given and the reasons for the difference in the transient signals is discussed taking the fundamental wave as well as the transient field distribution into account. Based on these results a model of the interaction of fundamental wave saturation and the transient control signals is established where the asymmetries caused by saturation at the different areas of the lamination are each represented by individual phasors. Adding up the phasors of all areas leads to the resulting asymmetry of the machine and gives its dependence on the point of operation.

Traditional CSA measurements can result in false alarms and/or misdiagnosis of healthy machines due to the presence of current frequency components in the stator current resulting from non-rotor related conditions such as mechanical load fluctuations, gearboxes, etc. Theoretical advancements have now made it possible to predict many of these components, thus making CSA testing much more robust and less error prone technology. Based on these theoretical developments, case histories will be presented which demonstrate the ability to separate current components resulting from mechanical gearboxes from those resulting from broken rotor bars. From this data, a new handheld instrument for reliable detection of broken rotor bars, air gap eccentricity, shorted turns in LV stator windings and mechanical phenomena/problems in induction motor drives is being developed and will be described. Detection of the inception of these problems prior to failure facilitates remedial action to be carried out thus avoiding the significant costs associated with unexpected down time due to unexpected failures.

The objective Is to establish the possibility of using the estimation strategy signals for fault diagnosis in variable speed electric drives. This strategy is based on the effect produced by inductance variation on the zero sequence voltage, exciting the motor with a predefined inverter-switching pattern.

As the excitation of these machines is fixed, it is not sufficient to simply disconnect the machine by gating off the inverter power semiconductors following the detection of a fault, and other remedial actions need to be employed. A range of single point winding and power semiconductor failures are analysed in detail and for each the most appropriate mitigating action described. The discussion is illustrated with test results taken from two identically rated salient and non-salient PM traction motors.

An important issue in such effort is the modelling of the induction machine including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, it is introduced a new and simpler approach for the modelling and computer simulation of induction machines with rotor asymmetries. This approach is based on the Well-known dq transient model of the symmetrical machine, with rotor asymmetries introduced through a linear transformation of the extended rotor current vector. Simulation results previously presented in the literature are reproduced to support the proposed approach.

However, when high reliability is required, the control using the field-oriented method is often necessary and the in-line diagnosis or off-line diagnosis have to be considered. This way has been studied for many years, and the control of this electrical motor has become richer along the years. Nevertheless, the use of double star induction motor or six-phase induction motor is slowly increasing and we find it in high power process. Its main advantage lies in most reliability in case of a normal operating system. This paper describes a fight model of a double star induction motor which, in spite of its simplicity, is able to provide useful indications for diagnostic purposes. A special attention is paid to the rotor defect. The most widespread way to make diagnosis is the analysis of the stator current spectrum. This method is classically named Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). The responses obtained show the effectiveness of these kinds of ways.

The proposed approach is a sensor-based technique using the mains current measurement. A localization domain made with seven patterns is built with the. stator Concordia mean current vector. One is dedicated to the healthy domain and the last six to each inverter switch. A probabilistic approach for the definition of the boundaries increases the robustness of the method against the uncertainties due to measurements and to the PWM. In high power equipment where it is crucial to detect and to diagnose the inverter faulty switch, a simple algorithm compares the patterns and generates a Boolean indicating the faulty device. In low power application (less than 1 kW) where only fault detection is required, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) evolving architecture neural network is used to build the wealthy operation area. Simulated experimental results on a 0.3kW Induction motor drive show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

A predictive maintenance diagnostic system that could analyze electrical waveforms to detect the presence of such faulty connections in a motor circuit would be a potentially valuable innovation. This paper describes preliminary analytical and experimental work in the detection of high-resistance connections. A neural network model is trained to characterize the behavior of "healthy" circuits in terms of the symmetrical components of three-phase voltage and current. Subsequent system operation, with additional resistance in the cabling due to faulty electrical connection, will exhibit a variation between the measured behavior and the expected "healthy" behavior. Experimental results show that this deviation is roughly proportional to the added resistance, and can be useful as a figure of merit for diagnosing the state of motor wiring.

C	Siddique, A; Yadava, GS; Singh, B			IEEE; IEEE	Siddique, A; Yadava, GS; Singh, B			Applications of artificial intelligence techniques for induction machine stator fault diagnostics: Review	IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 24-26, 2003	STONE MT, GA	IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc			NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROTOR FAILURES; MOTORS; WAVELET; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION	The on-line fault diagnostics technology for induction machines is fast emerging for the detection of incipient faults as to avoid the unexpected failure. Approximately 30-40% faults of induction machines are stator faults. This paper presents a review of recent developments in applications of artificial intelligence techniques for induction machine stator fault diagnostics. Now a days artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are being preferred over traditional protective relays for fault diagnostics of induction machines. The application of expert system, fuzzy logic system, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithm have been considered for fault diagnostics. These systems and techniques can be integrated into each other with more traditional techniques. A brief description of various AI techniques highlighting the merits and demerits of each other have been discussed. Fault diagnosis of electric motor drive systems using AI techniques has been considered. The futuristic trends are, also indicated.

The objective of this paper is to provide a survey of existing techniques for detection of stator related faults, which include stator winding turn faults, stator core faults, temperature monitoring and thermal protection, and stator winding insulation testing. The root causes of fault inception, available techniques for detection and recommendations for further research are presented. Although the primary focus is on-line, sensorless methods that use machine voltages and currents to extract fault signatures, off-line techniques such as partial discharge detection are also examined.

One important aspect of these methods is its ability to be applied to condition-based maintenance systems; moreover it has the sensitivity to predict how far the machine is from the end of its useful life. Any information that contributes to establishing an alarm level to predict the remaining life of the motor would be very useful. This paper presents the results of a study carried out on a motor working under a turn to turn short condition.

Based on these results, it cannot be ascertained if the methods would detect a turn-fault in an incipient stage of development, before it propagates to ground. An estimate of the time interval between fault detection and the flow of significant ground current would be useful for a commercial application to carefully shut-down the machine and controlled process and for maintenance scheduling. In this paper, an experimental test is carried out to accelerate insulation failure by thermally-induced stress, while simultaneously monitoring the voltages and currents for a turn fault using a previously proposed neural-network-based method. Results are provided to show that the fault could be clearly detected ahead of failure of winding-to-ground insulation.

The use of frequency converters affects the behavior of the machine and makes fault diagnosis more complicated. One of the widely used diagnostic methods is Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). This method is based on measurement of sidebands in the stator current spectrum. Those sidebands are usually located close to the main supply frequency. Frequency converter causes supply frequency to slightly vary in time and, as a result, some additional harmonics in the current spectrum are induced and sidebands are reduced. Those harmonics can be easily misinterpreted as the sidebands caused by the rotor faults. Although the rotor faults in the case of frequency converter supply are not so often, precaution is still necessary. In this paper the experimental results of fault diagnosis carried out using standard supply and using frequency converter have been compared and presented. All tests were performed on 22 kW, 380 V, 1470 r/min induction motor. The current spectra are given for the motor with two broken bars with both types of supply.

The diagnostic test is based on the analysis of the current space vector during motor starting via short-time analysis, using a sliding window and different spectral estimation algorithms. Differently from most of the diagnostic techniques already proposed in the technical literature, the approach, presented in this work, is effective regardless the load condition of the machine. Algorithms based on the FFT or optimal band-pass filters (non-parametric methods), on the estimation of a linear time-invariant model of the signal (parametric methods), and on the eigenanalysis of the autocorrelation matrix (high-resolution methods) have been used to process the motor current space-vector. Experiments prove that both parametric and high-resolution methods overcome the FFT-based approaches, keep only the principal frequency components of the signal and decrease the noise influence, thus permitting a better interpretation of the current vector spectrum and an automatic fault detection procedure.

This has lead to the common practice of categorizing bearing faults according to fault location (i.e., inner race, outer race, ball, or cage fault). While the ability to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies is necessary, this approach neglects another important class of faults that arise in many industrial settings. This research introduces the notion of categorizing bearing faults as either single-point defects or generalized roughness. These classes separate bearing faults according to the types of fault signatures that are produced rather than by the physical location of the fault. Specifically, single-point defects produce the four predictable characteristic fault frequencies while faults categorized as generalized roughness produce unpredictable broadband changes in the machine vibration and stator current. Experimental results are provided from bearings failed in situ via a shaft current. These results illustrate the unpredictable and broadband nature of the effects produced by generalized roughness bearing faults. This issue is significant because a successful bearing condition monitoring scheme must be able to reliably detect both classes of faults.

To motivate this topic, experimental results are provided that illustrate how the act of removing and replacing test bearings drastically alters the machine vibration and stater current spectral characteristics. Based on this observation, a method is developed that employs an externally applied shaft current to initiate and progress a bearing fault in an accelerated timeframe. This experimental method begins with a new, undamaged bearing and progresses it throughout its entire lifecycle in situ. The test machine is a standard induction motor that can be interfaced with any load and operate at any arbitrary speed or load level throughout the bearing failure process. Additionally, data generated by this experimental method can then be used to evaluate the performance of any bearing condition monitoring scheme.

The theoretical aspects underlying the use of this diagnostic technique are presented but a major emphasis is given to the integration of the diagnostic system into the DSP board containing the control algorithm. Taking advantage of the sensors already built-in the drive for control purposes, it is possible to implement this diagnostic system at no additional cost, thus giving a surplus value to the drive itself. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to diagnose stator faults and demonstrate the possibility of its integration in the DSP board.

A motor failure can result in the shutdown of a production line, or require that redundant equipment be utilised to circumvent the problem. By this way, the early detection of motor deterioration can increase plant availability and safety in an economical way. Many publications [1-6] have investigated the detection of rotor and stator winding failures in electrical machines; however, there is more limited research on fault diagnosis in induction motors fed by PWM converters [7-9]. This paper proposes a method, based on spectral estimation to diagnosis stator winding faults in induction motors fed by PWM converters. Simulation and experimental results are employed to validate the method. Further, a 5 Hp and 3 Hp, 230V induction motors with internal tapings from the stator windings are specially constructed. The motor are powered by a PWM converter and different fault conditions are investigated.

However, even if these components are reliable, they can be submitted to external stresses coming from the system and degradation can occur even in the electrical and/or mechanical parts. Fault detection in induction machines has been investigated largely for the last twenty years with success and progress is still being made. The objective of this study is to present a new method for early detection of anomalies, in particular broken bars and porosities which can occur in the fabrication process. The method presented is general and may be applied to the induction machine whilst in rotation or at standstill. It's based on broadband excitation signals which are able to excite the faulty modes of devices under tests. Experimental measurements are made both on healthy and faulty machines and the comparison gives a difference in the flux and current machine signatures which is basically the most commonly used method of fault detection. This fact is very important for industrial suppliers of induction machines, because in this way manufactures will have a way of early detection of defects before selling machines.

The conventional VMM requires the measured voltages, currents and the signal of a rotor position sensor. The novel scheme presented in this paper alternatively works without a rotor position sensor. Especially for low inertia drives accurate estimation of rotor position is required. The rotor fault related double slip frequency torque modulation causes a speed ripple with the same frequency. Consequently, low inertia drives are exposed to higher speed ripples. In this case, it's not sufficient to estimate the mean value of the actual speed, only. Even the speed ripple has to be acquired to benefit from the accuracy of the employed models of the VMM. The proposed technique evaluates the signatures of an inherent rotor fault in order to determine the rotor position signal. The speed ripple can be obtained from the torque modulations that the models already compute. This way, an accurate rotor fault detection technique without rotor position sensor can be realized.

Innumerable papers have been published about those techniques so far. Yet, the assessment of the severity of the actual fault has not received much attention. The term severity refers to the grade of electrical asymmetry of the rotor. This paper examines fault assessment and the respective specification. The objective is to compare those rotor fault assessment techniques which reflect the state of the art. A wide range of literature is cited in order to provide appropriate references. The authors also present and compare some measuring results in order to illustrate the investigated techniques.

In the first part the influence of these asymmetries on the transient electrical behavior of the machine is investigated by simulation results obtained from a magnetic equivalent circuit model. Starting from these results the proposed method is derived. It is based on the reaction of the machine current to voltage pulses caused by the switching of the inverter. The continuous switching of the inverter is necessary for the current control loop during normal operation of the drive. Using a special observer structure any changes in the reaction of the machine caused by airgap asymmetries can be detected and isolated. The only inputs necessary for the realization of the method are the de link values of the voltage and the current. The observer estimates the transient parameters of the three phases and by comparing the three phase values an error signal can be calculated. The method is insensitive to changes of the machine parameters due to temperature or saturation as long as these changes occur symmetrically in all three phases. The method is applicable in both steady state and transient operation. The practical operation of the method is verified by measurement results at different points of operation and with different fault positions / magnitudes.

The EMDS couples actual power hardware to a virtual simulation of the power system through a Sim-Stim Interface (SSI) which sources and sinks power to the HUT, performing Power Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL), as shown in Fig. 1. Since the goal of the EMDS is to perform fault diagnosis when the HUT is connected to a physical system, then SSI must be transparent in terms of losses, bandwidth and dynamic range. By its very nature, the SSI adds complexity to the system by the introduction of its internal components (such as sensors, AID and D/A converters, power amplifiers and operational software). This paper gives the key issues that enables the EMDS to perform PHIL diagnostic studies enabling one to test power equipment as if the device is connected to the actual power system without risking damage to both the equipment and the actual system.

The first is to bring the system under test (SUT) from its initial state to a targeted state t and the second is to check various specified properties of the SUT at t. This paper investigates the first phase for testing systems specified as observable nondeterministic finite-state machines with probabilistic and weighted transitions. This phase involves two steps. The first step transfers,the SUT to some state t' and the second step identifies whether t' is indeed the targeted state t or not. State transfer is achieved by moving the SUT along one of the paths of a transfer tree (TT) and state identification is realized by using diagnosis trees (DT). A theoretical foundation for the existence and characterization of TT and DT with minimum weighted height or minimum average weight is presented. Algorithms for their computation are proposed.

A feature selection scheme based on principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed in this paper. A methodology was developed for bearing defect classification using neural networks. The scheme has shown to provide more accurate defect classification with less parameter inputs than using all parameters initially considered relevant.

However, these techniques cannot truthfully identify fault features when the actual behavior of the physical system is far from linear due to the change of its operating conditions, and involves nonlinearity. This paper presents a nonlinear dynamics method called complexity, which has been investigated to extract feature parameters from raw vibration signals measured from a bearing system. The results demonstrated that complexity presents a good measure for detecting machine defects.

A new search method is proposed in this system to improve the efficiency of the diagnostic process. First of all, a diagnostic tree (a decision tree) is built by domain experts according to the functions of the devices in the machine. Then, the diagnostic priorities of nodes (devices) in the tree are determined based on a fuzzy group multiple attribute decision making method. A meta knowledge base for fault diagnosis is generated automatically, based on the determined priorities to guide the diagnostic process. After that, a domain knowledge base that hypothesises possible faults for each device in the tree is generated by domain experts and/or manuals. At last, the inference process starts based on the meta knowledge base and hypothesises which device is the possible cause of failure. To validate the system performance, an illustrative example (VCR troubleshooting) is presented for demonstration purposes.

C	Wu, QW; Hsiao, MS			IEEE; IEEE	Wu, QW; Hsiao, MS			Efficient sequential ATPG based on partitioned finite-state-machine traversal	INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE 2003, PROCEEDINGS	International Test Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th International Test Conference	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2003	CHARLOTTE, NC	IEEE Comp Soc Test Technol Tech Council, IEEE Philadelphia Sect				We present a new automatic test pattern generation algorithm for sequential circuits by traversing the partitioned state spaces. The new features include: (1) non-disjoint state groups are obtained such that two different state groups may have common flip-flops, (2) partial state transition graphs (STGs) are constructed at run time for each state group, (3) spectral information for state variables are extracted and the spectral information of the state variables helps to identify the behavior of the flip-flops in the frequency domain. This information will help us to intelligently partition the state space. We focus only on the STGs for the flip-flops that are grouped together instead of building the STG for the entire circuit, and the ATPG tries to traverse all states and transitions within each partial STG. By exercising states visited and arcs traversed, the vectors generated often lead to the detection of hard faults. Since we limit a maximum size any state group can be, construction of partitioned STGs is feasible even for very large sequential circuits. Only logic simulation is needed in our ATPG; as a result, the execution time is greatly reduced while achieving high fault coverages compared with other test generators. For some large sequential circuits, highest fault coverages have been achieved.

This method is especially well suited for analyzing time-series data that represent non-stationary and nonlinear processes. The method stands in contrast to classical methods, including Fourier analysis that are generally applicable only to periodic or stationary data that represent linear processes. This method is based principally on the concept of local wave decomposition (LWD), according to which any complicated set of data can be decomposed into a finite and often small number of "intrinsic mode functions" (IMFs) that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. This decomposition method is adaptive and, therefore, highly efficient. Since the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform, the intrinsic mode functions yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert Spectrum. This method is superior to the methods of time-frequency analysis available. Through the application research on the vibration signals, which are collected from the shaft of the gear box of a petroleum pump machine, we find new ways to solve machine fault diagnosis problem. With the method we can get the time-frequency spectrum - Hilbert Spectrum of the vibration signals and the Marginal Spectrum of Hilbert Spectrum, which can accurately detect the fault of gear, and based on the Hilbert Spectrum, we can definite the Degree of Stationarity of the vibration signal, through which we can find some useful information about gear working. Practical application proves that the utilization of nonlinear and nos-stationary character of machinery vibration signal is better than the ignorance of it, and thus we can extract more fault characteristic, and obtain more accurate diagnostic results. Finally, the related problems that need further study in this field are pointed out, too.

It is an effective way on analysis of stationary signal which can represent the frequency distribution of vibration signals in frequency domain. But the way of analysis can only do simple diagnosis and can not do exact diagnosis. The data that are acquired by data acquisition system contain a great deal of deep fault message, but the deep fault message can not be gotten by the traditional way of signal processing. The paper will study the technology of data mining and its application in the fault diagnosis for machinery. Data mining can draw out much useful knowledge and information unknown beforehand from amounts of uncompleted, unstable, random data. The paper studies the application about the technology of data mining based on wavelet theory in fault diagnosis for machinery according to up-to-date outcome, and brings forward the data mining way based on wavelet theory, we do verification by experiment. The wavelet transform can draw out the feature of fault, the neural network based on wavelet can effectively carry out the classification of faults. The basis can be supplied for its application.

The basic principles and programs of correlation dimension, wavelet multifractal and fractal fuzzy neural network are summarized for machine fault diagnosis in domestic, and their merits and defects are discussed. The correlation dimension for fault diagnosis is very simple, but must be considered the noise's influence and the reconstruction dimension. The wavelet multifractal can describe the signal's geometry characteristic and local dimension behaviour, and reflect the signal's singularity distribution, so it has much high precision. The fractal fuzzy neural network is a novel method based on fractal principle and neural network theory, in which the input is the fractal dimension subordinating-degree, and the output is the unit matrix. At last, the tendency of the fractal theory for machine fault diagnosis is predicted.

This view leads to a hierarchy of the form observations < system description < fault model, between the various knowledge sources. It turns out that the semantics for ordered logic programming nicely fits this intuition: if the observations contradict the normal system behavior, then the semantics will provide an explanation from the fault rules. The above model can be refined, without adding additional machinery, to support e.g. problems where there is a clear preference among possible explanations or where the system model itself has a complex structure. Interestingly, these extensions do not increase the complexity of the relevance or necessity decision problems. Finally, the mapping to ordered logic programs also provides a convenient implementation vehicle.

This allows pathologists to image specimens over a full spectrum, thereby revealing (often subtle) distinctions between different types of tissue. With this type of data, the spectral content of the specimens, combined with quantitative spatial feature characterization may make it possible not only to identify the presence of an abnormality, but also to classify it accurately. However, such are the quantities and complexities of these data, that without new automated techniques to assist in the data analysis, the information contained in the data will remain inaccessible to those who need it. We investigate the application of a recently developed system for the automated analysis of multi-/hyper-spectral satellite image data to the problem of cancer detection from multispectral histopathology image data. The system provides a means for a human expert to provide training data simply by highlighting regions in an image using a computer mouse. Application of these feature extraction techniques to examples of both training and out-of-training-sample data demonstrate that these, as yet unoptimized, techniques already show promise in the discrimination between benign and malignant cells from a variety of samples.

Now a method has been proposed that can reliably estimate both the rotor unbalance and misalignment from measured vibration during a single machine run-down. Distinct, but related, approaches are presented for the case of flexibly and rigidly coupled rotor systems. The theoretical concept and the outline computational implementation used are presented in this paper. The method is demonstrated using experimental data from a machine with two journal bearings and a flexible coupling to the motor. A sensitivity analysis has also been carried out for the proposed method with perturbations to the rotor and fluid bearing models to confirm the robustness of the proposed method.

(SPA) has developed a novel statistical approach to estimating the remaining useful life of aircraft components based on known usage monitoring data. The analysis technique is known as the Remaining Useful Life Estimation (RULE) methodology. The basic premise of RULE is to determine conservative predictions for the component loads and fatigue life values from Monte Carlo simulations based on a desired component reliability. Then, as the aircraft's usage is monitored, the component life can be calculated with a known reliability based on the conservative predictions generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The RULE methodology, which has been successfully tested on small-scale analytical problems, is ideally suited to be integrated into both rotorcraft and fixed-wine, aircraft. Furthermore, modifications to the technology may prove to be applicable to wide variety of health and prognostic problems.

The degradation of the bearings is the most frequent fault condition on modern inverter fed drive applications. In this contribution a new reliable method is proposed to detect fault conditions that result in air gap asymmetry. It is based on the step response of the machine phase currents to an excitation with voltage pulses applied by the switching of the inverter. Simulation results of a magnetic equivalent circuit model of an induction machine are presented to show the influence of air gap asymmetry on the transient electrical current slopes of the machine. Based on these results the necessary transient excitation and the evaluation algorithm are derived to detect and isolate these asymmetries. The only inputs necessary for the realization of the method are the phase currents which are also necessary for the current control loop during normal operation of the drive. Thus no additional sensors are needed to implement the proposed method. Finally, measurement results are given for a special machine equipped with eccentric sleeves in the bearing housings.

These forces can be used for non-invasive diagnosis of inter-turn faults and rotor eccentricity in switched-reluctance machines by monitoring of the vibrations on the machine casing. The technique uses a transient finite element analysis and produces characteristics for the forces on the teeth and net force on the rotor in terms of the current, winding and rotor positioning. The forces can be detected on the actual machine using accelerometers. The faults that produce an unbalanced radial force on the rotor will be very noticeable if it has vibrating components and these will be very apparent when using accelerometers attached to the stator casing. They also cause secondary problems such are worn bearings. The shorted-turns current will be studied and it is illustrated that this current is high, which leads to burn-out.

In this presentation, we shall discuss the guidelines as to the time to failure following changes in the trending of motor circuit analysis readings. In many cases, early detection of faults and the application of this method will allow for the reconditioning versus rewinding of electrical machinery. The scope of the paper will be low voltage, random wound induction motors in a clean electrical environment. The paper will also include a definition of the three stages of winding failure.

To ensure such system operates under working order, distributed parameter values are often inspected from subsystems or different points in order to judge working conditions of the system and make global decisions. In this paper, two parallel decision models based on support vector machine (PDMSVMs) are proposed and applied to the distributed fault diagnosis on diesel engine. Simulation results show PDMSVMs perform well in fault diagnosis. PDMSVMs are very convenient to information fusion of distributed decision system. PDMSVMs make decision based on synthetic information of subsystems and can richly exploit information of subsystems according to significance of subsystems to whole system. Therefore decisions made by PDMSVMs are reliable and accurate.

Such an objective is accomplished through an intelligent integration of the output tracking performance oriented direct adaptive robust control (DARC) design with the recently proposed accurate parameter estimation based indirect adaptive robust control (IARC) design. SISO nonlinear systems transformable to semi-strict feedback forms are considered. Theoretically, regardless of the specific estimation algorithm to be used, certain guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy are achieved even in the presence of uncertain nonlinearities-a desirable feature in applications. In addition, the theoretical performance of adaptive designs-asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties only-is preserved. The construction of physical parameter estimation law is based on the actual system dynamics and totally independent from the design of underline robust control law, which allows various estimation algorithms having better parameter convergence properties and practical modifications such as the on-line explicit monitoring of signal excitation levels to be used to significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting parameter estimates in implementation.

Unlike the tracking-performance-oriented direct adaptive robust control (DARC) algorithm, in addition to good output tracking performance, the IARC also focuses on accurate parameter estimates for secondary purposes such as machine health monitoring and prognostics. Accurate parameter estimates are obtained through parameter estimation algorithms based on the plant dynamics rather than the tracking error dynamics, while robust stability and performance are achieved through adaptive robust control. Comparative experimental results show that the proposed IARC achieves good tracking performance and accurate parameter estimation.

More specifically, by characterizing non-concurrent error detection/identification capabilities in terms of state encoding constraints and redundant dynamics, the proposed approach constructs a redundant version of the given FSM that allows the external mechanism to detect and identify errors due to past state-transition faults based on the current, corrupted FSM state. Therefore, the external mechanism can operate at a slower speed than the rest of the system, which relaxes the stringent requirements on its reliability.

The specific requirements vary depending on the type of machine, beam power, pulse length, etc. Some system concepts are common to a number of accelerators and these systems will be discussed. The Machine Protection System (MPS) must protect beam apertures and insertable devices from damage, minimize radiation produced by the beam (ALARA) for hands on maintenance, and shut down the beam when beam-on-target parameters drift outside specifications. NIPS systems should be used as an Accelerator diagnostic. NIPS can trigger data acquisition when a fault occurs, and start post mortem applications automatically. Tight integration with timing and other systems allows automatic recovery from beam faults. * SNS is managed by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 for the U.S. Department of Energy	Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA		Sibley, C (corresponding author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37830 USA.

This software platform has abilities to simulate the processes and conditions in normal cyclotrons such as start up and shut down, routine operations, beam current regulation with combination of built-in component models and sequential control logic. A Human Machine Interface (HMI) with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) functions and 3D interaction features provides a good operation channel. And an intelligent fault diagnosis module that can both generate errors and give solutions will be integrated into the platform in further plans. We use Object-Oriented technology to build this complex system and represent it in Unified Modeling Language (UML). It is easy to extend the functions in this open system. The platform is applied to Cyclotron Virtual Prototyping technology.

The discussion on the fault-tolerance of IM drives in the literature has mostly been on the conceptual level without any detailed analysis. Most of studies are only achieved experimentally. This paper provides an analytical tool to quickly analyze and predict the performance under fault conditions. Also, most of the presented results were machine specific and not general enough to be applicable as an evaluation tool. So, this paper will present a generalized method for predicting the post-fault performance of IM-drives after identifying the various faults that can occur. The fault analysis for IM in the motoring mode will be presented in this paper. The paper includes an analysis for different classifications of drive faults. The faults in an IM-drive -that will be studied- can be broadly classified as: machine fault, (i.e., one of stator windings is open or short, multiple phase open or short, bearings, and rotor bar is broken) and inverter-converter faults (i.e., phase switch open or short, multiple phase fault, and DC-link voltage drop). Briefly, a general-purpose software package for variety of IM-drive faults -is introduced. This package is very important in IM-fault diagnosis and detection using artificial intelligent techniques, wavelet and signal processing.

The ROC curve provides information on the tradeoff between the hit rate (true positives) and the false alarm rates (false positives). In order to draw the ROC curve both positive and negative examples are needed. In some applications, for example, machine condition monitoring, cancer detection, there are plenty of negative examples. However the positive examples are either rare, or do not fully describe the overall set of the possible positive examples. However, instead of the positive examples, some rules about the positive examples are available. For example, in machine condition monitoring, if a sensor drifts off from the set of observed states by a certain amount, we know that a fault has occurred. In order to use the ROC curve to evaluate classifiers, we artificially create the positive examples based on the application dependent rules and the existing negative examples. Then we draw the ROC curve using this set of positive and negative examples.

The choice of a measurement strategy in a multistation machining system is therefore crucial for subsequent successful identification of the machining error root causes. Recent advances in the linear state-space modelling of dimensional errors in multistation machining processes facilitate a formal and systematic characterization of measurement schemes. In this paper, the stream-of-variation methodology is employed to characterize various measurement schemes quantitatively in multistation machining systems using the Bayesian approach in statistics. Application of these methods is demonstrated in the characterization of measurement schemes in the machining process used for machining of an automotive cylinder head.

J	Webber, CJS; Payne, BS; Gu, F; Ball, AD				Webber, CJS; Payne, BS; Gu, F; Ball, AD			Componential coding in the condition monitoring of electrical machines - Part 1: principles and illustrations using simulated typical faults	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						neural network; componential coding; auto-encoder; condition monitoring	NEURAL NETWORKS; VIBRATION	This paper (Part 1) describes the principles of a novel unsupervised adaptive neural network anomaly detection technique, called componential coding, in the context of condition monitoring of electrical machines. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the technique's capabilities. The companion paper (Part 2), which follows, assesses componential coding in its application to real data recorded from a known machine and an entirely unseen machine (a conventional induction motor and a novel transverse flux motor respectively). Componential coding is particularly suited to applications in which no machine-specific tailored techniques have been developed or in which no previous monitoring experience is available. This is because componential coding is an unsupervised technique that derives the features of the data during training, and so requires neither labelling of known faults nor pre-processing to enhance known fault characteristics. Componential coding offers advantages over more familiar unsupervised data processing techniques such as principal component analysis. In addition, componential coding may be implemented in a computationally efficient manner by exploiting the periodic convolution theorem. Periodic convolution also gives the algorithm the advantage of time invariance; i.e. it will work equally well even if the input data signal is offset by arbitrary displacements in time. This means that there is no need to synchronize the input data signal with respect to reference points or to determine the absolute angular position of a rotating part.

J	Payne, BS; Gu, F; Webber, CJS; Ball, AD				Payne, BS; Gu, F; Webber, CJS; Ball, AD			Componential coding in the condition monitoring of electrical machines - Part 2: application to a conventional machine and a novel machine	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						neural network; componential coding; auto-encoder; condition monitoring; induction motor; transverse flux motor; fault detection; fault diagnosis	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; ROTATING MACHINERY; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; INDUCTION; STATOR	This paper (Part 2) presents the practical application of componential coding, the principles of which were described in the accompanying Part 1 paper. Four major issues are addressed, including optimization of the neural network, assessment of the anomaly detection results, development of diagnostic approaches (based on the reconstruction error) and also benchmarking of componential coding with other techniques (including waveform measures, Fourier-based signal reconstruction and principal component analysis). This is achieved by applying componential coding to the data monitored from both a conventional induction motor and from a novel transverse flux motor. The results reveal that machine condition monitoring using componential coding is not only capable of detecting and then diagnosing anomalies but it also outperforms other conventional techniques in that it is able to separate very small and localized anomalies.

J	Morhain, A; Mba, D				Morhain, A; Mba, D			Bearing defect diagnosis and acoustic emission	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY			English	Article						acoustic emissions; bearing defect diagnosis; condition monitoring	WAVES	Acoustic emission (AE) was originally developed for non-destructive testing of static structures, but over the years its application has been extended to health monitoring of rotating machines and bearings. It offers the advantage of earlier defect detection in comparison with vibration analysis. However, limitations in the successful application of the AE technique for monitoring bearings have been partly due to the difficulty in processing, interpreting and classifying the acquired data. The investigation reported in this paper was centred on the application of standard AE characteristic parameters on a radially loaded bearing. An experimental test rig was modified such that defects could be seeded onto the inner and outer races of a test bearing. As the test rig was adapted for this purpose, it offered high background acoustic emission noise providing a realistic test for fault diagnosis. In addition to a review of current diagnostic methods for applying AE to bearing diagnosis, the results of this investigation validated the use of r.m.s., amplitude, energy and AE counts for diagnosis. Furthermore, this study determined the most appropriate threshold level for AE count diagnosis, the first known attempt.

This paper presents a novel method for employing HMMs for autonomous diagnostics as well as prognostics. The diagnostics module exploits competitive learning to achieve HMM-based clustering. The prognostics module builds upon the diagnostics module to compute joint distributions for health-state transition times. The proposed methods were validated on a physical test bed; a drilling machine.

We have developed a Distributed Diagnostic Agent System, DDAS that detects faults of a device based on signal analysis and machine learning. The CBR techniques presented here are used to find root cause of vehicle faults based on the information provided by the signal agents in DDAS. Two CBR methods are presented, one used directly the diagnostic output from the signal agents and another uses the signal segment features. We present experiments conducted on real vehicle cases collected from auto dealers and the results show that both method are effective in finding root causes of vehicle faults.

In particular, we have built and tested a program, based on fairly simple information visualization techniques, to navigate interactively real-life BGP OASC (Origin AS Change) events. Our initial experience demonstrates that the integration of mechanical analysis and human intelligence can effectively improve the performance of anomaly detection and alert correlation. Furthermore, while a traditional representation of OASC events provides either little or no valuable information, our program can accurately identify, correlate previously unknown BGP/OASC problems, and provide network operators with a valuable high-level abstraction about the dynamics of BGP.

Due to environment degraded conditions, direct measurements are not possible, also for rapidity of the machine, human intervention is not possible in case of position fault. Therefore, an oriented vision solution is proposed. Degraded conditions are vibrations, dazzling, water and chips of metal projections... In this case, the once method cannot achieve a diagnostic problem: is it the right piece at the right place? That is why complementary methods presented in this paper are proposed in an adaptive way to solve this diagnostic problem. Image processing methods allow us to find image parameters. After a data analysis, image parameters are reduced. Then, using Bayesian approach and Neural approach, it is possible to ensure the diagnostic result. With these two methods, we obtain encouraging results and we show that it is possible to improve the results by combining different classifiers approaches.

A theoretical framework of 'dynamic similarity' in which two sets of mathematical operators are utilized in one system/data model to distinguish damage from nonlinear, time-varying and stochastic events in the measured data is discussed in this paper. Because structural damage initiation, evolution and accumulation are nonlinear processes, the challenge here is to distinguish abnormal from normal nonlinear dynamics, which are accentuated by physically or statistically non-stationary events in the operating environment. After discussing several examples of structural diagnosis and prognosis involving dynamic similarity, a simplified numerical finite element model of a helicopter blade with time-varying flexural stiffness on a nonlinear aerodynamic elastic foundation that is subjected to a stochastic base excitation is utilized to introduce and examine the effects of dynamic similarity on health monitoring systems. It is shown that environmental variability can be distinguished from structural damage using a physics-based model in conjunction with the dynamic similarity operators to develop more robust damage detection algorithms, which may prove to be more accurate and precise when operating conditions fluctuate.

The kind of early fault detection and diagnosis performed by Aladdin is aimed at allowing more time for decision making, increasing the operator awareness, reducing component damage, and supporting improved plant availability and reliability. In this paper we describe in broad lines the Aladdin transient classifier, which combines techniques such as recurrent neural network ensembles, Wavelet On-Line Pre-processing (WOLP), and Autonomous Recursive Task Decomposition (ARTD), in an attempt to improve the practical applicability and scalability of this type of systems to real processes and machinery. The paper focuses then on describing an application of Aladdin to a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) through the use of the HAMBO experimental simulator of the Forsmark 3 boiling water reactor NPP in Sweden. It should be pointed out that Aladdin is not necessarily restricted to applications in NPPs. Other types of power plants, or even other types of processes, can also benefit from the diagnostic capabilities of Aladdin.

J	Lane, S; Martin, EB; Morris, AJ; Gower, P				Lane, S; Martin, EB; Morris, AJ; Gower, P			Application of exponentially weighted principal component analysis for the monitoring of a polymer film manufacturing process	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						exponential weighting; polymer film manufacturing process; principal component analysis	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; SHEET-FORMING PROCESSES; MULTIVARIATE; MODELS; PCA; PLS	Multivariate statistical representations have been widely used in the process manufacturing industries for process performance monitoring, in particular for the detection of changes in current operation and the onset of process disturbances or faults. Applications of the technology have focused to a lesser extent on manufacturing processes where drift occurs over time as part of normal process operation, e.g., due to reactor fouling, machine wear, ramping of temperatures during process operation, and changes due to set-point adjustments. In this paper, an extension to the methodology based on the statistical projection technique of principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed for the monitoring of processes where drift and set-points changes are common place, i.e., exponentially weighted PCA. The technique is illustrated through its application to a polymer film manufacturing process where the representation is required to adapt quickly to changes in the process that are part of normal operating procedures, but remain sensitive to the detection of deviations from normal operation.

J	Bartelmus, W				Bartelmus, W			Diagnostic information on gearbox condition for mechatronic systems	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						computer simulation; condition monitoring; diagnostics; gearbox		To maintain mechatronic systems, operational current diagnostic information on gearing condition is needed. Diagnostic information on gearbox condition can be gained from vibration signals. To extract suitable information from the signal we need to know the relation between factors influencing the diagnostic signal and the gearbox condition. There are several factors that have influence on diagnostic signals and these may be divided into four groups: design (DF), production technology (PTF) operational (OF) and change of condition (CCF). To gain information from the vibration signal, many experiments have to be carried out. Because many factors influence the vibration signal, the experiments on real objects are very expensive. To reduce the cost, mathematical modelling and computer simulation may be used. Papers devoted to mathematical modelling and computer simulation are concentrated on one-stage gearboxes. In this research work, a system that consists of a driving motor, coupling, double-stage gearbox and driven machine is considered. Using the model, it is possible to investigate the above-mentioned factors that influence the vibration signal. Faults occur during a gearbox operation. Gearing faults may be divided into single faults (a crack in a tooth or its breakage) and distributed faults caused by gearing wear (pitting, scuffing, abrasion and erosion). The methods of fault detection using signal analysis is given in this paper. The paper shows how mathematical modelling and computer simulations help signal interpretation, taken from real measurements. Frequency, time and time-frequency analysis are used for signal interpretation. As a result, we obtain spectra, cepstra and time-frequency spectrograms. The paper refers to the condition monitoring method, which used simple wide-band signal estimators. The method may be easily adopted for use in monitoring the online gearbox condition in mechatronics systems, whereas an advanced signal interpretation may be used for offline condition monitoring.

This problem appears in a class of linear optimization applications used in the steel and aluminum industry, though similar problems are at the core of many research and practical applications. Understanding the effects of parameter variations in linear optimization problems, allow control experts to select Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) process control policies that better match existing plant conditions. Introducing mathematically-oriented tools of this type is a significant departure from the existing industrial process visualization style: existing human-machine interfaces are based either on the implementation or on the physical structure of the control system - mainly for the purpose of an easier fault detection and isolation. By contrast, the proposed method capitalize on the mathematical model used for the MIMO control and it is thus a more true predictor of the effects operator changes will have on the system.

For LAN duplicating, a Dual-Path Ethernet Module (DPEM) is developed. Since a DPEM is simply located at the front end of any network device as a transparent add-on type independent hardware machine, it does not require sophisticated server reconfiguration. We examine the desirable properties and the characteristics on the Dual-LAN structure. Our evaluation results show that the developed scheme is more efficient than the conventional Single-LAN structures in various aspects.

Using mutation-based alternative testing criteria it is possible to reduce the number of mutants but it is still necessary to determine the equivalent ones. In this paper the Bayesian Learning(one of the Artificial Intelligence techniques used in machine learning) is investigated to define the Bayesian Learning-Based Equivalent Detection Technique (BaLBEDeT), which provides guidelines to help the tester to analyze the live mutants in order to determine the equivalent ones.

J	Deshpande, VS; Modak, JP				Deshpande, VS; Modak, JP			Application of RCM for safety considerations in a steel plant	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						RCM; safety; maintenance schedule; PM; steel industry		Any operation or process done on machine or its parts to enhance the efficiency of machine before or after the breakdown is called maintenance. A concern may be said to be successful over the years, when it runs non-interrupted, maintains a smooth production flow consistently and at optimum productivity levels. Plant can achieve productivity up to a satisfactory level by proper maintenance work. The maintenance system may be categorized as either 'Planned' or 'Unplanned'. The classic maintenance problems in modem industries are insufficient pro-active maintenance, frequent problem repetition, erroneous maintenance work, sound maintenance practices not institutionalized, unnecessary and conservative PM, sketchy rationale for PM actions, lack of traceability/visibility for maintenance program, blind acceptance of OEM inputs, PM variability between like/similar units, paucity of predictive maintenance applications. Hence it was necessary to develop an appropriate methodology to develop strategies and programmatic approach to deal with such problems. The reliability centered maintenance offers the most systematic and efficient process to address an overall programmatic approach to the optimization of plant and equipment maintenance. In this paper, the concept of RCM has been applied to process of vacuum degassing/vacuum oxygen decarburising (VDNOD) in steel melting shop of a medium scale steel industry. Safety consideration is the significant aspect for selection of the system. By systematically applying the RCM methodology, failures, failure modes are analyzed. To preserve the system function, preventive maintenance tasks such as inspection/checking, lubrication, cleaning, adjustment, replacement, are allotted for various failure modes. RCM based preventive maintenance schedule for the system is formulated and compared with the company's existing preventive maintenance schedule. For subsystems such as ejectors, water-ring pumps and the RLC/ladle car/furnace, existing maintenance schedule is conservative. For oxygen lance and cooling pumps, maintenance frequency is to be increased to quarterly from yearly in the present schedule. For condensers bimonthly schedule is recommended as compared to none, whereas for cooling pumps the schedule remains unchanged. This reveals that RCM based tasks need not necessarily increase the frequency but can, retain or even decrease the frequency of maintenance based on functional priorities. RCM can also recommend the additional maintenance tasks. Application of RCM based PM schedule requires use of age exploration technique and attitudinal changes.

J	Wolfram, A; Isermann, R				Wolfram, A; Isermann, R			Component based tele-diagnosis approach to a textile machine	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						fault detection and diagnosis; tele-diagnosis; component-based; maintenance on demand		The detection and diagnosis of faults in technical systems is of great practical significance. With the help of recent data transfer techniques, service technicians must not necessarily be on site in order to diagnose the cause of failure. Therefore tele-diagnosis can be defined as a service making use of modern communication channels. However, further progress can be achieved by automating the supervision task. An early detection of faults may help to avoid product deterioration, performance degradation, major damage to the machinery itself and damage to human health or even loss of lives. Furthermore, by employing modern diagnostic systems, faults can even be detected before they lead to a partial or total failure of the plant. This information can be utilised to plan maintenance cycles and thus to minimise plant outages. Within this paper a component-based plant monitoring approach is proposed which relies on the idea that the supervision of complex plants can take place in the individual components.

The cardiovascular functional ability (FA) is a reliable parameter, which may define the lesion of the cardiovascular system following myocardial infarction. We have applied the Cubist machine learning tool to set up a model that defines the residual cardiovascular functional ability after a myocardial infarction by means of the maximal CPK in the acute phase of the disease. Cubist models numeric data and generates values by means of a collection of rules associated with the linear expression for computing target values. Based on the literature data set of Miric et al.,(1) we have derived and tested a reliable and accurate Cubist model for acute inferior and anteroseptal myocardial infarction consisting of three simple rules. The rules enable simple prediction of the expected cardiovascular functional ability in myocardial infarction following recovery. The model is based on two clinical parameters related to the disease, maximal CPK in the acute phase of the myocardial lesion, and anteroseptal or inferior cardial localisation of the infarction. Strong correlation (r anteroseptal = 1.00, r inferior = 0.94, n = 56), insignificant differences of real and predicted values, and low average error of the leave-one-out test (anteroseptal 1.72, inferior 3.54) confirm the accuracy of the method and its applicability in clinical medicine. In addition to the prognostic and diagnostic application, the extracted rules enable more efficient evaluation of new drugs and therapeutic procedures in Cardiology.

The tools are aimed at implementing system-level diagnosis using a comparison model. The diagnostic model accounts for some critical features of the APEmille architecture, and has been validated by means of VHDL simulation. Essentially, diagnostic tools force all processors to synchronously execute the same test program using the same data set, and compare the outputs of adjacent processors in real time. The diagnostic tools also implement a preliminary test session aimed at covering faults that might disrupt the comparison model. The diagnosis algorithm and the test programs used in comparison tests are also described.

Generally, a NN is trained off-line with all the data obtained prior to commissioning, which is hot possible in a practical situation.

They used the autocorrelation function to define a characteristic factor for a certain lithography-related failure mode. The frequency of lithography-related faults was monitored as time series data. Also, components of the characteristic factor quantified the direction of the inclination of lithography-related patterns. They changed according to time. The origin of faults varies with patterns. Thus, it is presumed that their causes differed with each period. Fault sourcing for a failure mode was carried out by correlating machine data and the characteristic factor with chi(2) test. Since the characteristic factor included only one failure factor, this test could be performed with high sensitivity. The authors classified lithography-related faults and evaluated their yield impact from their frequency and yield loss automatically.

J	Liang, B; Payne, BS; Ball, AD; Iwnicki, SD				Liang, B; Payne, BS; Ball, AD; Iwnicki, SD			Simulation and fault detection of three-phase induction motors	MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION			English	Article						fault simulation; mathematical models; condition monitoring; induction motors		Computer simulation of electric motor operation is particularly useful for gaining an insight into their dynamic behaviour and electro-mechanical interaction. A suitable model enables motor faults to be simulated and the change in corresponding parameters to be predicted without physical experimentation. This paper presents both a theoretical and experimental analysis of asymmetric stator and rotor faults in induction machines. A three-phase induction motor was simulated and operated under normal healthy operation, with one broken rotor bar and with voltage imbalances between phases of supply. The results illustrate good agreement between both simulated and experimental results. (C) 2002 IMACS. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, Q; Tang, Y				Sun, Q; Tang, Y			Singularity analysis using continuous wavelet transform for bearing fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							SIGNALS; REPRESENTATION; RECONSTRUCTION; MAXIMA	In this paper. wavelet transform is applied to detect abrupt changes in the vibration signals obtained from operating bearings being monitored. In particular, singularity analysis across all scales of the continuous wavelet transform is performed to identify the location (in time) of defect-induced bursts in the vibration signals. Through modifying the intensity of the wavelet transform modulus maxima, defect-related vibration signature is highlighted and can be easily associated with the bearing defect characteristic frequencies for diagnosis. Due to the fact that vibration characteristics of faulty bearings are complex and defect-related vibration signature is normally buried in the wideband noise and high frequency structural resonance. simple signal processing cannot be used to detect bearing fault. We show, through experimental results, that the proposed method has the ability to discriminate noise from the signal significantly and is robust to bearing operating conditions, such as load and speed. and severity, of the bearing damage. These properties are desirable for automatic detection of machine faults. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Both narrow and wide bandwidth PD detectors are considered; particular attention is given in regard to their suitability to different types of electrical apparatus and cable specimens under test as well as their applicability to discharge site location and their capability to detect different forms of PD. A rather substantial portion of the discussion is devoted to the use of intelligent machines as applied to PD pattern recognition in terms of either PD pulse-height/discharge epoch (phase) distributions or discharge pulse shape attributes.

J	Aenis, M; Knopf, E; Nordmann, R				Aenis, M; Knopf, E; Nordmann, R			Active magnetic bearings for the identification and fault diagnosis in turbomachinery	MECHATRONICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st IFAC Conference on Mechatronic Systems	SEP 18-20, 2000	DARMSTADT, GERMANY	IFAC		magnetic bearings; force measurement; dynamics; frequency responses; diagnosis		Active magnetic bearings, a typical mechatronic product, have been successfully applied in industrial turbomachinery. Their main advantages are the contactless working principle,the frictionless suspension, and that they represent an active system. Therefore, the active magnetic bearings are well suited to operate contactless as actuator and sensor elements in rotating machinery. The aim of the presented projects of the Special Research Program (SFB 241) supported by the German Research Council (DFG) is to use active magnetic bearings as an identification and diagnosis tool for turbomachines. The identification and diagnosis procedures are. based on frequency response functions. For this type of diagnosis using transfer functions, an accurate force measurement is crucial. The paper compares force measurement results and achievable accuracies of a radial magnetic bearing using different measurement techniques over a large operating range. Furthermore, a state-space model of the entire mechatronic system is developed to facilitate the diagnosis procedure. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

ErbB2 is resistant to degradation mediated by c-Cbl, the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ligand-induced ubiquitination of ErbB1 (epidermal growth factor receptor). Because of its resistance to degradation, ErbB2 is the preferred dimerization partner for other members of the ErbB family, and its overexpression in vivo is associated with poor prognosis. We now show that the chaperone-binding ubiquitin ligase CHIP efficiently ubiquitinates and down-regulates ErbB2. CHIP expression shortens the half-life of both nascent and mature ErbB2 protein. In vitro ubiquitination assay shows that CHIP serves as a ubiquitin ligase for ErbB2, and both exogenously expressed and endogenous CHIP coprecipitate with the kinase. Furthermore, CHIP association with ErbB2 requires a chaperone intermediate and is increased by the chaperone-binding drug geldanamycin, a potent stimulator of ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation. These data describe a previously unrecognized pathway, amenable to pharmacologic manipulation, that mediates ErbB2 stability.

One approach to counter the loss of production is to make the machines more reliable, thereby reducing their times of non-use. Another is to enable machine operators to solve the problem themselves, thereby avoiding the delay until maintenance staff is sent from different locations. Operators may be supported in the fault-finding process by a knowledge-based decision-support system. The questions are how to avoid the negative consequences of using such systems and how to even increase competence on the job is addressed by competence promoting multi-agent system for support (ComPASS), a system based on a multi-agent architecture, and an instrument to measure competence enhancement. A running, functioning prototype was developed and evaluated. Based on this experience the system is currently being extended and improved, first results of which are presented here. (C) 2002 IMACS.

It is shown for aromatic amines, used as an example of organics found in River Elbe water, Germany, how the simulation methods provide basic information about rate constants of biological degradation and adsorption equilibrium constants under conditions that are as realistic as possible. Biodegradation of nitroanilines and higher chlorinated anilines is relatively slow and adsorption onto the sandy aquifer material is weak. Accordingly, occurrence of these compounds in the production wells of the waterworks cannot be excluded. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In practice, static and dynamic eccentricities happen to exist together. With this point in mind, an analytical approach to evaluate performance of a. three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentric condition has been presented in this paper. Clear and step-by-step theoretical analysis, explaining completely the presence of certain harmonics in the line-current spectrum in presence of eccentricity, is discussed. More important, it is shown for the first time that a link exists between the low- and high-frequency elements of these harmonics. It is also shown that these high-frequency components are not very strong in all types of machines. These results will be, useful in generating rules and laws to formulate online, tools for machine-condition monitoring. Finite-element results to substantiate the inductance values used in the simulation are also included. The analysis is validated by the line-current spectrum of the eccentric machine obtained through simulation using modified winding-function. approach (MWFA) and experimentation.

This stems from current and voltage signature analysis which has progressed from the laboratory and the work of dedicated specialist experts to become the base for modern instrumentation available to plant operatives. In addition to line-fed motors, a clear view of variable-frequency drive applications is now possible without requiring connection directly to the motor terminals. The use of the motor itself as a transparent sensor, making shaft torque signatures available at the motor control cabinet, allows for advanced diagnostics of the voltage supply, motor, and load system.

J	Qiu, J; Zhang, C; Seth, BB; Liang, SY				Qiu, J; Zhang, C; Seth, BB; Liang, SY			Damage mechanics approach for bearing lifetime prognostics	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							CUMULATIVE FATIGUE DAMAGE; CRACK-PROPAGATION; ROLLING-CONTACT; MACHINERY	The ability to achieve accurate bearing prognostics is critical to the optimal maintenance of rotating machinery in the interest of cost and productivity. However, techniques to real time predict the lifetime of a bearing under practical operating conditions have not been well developed. In this paper, a stiffness-based prognostic model for bearing systems based on vibration response analysis and damage mechanics is discussed. As the bearing system is considered as a single-degree-of-freedom vibratory system, its natural frequency and its acceleration amplitude at the natural frequency can be related to the system stiffness. On the other hand, the relationship between failure lifetime, running time and stiffness variation can be established from the damage mechanics. Combining the above two, the natural frequency and the acceleration amplitude of a bearing system can be related to its running time and failure lifetime. Thus, the failure lifetime of a bearing system can be predicted on-line based on vibration measurement. Experiments have been performed on a tapered roller bearing life testing stand under various operation conditions to calibrate and to validate the proposed model. The comparison between model-calculated data and experimental results indicates that this model can be used to effectively predict the failure lifetime and the remaining life of a bearing system.

J	Dow, CR; Chen, JS; Hsieh, MC				Dow, CR; Chen, JS; Hsieh, MC			Checkpointing MPI applications on symmetric multi-processor machines using SMPCkpt	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						checkpointing; fault-tolerance; symmetric multi-processor machines; MPI; playback debugging; process migration; rollback and recovery	RECOVERY; SYSTEMS	Researchers from many different areas have requirements for computational power to solve their specific problems. Symmetric multi-processor (SMP) machines are also widely available and their processing capacity is in demand particularly for applications in areas such as virtual reality and multimedia. Checkpointing provides the backbone for rollback recovery (fault-tolerance), playback debugging, process migration and job swapping. Numerous checkpointing tools have been designed and implemented but few are based on SMP machines for MPI applications. This work designs, develops, and implements SMPCkpt, a checkpointing system for symmetric multi-processor environments. SMPCkpt supports a range of facilities, including transparent checkpointing, fault detection, and rollback recovery. Two coordinated checkpointing algorithms, barrier and non-barrier, are developed and implemented in SMPCkpt that can be used to reduce the execution down time in the presence of failures.

J	Boesch, DF				Boesch, DF			Challenges and opportunities for science in reducing nutrient over-enrichment of coastal ecosystems	ESTUARIES			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; CHESAPEAKE BAY; WATER-QUALITY; MARINE EUTROPHICATION; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NITROGEN; TRENDS; IMPACT; HYPOXIA	Nutrient over-enrichment has resulted in major changes in the coastal ecosystems of developed nations in Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania, mostly taking place over the narrow period of 1960 to 1980. Many estuaries and embayments are affected, but the effects of this eutrophication have been also felt over large areas of semi-enclosed seas including the Baltic, North, Adriatic, and Black Seas in Europe, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Seto Inland Sea in Japan. Primary production increased, water clarity decreased, food chains were altered, oxygen depletion of bottom waters developed or expanded, seagrass beds were lost, and harmful algal blooms occurred with increased frequency. This period of dramatic alteration of coastal ecosystems, mostly for the worse from a human perspective, coincided with the more than doubling of additions of fixed nitrogen to the biosphere from human activities, driven particularly by a more than 5-fold increase in use of manufactured fertilizers during that 20-year period. Nutrient over-enrichment often interacted synergistically with other human activities, such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and other forms of chemical pollution, in contributing to the widespread degradation of coastal ecosystems that was observed during the last half of the 20th century. Science was effective in documenting the consequences and root causes of nutrient over-enrichment and has provided the basis for extensive efforts to abate it, ranging from national statutes and regulations to multi-jurisdictional compacts under the Helsinki Commission for the Baltic Sea, the Oslo-Paris Commission for the North Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay Program, for example. These efforts have usually been based on a relatively arbitrary goal of reducing nutrient inputs by a certain percentage, without much understanding of how and when this would affect the coastal ecosystem. While some of these efforts have succeeded in achieving reductions of inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen, principally through treatment of point-source discharges, relatively little progress has been made in reducing diffuse sources of nitrogen. Second-generation management goals tend to be based on desired outcomes for the coastal ecosystem and determination of the load reductions needed to attain them, for example the Total Daily Maximum Load approach in the U.S. and the Water Framework Directive in the European Union. Science and technology are now challenged not just to diagnose the degree of eutrophication and its causes, but to contribute to its prognosis and treatment by determining the relative susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to nutrient over-enrichment, defining desirable and achievable outcomes for rehabilitation efforts, reducing nutrient sources, enhancing nutrient sinks, strategically targeting these efforts within watersheds, and predicting and observing responses in an adaptive management framework.

J	Roverso, D				Roverso, D			Plant diagnostics by transient classification: The ALADDIN approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	OECD Halden Workshop on Power Plant Surveillance and Diagnostics	SEP 03-04, 2001	HALDEN, NORWAY	OECD			MODULAR NEURAL-NETWORK; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT; DECOMPOSITION; WAVELETS; TIME	Any action taken on a plant, for example in response to an abnormal situation or in reaction to unsafe conditions, relies on the ability to identify the state and dynamics of operation of the plant. Although there might be hundreds or even thousands of measurements in a plant, there are generally few events occurring. The data from these measurements must be mapped into appropriate descriptions of the occurring event(s), which in most cases is a difficult task. The real-time history of scores of variables can be displayed and monitored in most computerized plant monitoring and control systems. However, Whereas a simple visual inspection of displayed trends is generally sufficient to allow the operator to confirm the plant status during normal, steady-state operations, when the plant is subject to deviations due to anomalies or faults, the displayed trends of interacting variables can be very difficult to interpret, either because the changes are too subtle, or because the changes are too fast. In this article we describe the ALADDIN methodology for dynamic event recognition and fault diagnosis, which combines techniques such as recurrent neural network ensembles, wavelet on-line pre-processing (WOLP), and autonomous recursive task decomposition (ARTD), in an attempt to improve the practical applicability and scalability of this type of system to real processes and machinery.

In the preprocessing and feature extraction stage, the higher-order statistics (HOS) is used to extract features from the vibration signals. In the recognition process, two kinds of neural network classifier are used to evaluate the classification results. These two classifiers are self-organizing feature mapping (SOM) network for collecting data at the initial stage and learning vector quantization (LVQ) network at the identification stage. The experimental results obtained from HOS as preprocessor to extract the features of fault are clearer than those obtained from the power spectrum. In addition, the recognizable rate by using either SOM or LVQ as classifiers is 100%.

The Center for Emergency Response, Training, and Analysis (CERTA) located at the headquarters of NSD, Budapest, Hungary, was established in 1997. The center supports the NSD installation, radiological monitoring, and advisory team in case of nuclear emergencies, with appropriate hardware and software for communication, diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction. The vital information transfer and analysis (VITA) system represents an important part of the CERTA, as it provides for the continuous remote inspection of the four VVER-440/V213 units of the Hungarian Paks nuclear power plant (NPP). The on-line information system maintains a continuous data link with the NPP through a managed leased line that connects CERTA to a gateway computer located at the Paks NPP. The present scope of the system is a result of a 4-yr development project: In addition to the basic safety parameter display functions, the VITA system now includes an on-line break parameter estimation module, an extensive training package based on simulated transients, and on-line data transfer capabilities to feed accident diagnosis/analysis codes.

J	Bagshaw, RW; Newman, ST				Bagshaw, RW; Newman, ST			Manufacturing data analysis of machine tool errors within a contemporary small manufacturing enterprise	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						manufacturing data analysis; expert systems; feature based manufacturing; machining tool error detection and diagnosis; computer aided inspection	DATA-ANALYSIS FACILITY; STRUCTURED APPROACH; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	The main focus of this paper is directed at the determination of manufacturing errors within the contemporary smaller manufacturing enterprise sector. These can manifest themselves as machine tool, fixturing or programming errors, experienced during the manufacture of 2 1/2D components on a 3-axis vertical machining centre. The manufacturing error diagnosis is achieved through the manufacturing data analysis of the results obtained from the inspection of the component on a co-ordinate measuring machine. This manufacturing data analysis activity adopts a feature-based approach and is conducted through the application of a forward chaining expert system, termed, the Product Data Analysis Distributed Diagnostic Expert System, which forms part of a larger prototype feedback system entitled the Production Data Analysis framework. This paper introduces the manufacturing error categorisations that are associated with milling type operations, knowledge acquisition and representation, conceptual structure and operating procedure of the prototype manufacturing data analysis facility. The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the logic employed through the simulation of manufacturing error scenarios. This prototype manufacturing data analysis expert system provides a valuable aid for the rapid diagnosis and elimination of manufacturing errors on a 3-axis vertical machining centre in an environment where operator expertise is limited.

J	Hadjicostis, CN; Verghese, GC				Hadjicostis, CN; Verghese, GC			Fault-tolerant computation in groups and semigroups: applications to automata, dynamic systems and Petri nets	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						fault-tolerant computing; group machines; semigroup machines; concurrent error detection; concurrent error correction; algorithm-based fault tolerance; automata; linear time-invariant dynamic systems; Petri nets	RELIABLE COMPUTATION; MATRIX; NOISE	The traditional approach to fault-tolerant computation has been via modular hardware redundancy. Although universal and simple, modular redundancy is inherently expensive and inefficient. By exploiting particular structural features of a computational architecture or an algorithm, arithmetic codes and recently developed algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques manage to introduce "analytical redundancy" and offer more efficient fault coverage at the cost of narrower applicability and harder design. In this paper, we extend a variety of results and constructive procedures that were developed in previous work for computations that take place in an abelian group to a more general setting that considers computations in semigroups. We demonstrate possible encodings for semigroup operations of interest and use our extension to design concurrent error detection and correction schemes for group and semigroup machines. The method provides insight regarding the role of decomposition in fault-tolerant algebraic machines and results in a general, hardware-independent characterization of concurrent error detection and correction in finite semiautomata. We also demonstrate that by extending this approach to other dynamic systems, with specific hardware implementations and failure modes, we can systematically obtain fault-tolerant architectures. More specifically, we apply these techniques to linear time-invariant dynamic systems and Petri net models of discrete event systems. (C) 2002 The Franklin Institute.

J	Peng, Z; He, Y; Chen, Z; Chu, F				Peng, Z; He, Y; Chen, Z; Chu, F			Identification of the shaft orbit for rotating machines using wavelet modulus maxima	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								In this paper, a novel approach for the identification of the shaft centre orbits is proposed, which is based on wavelet modulus maxima. For this approach, continuous wavelet transform is utilised upon the Theta-S diagram of the shaft centre orbits, and then, maxima lines are extracted and Lipschitz exponents alpha of every maxima line are calculated by non-linear least-squares method. The number of maxima lines with positive alpha, the mean of the positive alpha, the number of maxima lines with negative alpha and the mean of the negative alphaE are used as features of the shaft orbits. In succession, the four features are used as the inputs of the back-propagation network to classify the shaft orbits for the fault diagnosis for the rotating machines. The experimental data of four classes of faults (rub-impact, oil whirl, coupling misalignment and unbalance) are used to test the performance of the proposed method. The test result indicates that the proposed method is very effective with the advantages of fewer features used and faster training of the network, and can fulfil classification of the shaft centre orbit with satisfactory accuracy.

Theoretical study of two mutually wearing bodies has shown that their steady-state worn profile depend on their initial profiles. This conclusion enables to suggest the possibility of control over wheel/rail stable-state worn profile, which should be optimal on the selected criteria. Equations derived in this study make it possible to find the optimal wheel flange/rail head profile which provides for minimal total wear rate of wheel traveling along the selected track section, once the lateral forces, and the angle of attack and the wear model are known. To obtain the wear model, i.e. the dependence of the wear rate from the contact parameters, laboratory simulation of wear between wheel flange and side face of the rail head is used. Laboratory experiments were carried out on the rolling-lateral sliding wear testing machine. Analysis of modeled worn wheel flange/rail head optimal profile is made. Practical application of the suggested approach is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Mater. Process. Technol. 107 (2000) 243]. The methodology termed automated sensor and signal processing selection (ASPS), is based on Taguchi's orthogonal arrays in order to provide cost effective and speedy selection of sensors and signal processing methods that are ultimately used for monitoring process conditions. The evaluation using tool damage in end milling operations shows that ASPS methodology can successfully achieve its objectives without significantly affecting the system's capability for fault detection. The experiments investigate two new types of cutting tools each with three distinct conditions which are processed by four different and independent neural network paradigms-two supervised and two unsupervised. Thus, the results confirm the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed ASPS methodology and show that it can be applied to condition monitoring systems without the need for implementing pattern recognition tools during the design phase.

J	Hoffman, AJ; van der Merwe, NT				Hoffman, AJ; van der Merwe, NT			The application of neural networks to vibrational diagnostics for multiple fault conditions	COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES			English	Article						vibration analysis; bearing defects; imbalance; deteriorating fault conditions; automated diagnostics; neural networks; Kohonen feature maps; nearest neighbour rule; radial basis function networks		Vibration analysis has long been used for the detection and identification of machine fault conditions. The specific characteristics of the vibration spectrum that are associated with common fault conditions are quite well known, e.g. the BPOR spectral component reflecting bearing defects and the peak at the rotational frequency in the vibration spectrum indicating the degree of imbalance. The typical use of these features would be to determine when a machine should be taken out of operation in the presence of deteriorating fault conditions. Reliable diagnostics of deteriorating conditions may however be more problematic in the presence of simultaneous fault conditions. This paper demonstrates that the presence of a bearing defect makes it impossible to determine the degree of imbalance based on a single vibration feature, e.g. the peak at rotational frequency. In such a case, it is necessary to employ diagnostic techniques that are suited to the parallel processing of multiple features. Neural networks are the best known technique to approach such a problem. The paper demonstrates that a neural classifier using the X and Y components of both the peak at rotational frequency and the peak at BPOR frequency as input features can reliably diagnose the presence of bearing defect and can at the same time indicate the degree of imbalance. Several different neural techniques are evaluated for this purpose. It is first shown how Kohonen feature maps can be applied to do an exploratory analysis on the data, and to implement reliable classification of different bearing conditions. Different supervised neural classification techniques are then evaluated for their ability to reliably model the degree of imbalance, while also identifying the presence of defects.

The class of faults to be diagnosed is restricted to broken rotor bars, asymmetry in the rotor cage and asymmetry in the stator, arising due to an inter-turn fault resulting in an opening or shorting of one or more circuits of stator phase windings. The method is based on model invalidation tools and H-infinity/mu-framework models. The experimental model consists of a nominal model estimated by means of a subspace identification algorithm, together with linear fractional norm-bounded perturbations and norm-bounded unknown inputs.

The human immune system is a remarkable system of interacting cells and organs that protect the body from invasion and maintains reliable operation even in the presence of invading bacteria or viruses. This paper seeks to address the field of electronic hardware fault tolerance from an immunological perspective with the aim of showing how novel methods based upon the operation of the immune system can both complement and create new approaches to the development of fault detection mechanisms for reliable hardware systems. in particular, it is shown that by use of partial Matching, as prevalent in biological systems, high fault coverage can be achieved with the added advantage of reducing memory requirements. The development of a generic finite-state-machine immunization procedure is discussed that allows any system that can be represented in such a manner to be "immunized" against the occurrence of faulty operation. This is demonstrated by the creation of an immunized decade counter that can detect the presence of faults in real time.

J	Goumas, SK; Zervakis, ME; Stavrakakis, GS				Goumas, SK; Zervakis, ME; Stavrakakis, GS			Classification of washing machines vibration signals using discrete wavelet analysis for feature extraction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						fault diagnosis; feature extraction; Karhunen-Loeve transform; neural and neuro-fuzzy systems; pattern recognition; statistical signal processing; wavelet analysis		Wavelets provide a powerful tool for nonstationary signal analysis. In vibration monitoring, the occurrence of occasional transient disturbances makes the recorded signal nonstationary, especially during the start-up of an engine. Through the wavelet analysis, transients can be decomposed into series of wavelet components, each of which is a time-domain signal that covers a specific octave frequency band. Disturbances of small extent (duration) are amplified relative to the rest of the signal when projected to similar size wavelet bases and, thus, they can be easily detected in the corresponding frequency band. This paper presents a new method for extracting features in the wavelet domain and uses them for classification of washing machines vibration transient signals. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT), in conjunction with statistical digital signal processing techniques, is used for feature extraction. The Karhunen Loeve transform (KLT) is used for feature reduction and decorrelation of the feature vectors. The Euclidean, Mahalanobis, and Bayesian distance classifiers, the learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier, and the fuzzy gradient classifier are used for classification of the resulting feature space. Classification results are illustrated and compared for the rising part of vibration velocity signals of a variety of real washing machines with various defects.

J	Bogard, F; Debray, K; Guo, YQ				Bogard, F; Debray, K; Guo, YQ			Determination of sensor positions for predictive maintenance of revolving machines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						ball bearing; finite element of bearing; modal analysis; experimental validation; conditional maintenance	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; STIFFNESS	The monitoring by measurement and analysis of vibration is largely used to detect the defects in revolving machines. The determination of the best sensor positions is one of the main research goals in the field of predictive maintenance. This paper proposes a numerical methodology based on a finite element model and a spectral analysis in order to find optimum sensor positions. The bearing is a key component for the vibration propagation from the moving parts to static ones. An analytical bearing model and its numerical implementation in a finite element code are presented. The tangent stiffness matrix of the bearing element is obtained by the Newton-Raphson method and then used for the modal and spectral analyses. Several techniques are used to find the most sensitive zones to common defects. The proposed numerical approach correlate well with the experimental results. The numerical modeling of a grinder shows the interests in industrial applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although Statistical Process Control (SPC) has been widely used as the primary method in the control of quality, it mainly serves as a change detection tool rather than a method to identify root causes of process changes. This paper proposes a systematic approach to overcome the limitations faced by SPC. In this method, a state space variation propagation model is derived from the product and process design information. The virtual machining concept is applied to isolate faults between operations, and further used in the root cause determination. The detailed methodology is presented, and a case study is conducted to illustrate and verify the developed diagnosis method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Park model was used to describe the electrical variables. System faults such as stator winding failures or broken rotor bars are investigated. Parameter variations due to heating are considered. The identification of a single parameter, modelling the temperature effect, has allowed good detection within a classical analytical redundancy scheme. The wavelet transform is applied to the residuals rather than to the raw stator currents, in order to filter variations due to variable speed. An experimental benchmark (Leroy-Sommer, 1.1 kW) has allowed a practical comparison of the methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A method is presented that can discover recurrent patterns from multiple flows of events, such as alarms and configuration events, as well as discrete information, such as traffic and usage, taking into account static and dynamic information concerning observed objects and their environments. This method can filter out theoretically useless patterns, using a novel technique for detecting chaos in sequences of events. The prediction accuracy of the discovered patterns has been measured using objects with dynamic behavior controlled by known and complex differential equations. The proposed mining method has been used for discovering and predicting alarms in a computer network composed of several Internet servers taking into account the alarm and configuration events history, as well as static information about these servers.

Particular attention is focused on the system used to measure vertical stress in the mechanical structure of a Tokamak nuclear fusion plant during fusion experiments. The strategy adopted is based on a modular structure comprising two stages. The first stage consists of a neural network which acts as a symptom model able to estimate directly some suitable features of the expected sensor responses, thus allowing the most frequently occurring sensor faults to be isolated. The second stage consists of a fault classifier implemented via a fuzzy inference system, in order to exploit the knowledge of the experts. The proposed strategy has been validated at the Joint European Torus (JET), on several experiments. A comparison has been made with both traditional sensor monitoring techniques and validation performed manually by experts. A great improvement has been achieved, in terms of both fault detection and classification capabilities, and the degree of automation achieved.

Conventional monitoring techniques are designed for operating conditions near nominal speed and load. Generally, load torque is not available at batch test as the test sample should not or cannot be clutched. However, at standstill, shaft torque and rotor currents are big enough to enable rotor monitoring. Therefore, short-circuit tests are applicable for diagnostic purposes. This application will be demonstrated by means of the Vienna Monitoring Method, which is a model-based torque evaluation technique.

The evaluation criteria include the effect of integration of the force ring on the dynamics of the spindle. the drift behavior due to temperature change inside the spindle. the cross-talk between the channels, and the existence and compensation of the spindle-internal forces. The application of the force ring to process model-based monitoring and fault diagnosis has been demonstrated by the determination of force calibration coefficients using the force ring and their comparison with results obtained with a platform dynamometer.

J	DiMaggio, SJ				DiMaggio, SJ			Acceptance screening of turbopump gears using the cepstrum method	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION	Vibration measurements are used to assess the health of components in rotating equipment across a wide range of industries, The typical practice in most machinery analysis is to establish a baseline for a specific machine and subsequently implement a regular monitoring schedule. In a process known as trend analysis, changes in relevant parameters are then tracked over the life of the machine. In some cases the comparison of measurements between different machines is not recommended because of variability in transmission path effects caused by either manufacturing tolerances or differences in the instrumentation setup. Although these concerns are valid, the constraints imposed by the particular application to acceptance screening of rocket engine turbomachinery make a comparison between engines useful. It is suggested that engine-to-engine comparisons of vibration-related parameters can be used to provide information on abnormal gear behavior. Support for this proposal is presented in the context of parameters developed from a cepstrum analysis of gearbox vibration data acquired during actual ground-test acceptance firings of a rocket engine. The results obtained are also used to verify the ability of the cepstrum method to diagnose gear tooth damage in turbopumps. In this application the cepstrum is defined as the inverse discrete Fourier transform of the log of the two-sided autospectral density.

J	Peng, ZX				Peng, ZX			An integrated intelligence system for wear debris analysis	WEAR			English	Article						automatic wear debris analysis; artificial intelligence techniques; machine condition monitoring	PARTICLE CLASSIFICATION	Wear debris generated from two moving surfaces inside a machine is a direct wear product of operating machinery. The study of the debris can reveal wear mechanisms, wear modes and wear phases undergoing in the machine. Hence, wear debris analysis can be a very useful means to assess the condition of the machine. However, the current techniques for individual particle analysis are usually time-consuming and costly due to the requirement of analyst's expertise to perform particle inspection, morphology characterisation and data interpretation. The limitation has obstructed the wide application of this method. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective, reliable and cost-efficient techniques to perform wear debris analysis for industrial application. This paper presents a fully computerised package for wear debris analysis. The package includes three major systems corresponding to a three-dimensional particle analysis system, an automatic particle identification system and an expert system, communicating with each other through user-friendly interfaces. The successful development of such a system has demonstrated the possibility to achieve a fully computerised analysis system for routine and in-depth wear debris study for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

J	Roberts, C; Dassanayake, HPB; Lehrasab, N; Goodman, CJ				Roberts, C; Dassanayake, HPB; Lehrasab, N; Goodman, CJ			Distributed quantitative and qualitative fault diagnosis: railway junction case study	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						distributed detection; fault diagnosis; qualitative analysis; fuzzy hybrid systems; fieldbus; railways; maintenance	FUZZY	The paper develops a novel, comprehensive. reasoned approach to fault diagnosis in a class of reciprocating, electro-mechanical equipment referred to as single throw mechanical equipment (STME). STMEs are widely used in many industrial applications-examples of which include automatic doors, mechanical presses and barrier systems. A formal definition of the STME is initially presented. In this paper, an electro-pneumatic railway point machine within a railway junction is taken as a case study. The proposed approach distributes the fault diagnosis process across a geographical area interconnected using fieldbus data communication networks. This allows for the fault detection and isolation of multiple assets within close proximity to one another at a minimal cost. A robust, straightforward, quantitative method based on abstract static models and structured residuals is used for fault detection and preliminary diagnosis is suggested. This is capable of being implemented at an asset level on an embedded processor. Fault isolation is carried out at one central point in the distributed architecture; thus allowing full fault diagnosis of multiple assets to be carried out economically. Details of a hybrid quantitative and qualitative, neuro-fuzzy network suitable for carrying out fault isolation is discussed and results collected from a laboratory based test-rig are presented.

Classical reliability addresses statistically-generic devices and is less suitable for the situations when failures are not traced to manufacturing but rather to unique operational conditions of particular hardware units. An approach aimed at the accurate assessment of the probability of failure of any avionics unit utilizing the known history-of-abuse from environmental and operational factors is presented herein. The suggested prognostic model utilizes information downloaded from dedicated monitoring systems of flight-critical hardware and stored in a database. Such a database can be established from the laboratory testing of hardware and supplemented with real operational data. This approach results in a novel knowledge discovery from data (KDD) technology that can be efficiently used in a wide area of applications and provide a quantitative basis for the modem maintenance concept known as service-when-needed.

J	Kontogiannis, T; Moustakis, V				Kontogiannis, T; Moustakis, V			An experimental evaluation of comprehensibility aspects of knowledge structures derived through induction techniques: a case study of industrial fault diagnosis	BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ACQUISITION; INTELLIGENCE; DESIGN	Machine induction has been extensively used in order to develop knowledge bases for decision support systems and predictive systems. The extent to which developers and domain experts can comprehend these knowledge structures and gain useful insights into the basis of decision making has become a challenging research issue. This article examines the knowledge structures generated by the C4.5 induction technique in a fault diagnostic task and proposes to use a model of human learning in order to guide the process of making comprehensive the results of machine induction. The model of learning is used to generate hierarchical representations of diagnostic knowledge by adjusting the level of abstraction and varying the goal structures between 'shallow' and 'deep' ones. Comprehensibility is assessed in a global way in an experimental comparison where subjects are required to acquire the knowledge structures and transfer to new tasks. This method of addressing the issue of comprehensibility appears promising especially for machine induction techniques that are rather inflexible with regard to the number and sorts of interventions allowed to system developers.

The technique can extensively and economically characterize and predict faults from the induction machine adjustable speed drive design data. This is done through the development of dual-track proof-of-principle studies of fault simulation and identification. These studies are performed using our proven Time Stepping Coupled Finite Element-State Space method to generate fault case data. Then, the fault cases are classified by their inherent characteristics, so-called "signatures" or "fingerprints." These fault signatures are extracted or mined here from the fault case data using our novel Time Series Data Mining technique. The dual-track of generating fault data and mining fault signatures was tested here on three, six, and nine broken bar and broken end-ring connectors in a 208-volt, 60-Hz, 4-pole, 1.2-hp, squirrel cage 3-phase induction motor.

J	Oh, N; Shirvani, PP; McCluskey, EJ				Oh, N; Shirvani, PP; McCluskey, EJ			Error detection by duplicated instructions in super-scalar processors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						concurrent error detection; error detection by duplicated instructions; fault-injection experiment; fault tolerance; instruction-level parallelism; single event upset; super-scalar processor and instruction-scheduling; transient fault	CONCURRENT; CHECKING	This paper proposes a pure software technique "Error Detection by Duplicated Instructions" (EDDI), for detecting errors during usual system operation. Compared to other error-detection techniques that use hardware redundancy, EDDI does not require any hardware modifications to add error detection capability to the original system. EDDI duplicates instructions during compilation and uses different registers and variables for the new instructions. Especially for the fault in the code segment of memory, formulas are derived to estimate the error-detection coverage of EDDI using probabilistic methods. These formulas use statistics of the program, which are collected during compilation. EDDI was applied to eight benchmark programs and the error-detection coverage was estimated. Then, the estimates were verified by simulation, in which a fault injector forced a bit-flip in the code segment of executable machine codes. The simulation results validated the estimated fault coverage and show that approximately 1.5% of injected faults produced incorrect results in eight benchmark programs with EDDI, while on average, 20% of injected faults produced undetected incorrect results in the programs without EDDI. Based on the theoretical estimates and actual fault-injection experiments, EDDI can provide over 98% fault-coverage without any extra hardware for error detection. This pure software technique is especially useful when designers cannot change the hardware, but they need dependability in the computer system. To reduce the performance overhead, EDDI schedules the instructions that are added for detecting errors such that "Instruction-Level Parallelism" (ILP) is maximized. Performance overhead can be reduced by increasing ILP within a single super-scalar processor. The execution time overhead in a 4-way super-scalar processor is less than the execution time overhead in the processors that can issue two instructions in one cycle.

The machine tool failure causality digraph models a failure cause taking into consideration its failure contributing events and their interaction in terms of the cause-effect relationship, i.e. causality. The machine tool failure causality function is determined from the machine tool failure causality matrix. The matrix is obtained from the digraph, which is characteristic of the failure cause. The function is useful not only for failure cause analysis but also for comparison and evaluation of the failure cause. The coefficients of similarity and dissimilarity based on the function are also proposed. These coefficients are useful for comparison of two failure causes of a machine tool. In addition, the machine tool failure causality index, derived from the machine tool failure causality function, is proposed, which evaluates and ranks the failure causes of a machine tool.

The method shows potential for analysing transient vibration signals. An example is included that shows how the procedure was employed to analyse the transient vibration signals created from faulty low speed rolling element bearings. Spectral plots generated by applying the procedure to very short data samples, as well as trending parameters based on these spectral estimations and Prony parameters, are presented. An equation was also derived to quantitatively determine the fault status. It is shown that application of the Prony model based method has the potential to be an effective as well as efficient machine condition monitoring and diagnostic tool where short duration transient vibration signals are being generated.

J	Jack, LB; Nandi, AK				Jack, LB; Nandi, AK			Fault detection using support vector machines and artificial neural networks, augmented by genetic algorithms	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used to detect faults in rotating machinery for a number of years, using statistical methods to preprocess the vibration signals as input features. ANNs have been shown to be highly successful in this type of application; in comparison, support vector machines (SVMs) are a more recent development, and little use has been made of them in the condition monitoring arena. The availability of a limited amount of training data creates certain problems for the use of SVMs, and a strategy is advanced to improve the generalisation performance in cases where only limited training data is available. This paper examines the performance of both types of classifiers in two-class fault/no-fault recognition examples and the attempts to improve the overall generalisation performance of both techniques through the use of genetic algorithm based feature selection process.

J	Mahfouf, M; Abbod, MF; Linkens, DA				Mahfouf, M; Abbod, MF; Linkens, DA			The design of supervisory rule-based control in the operating theatre via an anaesthesia simulator	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy logic control; rule base; supervisory; fault detection; alarms; anaesthesia; SOFLC	PHARMACOKINETICS; IV	The development of online drug administration strategies in operating theatres represents a highly safety-critical situation. The usefulness of different levels of simulation prior to clinical trials has been shown in previous studies in muscle relaxant anaesthesia. Thus, in earlier work on predictive self-tuning control for muscle relaxation a dual computer real-time simulation was undertaken, subsequent to algorithm validation via off-line simulation. In the present approach a supervised rule-based control algorithm is used. The control software was implemented on the actual machine to be used in theatre, while another computer acted as a real-time patient simulator. This set-up has further advantages of providing accurate timing and also finite data accuracy via the ADC/DAC interface, or the equivalent digital lines. Also, it provides for controller design fast simulation studies compared to the real-time application. In this paper, a new architecture which combines several hierarchical levels for control (a Mamdani-type fuzzy controller), adaptation (self-organizing fuzzy logic control) and performance monitoring (fault detection, isolation and accommodation) is developed and applied to a computer real-time simulation platform for muscle relaxant anaesthesia. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm fulfilled successfully the requirements for autonomy, i.e. automatic control, adaptation and supervision, and proved effective in dealing with the faults and disturbances which are normally encountered in operating theatres during surgery.

An important proposal made by Chow, that was subsequently adapted by Binder, consists in deriving test sequences covering all round-trip paths in a finite state machine (FSMs). Based on a number of (rather strong) assumptions, and for traditional FSMs, it can be demonstrated that all operation and transfer errors in the implementation can be uncovered. Through experimentation, this paper investigates this strategy when used in the context of UML statecharts. Basecton a set of mutation operators proposed for object-oriented code we seed a significant number of faults in an implementation of a specific container class. We then investigate the effectiveness of four test teams at uncovering faults, based on the round-trip path strategy, and analyze the faults that seem to be difficult to detect. Our main conclusion is that the round-trip path strategy is reasonably effective at detecting faults (87% average as opposed to 69% for size-equivalent, random test cases) but that a significant number of faults can only exhibit a high detection probability by augmenting the round-trip strategy with a traditional black-box strategy such as category-partition testing. This increases the number of test cases to run and therefore the cost of testing- and a cost-benefit analysis weighting the increase of testing effort and the likely gain in fault detection is necessary.

The concept of BAS is based on an appropriate technological level considering human factors and highly automated machines. The supervisor not only considers normal process but also detection and treatment of failures. The framework is based on Distributed Petri Net (DPN). DPN permit the integration of several modules of Petri nets (PN), where each module represent a particular process such as normal processes, detection and treatment of failures. A case study of detection and treatment of failure in machining operations will be considered, in which, the normal process, the detection and treatment of failures in a BAS are integrated through modules based on DPN.

Existing Naval condition assessment systems such as WAS (Integrated Condition Assessment System) employ several fault detection and diagnostic technologies ranging from simple thresholding to rule-based algorithms. However, these technologies have not specifically focused on the ability to predict the future condition (prognostics) of a machine based on the current diagnostic state of the machinery and its available operating and failure history data. An advanced prognostic capability is desired because the ability to forecast this future condition enables a higher level of condition-based maintenance for optimally managing total Life Cycle Costs (LCC). A second issue is that a framework does not exist for "plug 'n play" integration of new diagnostic and prognostic technologies into existing Naval platforms. This paper will outline such Prognostic Enhancements to Diagnostic Systems (PEDS) using a generic framework for developing interoperable prognostic "modules". Specific prognostic module examples developed for gas turbine engines and gearbox systems are also provided.

In many cases, significant reductions in gas turbine total ownership costs have been achieved through the judicious application of these technologies. However, there is currently no consistent methodology available for assessing both the technical and economic benefits of these machinery diagnostic technologies. In response to this need, a virtual test bench is under development by the US Navy for assessing the performance and effectiveness of machinery diagnostic systems. The test bench utilizes a 'plug 'n play' interface that can readily accept standardized diagnostic/prognostic tools and link them to real transitional and seeded fault data from appropriate condition based maintenance (CBM) platforms. The assessment process relies on a standard set of mathematical ground rules and a statistical framework to directly identify confidence bounds, robustness measures, and various diagnostic thresholds associated with specific mechanical diagnostic technologies. Specific performance and accuracy of the diagnostic algorithms at the component or subsystem level are evaluated with performance metrics, while system level capabilities in terms of achieving the overall operational goals of the diagnostic system will be evaluated with effectiveness measures. This qualification and validation methodology is utilized to compare a variety of diagnostic tools that are commonly used to analyze vibration data.

As increases in electrostatic charge level may be associated with the earliest stages of oil film / contact breakdown and the onset of wear, then charge monitoring may be used to identify a wide prognostic window over which component condition may be determined. The ability to monitor component deterioration from in early stage, and hence predict when replacement is required, will enable greater flexibility in terms of maintenance planning and equipment availability. This paper reviews the state of the art of using the electrostatic technology for monitoring component condition and deterioration, discusses the possible electrostatic charge generation mechanisms at the oil-component surface interface and the influence of oil chemistry wider wear conditions.

C	Hess, A; Fila, L			IEEE; IEEE	Hess, A; Fila, L			The joint strike fighter (JSF) PHM concept: Potential impact on aging aircraft problems	2002 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-7	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 09-16, 2002	BIG SKY, MT	IEEE Aerosp & Electr Syst Soc, Aerosp Corp, AstroExpo com, Circle Mt Co, GEB Software Technologies, Jet Propulsion Lab, Opt Energies Technologies Inc, Profet Enterprises				The JSF Autonomic Logistics (AL) system is a new supportability concept that will enable the aircraft to be better utilized throughout the life of the platform, and at a lower cost as compared with legacy aircraft. Autonomic Logistics is, simply put, the automation of the logistics environment such that little human intervention is needed to engage the logistics cycle. Actions that will be automated within the JSF supportability concept include maintenance scheduling, flight scheduling, ordering spare parts, and the like. The cornerstone of Autonomic Logistics is an advanced diagnostic and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) system. The PHM provides the data, information, and knowledge for initiating the AutoLog chain of events. PHM is the ability of the aircraft to do fault detection (FD), fault isolation (FI), and accommodation real-time on-board the aircraft. Along with this FD/FI capability, some of the other facets of PHM include fault prediction on selected components, parts life usage tracking, fault filtering and reporting, and recommended action to the pilot only when action is necessary. It is intended that in most cases, maintenance actions and lifing decisions will be based on the actual material condition of the equipment components. The proposed architecture of this PHM concept includes a hierarchical approach where data begins at the sensor level and is transported up to area reasoners that turns this data into information about a particular subsystem. From the area reasoner, the information is then passed up to a top level Air Vehicle Reasoner where subsystem information is then fused to give knowledge about the health of the entire air vehicle. Additionally, many of the technologies that are being developed for the JSF PHM suite could be applied to legacy aircraft and would show significant benefits in respect to LCC and maintainability issues. In many cases, the capability of PHM sensors and prognostic technologies will enable the ability to "see" incipient faults in subsystem components very early prior to their progressing to final system failure. These capabilities will enable accurate useful life remaining predictions mid more aggressive health management of assets. Through very accurate tracking of the life usage data for component parts, the JSF PHM and AL will be able to anticipate many problems that plague current legacy aircraft; giving a lead time to provide fixes before the actual problems become fleet wide and catastrophic. The PHM architecture will directly interface with the Joint Distributed Information System (JDIS), the information system that will enable Autonomic Logistics functions. The JDIS could automatically forward to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) data on problems that arise within the fleet, thus alerting them to a developing situation sooner, and enabling them to provide faster, cheaper fixes to these problems. With these safeguards in place, the JSF will put itself in a position to quickly react to ageing aircraft problems, increase sortie generation rates, decrease mean time to diagnose faults and failures as well as drastically decrease maintenance costs.

They have been applied successfully to a wide range of problem domains, from protein structure prediction to satellite fault diagnosis. However their execution can be computationally demanding. We introduce a scalable FPGA-based architecture for executing inductive logic programs, such that the execution speed largely increases linearly with respect to the number of processors. The architecture contains multiple processors derived from Warren's Abstract Machine, which has been optimised for hardware implementation using techniques such as instruction grouping and speculative assignment. The effectiveness of the architecture is demonstrated using the mutagenesis data set containing 12000 facts of chemical compounds.

Multifunction microprocessor-based protection relays and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) have created new opportunities for the measurement of power system signals and their diagnosis. The quantity and complexities of the information has been enhanced to the extent that it is well beyond what is required for the immediate operational issues. A significant amount of data is now continually available and during a serious operational incident or fault, it may become excessive and impossible for a substation operator to handle. A technique used to extract concise information from the data received from microprocessor-based relays will be described in this paper. The data analysis technique is based on Rough Set Theory, which has already been used in many areas of artificial intelligence including machine learning and knowledge-based system. A 33/11kV distribution network was modeled under different types of fault scenarios using EMTDC. The resulting event database was uploaded into the Rough Set Data Analysis Module (RSDAM), which eliminates superfluous data whilst keeping all the essential information.

A suitable model enables motor faults to be simulated and the change in corresponding parameters to be predicted without physical experimentation. This paper presents both a theoretical and experimental analysis of asymmetric stator and rotor faults in induction machines. A three-phase induction motor was simulated and operated under normal healthy operation, with one broken rotor bar and with voltage imbalances on one phase of supply. The results illustrate good agreement between both simulated and experimental results.

Moreover, the mining results are extraordinarily valuable for domain experts to discover the running regularity of machines, predict the running trend and provide decision supports for senior managers.

This paper is aimed at simulating and analyzing vibration fault signals, which can be useful for teaching and training purposes especially for companies dealing with predictive maintenance. To achieve this a Vibration Faults Simulation Rig (VFSR) is designed and developed to simulate and study most common vibration faults signals encountered in rotating machines.

These theorems can be used for identifying fault pairs that can be dropped from consideration before diagnostic ATPG starts, thus improving the efficiency of diagnostic ATPG. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theorems, which allow us to identify almost all the indistinguishable fault pairs in finite-state machine benchmarks.

These attributes are essential to critical 24/7/366 operations and they improve upon systems that only enhance throughput. They also address the single-point-of-failure issues attendant upon architectures that commit critical operations to single machines. Graceful throughput degradation is achieved to mitigate all-or-nothing approaches. Parallel/distributed processing has three important goals. The first is for the subject application to provide faster throughput than it would while running on a single CPU or computer. The second goal is to make best use of existing capital equipment. For critical systems, the third goal is fault tolerance via redundancy. This project addresses the third goal. It seeks to demonstrate a means to make parallel/distributed processing systems fault tolerant so that crashes of individual machines in a cluster do not bring the entire system down. In spite of individual machine failures, it also seeks to ensure the completion of all tasks so that system throughput degrades gracefully. These goals can be met by a system composed of a generic TCP/IP LAN connecting some number of ordinary office computers and laboratory workstations that are heterogeneous and of unknown reliability. Described here is concept formulation and design. Other projects in this arena are referenced. These provide essential technology to this present effort. Particular application is made to detecting unspecified anomalies in unspecified data streams drawn from staring continuous-dwell sensors. This application enables the reliable non-stop detection of unexpected events, with the results immediately made available to human analysts or additional automated processing.

In order to avoid and even counter this effect, a system was designed based on a multi-agent-architecture. This system, ComPASS, is a competence promoting decision support systems assisting machine operators in their tasks of finding and solving problems causing the standstill of CNC machine-tools. In addition, an instrument to measure this effect was developed. In this paper the system design, its scope and the competence measurement are detailed. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

In the proposed algorithm, a pattern recognition technique according to Bayes minimum error classifier is developed to detect incipient rotor faults such as broken rotor bar and static eccentricity in induction motors. Also, part of the algorithm is based on the acceleration method presented in the IEEE Std. 112 [1]. It helps to calculate the motor's torque using two line currents and voltages. The use of linear and quadratic time - frequency representations is investigated as a viable solution to the task at hand. Speed information is vital in this approach, so an algorithm to track the speed related saliency induced harmonics from the machine's line current spectrogram is presented. Capturing the harmonics gives the rotor speed that can also be used to extract the feature vector for diagnostic. The implementation of the algorithm on TMS320C6000 family of DSP chips is currently underway. The complete algorithm will then be used to obtain the induction motor's performance curves. This is a complete stand-alone panel mounted induction motor diagnostic tool currently being developed in our lab. This package will be used in conjunction with a drive system (inverter) for on line performance monitoring and preventing unwanted shutdown of the induction motor. The difficulties encountered, including a limited dynamic range and the presence of cross terms, are addressed and the suggested solution is provided. Experimental results corroborating the proposed algorithm are presented, and a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach is touched upon.

The two-frame cubic algebra for compact description of sequential primitive element (here and further, primitive) in form of cubic coverings is used. Problems of digital circuit testing are formulated as linear equations. The described cubic fault simulation method allows to propagate primitive fault lists from its inputs to outputs; to generate analytical equations for deductive fault simulation of digital circuit at gate, functional and algorithmic description levels; to build compilative and interpretative fault simulators for digital circuit. The fault list cubic coverings (FLCC) allowing to create single sensitization paths are proposed. The test generation method for single stuck-at fault (SSF) detection with usage of FLCC is developed. The means of test generation for digital devices designed in Active-HDL are offered. The input description of design is based on usage of VHDL, Verilog and graphical representation of Finite State Machine (FSM). The obtained tests are used for digital design verification in Active-HDL. For fault coverage evaluation the program implementation of cubic simulation method is used. Also models and procedures of test generation for digital systems verification based on genetic algorithms are offered. Program implementation of test generator is oriented to processing of digital circuits with large dimensionality and it combines advantages of genetic algorithms (high speed operation of test generation with specified fault coverage) with advantages of deterministic ones (reproducibility of generated test sequences).

The method is based on a theory that views damage as occurring in a hierarchical dynamical system where slowly evolving, hidden failure processes are causing nonstationarity in a fast, directly observable system. The damage variable tracking is based on statistics calculated using data-based local linear models constructed in the reconstructed phase space of the fast system. These statistics are designed to measure a local change in the fast systems flow caused by the slowtime failure processes. The method is applied to a mathematical model of an experimental electromechanical system consisting of a beam vibrating in a potential field crated by two electromagnets. Two failure modes are introduced through discharging batteries supplying power to these electromagnets. Open circuit terminal voltage of these batteries is a two-dimensional damage variable. Using computer simulations, it is demonstrated both analytically and experimentally that the proposed method can accurately track both damage variables using only a displacement measurements from the vibrating beam. The accurate estimates of remaining time to failure for each battery are given well ahead of actual breakdowns.

Observers are filters based on physical models of machine-fault combinations and use measured machine signatures to identify and characterize the state of a machine. Observers are adaptively deployed as a machine wears and can be coupled with one another to handle interacting conditions and faults. The scheme is detailed using the fault of a cracked rotor shaft that interacts with gravity and imbalance. Observers for shaft cracking and imbalance are presented. The observers provide machine condition and fault strengths to life models used to determine remaining machine life. A life model based on the Forman crack growth law of linear elastic fracture mechanics is developed to determine the number of machine cycles remaining until catastrophic failure.

However, in the case of high reliability/availability-oriented industries (e.g., power systems for internet data centers have a desired availability of 0.99999 and, for semiconductor fabrication plants, have availability requirement of 0.9999999), this type of preventive maintenance scheduling is inadequate. A suitable approach in these situations is the adoption of condition-based predictive maintenance. Here the system condition is evaluated by processing the information gathered from the monitors placed at different points in the system, and maintenance is performed only when the failure/malfunction prognosis dictates. In the past, for power systems, voltages, currents, power, temperature and electromagnetic quantities had been monitored along with surface inspection and material quality tests at regular intervals. Diagnostic methods are already in place to indicate problems in industrial power systems by examining these monitored quantities. However, they lack the capability of looking into distant future. With the introduction of modem digital electronics-based smart monitors, the capability of logging power quality data at micro-second intervals, advanced signal processing tools for extracting features from collected data, and data mining techniques, a new horizon in maintenance scheduling has been unveiled. Trending techniques and techniques based on neural networks, when applied to the extracted features, enable us to predict the possible failures of individual equipment and subsystems well before they manifest. This paper considers the problem of evaluating the health indices of components of a power system by making use of the monitored power-quality data and classification techniques. Health index analysis distinguishes the healthy and risky components of the system. Results of these evaluations can be fed as inputs into a system-reliability/availability analysis tool. The reliability analysis enables analysts to decide on prioritization of the maintenance options subject to budget constraints.

At the first stage, a data-mining-based approach is used to identify crucial medical-oriented features that can distinguish PAF HRV sequences from non-PAF HRV ones. However, PAF patients can experience PAF without exhibiting the medical-oriented features. To detect this type of patients, at the second stage, we employ a machine-learning-based approach to select certain nonlinear features that can classify HRV sequences into classes of PAF or non-PAF. The developed approach was trained on the PAF Prediction Challenge Database and was tested on the dataset consisting of 30-minute HRV episodes extracted from MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database and the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database. It was obtained from the numerical evaluation that the developed approach achieved about 85% of accuracy in short-term prognosis of PAF by using the first stage approach alone and around 90% of accuracy with the combination of both stages. Furthermore, the developed medical-oriented features can be clinically valuable to the cardiologists for providing insights to the initiation of PAR.

The proposed method is based on the computation of the stator and rotor current spectra. An experimental set-up for a 11kW induction machine was developed in order to get numerical data for axial leakage flux, voltages and currents from the stator side. The comparison between the simulation, the analytical computation and the experimental results shows the model capability to reproduce the electromagnetic phenomena in the induction machine. The proposed model can be used to design electrical fault detection devices with low cost and non-invasive sensors.

In the past twenty years, axial flux sensors have been used for diagnosis purpose but rarely in presence of complex power supply such as voltage static inverter. In this paper, it is proved that a simple external flux sensor is more efficient than the classical stator current analysis to detect intern-turn short circuit in three-phase induction machine. The new result is that, even in presence of power supply harmonics, it is possible to detect easily the stator winding faults in the low frequency range of the flux spectrum with low frequency resolution.

Often, these machines run critical loads and their sudden breakdown can be catastrophic. Thus, the drive system of the motor should also have diagnostic features to predict machine faults at their very inception. Consequently, it becomes very important to have machine models and control techniques that can distinguish between the healthy and faulty condition of machines. Quite a few of these faults are eccentricity related. In practice, static as well as dynamic eccentricity, happen to exist simultaneously. With this point in mind, an analytical approach to evaluate performance of a three-phase induction motor under mixed eccentric condition has been presented in this paper. A clear relationship between the high and low frequency components reported earlier in literature has been established. The analysis is validated by the line current spectrum of the eccentric machine obtained through simulation. The effects of the number of rotor slots, machine pole numbers and load conditions; which can change the current spectrum considerably; can also be studied. The fault condition has been simulated using modified winding function approach (MWFA). Finite element results to substantiate the inductance values used in the simulation are presented. Experimental results to substantiate simulations have been included.

However, for closed-loop drives, the power supply is a regulated current source and hence, the motor voltages must also be monitored for fault information. In this paper, a previously proposed neural network scheme for turn fault detection in line-connected induction machines is extended to inverter-fed machines, with special emphasis on closed-loop drives. Experimental results are provided to illustrate that the method is impervious to machine and instrumentation non-idealities, and that it requires lesser data memory and computation requirements than existing schemes, which are based on data look-up tables.

Measurement of the resulting high frequency negative sequence current (or alternatively of the negative sequence impedance) is used to detect turn faults at an incipient stage. Though sharing the same physical principles of similar techniques applied to line-connected machines, the use of a high frequency signal will be shown to present important advantages, such as providing the same performance almost independent of the fundamental excitation frequency, and drastically reducing the sensitivity to the working condition of the machine, i.e. torque and flux levels.

Early diagnosis and accommodation of faults could enhance safety. Fault-tolerant control is a methodology to help prevent that faults develop into failure. The means include on-line fault diagnosis, automatic condition assessment and calculation of remedial action to avoid hazards. This paper gives an overview of methods to obtain fault-tolerance: fault diagnosis; analysis of properties of a faulty system; means to determine remedial actions. The paper illustrates the techniques by two marine examples, sensor fusion for automatic steering and control of the main engine. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

This work is justified with the complex systems by the need of controlling and maintaining in dynamical way the global system performances in order to optimise the enterprise strategies. The added value of our methodology is to formalise the maintenance aid models from a priori knowledge both on the system functioning and malfunctioning by means of Bayesian Networks. The networks are built on adaptability principles and integrate uncertainties on the relationships between causes and effects. The feasibility of this methodology is tested in a manufacturing context with the maintenance aids on a lathe machine. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

One approach is to make the machines themselves more reliable, thereby reducing their down-times. The other angle to be considered are human resources. The modem term of "empowerment of people" applies also to the machine operators. The more the personnel at the machine is capable of repairing or preventing damage, the lower the costs for this repair and the shorter the down-time. This means, operators have to be supported in the fault-finding process by a knowledge-based decision-support system. Diagnostic tools bear the danger of people relying too much on them and their capabilities, so that after a while the formerly competent personnel looses their competence. The questions how to prevent this from happening and how to even increase competence on the job will be answered in the following by presenting a multi-agent architecture and an instrument to measure competence enhancement.

Error confinement wrappers are automatically generated, from the specifications of the target real-time system. The resulting wrappers are the executable version of the specifications, and account for both timing and functional constraints. They are executed on-line by a runtime checker, a sort of virtual machine that interprets temporal logic. A reflective approach is used to implement an observation layer placed between the runtime checker and the target system. It allows the wrappers to obtain the necessary event and data items from the target system so as to perform at runtime the checks defined by the temporal logic specifications. The proposed method has been applied to the use of real-time microkernels in dependable systems. Fault injection is used to assess the detection coverage of the wrappers and analyze trade-offs between performance and coverage.

J	Roze, L; Cordier, MO				Roze, L; Cordier, MO			Diagnosing discrete-event systems: Extending the "diagnoser approach" to deal with telecommunication networks	DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Discrete Event Systems(WODES'98)	AUG 26-28, 1998	CAGLIARI, ITALY			model based approach; real-time monitoring; telecommunication networks; communicating finite state machine; generic model		Detection and isolation of failures in large and complex systems such as telecommunication networks are crucial and challenging tasks. The problem considered here is that of diagnosing the largest French packet switching network. The challenge is to be as efficient as the existing expert system while providing greater generality and flexibility with respect to technological and reconfiguration changes in the network. The network is made up of interconnected components each of which can send, receive and transmit messages via its ports. The problem we are faced with is to follow the evolution of the network on the basis of the stream of time-stamped alarms which arrive at the supervision center. We have decided to use model-based techniques which are recognized to be more adapted to evolutive systems than expertise-based approaches are. This paper starts with a description of how we model the global behavior of this discrete-event system by using communicating finite state machines. It goes on to explain how this model is used for analyzing the stream of alarms and diagnosing the network. Our work is based on the diagnoser approach proposed by Sampath et al. (1995). Starting from a model of the network adapted to simulate faults, this approach transforms it into a finite state automaton, called a diagnoser, in order to analyze the stream of alarms. The approach described in Sampath et al. (1995; 1996) proved to be grounded on certain basic hypotheses which were too restrictive for our application. This paper extends Sampath's proposal to communicating finite state machines. The difficulties we had to cope with are outlined and the way we overcome them is presented. A major difficulty is the huge size of the global model of the system. To solve this problem we take advantage of the hierarchical structure of the network and rely on a generic model of the system for building a generic diagnoser.

Management in those industries is under additional pressure to increase productivity and efficiency while increasing profits. Unscheduled and unplanned downtime, due to machine or process failures, heavily impacts the operational and financial performance of the company. Early warning of equipment failure provides significant value to managers in today's extremely competitive marketplace. This paper discusses a framework to analytically value the early warning of failure, both catastrophic and minor failure, in the power and pipeline industries. By implementing early warning failure technology, organizations can realize quantifiable financial improvements in the form of maintenance expense reduction and operations revenue improvement. This presentation will discuss the framework for assessing the value of early warning as well as illustrate a fossil fuel power plant example.

The test is designed so to study measurement problems of an on-line station. Bearing defects include faults in the cage, in the rolling element and in the outer and inner ring. A set of no defective and defective motors were analyzed by means of the acceleration signal provided by the accelerometer, and the displacement and velocity signals given by a single point laser vibrometer. Advantages and disadvantages of both absolute and relative sensors and of contact and non-contact instrumentation will be exposed taking into account the applicability in real on line quality control measurements and bringing to evidence the related measurement problems due to the specific environmental conditions of assembly lines and sensor installation constraints.

This still has many weak points. To remove these problems, we use the virtual reality techniques. We conceive a system for collecting vibration data with the use of a remote robot control controlled by a virtual designed model. With our model we can manipulate both of the machine, to be checked, and the robot. In our 3D model the data collecting points are very well known. This will assure a good exactitude in the data collection. Our system will assure a good remote maintenance and fault diagnosis not only in dangerous places, but also in ordinary cases.

They suffer from certain other drawbacks too: a single point of failure and hence lack of fault tolerance, and heavy communication costs associated with the central manager. It has been recognized that decentralization/distributed solutions can solve some of the problems associated with centralized solutions [3]. For this reason, there has been considerable interest in the recent past on distributed/decentralized network management applications. Our work in this paper has been motivated by this research trend in network management. We present the design and evaluation of an SNMP-based distributed network fault detection/monitoring system. The design involves the integration of our recently developed ML-ADSD algorithm [11], [16] for diagnosis of faults in a distributed system of processors into the SNMP framework. The ML-ADSD algorithm uses the multilevel paradigm and is scalable in the sense that only minor modifications will be required to adapt the algorithm to networks of varying sizes. The system allows processors to fail and/or recover during the process of diagnosis. Thus the system has fault tolerance capability. We demonstrate the application of the system by implementing it on an Ethernet network of 32 machines. Our results establish that the diagnosis latency (or time to termination) is much better than the latency of earlier solutions. Also, the bandwidth utilization of our system is very insignificant, thereby demonstrating the practicality of deployment of the system in a real network environment. Thus in this work we have successfully integrated three modern disciplines: network management; distributed computing and system level diagnosis.

Within the general-purpose UNIX(R) server market, they also offer the highest levels of concurrent error detection, fault isolation, recovery, and availability. High availability is achieved by minimizing component failure rates through improvements in the base technology, and through design techniques that permit hard-and soft-failure detection, recovery, and isolation, repair deferral, and component replacement concurrent with system operation. In this paper, we discuss the fault-tolerant design techniques that were used for array, logic, storage, and I/O subsystems for the p690. We also present the diagnostic strategy, fault-isolation, and recovery techniques. New features such as POWER4 synchronous machine-check interrupt, PCI bus error recovery, array dynamic redundancy, and minimum-element dynamic reconfiguration are described. The design process used to verify error detection, fault isolation, and recovery is also described.

An important issue in such effort is the modelling of the induction machine including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, it is introduced a new and simpler approach for the modelling and computer simulation of induction machines with rotor asymmetries. This approach is based on the well known dq transient model of the symmetrical machine, with rotor asymmetries introduced through a linear transformation of the extended rotor current vector. Simulation and practical results previously presented in the literature are reproduced to support the proposed approach.

However, even if the spectrum analysis is well known and has been published intensively in the literature, the problem of automatic classification for fault detection is still open. The aim of this paper is to present a new neural network approach for fault and speed detection using the current spectrum analysis. After the presentation of an original database creation, the classification using a particular neural network is developed. This network is conceived in order to output the posterior probabilities of class membership of the input, which allow the estimation of the level of confidence of the classification. Then, the classical motor slip detection algorithm is verified and the classification is experimentally performed on a squirrel-cage three-phase induction machine. The efficiency of the iteration process is shown together with the confusion matrix for the current spectrum analysis in the proposed method.

These characteristic fault frequencies tend to modulate the electric machine's frequencies of natural mechanical resonance. Therefore, an amplitude modulation (AM) detector, similar to the bispectrum, is proposed. This new tool is especially designed to detect instances of AM when the measured magnitude of the characteristic fault frequency itself is not significant (eg. incipient bearing faults). A normalized version of this detector is also presented to assist in the interpretation of results. Computer simulations as well as actual bearing vibration data are used to confirm the proficiency of this proposed AM detector in identifying bearing faults.

This paper presents a SVMs based approach for fault diagnosis of valves in three-cylinder reciprocating pumps. The vibration signals collected from pumps are preprocessed with the wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and time-frequency information is extracted as the character vector for training and testing the SVMs. To classify multiple fault modes of valves, a SVMs based multi-class classifier is constructed and used in the valve faults diagnosis. The results in experiments show that fault types and positions of faulty valves can be identified and diagnosed by the above method. Furthermore, compared with the results of a BP network, more excellent diagnosis accuracy indicates the potential of the SVMs techniques in machinery fault detection.

The results of a study conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors in online monitoring of dressing is reported. Two aspects of the process are addressed. The first is the detection of undesired wheel conditions, such as an out-of-round wheel and wheel contour errors. The other is improving the surface finish of the ground workpiece by monitoring the dressing parameters. Experimental results indicate that AE signal can be effectively used to identify the faults that might occur during dressing. This in turn will result in better surface finish in the machined workpiece.

For low-voltage machines, negative-sequence impedance or currents are measured for the same. Such diagnostic schemes should be carefully implemented as supply voltage unbalance, manufacturing-related asymmetry, etc., also produce negative-sequence voltages. A few approaches based on motor current signature analysis have already been proposed to detect stator interturn faults. However, little or no physical insight was provided to explain the occurrence of certain harmonies in the line current or the influence of voltage unbalance on these harmonics. Also, in at least one of these papers, a large portion of the stator winding was shorted to emulate the faults. The method proposed in this paper monitors certain rotor-slot-related harmonics at the terminal voltage of the machine, once it is switched off. In the absence of supply voltage, issues such as voltage unbalance, time harmonics do not influence the measurements except as initial conditions, which is a very desirable feature when the machine is fed from an adjustable-speed drive. Satisfactory simulation and experimental results have been obtained with only about 1.5% (5/324) of the total number of turns shorted.

As a solution to this, the diagnostic system described here involves the measurement of machine vibration to detect faults. Some experimental results are given comparing the classification results obtained for higher derivatives with acceleration signals. In these applications, the quality of the input features for a fuzzy pattern classifier is significantly higher if features are calculated on the basis of a higher derivative of the time signal than on the basis of the original measured acceleration signal.

IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Fault Tolerant Comp, IFIP Working Grp 10 4, DARPA, LAAS CNRS, Univ Michigan				Designing applications with timeliness requirements in environments of uncertain synchrony is known to be a difficult problem. In this paper we follow the perspective of timing fault tolerance: timing errors occur and they are processed using redundancy, e.g., component replication, to recover and deliver timely service. We introduce a paradigm for generic timing fault tolerance with replicated state machines. The paradigm is based on the existence of Timing Failure Detection with timed completeness and accuracy properties. Generic timing fault tolerance implies the ability to dependably observe the system and to timely notify timing failures, which we discuss in the paper. On the other hand, it ensures replica determinism with respect to time (temporal consistency), and safety in case of spare exhaustion. We show that the paradigm can be addressed and realized in the framework, of the Timely Computing Base (TCB) model and architecture. Furthermore, we illustrate the generality of our approach by reviewing previous existing solutions and by showing that in contrast with ours, they only secure a restricted semantics, or simply provide ad-hoc solutions.

IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Fault Tolerant Comp, IFIP Working Grp 10 4, DARPA, LAAS CNRS, Univ Michigan				A virtual duplex system (VDS) can be used to increase safety, without the use of structural redundancy on a single machine. If a deterministic program P is calculating a given function f then a T DS contains two variants P-a and P-b of P which are calculating the diverse functions f and f(b) in sequence. If no error occurs in the process of designing and executing P-a and P-b, then f = f(a) = f(b) holds. A fault in the underlying processor hardware is likely, to be detected by, the deviation of the results, i.e. f(a)(i) not equal f(b)(i) for input i. Normally, VDSs are generated by, manually, applying different diversity, techniques. This paper, in contrast, presents a new method and a tool for the automated generation of VDSs with a high detection probability, for hardware faults. Moreover, for the first time the diversity, techniques are selected by, an optimization algorithm rather than chosen intuitively. The generated VDSs are investigated extensively, by, means of software implemented processor fault injection.

IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Fault Tolerant Comp, IFIP Working Grp 10 4, DARPA, LAAS CNRS, Univ Michigan			ARCHITECTURE	This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a software-implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) environment built around a set of self-checking processes called ARMORs running on different machines that provide error detection and recovery services to themselves and to spaceborne scientific applications. The experiments are split into three groups of error injections, with each group successively stressing the SIFT error detection and recovery more than the previous group. The results show that the SIFT environment adds negligible overhead to the application during failure-free runs. Only 11 cases were observed in which either the application failed to start or the SIFT environment failed to recognize that the application had completed, Further investigations showed that assertions within the SIFT processes-coupled with object-based incremental checkpointing-were effective in preventing si,stem failures by protecting dynamic data within the SIFT processes.

With the lower cost and flexibility afforded by PC-based tools, MCM applications are becoming more widespread. The use of the Personal Computer (PC) has also allowed the development and use of new signal analysis algorithms in the time, frequency, order and joint time-frequency domains in an easy and intuitive manner. The vibration monitoring market has shown years of steady growth driven in part by the lower cost and wider availability of tools for real-time data acquisition and signal analysis using standard PCs. This paper will help guide the first time PC-based MCM system developer and/or user through the MCM system design and development process using data acquisition boards and a graphical programming language.

The methodology combines multivariable and signal-processing statistical tools, which are used to extract the characteristics of the faults, with classifier algorithms. The characteristics of the faults are extracted using linear and nonlinear principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Pattern classification is performed using support vector machines as opposed to neural networks. The results of combining the different statistical techniques for extracting fault characteristics with the classifier algorithm based on support vector machines, are evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in the detection and identification of process faults.

The Fuelling Machine grab cables are subjected to repeated bending around a series of pulleys that induce a twist in the cables. The twisting of the cables ultimately results in the failure of the cables. In this paper, anew method, WACM, is proposed. Wavelet analysis is used to detect the twisting degree. The calculation results show that this method is superior to DLCM.

Initiation and propagation of surface cracks in rotary shafts are common causes for such failure modes. To be able to detect the onset and progression of these faults will considerably extend the lifetime and improve the reliability of the mechanical system. A wavelet-based algorithm effective in identifying mechanical chaotic response has been applied to determine the nonlinear dynamical characteristics of a model-based, cracked rotor This investigation confirms reported correlation of surface crack breathing with rotor chaotic motions. The effectiveness of the algorithm in detecting rotor-dynamic instability induced by mechanical faults as contrast to algorithms that are based on nonlinear dynamics is discussed. The results show not just the feasibility of the algorithm in mechanical fault diagnosis but also suggest its applicability to in-line, real-time condition monitoring at both the system and component levels.

This paper presents new developments in the area of fault diagnosis based on intelligent software agents. The research objective was to design an agent capable of continuous real-time machine learning by using an artificial neural network known as the cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC). An engine simulator that can model both normal and faulty engine operations was used to develop the learning system controller in a flexible and cost-efficient manner. This paper provides a description of the selected CMAC, a brief overview of the real-time engine simulator and its integration with the learning system as well as a few results.

In particular we address: (1) analysis in the prototype phase using physical fault injection to an actual system. We use example of fault injection-based evaluation of a software-implemented fault tolerance (SIFT) environment (built around a set of self-checking processes called ARMORS) that provides error detection and recovery services to spaceborne scientific applications and (2) measurement-based analysis of systems in the field. We use example of LAN of Windows NT based computers to present methods for collecting and analyzing failure data to characterize network system dependability. Both, fault injection and failure data analysis enable us to study naturally occurring errors and to provide feedback to system designers on potential availability bottlenecks. For example, the study of failures in a network of Windows NT machines reveals that most of the problems that lead to reboots are software related and that though the average availability evaluates to over 99%, a typical machine, on average, provides acceptable service only about 92% of the time.

The purpose of this monitoring is to predict degradation and potential failure and inform equipment maintainers, in a timely manner, of the need for maintenance or operational adjustments. PHM systems go beyond using sensors to detect pending equipment failures. They use a combination of information to predict equipment health. Once equipment health is known, it is necessary to address the questions: "So, what needs to be done about a potential failure mode, and when?" This paper presents two PHM software applications. The Evidence Engine predicts what the system states will be (and with what probability) given current evidence. "Evidence" may include such things as sensor data, maintenance and inspection data, usage profiles, component age, historical data on similar equipment or components, oil analysis, thermography, etc. The Consequence Engine predicts the effect that repair/replace/inspect/wait strategies will have on the system if that action is taken. This "consequence analysis" part of the problem must be performed in such a way that the expected benefit from performing each alternative can be calculated. An example analysis based on realistic electricity cost data and equipment reliability and maintenance data for a major power plant component is presented. The example is relevant for both nuclear and conventional power plants.

Use of such methodologies has the potential to improve the long-term availability of plant components and equipment, resulting in overall improvements to plant safety and operability. Through the use of "Smart Equipment" and other allied technologies the potential exists to provide a comprehensive predictive maintenance capability by: (1) assessing equipment health, (2) monitoring for equipment degradation, (3) predicting the remaining useful life of equipment, and (4) providing guidance concerning when equipment should be repaired or replaced. Such capability, once fully implemented in an enterprise-level Health Monitoring System (HMS), will allow significant flexibility for power plant operations and will minimize plant outages due to unanticipated equipment failures. Thus, nuclear power plants can reduce maintenance and operations costs while improving availability and safety. One critical aspect of implementing a practical enterprise-level HMS is the collection of plant-wide health status data and the presentation of this complex information in a simple and integrated manner, which readily conveys the overall plant health state. In addition, an enterprise-level HMS must allow convenient navigational access to lower-level detailed plant data and support information. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is actively promoting advancing the state of nuclear technology through its broad-based Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) program, One component of this initiative, "Smart Equipment and Systems to Improve Reliability and Safety in Future Nuclear Power Plant Operations (SMART-NPP)," is focusing on the development of a methodology to systematically monitor the health of individual plant components/equipment and to provide plant operations personnel with real-time health status information to support their decision making. The program further seeks to demonstrate this technology on a target component/system. This unique program is being undertaken through a collaborative effort by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Pennsylvania State University (PSU), Duke Engineering & Services (DS&E), and the Nuclear Automation Division of Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC). As a contributing partner to the SMART-NPP program, Westinghouse has developed a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for a nuclear power plant enterprise-level HMS. The design of this HMI is described in this paper. Other components of this program include the Bayesian Belief Networks, HMS, Virtual Machine, and a demonstration system. These are further described in the References.

Smart equipment embodies elemental components such as sensors, data transmission devices, computer hardware and software, and human-machine interface (HMI) devices that continuously monitor and predict the system performance and remaining useful life of the equipment. A set of integrated elements has been developed that comprise a demonstration health monitoring system (HMS) for a selected smart plant component. The capability to receive input from both a physical, real-world system and a virtual machine simulation provides a wide range of demonstration options. The HMS concept provides a unique system-level integration of plant maintenance information with real-time sensor data utilizing self-monitoring and self-diagnostic characteristics built into the equipment. The use of a distributed software architecture facilitates scaling up to enterprise-wide applications, and provides the ability to view real-time equipment performance and safety-related data from remote locations. This paper summarizes the activities to demonstrate the application of the integrated set of tools and methodologies that have been developed during this program. A description of the elements of the HMS as well as the demonstration scenarios is presented.

The proposed diagnosis system uses only measured motor terminal currents and voltages, and motor speed. The effectiveness of the diagnosis system is demonstrated through staged motor faults of electrical and mechanical origin. Scaling of the diagnosis system to machines with different power ratings is demonstrated with data from 2.2 kW, 373 kW and 597 kW induction motors.

Generally, it is very difficult to diagnose a machine fault by conventional methods based on mathematical models because of system complexity and the existence of nonlinear factors. In this research, a neural network is applied to the fault diagnosis of the machine. The neural network has learning and memory capability. By the learning of normal and abnormal states of the object system, a new-method with neural networks is proposed which can diagnose a fault of the machine. The proposed fault diagnosis system is based on the spectrum of vibrations or sounds obtained from the operating machine, because the time series data of vibrations or sounds are complicated and include noise. The difference between normal and abnormal data becomes clearer comparing time series data. It is suitable for the detection of the fault to utilize changes of spectral data. Using this method, it is shown that it can detect unknown fault patterns. The fault diagnosis experiments are performed on both a wood slicing machine and an electromagnetic valve. The possibility of an on-line fault diagnosis system is examined through the construction of an on-line data processing system for an electromagnetic valve and it is shown that the fault diagnosis can be performed in real time. Through these results, the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis system is verified.

Achieving this will require new enabling diagnostic technologies. One such technology, the use of acoustic emission for the early detection of helicopter rotor head dynamic component faults, has been investigated by Honeywell Technology Center for its rotor acoustic monitoring system (RAMS). This ambitious, 38-month, proof-of-concept effort, which was a part of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Air Vehicle Diagnostics System program, culminated in a successful three-week flight test of the RAMS system at Patuxent River Flight Test Center in September 1997. The flight test results demonstrated that stress-wave acoustic emission technology can detect signals equivalent to small fatigue cracks in rotor head components and can do so across the rotating articulated rotor head joints and in the presence of other background acoustic noise generated during flight operation. This paper presents the results of stress wave data analysis of the flight-test dataset using time-frequency techniques to assess background operational noise vs. machinery failure detection results. The analysis of various flight maneuvers to quantify acoustic operational noise due to hydraulics and rotor operation is discussed.

These have been in all three areas of interest, namely fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis, but except for the first still require an expert to determine what analyses to perform and to interpret the results. Currently much effort is being put into automating fault diagnosis and prognosis, as the major economic benefits come from being able to predict with reasonable certainty how much longer a machine can safely be operated, this often being a matter of several months from when incipient faults are first detected. The current tutorial discusses the different requirements for detecting and diagnosing faults, outlining a robust procedure for the former, and then goes on to discuss a large number of signal processing techniques that have been proposed for diagnosing both the type and severity of the faults once detected.

It shows that these vibration signals display higher-order cyclostationarity under some conditions. A model of signals modulated in amplitude and phase is used in order to interpret the cyclic bispectrum, i.e. a third-order cyclic statistics, in the frequency domain. Interpretation and estimation techniques of the cyclic bispectrum allow better comprehension of the application of cyclic statistics to mechanical systems. The ambiguity concerning the use of moments or cumulants for estimation is discussed. Moreover, the difference between them is illustrated on industrial gear signals. Application to diagnosis of spalling in gear teeth of a U.S. Navy helicopter (Westland database) demonstrates the effectiveness of this new parameter for a good diagnosis. Finally, simple and efficient indicators of cyclostationarity are proposed, which can be used to monitor and follow up the state of a gearbox system.

Cluster analysis and discriminant analysis are the main statistical techniques used. These techniques have been extensively used in various scientific fields for the discrimination of data, but rarely for the diagnosis of machinery faults using vibration analysis. The application of these techniques was carried out in the detection of failures in a set of rolling element bearings with four different known bearing conditions (new bearing, outer race defect bearing, inner race defect bearing and ball defect bearing). The different elements (rolling element bearings) are grouped into clusters as homogenous as possible according to the observed variables (vibration amplitude at different frequencies). The results provide a useful criterion for the discrimination among the different types of failures in the bearings.

The negative-selection algorithm proposed which is inspired by the negative-selection mechanism of the immune system is able to detect any change. In this paper, the algorithm is improved to make it suitable for the fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. Moreover, based on the improved algorithm a new approach of fault diagnosis of rotary machinery is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated by the on-line fault diagnosis of rotary machinery successfully. In addition, the approach of the novel fault diagnosis can also be applied to other fields.

Since the vibration signals collected from pumps apparently show the existence of non-stationary signals and the interference of neighboring valves, the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is introduced as a preprocessing means of extracting time-frequency information from vibration signals to obtain the fault characteristics of the valves. To classify multiple fault modes of valves, a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based multi-class classifier is constructed and used in the valve faults detection. The results in experiments prove that fault types and positions of faulty valves can be identified and diagnosed by the above method. Furthermore, compared with the results using an Artificial Neural Network (BP), more excellent diagnosis accuracy indicates the potential of the SVMs techniques in machinery fault detection.

Therefore, modern hydropower plants are now active by pursuing transition from conventional scheduled maintenance as too expensive, to predictive maintenance more adapted as to detect and diagnose just in time the degradations in order to anticipate the failures. The predictive maintenance is mainly based on conditioning monitoring, fault diagnosis and prognosis, which allow for taking the right maintenance decision at the right time and at the right place. These three characteristics of the decision leads, as a consequence, to a combination of the conventional hierarchical model of the operating system with a new distributed one founded on the co-operation of "intelligent" field components embedding data.. processing,. storage and communication capabilities. So, the operational IT architecture which supports the predictive maintenance.. strategy, has to integrate an interoperability with these types, of components. This paper aims. at describing the development of an "intelligent" interoperable governor that supports some predictive maintenance functions. It allows for not only performing Fault and Degradation Diagnosis on frequency, gate opening and other signals, but also automatically reconfiguring its operation mode if some faults happen. The prototype of the proposed governor is tested and validated to be then developed into an industrial product.

The associated detector observes the frequencies with which states are occupied and detects faults by analyzing the deviation between the expected frequencies and the actual measurements. In addition to state occupancy measurements, the detector requires a statistical characterization of the input, but does not need to know the order with which states appear or the input sequence that is applied to the FSM. The discussion in the paper focuses on the case of a single fault and on the performance of the fault detector in terms of the probabilities of detection and false alarm, the number of states, and the length of the observation window.

One approach to counter the loss of production is to make the machines more reliable, thereby reducing their times of non-use. Another is to enable machine operators to locate and to remove machine faults and their causes themselves, in order to reduce delay until maintenance staff is sent from a location far away. Operators may be supported in the fault-finding process by a knowledge-based decision-support system. The questions as to how to avoid the negative consequences of using such systems and how to even increase competence on the job is addressed by ComPASS, a system based on a multi-agent architecture. A running, functioning prototype was developed and evaluated. Based on this experience the system is currently being extended and improved, first results of which are presented here.

The basic feature, termed here the energy index (EI), is a statistical measure of relative energy levels of segments of a time domain signal over a cycle. The properties of the El are discussed and its different forms are derived. A procedure is presented for fault diagnosis of gears using the proposed features. As an illustration, time domain acoustic emission (AE) signals of a test gearbox have been processed to extract these features and to test their relative significance in the diagnostic process. The proposed technique is compared with some of the existing methods using the same AE data for early fault detection. The applicability of the proposed technique is also studied using a set of vibration data of a helicopter drivetrain system gearbox. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed features in monitoring and diagnosis of machine conditions, with the capability of early fault detection.

Early detection of the problem would give the management sufficient time for machine service. In this manner, predictive maintenance can be achieved. In this work, vibration measurements have been used for the diagnosis of roller bearings. Six indices were selected for the diagnostic purpose. They are a) The average of the top five amplitude values of the frequency response function in the high frequency range, b) The peak value of amplitude of frequency response function in the high frequency range, c) The average of the top five amplitude values of the frequency response function in the prime spike range, d) Autocorrelation in the high frequency range, e) Autocorrelation function in prime spike range, and f) Cepstrum in the high frequency range. The counterpropagation neural networks were used for the classification of faulty bearings into six different categories so that corrective actions can be taken.

Hence the run-up process faults diagnosis is an active subject of research nowadays. This paper shows how 2-dimension hidden Markov model can be used to build a fault diagnosis system based on time-frequency analysis to the process signal. The topology of this model and its parameters are introduced. Meanwhile how to select the features by time-frequency analysis is discussed here. Finally, the new model was tested with experimental data collected from Bently-Nevada rotor experimental system (Model 24755) and the new method was found to outperform previously proposed classifiers based on the average spectrum of the machinery fault signal with much more correct classifications.

The system has two main parts. The first, sensing and transmitting of variable by a network of intelligent sensors and transducers The second, analysis and prognosis of machinery health by a two-step statistical process model (SPM). Most contemporary intelligent sensors have signal-conditioning circuit integrated within the sensor as a single chip device. In many instances sensor and signal conditioning circuit are packaged together as one unit. However, intelligent sensors are becoming increasingly important for many critical applications. An intelligent sensor network system can perform sensing and transmitting of variables for the process controller and can also locally store and transmit sensed variable over wireless link to remote central processing computer. The central processing computer is used for continuous statistical analysis of multiple variables and can be used for predicting machinery failure. Operators at remote location can review processed information at any instant of time and determine imminent and prospective condition of the machinery. Currently we are researching to develop an intelligent sensor network system that will sense and temporarily store process variables and periodically transmit them to a remote location for processing, analyzing, and storing. The process variables are transmitted to the central computer as well as to the controller for continuous control of the process. The statistical process model (SPM) located in the central computer system will analyze the related data for predicting machinery failure and prognostic maintenance.

During the process of detecting, two images of objects in different directions are usually enough to know whether an inner part is in fault. Comparing the features of two preprocessed images and standard images, makes the fault diagnosis of key parts possibly. The detecting system combines DR (digital radiography) technology with machine vision techniques, and applies the BP neural network algorithm in the fault recognition process. The experimental results indicate that the system can correctly and rapidly identity faulty products with parts missing.

Problems of digital circuit testing are formulated as linear equations. The described cubic fault simulation method allows to propagate primitive fault lists from its inputs to outputs; to generate analytical equations for deductive fault simulation of digital circuit at gate, functional and algorithmic description levels; to build compilative and interpretative fault simulators for digital circuit. The fault list cubic coverings (FLCC) allowing to create single sensitization paths are proposed. The test generation method for single stuck-at fault (SSF) detection with usage of FLCC is developed. The means of test generation for digital devices designed in Active-HDL are offered. The input description of design is based on usage of VHDL, Verilog and graphical representation of Finite State Machine (FSM). The obtained tests are used for digital design verification in Active-HDL. For fault coverage evaluation the program implementation of cubic simulation method is used. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

Global vibration indexes as RMS, Kurtosis, etc., are widespread known in industry and in addition, are recommended by international norms. Despite that, these parameters do not allow reaching reliable equipment condition diagnosis. They are attractive for their apparent simplicity of interpretation. This work presents a discussion about the diagnosis possibilities based on these traditional parameters. The database used comprises rolling bearings vibration signals taking into account different fault conditions, several shaft speeds and loading. The obtained results show that these global vibration parameters are limited regarding correct fault diagnosis, especially in initfaults condition. As an alternative method a new technique is proposed. This technique seeks to obtain a global parameter that makes better characterization of fault condition. This methodology, named Residual Energy, uses integration of the difference between the power spectrum density of the fault condition and the normal one. The results obtained with this technique are compared with the traditional RMS and Kurtosis.

Chaotic computing and immune systems are added later to enhance the soft computing capabilities. The fusion of SC components creates new functions i.e. flexible knowledge representation (symbol and pattern), acquisition and inference (tractability, machine intelligent quotient), and robust and low cost product. Among them immune systems are very suitable for control and diagnosis of multi-agent systems (large-scale and complex systems) that interact among human beings, environment and artificial objects corresponding to the usage of complex interactions among antibodies and antigens in the immune systems. This paper describes novel sensor fault diagnosis for an uninterruptible power supply control system and new decision making of a robot in a changeable environment using immune networks. Simulation studies show that the proposed methods are feasible and promising for control and diagnosis of large-scale and complex dynamical systems.

It is illustrated using acoustic emissions from mechanical equipment. It was found that acoustic signals from different stages of operation appeared as distinct clusters in the PCA analysis. The clusters moved when machinery faults were present and the modelling errors also increased under fault conditions; thus, each type of fault had a distinctive signature and could be diagnosed. PCA using autocovariance functions that were derived from the full power spectrum had better performance than spectral PCA using averaged periodograms, and both gave a significant improvement over time-domain PCA.

J	Gelle, G; Colas, M; Serviere, C				Gelle, G; Colas, M; Serviere, C			Blind source separation: A tool for rotating machine monitoring by vibrations analysis?	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							STABILITY ANALYSIS; SIGNAL SEPARATION; STATISTICS	Blind source separation (BSS) is a general signal processing method, which consists of recovering, from a finite set of observations recorded by sensors, the contributions of different physical sources independently from the propagation medium and without any a priori knowledge on the sources. Such methods are attractive for the monitoring or the diagnosis of mechanical systems. It is shown that BSS allows the vibratory information generated from a single rotating machine working in a noisy environment to be recovered by freeing the sensor signal from the contribution of other working machines. In that way, BSS can be used as a pre-processing step to rotating machine fault detection and diagnosis. In this paper, two possible approaches to solve the BSS problem of rotating machine signals are compared; that is, the temporal or frequential approach. The first method developed initially for temporally white signals is used in an experimental context and it is shown that the results are comparable to the frequential domain approach specially developed for rotating machine signals. These two approaches are tested on real signals from a mechanical testing bench, and the implementations of the different methods as well as their performances are discussed. An example to bearing fault detection is given in the final part, to illustrate the potential of this approach as a pre-processing step to improve the diagnosis. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

The proposed algorithm uses only stator currents as input without the need for any other variables. First rotor speed is estimated from the stator currents, then appropriate features are extracted. The produced feature vector is normalized and fed to the trained classifier to see if motor is healthy or has broken bar faults. Only number of poles and rotor slots are needed as pre-knowledge information. Theoretical approach together with experimental results derived from a 3 hp ac induction motor show the strength of the proposed method. In order to cover many different motor load conditions data are obtained from 10% to 130% of the rated load for both a healthy induction motor and an induction motor with a rotor having 4 broken bars.

Reliable prognostic models that are based on survival analysis techniques have been recently applied to a variety of domains, with varying degrees of success. In this article, we review some methods commonly used to model time-oriented data, such as Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression, and discuss their applications in medical prognosis. Nonlinear, nonparametric models such as neural networks have increasingly been used for building prognostic models.

J	Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD				Edwards, DJ; Holt, GD			Predicting construction plant maintenance expenditure	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						construction plant; financial management; linear interpolation; maintenance; management; prediction; stochastic random numbers; UK	EQUIPMENT SELECTION	Utilization of construction plant and equipment forms an essential part of construction contractors' efforts to augment productivity and reduce costs. However, efficient and effective management of plant and equipment is requisite to maximizing its potential benefits. A problem in this respect is not knowing when a maintenance event might occur, or its extent in terms of cost and time. This paper presents a stochastic mathematical modelling methodology (using random numbers) to predict the probable cost of 'the next' maintenance event for tracked hydraulic excavators; where a maintenance event includes both breakdown and scheduled maintenance. Information on a random sample of 33 360 degrees tracked hydraulic excavators were obtained from contractors operating within the opencast mining industry. From these, 9473 maintenance event 'cost' observations were recorded and modelled. Validation of the model is achieved using a random 'hold out' sample of 50 maintenance cost observations taken from nine machines. Analyses reveal that overall model predictive performance is robust, having a mean percentage error (MPE) of 4.46 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23.63. Pearsons correlation coefficient (r) and a paired t-test are conducted to determine the accuracy and consistency of model predictions respectively. With an r of 0.76 and no significant difference being found between the mean of predicted/actual values, the model shows both accurate and consistent cost predictions. The random number technique shows potential for improved maintenance practice by providing a practical methodology for planning, scheduling and controlling future plant resource requirements. The paper concludes with direction for future research which includes: (1) the application of this research to plant items working in other operational environments (e.g. civil engineering and construction); and (2) prediction of the next breakdown event.

At first, the design of fault diagnosis filter is performed using nonlinear observer techniques, where the system is decoupled through a nonlinear transformation and an observer is used to generate the required residual signal. By introducing an extra input to the observer, a direct estimation of the time-varying fault is obtained when the residual is controlled, by this extra input, to zero. The stability analysis of this observer is proved and some relevant sufficient conditions are obtained. Using the estimated fault vector, a fault tolerant controller is established which guarantees the stability of the closed loop system. The proposed algorithm is applied to a combined pH and consistency control system of a pilot paper machine, where simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, it is difficult to extract most important symptom parameters and functions of those parameters by which faults of machinery can be sensitively detected and fault types can be precisely distinguished. In order to overcome this difficulty and ensure highly accurate fault diagnosis, a new method called "automated function generation of symptom parameters" using genetic algorithms (GA) is presented here. By applying the method to real machinery diagnoses problems, it has been shown that the key symptom parameter function can be quickly generated. In this paper, we give a diagnosis example of rolling bearing of which operating conditions are variable in rotating speed and load.

J	Baydar, N; Ball, A				Baydar, N; Ball, A			A comparative study of acoustic and vibration signals in detection of gear failures using Wigner-Ville distribution	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TIME SIGNALS; TOOL	Vibration analysis is widely used in machinery diagnostics and the Wigner-Ville distribution has also been implemented in many applications in the condition monitoring of machinery. In contrast to previous applications, this paper examines whether acoustic signal can be used effectively to detect the various local faults in gearboxes using the smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution. Three types of progressing local faults, broken tooth, gear crack and localised wear, were simulated. The results from acoustic signals were compared with vibration signals. The results suggest that acoustic signals are very affective for the early detection of faults and may provide a powerful tool to indicate the various types of progressing faults in gearboxes.

J	Bellina, F; Pomaro, N; Taliercio, C				Bellina, F; Pomaro, N; Taliercio, C			Automatic check of the RFX machine signals	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	21st Symposium on Fusion Technology (SOFT-21)	SEP 11-15, 2000	MADRID, SPAIN			signal processing; data acquisition; fusion		The paper deals with an automatic computer procedure developed to detect errors or faults in the signal waveforms measured during the operation of the RFX machine. These data are generated by the diagnostic equipment and other sensors installed in the machine and in its power supplies. The signal check is paramount, since even a single faulty waveform may lead to wrong results in the post-processing phase. Due to their large number, the manual inspection of each signal after the pulse is impossible. The check has to be performed as quickly as possible, in order to identify and discard the defective waveforms before their on-line elaboration. To this purpose, the on-line signal check program is integrated in the control data acquisition system of RFX Presently, the procedure is being used to check the quality of the saved machine pulse data.

Specific signs and symptoms determined from medical examinations, laboratory tests, and patient history are utilized to predict the outcome of a potential pathological disorder. Utilizing a strategy similar to the medical examination, the status of ecosystems can be examined. To demonstrate this concept a "patient" case study of the Gulf of Mexico is described. The diagnosis of potential abnormalities within the Gulf of Mexico was conducted by examining field indicators including sediment chemistry and tissue chemistry (field examinations), sediment toxicity (laboratory testing), and a benthic index (patient history and existing symptoms). Based on the diagnosis (ecological assessment), a prognosis for the Gulf of Mexico was determined and specific areas that are impacted by stressors. were identified for more detailed assessments. Pensacola Bay was identified as such an area impacted by stressors. The case study example demonstrates that a medical approach of "diagnosis and prognosis" can be utilized as a strategy to help identify stressors, develop a successful treatment plan, and prevent future ecosystem degradation.

In this paper, in order to utilize multiple symptom domains to improve the diagnosis accuracy, an idea of fault multi-symptom-domain consensus diagnosis is developed. From the point of view of the group decision-making, two particular multi-symptom-domain diagnosis strategies are proposed. The proposed strategies use BP (Back-Propagation) neural networks as diagnosis models in various symptom domains, and then combine the outputs of these networks by two combination schemes, which are based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and fuzzy integral theory, respectively. Finally, a case study pertaining to the fault diagnosis for rotor-bearing systems is given in detail, and the results show that the proposed diagnosis strategies are feasible and more efficient than conventional stacked-vector methods.

J	Zhang, C; Liang, SY; Qiu, J				Zhang, C; Liang, SY; Qiu, J			Bearing failure prognostic model based on damage mechanics and vibration monitoring	TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2001 Condition Monitoring Conference	FEB 26-28, 2001	SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS			bearings; failure; vibration; damage mechanics; life prognostic; monitoring	FATIGUE LIFE PREDICTION; PROPAGATION; MACHINERY	Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdown in rotating machinery. In this paper, a stiffness-based life-signal prognostic model of a bearing system based on vibration response analysis and damage mechanics is proposed. When a bearing system is simplified as a Single-DOF vibration system, the natural frequency of the system is proportional to the system stiffness, and the amplitude of acceleration response at the natural frequency is opposite to the system stiffness. Meanwhile, for the rules of dam age mechanics, the relationship among failure lifetime, running time and variations of stiffness of a bearing system can be established. With the combination of above two relationships, the natural frequency and the amplitude of acceleration response at the natural frequency are related to the running time and failure life time. Thus, the failure lifetime of a bearing system can be predict ed via vibration signals from an accelerometer, which is attached to the bearing housing. The resulting model is calibrated by parameter identification approach. Failure life tests of taped roller bearing are performed for verification of this analytical model. The experimental results indicate that this model can effectively trace and evaluate the failure lifetime and the remaining life of a bearing system.

J	Chao, CS; Yang, DL; Liu, AC				Chao, CS; Yang, DL; Liu, AC			A LAN fault diagnosis system	COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						automated fault isolation; alarm correlation; finite state machine; fault propagation duration; fault severity		The increasing importance of computer networks in today's society demands high levels of network availability and reliability. This is particularly apparent for the enterprises that perform their transactions depending highly on e-commerce. However, a trivial network fault could cause costly damages to the enterprises because of fault propagation. In this paper, we offer a fault diagnosis mechanism for effective and automated network fault isolation. This mechanism uses finite state machine (FSM) to model our classified and refined fault propagation behavior. A concept called fault propagation duration is also introduced into the mechanism and combined with the FSM-based fault propagation knowledge to complete the mechanism's implementation. Based on the diagnosis mechanism, an automated fault diagnosis system called alarm correlation view (or ACView) for isolating network faults is proposed. This diagnosis system not only provides the process of automated alarm collection, alarm correlation, and fault isolation, but also functions to recognize the propagations of all the faults with their corresponding fault severities.

J	Nandi, S; Ahmed, S; Toliyat, HA				Nandi, S; Ahmed, S; Toliyat, HA			Detection of rotor slot and other eccentricity related harmonics in a three phase induction motor with different rotor cages	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						eccentricity; induction motor fault diagnosis; sensorless speed estimation	AIR-GAP ECCENTRICITY; MACHINES	Detection of rotor slot and other eccentricity related harmonics in the line current of a three phase induction motor is important both from the viewpoint of sensorless speed estimation as well as eccentricity related fault detection. However, it is now clear that not all three phase induction motors are capable of generating such harmonics in the line current. Recent research has shown that the presence of these harmonics is primarily dependent on the number of rotor slots and the number of fundamental pole pairs of the machine. While the number of fundamental pole pairs of a three phase induction motor usually is within one to four (higher pole pairs are generally avoided due to increased magnetizing current), the number of rotor slots can vary widely. The present paper investigates this phenomenon further and obtains a hitherto nebulous theoretical basis for the experimentally verified results. Detailed coupled magnetic circuit simulation results are presented for a four pole, three phase induction motor with 44, 43, and 42 rotor slots under healthy, static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity conditions. The simulation is flexible enough to accommodate other pole numbers also. These simulations are helpful in quantifying the predicted harmonics under different combinations of load, pole pair numbers, rotor slots and eccentricity conditions, thus making the problem easier for drive designers or diagnostic tools' developers. Data from three different induction machines, namely, a 4 pole, 44 bar, 3 HP, a 4 pole, 28 bar, 3 HP, and a 2 pole, 39 bar, 100 HP motor have been used to verify the results experimentally. The simulation and the experimental results clearly validate the theoretical findings put forward in this paper.

Besides the traditional current signature analysis based on one-phase current spectrum lines at frequencies (1 +/- 2s)f, the procedures based on analysis of the line at frequency 2sf in the spectrum respectively of electromagnetic torque, space vector current modulus, and instantaneous power are considered. These last procedures have similar features and the comparison is developed on the basis of instantaneous torque. It is addressed that the speed ripple introduces two further terms in the instantaneous torque, decreasing the accuracy of the diagnosis. It is shown that there is a link between the angular displacement of the current sideband components at frequencies (1 2s)f. This allows a more correct quantitative evaluation of the fault and shows the superiority of the sideband current components diagnostic procedure over the other proposed methods.

Such decision may be supported by utilizing models that predict the patient's outcome. The study described in this paper investigates the possibility to construct patient outcome prediction models from retrospective patient's data at the end of initial damage control surgery by using feature mining and machine learning techniques. As the data used comprises rather excessive number of features, special attention was paid to the problem of selecting only the most relevant features. We show that a small subset of features may carry enough information to construct reasonably accurate prognostic models. Furthermore, the techniques used in our study identified two factors, namely the pH value when admitted to ICU and the worst partial active thromboplastin time, to be of highest importance for prediction. This finding is pathophysiologically reasonable and represents two of three major problems with severe trauma patients, metabolic acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.

The proposed paper combines some extensive numerical simulations of a single stage geared unit with localized tooth faults and the use of several detection techniques whose performances are compared and critically assessed. A model aimed at simulating the contributions of local tooth defects such as spalling to the gear dynamic behavior is set lip. The pinion and the gear of a pair are assimilated to two rigid cylinders with all six degrees of freedom connected by a series of springs which represent gear body and gear tooth compliances on the base plane. Classical shaft finite elements including torsional, flexural and axial displacements can be superimposed to the gear element together with some lumped stiffnesses, masses, inertias, ... which account for the load machines, bearings and couplings. Tooth defects are modeled by a distribution of normal deviations over a zone which can be located anywhere on the active tooth flanks. Among the numerous available signal processing techniques used in vibration monitoring, cepstrum analysis is sensitive, reliable and it can be adapted to complex geared system with several meshes. From an analytical analysis of the equations of motion, two complementary detection techniques based upon acceleration power cepstrum are proposed The equations of motion and the contact problem between mating flanks are simultaneously solved by coupling an implicit time-step integration scheme and a unilateral normal contact algorithm. The results of the numerical simulations are used as a data base for the proposed detection techniques. The combined influence of the defect location, depth and extent is analyzed for two examples of spur and helical gears with various profile modifications and the effectiveness of the two complementary detection methods is discussed before some conclusions are drawn.

J	Randall, RB; Antoni, J; Chobsaard, S				Randall, RB; Antoni, J; Chobsaard, S			The relationship between spectral correlation and envelope analysis in the diagnostics of bearing faults and other cyclostationary machine signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								In recent years there has been an increasing interest in applying cyclostationary analysis to the diagnostics of machine vibration signals. This is because some machine signals, while being almost periodic, are not exactly phase-locked to shaft speeds, and thus even after compensation for speed fluctuation cannot be extracted by synchronous averaging. Typical examples are the combustion events in IC engines, which vary from cycle to cycle, and impulsive signals from faults in rolling element bearings, which are affected by minor but randomly varying slip. Two main tools for the analysis of cyclostationary signals are the two-dimensional autocorrelation function us central time on the one axis and time displacement around the central time on the other, and its two-dimensional Fourier transform known as the spectral correlation. The latter can be quite complex to interpret, so some authors have suggested integrating it over all frequencies to obtain a Fourier series spectrum vs cyclic frequency. In this paper, it is shown that this gives the same result as a Fourier transform of the average squared envelope of the signal, which is much easier to obtain directly. Not only that, envelope analysis has long been used in the diagnostics of rolling element bearing signals, and some of the experience gained can be carried over to spectral correlation analysis. There is a possibility that the full spectral correlation may still give some advantage in distinguishing between modulation effects due to gear rotations and bearing inner race rotations (even at the same speed) by virtue of the different amounts of randomness associated with each.

J	Altmann, J; Mathew, J				Altmann, J; Mathew, J			Multiple band-pass autoregressive demodulation for rolling-element bearing fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							FREQUENCY	This paper presents a novel method to enhance the detection and diagnosis of low-speed rolling-element bearing faults based on discrete wavelet packet analysis (DWPA). The method involves the automatic extraction of wavelet packets containing bearing fault-related features from the discrete wavelet packet analysis representation of machine vibrations. Automated selection of the wavelet packets of interest is achieved via an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which can be implemented on-line. The resultant signal extracted by this technique is essentially an optimal multiple band-pass filter of the high-frequency bearing impact transients. Used in conjunction with the autoregressive (AR) spectrum of the envelope signal, a sensitive diagnosis of the bearing condition can be made. The discrete wavelet packet analysis multiple band-pass filtering of the signal results in a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to its high-pass counterpart, with an exceptional capacity to exclude contaminating sources of vibration. A more modest increase in the signal-to-noise ratio is achieved when compared to digital band-pass filtering, with the filter range adjusted to obtain the best possible isolation of the bearing transients.

In this paper, a genetic algorithms based method for shaft crack detection is proposed and described, which formulates the shaft crack detection as an optimization problem by means of finite element method and utilizes genetic algorithms to search the solution. Using genetic algorithms avoids some of the weaknesses of traditional gradient based analytical search methods including the difficulty in constructing well-defined mathematical models directly from practical inverse problems. The numerical experiments suo-est that good predictions of the shaft crack locations and configuration are possible and the proposed method is feasible. The study also indicates that the proposed method has the potential to solve a wide range of inverse identification problems in a systematic and robust way. (C) 2001 IMACS.

Such a mode of support is found to be inefficient, ineffective and generally results in high costs, long service cycles, and poor quality of service. With the advent of the Internet technology, it is possible to deliver customer service support over the World Wide Web. This paper describes a Web-based intelligent fault diagnosis system, known as WebService, to support customer service over the Web. In the WebService system, a hybrid case-based reasoning (CBR) and artificial neural network (ANN) approach is adopted as the intelligent technique for machine fault diagnosis. Instead of using traditional CBR technique for indexing, retrieval and adaptation, the hybrid CBR-ANN approach integrates ANN with the CBR cycle to extract knowledge from service records of the customer service database and subsequently recall the appropriate service records using this knowledge during the retrieval phase.

The network, called an incremental learning fuzzy neural (ILFN) network, uses localize neurons to represent the distributions of the input space and is trained using a one-pass, on-line, and incremental learning algorithm that is fast and can operate in real time. The ILFN network employs a hybrid supervised and unsupervised learning scheme to generate its prototypes. The network is a self-organized structure with the ability to adaptively learn new classes of failure modes and update its parameters continuously while monitoring a system. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed network, numerical simulations have been performed using some well-known benchmark data sets, such as the Fisher's Iris data and the Deterding vowel data set. Comparison studies with other well-known classifiers were performed and the ILFN network was found competitive with or even superior to many existing classifiers. The ILFN network was applied on the vibration data known as Westland data set collected from a U.S. Navy CH-46E helicopter test stand, in order to assess its efficiency in machinery condition health monitoring. Using a simple fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique for feature extraction, the ILFN network has shown promising results. With various torque levels for training the network, 100% correct classification was achieved for the same torque levels of the test data.

The purpose of fault diagnosis is the isolation of faults on defective systems, a task requiring a high skill set. This has driven the need for automated diagnostic tools. Over the last two decades, automated diagnosis has been an active research area, but the industrial acceptance of these techniques, particularly in cost-sensitive areas, has not been high. This paper reviews this research, primarily covering rule-based, model-based, and case-based approaches and applications. Future research directions are finally examined, with a concentration on issues, which may lead to a greater acceptance of automated diagnosis.

J	Wang, WJ; Wu, ZT; Chen, J				Wang, WJ; Wu, ZT; Chen, J			Fault identification in rotating machinery using the correlation dimension and bispectra	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						rotating machinery; condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; correlation dimension; bispectra	OIL FILM BEARINGS; TIME-SERIES; ROTOR; ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNALS; SYSTEM; CHAOS; ORDER	This paper reports on the application of nonlinear dynamics and higher-order spectra, with particular regard to the correlation dimension and bispectra in rotating machinery fault identification. The performance of the two methods is evaluated from the view of the practitioners' point. The correlation dimension of nonlinear dynamical system is of value to engineers because it provides an estimation of the number of degrees of freedom that an engineering system possesses. It can provide some intrinsic information of an underlying dynamic system, and can be used to classify different faults intelligently. Therefore, correlation dimension is helpful for an automatic fault detection procedure. Bispectral analysis offers a method for determining the nonlinear coupling and energy exchange between Fourier modes, and explains the origins of spectra peaks at certain values in the frequency spectrum. Such frequency domain information is necessary in order to classify different faults in rotating machinery. Therefore, a combination of correlation dimension and bispectra offer a good description of a nonlinear system. These methods can be complementary to each other in machinery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis field.

According to the concept of EID, multilevel information representation based on abstraction hierarchy of work domain is expected to be advantageous for supporting the operator's problem solving. To investigate the advantage of EID application, an experiment was conducted using a computer-based simulation of the secondary cooling system of nuclear power plants. Three interfaces were compared: the first representing only the physical properties of the process, the second representing purpose-related generalized functions (GFs) in addition to the physical properties, and the third representing abstract functions (AFs) governing the GFs in addition to the physical properties. The results showed that the diagnostic performance was improved by displaying functionally abstracted information at both levels, and that the usefulness of the abstract information was dependent on the complexity of the diagnosis problems.

In this paper, a new rubbing identification method is proposed, which is based on the acoustic emission technique. In this method, the acoustic emission signal of the rubbing in the multi-support rotor-bearing system is acquired by the acoustic emission sensor, and then the continuous wavelet transform is utilized to analyze this signal. Based on the rubbing mechanism, the frequency feature of the multiple frequency relation in the instantaneous frequency wave is extracted as the rubbing identification feature. The experimental results prove that the proposed method is efficient and feasible.

The proposed method of shaft current monitoring is noninvasive, reliable, portable, and low cost. Causes of the shaft current are described and prediction rules introduced. Fault conditions such as air-gap eccentricity, slot harmonies, and rotor broken bars or end ring result in asymmetrical flux pattern around the shaft, hence, resulting in shaft voltage. Bearing failures can occur when the voltage level exceeds the threshold of the oil film. The importance of the oil film is described.

J	Tse, PW; Peng, YH; Yam, R				Tse, PW; Peng, YH; Yam, R			Wavelet analysis and envelope detection for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis - Their effectiveness and flexibilities	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							VIBRATION SIGNALS; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION	The components which often fail in a rolling element bearing are the outer-race, the inner-race, the rollers, and the cage. Such failures generate a series of impact vibrations in short time intervals, which occur at Bearing Characteristic Frequencies (BCF). Since BCF contain very little energy, and are usually overwhelmed by noise and higher levels of macro-structural vibrations, they are difficult to find in their frequency spectra when using the common technique of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). Therefore, Envelope Detection (ED) is always used with FFT to identify faults occurring at the BCF. However, the computation of ED is complicated, and requires expensive equipment and experienced operators to process. This, coupled with the incapacity of FFT to detect nonstationary signals, makes wavelet analysis a popular alternative for machine fault diagnosis. Wavelet analysis provides multi-resolution in time frequency distribution for easier detection of abnormal vibration signals. From the results of extensive experiments performed in a series of motor pump driven systems, the methods of wavelet analysis and FFT with ED are proven to be efficient in detecting some types of bearing faults. Since wavelet analysis can detect both periodic and nonperiodic signals, it allows the machine operator to more easily detect the remaining types of bearing faults which are impossible by the method of FFT with ED. Hence, wavelet analysis is a better fault diagnostic tool for the practice in maintenance.

The methods are pseudo-phase portrait, singular spectrum analysis and correlation dimension. The pseudo-phase portrait is simple, easy to draw, and is sensitive to some fault types. Singular spectrum analysis can reveal the complexity of a signal. By means of singular spectrum analysis one can reduce the noise of a signal. Correlation dimension can provide some intrinsic information of an underlying dynamical system, and can be used to classify different faults intelligently. Examples show that all these methods are advantageous in the field of non-linear diagnostics. Therefore, it is quite reasonable for effective fault diagnosis to use non-linear diagnostic methods in addition to the methods currently used, such as orbit portrait, FFT spectra, time-frequency analysis, etc. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Lee, SU; Robb, D; Besant, C				Lee, SU; Robb, D; Besant, C			The directional Choi-Williams distribution for the analysis of rotor-vibration signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							WIGNER DISTRIBUTION	The accurate analysis of time-varying signals is an essential pre-request for the fault diagnosis and hence safe operation of rotating machines. The Wigner distribution (WD) is probably most widely used among the Cohen's class in order to describe how the spectral content of a signal changes over time. However, the basic nature of such signals causes significant interfering cross-terms, which do not permit a straightforward interpretation of the energy distribution. A new signal processing technique, the directional Choi-Williams distribution (dCWD), is proposed to account for complex-valued time-varying signals, which represent the planar motion of rotating machinery at each instant of time. Using the dCWD, not only are the cross-terms minimised but also the interference terms between the forward and backward harmonic components are avoided by transforming complex signals into the forward and backward pass analytic signals. Therefore, the dCWD produces a much lower level of the interference terms than the WD and hence leads to a much clear understanding of the dynamic behaviour of rotors under rotating conditions. The effectiveness of the dCWD is demonstrated by comparing it with the WD and Choi-Williams distribution through some numerical examples and an application to experimental signals.

The purpose of this study was to investigate if the atrial arrhythmias recorded immediately after cardioversion are associated with the risk of recurrence of the arrhythmia and to compare the prognostic significance of this parameter with that of other established risk factors. In a series of 71 patients, the risk factors for recurrence of AF during the first year after successful electrical cardioversion were analyzed. A new parameter that was investigated was the frequency of atrial premature beats and the presence of runs of supraventricular tachycardia in the Holter recording started immediately after the cardioversion. Age, left atrial size, left ventricular systolic function, duration of the arrhythmia before cardioversion, underlying cardiac disease, or medication taken were not found to be predictive of recurrence of the arrhythmia. However, the natural logarithm of the number of atrial premature complexes per hour of the Holter recording in the 37 patients in whom AF recurred was higher compared to that of the 34 patients who maintained sinus rhythm (P < 0.0005). The same was true if only the first 6 hours of the recording were analyzed (P < 0.0005). There was a trend for more frequent arrhythmia recurrence if runs of supraventricular tachycardia were present. The finding of > 10 atrial premature complexes per hour in the recording had a relative risk of 2.57 (1.51-4.37), a positive predictive accuracy of 76.5%, and a negative predictive accuracy of 70.3% for subsequent arrhythmia recurrence. We can conclude that frequent (> 10/hour) atrial premature complexes in the Holter recording after electrical cardioversion for AF is a significant risk factor for recurrence of the arrhythmia.

They have proved to be effective in predictive or proactive maintenance and quality control. Along with the fast development of computer and sensing technologies, sensors are being increasingly used to monitor machine status. In recent years, the fusion of multisensor data has been applied to diagnose machine faults. In this study, multisensors are used to collect signals of rotating imbalance vibration of a test rig. The characteristic features of each vibration signal are extracted with an auto-regressive (AR) model. Data fusion is then implemented with a Cascade-Correlation (CC) neural network. The results clearly show that multisensor data-fusion-based diagnostics outperforms the single sensor diagnostics with statistical significance.

J	Khoo, LP; Zhai, LY				Khoo, LP; Zhai, LY			A rough set approach to the treatment of continuous-valued attributes in multi-concept classification for mechanical diagnosis	AI EDAM-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING DESIGN ANALYSIS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						knowledge acquisition; mechanical diagnosis; rough sets		The efficient use of critical machines or equipment in a manufacturing system requires reliable information about their current operating conditions. This information is often used as a basis for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis-which essentially is an endeavor of knowledge extraction. Rough set theory provides a novel way to knowledge acquisition, especially when dealing with vagueness and uncertainty. It focuses on the discovery of patterns in incomplete and/or inconsistent data. However, rough set theory requires the data analyzed to be in discrete manner. This paper proposes a novel approach to the treatment of continuous-valued attributes in multi-concept classification for mechanical diagnosis using rough set theory. Based on the proposed approach, a prototype system called RClass-Plus has been developed. RClass-Plus is validated using a case study on mechanical fault diagnosis. Details of the validation are described.

J	Kozma, R; Freeman, WJ				Kozma, R; Freeman, WJ			Chaotic resonance - Methods and applications for robust classification of noisy and variable patterns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; DYNAMICS; ATTRACTORS; MODEL; RECOGNITION; ELEMENTS; MEMORY; PHASE; EEGS	A fundamental tenet of the theory of deterministic chaos holds that infinitesimal variation in the initial conditions of a network that is operating in the basin of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor causes the various trajectories to diverge from each other quickly. This "sensitivity to initial conditions" might seem to hold promise for signal detection, owing to an implied capacity for distinguishing small differences in patterns. However, this sensitivity is incompatible with pattern classification, because it amplifies irrelevant differences in incomplete patterns belonging to the same class, and it renders the network easily corrupted by noise. Here a theory of stochastic chaos is developed, in which aperiodic outputs with 1/f(2) spectra are formed by the interaction of globally connected nodes that are individually governed by point attractors under perturbation by continuous white noise. The interaction leads to a high-dimensional global chaotic attractor that governs the entire array of nodes. An example is our spatially distributed KIII network that is derived from studies of the olfactory system, and that is stabilized by additive noise modeled on biological noise sources. Systematic parameterization of the interaction strengths corresponding to synaptic gains among nodes representing excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations enables the formation of a robust high-dimensional global chaotic attractor. Reinforcement learning from examples of patterns to be classified using habituation and association creates lower dimensional local basins, which form a global attractor landscape with one basin for each class. Thereafter, presentation of incomplete examples of a test pattern leads to confinement of the KIII network in the basin corresponding to that pattern, which constitutes many-to-one generalization. The capture after learning is expressed by a stereotypical spatial pattern of amplitude modulation of a chaotic carrier wave. Sensitivity to initial conditions is no longer an issue. Scaling of the additive noise as a parameter optimizes the classification of data sets in a manner that is comparable to stochastic resonance. The local basins constitute dynamical memories that solve difficult problems in classifying data sets that are not linearly separable. New local basins can be added quickly from very few examples without loss of existing basins. The attractor landscape enables the KIII set to provide an interface between noisy, unconstrained environments and conventional pattern classifiers.

J	Dron, JP; Rasolofondraibe, L; Bolaers, F; Pavan, A				Dron, JP; Rasolofondraibe, L; Bolaers, F; Pavan, A			High-resolution methods in vibratory analysis: application to ball bearing monitoring and production machine	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						high-resolution methods; vibration ball bearing; correlogram; forming press		This paper is concerned with the implementation of parametric spectrum analysis using a high-resolution technique for setting up a conditional maintenance program via vibration analysis on a forming press. To achieve this, the resolving power of signal-processing-based parametric techniques is illustrated using spectrum assessment computation. Processing of the experimental results enabled (i) various autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis methods and especially Burg's algorithm to be tested and (ii) conventional spectrum analysis techniques such as the correlogram to be compared with parametric methods in terms of detection level as well as for mechanical component fault monitoring, especially ball bearing defects. Among various possible models, the AR model was retained along with Burg's algorithm and the Akaike information criterion. A detection and location methodology for faults likely to occur on rotating machinery was developed on the basis of the results that were obtained. The methodology, supplementing other analysis techniques, relies on the understanding of component spectrum behavior and various constraints, such as component access, spectral resolution of the industrial measuring device, and statistical properties of the power spectral density measurements of a random signal. The results show that parametric methods are particularly worthwhile in the early detection of component defects, especially when two characteristic frequencies are close to one another. However, the complexity of these techniques necessitates many precautions when they are implemented; consequently, they should not replace conventional methods, but supplement them.

J	Guttler, S; Kantz, H				Guttler, S; Kantz, H			The auto-synchronized wavelet transform analysis for automatic acoustic quality control	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION; MACHINERY; SIGNALS	A new feature vector for automatic acoustic quality control is presented and applied to the classification of electric sliding sunroofs at the quality control point by analyzing the sliding noise. The specific features of the sound signals (signatures) which distinguish products of different quality are not explicitly sought, because these signatures are highly specific for each application. Instead, the property is used that the relevant information about the sound signals can be resolved by the ears of experts. The time-frequency resolution of the ear is approximated by a wavelet transform of the signals. As a new approach to the important problem of noise reduction the concept of auto-synchronized wavelet transforms is introduced which allows wavelet transforms land more general time-frequency representations) to be averaged in the time domain without losing the time-resolved information in the signals. By this averaging process, statistical fluctuations (noise, parameter drifts) can be reduced significantly to reveal the characteristic features of the. signals. The classification can then be performed by a next neighbour search on a training set. The concept of auto-synchronized wavelet transforms is developed in a mathematically formal way and the properties of the feature vectors obtained are studied by using artificial noisy signals before applying this method to the experimental data.

J	Park, E; Tilbury, DM; Khargonekar, PP				Park, E; Tilbury, DM; Khargonekar, PP			A modeling and analysis methodology for modular logic controllers of machining systems using Petri net formalism	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						fault diagnosis/recovery control logic; logic control; machining systems; modular logic controller; petri nets (PNs); reconfigurable manufacturing systems	DESIGN; IMPLEMENTATION; SPECIFICATION	Logic controllers for machining systems typically have three control modes: auto, hand, and manual. In this paper, a unified formal representation of logic controllers with three control modes is provided using Petri nets (PNs). A modular logic controller structure is introduced and formalized for high-volume transfer lines. The modular logic controller consists of a control module for mode decision and control modules for station logic controllers. Each station control module is represented by connecting operation modules which are designed with respect to the fault recovery processes of operations; their connection algorithm is also provided. In our formal representation, each control module is represented by a live, safe, and reversible PN. A condition for the modular logic controller to generate a correct control logic is provided: operation causality condition. Using the modular structure of a logic controller, the control logic can be easily reconfigured and automatic code generation is possible.

The paper discusses features considered in the study, data collected, and the data mining solution approach to identify causes of quality faults in an industrial application.

J	Goodman, DL				Goodman, DL			Prognostic methodology for deep submicron semiconductor failure modes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS AND PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								Semiconductor reliability issues are beginning to emerge as a major impediment to long term reliability of critical systems such as Internet routers, ATM machines, and Automotive/Aerospace fly-by-wire systems. Semiconductors have certain defined failure modes that can contribute to end-of-life failures. These modes include time-dependent dielectric breakdown of the gate oxide (TDDB), hot carrier damage, and metal migration. All of these common failure modes are far worse at geometries below 0.25 u. Fortunately, there are methods proposed that counteract these common failure modes. This paper surveys the problems involved, and recommends a methodology for the inclusion of pre-calibrated prognostic cells that can be co-located with a host circuit to provide an "early-warning" of a system failure, so that appropriate corrective action can be taken.

To achieve this task detailed analysis of the air gap flux distribution and its dependence on the particular machine configuration is carried out. The analysis presented is based on the rotating wave approach which accounts for all the stator and rotor MMF harmonics, stator and rotor slot harmonics and harmonics due to saturation. It is shown that the most reliable indicators of the presence of the fault are the lower sideband of field rotational frequency with respect to the fundamental, together with some of the components that are related to slotting. Some of them increase as functions of the link current, in a range from 0 to over 10% and some components decrease in the range 0-12%.

The proposed approach uses the Hartley series for fitting operating data (voltage and currents measurements). The essence of the method is the use of linear state estimation to identify the coefficients of the Hartley series. The approach is tested for noise corruption likely to be found in measurements. The method is found to be suitable for the processing of digital fault recorder data to identify synchronous machine parameters.

However, medical services can be provided at or close to the home of the patient using fully equipped mobile telemedicine systems. Such a system can identify the disease at an early stage, improve quality of life and prognosis through early diagnosis and treatment, and reduce the costs of medical service. Furthermore, the unit can provide mass screenings of the population, as well as full medical service to remote areas. The Telecommunications Advanced Organization of Japan, Matsumoto, Japan, and Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto, Japan, established a research center for a unique telemedicine project using a mobile system. The mobile unit consists of a van that houses a spiral computed-tomography (CT) machine and various telecommunications equipment. The unit allows medical examination, CT scanning, and on-line two-way transfer of image data/teleconferencing to a medical center for consultation with various specialists. We have used the system thus far for the early detection of lung cancer through mass screenings over a four-year period in 29 administrative districts, Mass screenings of 19 117 residents resulted in the identification of 75 cases of early lung dancer who were later treated by partial pneumonectomy at Shinshu University Hospital and affiliated hospitals. We have also used the system to provide medical services to rural areas, as telemedicine support at remote areas, wintertime telemedicine support to an international sports competition, and various medical services to a home-care facility.

In normal operating conditions this kind of damage can be revealed by classical vibration analyses, such as Spectral or Envelope ones. Furthermore. this last technique-by working in time domain-makes it possible to monitor the Longitudinal dimension of the defect. In this paper, the limits of the mentioned methodologies are presented by showing their application to bearings affected by different pitting failures on the outer or inner race or a rolling element and subjected to a very low radial load. Results are compared with that obtained by an advanced signal processing method based on the evaluation of the wavelet transform. Effects of fault evolution are investigated. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Anand, SS; Hamilton, PW; Hughes, JG; Bell, DA				Anand, SS; Hamilton, PW; Hughes, JG; Bell, DA			On prognostic models, artificial intelligence and censored observations	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						colorectal cancer; survival analysis; nearest neighbour; censored observations		The development of prognostic models for assisting medical practitioners with decision making is not a trivial task. Models need to possess a number of desirable characteristics and few, if any, current modelling approaches based on statistical or artificial intelligence can produce models that display all these characteristics. The inability of modelling techniques to provide truly useful models has led to interest in these models being purely academic in nature. This in turn has resulted in only a very small percentage of models that have been developed being deployed in practice. On the other hand, new modelling paradigms are being proposed continuously within the machine learning and statistical community and claims, often based on inadequate evaluation, being made on their superiority over traditional modelling methods. We believe that for new modelling approaches to deliver true net benefits over traditional techniques, an evaluation centric approach to their development is essential. in this paper we present such an evaluation centric approach to developing extensions to the basic k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) paradigm. We use standard statistical techniques to enhance the distance metric used and a framework based on evidence theory to obtain a prediction for the target example from the outcome of the retrieved exemplars. We refer to this new k-NN algorithm as Censored k-NN (Ck-NN). This reflects the enhancements made to k-NN that are aimed at providing a means for handling censored observations within k-NN.

J	Cannavo, PF				Cannavo, PF			American contradictions and pastoral visions - An appraisal of Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden	ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							ENVIRONMENTALISM	Leo Marx's 1964 The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America war a foundational work in environmental studies. This article discusses the volume's significance and how Marx's ideas have evolved in later essays. Especially noteworthy is Marx's insight into the contradictory relationship with nature embodied in American pastoralism. Americans celebrate nature and rural values and yet embrace industry and commercialism as means to a pastoral utopia, even though these are ultimately destructive of the natural environment. Given these contradictions and the ascendancy of industrial and commercial values, Marx argues that American pastoralism ultimately fails as a viable cultural and political ideal. This article is critical of such pessimism but also shows how, in later essays. Marx revises his prognosis. Marx comes to see the pastoral ideal, particularly as manifested in environmentalism, as offering a key political alternative to contemporary industrial society and its social and ecological pathologies.

The method is based on current sensing. By evaluating the second derivative of the current in the switched on windings, it is possible to determine if motion takes place. The proposed method has been implemented using a 16-b microcontroller. Since this diagnostic tool is based mainly on the internal resources of the microcontroller and takes about 10 mus every 26 mus, it could be integrated into the digital motor drive. Experimental results show that under heavy-load working conditions about 90% of the anomalous waveforms are detected, while spurious alarms are negligible (0.001% measured with respect to over half a million analyzed waveforms).

J	Scruggs, JT; Mili, L				Scruggs, JT; Mili, L			Dynamic gradient method for PEBS detection in power system transient stability assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Lyapunov methods; transient stability; electric power systems; gradient system; potential energy boundary surface (PEBS); critical clearing time	BCU METHOD	In methods for assessing the critical clearing time based on the transient energy function, the dominant procedures in use for detecting the exit point across the potential energy boundary surface (PEBS) are the ray and the gradient methods. Because both methods rely on the geometrical characteristics of the post-fault potential energy surface, they may yield erroneous results. In this paper, a more reliable method for PEBS detection is proposed. It is called the dynamic gradient method to indicate that from a given system state, a small portion of the trajectory of the gradient system is approximated and tested for convergence toward the post-fault stable equilibrium point. It is shown that a trade-off between computing time and reliability can be found as the number of machines in the system becomes greater. The method is illustrated on 3-machine and 10-machine systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such reasoning systems must be capable of learning the specific features of each machine during its life cycle. In this paper, a hybrid reasoning approach that is capable of integrating domain knowledge and test and operational data from the machine is described. This approach is illustrated with an industrial gearbox example. In this approach explicit domain knowledge is expressed as a rule-base and used to train a feed-forward neural network. The training process results in a parsimonious representation of the explicit knowledge by combining redundant rules. A significant added practical benefit of this process is that it also is able to identify logical inconsistencies in the rule-base. Such inconsistencies are notorious in causing deadlock in large-scale expert systems. The neural network can be periodically updated with test and operational data to adapt the network to each specific machine. The flexibility and efficiency of this hybrid approach make it very suitable for practical health management systems designed to operate in a distributed environment.

Prognostic utility for the signature features are determined by transitional failure experiments. Such experiments provide evidence for the failure alert threshold and of the likely advance warning one can expect by tracking the feature(s) continuously. Kalman filters are used to track changes in features like vibration levels. mode frequencies, or other waveform signature features. This information is then functionally associated with load conditions using fuzzy logic and expert human knowledge of the physics and the underlying mechanical systems. Herein is the greatest challenge to engineering. However, it is straightforward to track the progress of relevant features over time using techniques such as Kalman filtering. Using the predicted states, one can then estimate the future failure hazard, probability of survival, and remaining useful life in an automated and objective methodology.

Effectively developing this function requires a structured approach to ensure that data level fusion, feature level fusion, and information level fusion are performed in a coherent architecture. This paper describes a methodology for examining the interfaces between aircraft system/subsystem elements of a PHM function. Case study scenario development is used as the basis for this methodology. Likely failure/damage/wear modes of the equipment are tracked from the observable symptom level through multiple levels of fusion to the top layer of the fusion architecture. There are multiple advantages of this structured approach: identification of interface requirements; clarification of information flows; identification of the individual functional elements of the architecture; and confirmation of the effectiveness of a given architecture. This methodology is applicable to all of the levels of the PHM information hierarchy. Case studies range from propulsion and vehicle system conditions that require immediate pilot notification as well as maintenance notification, to those that are analyzed over longer periods of time for estimating remaining life. Using a wide range of conditions allows examination of interfaces and modeling and cross-correlation techniques that support all levels of the information fusion hierarchy. A summary of the outcome and issues identified during the review of case studies of the vehicle, propulsion and air vehicle PUM systems is presented in this paper.

Included within such health management systems will be various failure mode diagnostic and prognostic (D/P) approaches ranging from genetic signal processing and experience-based algorithms to the more complex knowledge and model-based techniques. While signal processing and experienced-based approaches to D/P have proven effective in many applications, knowledge and model-based strategies can provide further improvements and are not necessarily more costly to develop or maintain. This paper will describe some generic prognostic and health management technical approaches to confidently diagnose the presence of failure modes or prognose a distribution on remaining time to failure.

The identification of natural frequencies of vibration and modal damping is of fundamental engineering importance. The damage done to a particular structure under an unknown force might be ascribed to the relative damping or the lack thereof and the natural frequencies of a vibrating system. The paper focuses on the design of a fault detection algorithm, which consists of two steps: (1) residual generation at each scale and (2) decision rules. The designed residual measurements are to reflect possible changes of interest in the dynamic signal. They are based on sufficient statistics of the model parameters at each resolution level. The decision rule is based on the generated residual. The following decision mechanisms are implemented: chi-squared test, and Shewhart control chart.

Because of the nonstationary nature of the vibrating system, one has to apply the time-scale transform to capture the nonstationary modes. The autoregressive moving average modeling captures the modal signatures, in particular. the autoregressive components (natural frequencies and damping in various modes) of the vibrating system. We consider the problem of detecting and diagnosing changes in the eigenstructure of the state transition matrix of the state-space model. A chi-square test is performed at different level of resolution in the time-scale space. The dynamic system that is considered in this research is a vibrating gear system.

At the higher level, First-Order Hybrid Petri Nets are used to generate the asynchronous concurrent events characterizing the nominal optimal system behavior, also providing the machine production rates. At the lower level, a real-time scheduler and a discrete Petri net communicate with the field-bus devices to force the machine to produce at the rates provided by the upper level, and monitor the occurring events by keeping track of part movements. Whenever a process failure is detected, the diagnosis procedure is triggered, and a recovery sequence is imposed.

In the paper, as an example, a complex fault tolerant finite state machine has been mapped on the FPGA contained in the SoC. The fault identification has beet? obtained by using a checker permitting the identification of class of faults. When a fault is detected, an interrupt for the microcontroller is generated and the interrupt handling routine partially reprograms the FPGA to override the part of memory configuring the faulty block. The architectures of the SoCs recently appeared on the market are characterized by a very efficient interaction between the microcontroller and the FPGA allowing a very efficient implementation of the fault detection and fault recovery strategy, A test bed of the proposed methodology has been implemented on the recently presented Atmel AT94K FPSLIC (Field Programmable System Level Integrated Circuits).

The method is based on least squares estimation and a simple formula for the derivative operator. The method is developed to be used with a Visual C++ engine and graphic user interface (GUI), so that the practicing power engineer may link machine measurements taken in an on-line environment with the estimator. A major objective is to develop the GUI application which will be user friendly and self guiding so as to enable prompt estimation of the desired parameters. In this way, possible fault conditions can be detected and remedy action can be undertaken. Moreover, it is desired that an algorithm be developed such that it will enable bad measurement detection and rejection so as to increase the reliability of the results.

When the network is connected to the Internet and services are remotely available they become a potential target for hackers, As the number of security related incidents is constantly increasing at an alarming rate the need for automated tools to detect intrusions becomes evident. Such tools are called intrusion detection systems. We present Sparta, a system that allows to detect security policy violations and network intrusions in a heterogeneous, networked environment. We have designed a pattern language in order to express intrusions (i.e. offending event patterns) in a declarative manner. This allows to specify what to detect instead of how to detect, A fully distributed approach to find the given patterns is presented as well, We use mobile agents to correlate event data instead of moving the whole information to a central location, This increases the fault tolerance and scalability of our system.

It has potential applications in many areas such as detection of machine damage or highlighting abnormal features in medical data. One approach is to build a hypothesis estimating the support of the normal data i.e. constructing a function which is positive in the region where the data is located and negative elsewhere. Recently kernel methods have been proposed for estimating the support of a distribution and they have performed well in practice - training involves solution of a quadratic programming problem. In this paper we propose a simpler kernel method for estimating the support based on linear programming. The method is easy to implement and can learn large datasets rapidly. We demonstrate the method on medical and fault detection datasets.

The controlled study involved a conventional conservative treatment, sham treatment, biphasic pulsed current, and direct current electrical stimulation. A quantity of available data suffices for an analysis with machine learning methods. So far only a limited number of studies have investigated the wound and patient attributes which affect the chronic wound healing. There is none to our knowledge to include the treatment attributes. The aims of our study are to determine effects of the wound, patient and treatment attributes on the wound healing process and to propose a system for prediction of the wound healing rate. In the first step of our analysis we determined which wound and patient attributes play a predominant role in the wound healing process. Then we investigated a possibility to predict the wound healing rate at the beginning of the treatment based on the initial wound, patient and treatment attributes. Finally we discussed the possibility to enhance the wound healing rate prediction accuracy by predicting it after a few weeks of the wound healing follow-up. By using the attribute estimation algorithms ReliefF and RReliefF we obtained a ranking of the prognostic factors which was comprehensible to field experts. We also used regression and classification trees to build models for prediction of the wound healing rate. The obtained results are encouraging and may form a basis of an expert system for the chronic wound healing rate prediction. If the wound healing rate is known, then the provided information can help to formulate the appropriate treatment decisions and orient resources to those individuals with poor prognosis.

At the heart of quality of care programs lie prognostic models whose predictions for a particular patient population may be used as a norm to which actual outcomes of that population can be compared. This paper motivates and suggests a method based on Machine Learning and Statistical ideas to study the behavior of current IC prognostic models for predicting in-hospital mortality. An application of this method to an exemplary logistic regression model developed on the IC data from the National Intensive Care Evaluation registry reveals the model's weaknesses and suggests ways for developing improved prognostic models.

Adaptive signal processing techniques have been used but With varying success.,, This paper describes the application of blind deconvolution to detect incipient failure in rolling element bearings. The technique involved using the eigenvector algorithm (EVA) developed, in [1] to derive an adaptive equalizer to recover the desired signal (bearing). The superior capability of the technique in detecting a. growing defect was evaluated using experimental tests where artificial noise was used to mask a simulated bearing defect. This work is currently being applied to in situ tests.

This research has been motivated and supported by the U.S. Navy's active interest in integrating advanced diagnostic and prognostic algorithms in existing Naval digital control and monitoring systems. A rudimentary diagnostic platform is assumed to be available providing timely information about incipient or impending failure conditions. We focus on the development of a prognostic algorithm capable of predicting accurately and reliably the remaining useful lifetime of a failing machine or component. The prognostic module consists of a virtual sensor and a dynamic wavelet neural network as the predictor. The virtual sensor employs process data to map real measurements into difficult to monitor fault quantities. The prognosticator uses a dynamic wavelet neural network as a nonlinear predictor. Means to manage uncertainty and performance metrics are suggested for comparison purposes. An interface to an available shipboard Integrated Condition Assessment System is described and applications to shipboard equipment are discussed. Typical results from pump failures are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the methodology.

The fundamental theory for the method is presented. In this theory, damage processes are viewed as occurring in a hierarchical dynamical system consisting of "fast", directly observable subsystem coupled with a "slow", hidden subsystem describing damage evolution. In the algorithm, damage tracking is achieved using a two-time-scale modeling strategy based on phase space reconstruction. Using the reconstructed phase space of the reference (undamaged) system, short-time predictive models are constructed. Fast-time data from later stages of damage evolution of a given system are collected and used to estimate the short time reference model prediction error or a tracking metric. The tracking metric is used as an input to a nonlinear recursive filter, the output of which provides an estimate of the current damage (or, equivalently, health) state. Estimates of remaining useful life (or, equivalently, time to failure) are obtained recursively using the current damage state estimates under the assumption of a particular battery voltage evolution model. In the experimental application, the method is shown to accurately estimate both the battery state and the time to failure throughout the whole experiment.

Moreover, many sensors are incapable of reliable decision-making on their awn. In such cases, a signal processing front-end that can match inference needs will be very helpful. The work is concerned with providing an object-oriented simulation environment for signal processing and neural network-based fault diagnosis and prognosis. In the toolbox, we implemented a wide range of spectral and statistical manipulation methods such as filters, harmonic analyzers, transient detectors, and multi-resolution decomposition to extract features for failure events from data collected by data sensors. Then we evaluated multiple learning paradigms for general classification, diagnosis and prognosis. The network models evaluated include Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) Neural Network, Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Decision Trees (C4.5), Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (FuzzyArtmap), Linear Discriminant Rule (LDR), Quadratic Discriminant Rule (QDR), Radial Basis Functions (RBF), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Single Layer Perceptrons (SLP). Validation techniques, such as N-fold cross-validation and bootstrap techniques, are employed for evaluating the robustness of network models. The trained networks are evaluated for their performance using test data on the basis of percent error rates obtained via cross-validation, time efficiency, generalization ability to unseen faults. Finally, the usage of neural networks for the prediction of residual life of turbine blades with thermal barrier coatings is described and the results are shown. The neural network toolbox has also been applied to fault diagnosis in mixed-signal circuits(16).

Recently, with the continual shrinking of resources, both monetary and personnel, the Navy has looked at various ways of reducing the workload and cumbersome work practices that its personnel have to perform. However, this is to be accomplished while maintaining its high level of readiness. [In fact, the CNO (ADM Vern Clark) has indicated the top five priorities for the Navy are manpower, current readiness, future readiness, quality of service, and Navy-wide alignment] (1) Due to these two requirements, the Navy has mandated a shift from its present maintenance philosophy, i.e. the Planned Maintenance System (PMS), to one that utilizes Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) principles. Simply put, the Navy wants to shift from a calendar based maintenance system, i.e. performing maintenance every so many days / months, to a maintenance system that is based upon the condition, performance and operation, of the equipment in question. To meet this objective, the Navy needed to apply condition-monitoring strategies for its ships' engineering equipment. The Navy chose to apply the Integrated Condition Assessment System (ICAS) to fill this requirement. ICAS has multiple applications that can be and are used by the Navy to help reduce workloads. However one of the key requirements that ICAS fills to enable CBM is the ability to trend machinery performance and diagnose machinery health. These two areas are key to the enabling of CBM within the Navy. With these tools, ICAS has the ability to turn the operational data that the new Machinery Control Systems (MCS) and the new sensor information systems provide into useful and useable information. This information can be used for the diagnosis of failures and the indications of possible future fault conditions.

Due to the nature of the observed data and the available knowledge, the diagnostic and prognostic methods are often a combination of statistical inference and machine learning methods. The development (or selection) of appropriate methods requires appropriate formulation of the learning and inference problems that support the goals of diagnosis and prognosis. An important aspect of the formulation is modeling - relating the real system to its mathematical abstraction. This paper explores the impact of diagnostic and prognostic goals on modeling and reasoning system requirements, with the purpose of developing a common software framework that can be applied to a large class of systems. In particular, the role of failure-dependency modeling in the overall decision problem is discussed. The applicability of Qualtech Systems' modeling and diagnostic software tools to the presented framework for both the development and implementation of diagnostics and prognostics is assessed. Finally, a potential application concept for advancing the reliability of Navy shipboard Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) systems and processes is discussed.

In this paper, a genetic algorithm-based method for shaft crack detection is proposed and described, which formulates the shaft crack detection as an optimization problem by means of finite element method and utilizes genetic algorithms to search for the solution. Using genetic algorithms avoids some of the weaknesses of traditional gradient-based analytical search methods including the difficulty in constructing well-defined mathematical models directly from practical inverse problems. The numerical experiments suggest that good predictions of the shaft crack locations and configuration are possible and the proposed method is feasible. The study also indicates that the proposed method has the potential to solve a wide range of inverse identification problems in a systematic and robust way. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To achieve this a serious commitment must be made to routine condition monitoring. When implemented effectively condition monitoring can yield a considerable cost benefit, resulting from a reduction in forced outages and a reduction in secondary damage costs from failing machinery. The collection of condition monitoring. data through hand-held devices,, though desirable, is becoming an expensive luxury due to 'right sizing' of manpower within process industries. This paper gives an insight into how a cost effective Integrated on-line condition monitoring surveillance system was developed, which removes the requirement of the weekly/monthly plant 'walk round' activity-by-maintenance staff. In addition examples of prevented plant failures are demonstrated, such as; . ID fan pedestal bolts working loose . Diagnosis of a gear fault in a variable speed,feed pump turbine. .

In the waste water. industry, bearings are normally changed according to their time in service rather than by using any online condition monitoring systems. Once a bearing is removed from a pump, regardless of its condition, it has to be discarded and this can lead to an expensive waste of potentially useful bearings. On the other hand, if the bearing is not changed when required it may cause major problems to the pump and large financial losses will be inevitable. In this project, the common pump bearing faults occurring in a typical waste water pumping station were simulated on a laboratory test-rig. The pump vibration was monitored and artificial neural networks were applied to identify the faults. Six types of bearing faults were created on the bearing inner race, outer race, ball and cage by E.D.M machining. Through conventional analysis methods it is impossible to identify those faults due to the complexity of the signals.

However, this success has not been mirrored at low rotational speeds of less than 20 rpm. At such speeds the energy generated from bearing defects might not show as an obvious change in signature and thus become undetectable using conventional vibration measuring equipment, This paper presents an investigation into the applicability of acoustic emission for detecting early stages of bearing damage at a rotational speed of 1.12 rpm. Furthermore, it reviews work undertaken in monitoring bearings rotating at speeds below 20 rpm. Investigations were centered on a bearing test-rig onto which localised surface defects were seeded by spark erosion. Analysis of acoustic emission signatures associated with bearing outer race, inner race and roller defects, showed that the uniqueness of the defect signature patterns could be utilised to provide early fault diagnosis.

Normalisation is carried out using multiple classes, in an attempt to ensure that the training data provided to the classifier is easy to partition. In condition monitoring however it is often difficult to provide training data that includes all likely fault conditions and this can be a significant problem to overcome. Work previously carried out (Jack, 2000) using feature selection with supervised training of neural networks and support vector machines has indicated that in most cases, the feature selection mechanism chose features with minimum variance within a class, making the data for each class closely clustered together. On this basis, it was decided to examine the impact of using minimum variance features of datasets that contained only normal data, and investigating the impact of this strategy on a simple novelty detection technique using the self organising map (SOM), first proposed by Kohonen. Features are transformed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality of data, while reordering the data from maximal to minimal variance. Using the minimum variance dimensions of the transformed data, it may be possible to detect condition changes. This would imply it would be comparatively easy to detect other conditions, Data from two different machines was used; machine A exhibiting rub and misalignment faults, providing 5 different datasets, while machine B exhibits ball bearing faults, from which 6 different statistical and spectral based datasets have been derived. The normal data is then used to train the SOM, and using a simple thresholding algorithm, detection is carried out. Results indicate that minimal variance features can improve detection of fault characteristics, however a hybrid approach using a mixture of maximal and minimal variance feature seems to offer the most robust solution.

The station consists of six 300MW Francis-type Pump-Turbines, with each 520 tonne assembly being suspended via a support bracket and a set of oil lubricated thrust bearing pads. Dinorwig performs a critical role in the UK National Grid system due to its ability to provide almost instantaneous power, Each of the machines must operate under an arduous regime in comparison with thermal base-load units, with each unit performing up to twenty-five mode change sequences per day. With such a regime the reliability of such plant is of critical importance in today's competitive electricity market. After carrying out an initial investigation into what useful information could be obtained from information currently monitored to determine the health of the plant, the authors are to continue a stage further and develop a condition monitoring and fault diagnostic system suitable for the machines at Dinorwig. In conjunction with developing the system, an assessment will be made of the improvements in the general condition of a unit which will have a new magnetic thrust bearing installed this year. The main purpose of the bearing is to reduce the load experienced by the thrust bearing at various power loads. This paper summaries the initial development work being carried out in order to identify the most appropriate monitoring parameters, analysis techniques and data acquisition systems required to achieve an effective condition monitoring and fault diagnostic system.

Maintenance can account for an extremely large proportion of the operating costs of machinery. Additionally, machine breakdowns and consequent downtime can severely affect the productivity of factories or the safety of products. Therefore, the manufacturing industries of the 21(st) century are influenced by the following major subjects of increased availability of physical resources, the improvement of product quality, and the improvement of manufacturing methods and techniques at high yearly utilization rate. Base is the effective use of available information contents from the machines in operation, like measured vibration signals and process parameters to extract significant patterns with the aim of early fault detection, the discovery of lack in the organization leadership and/or the operating condition.

Its condition monitoring and fault diagnosis have been addressed for a long time. This paper presents a new signal processing method-Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to detect the faults in rolling bearings. The ICA has been widely adopted for blind source separation without any prior information on the sources and their mixing process. However, some limitations exist in natural signals separation because of the embedded noise signal, convolution, etc. In practice, there should exist some prior knowledge useful for source separation about the collected signals. For example, the knowledge about the structure of the machine under examination and the sensor layout are helpful to identify the source behavior and the number of independent components. Considering these prior knowledge, the source separation process becomes partially blind, Example reveals the advantages of this method. The potential applications of Independent Component Analysis in machine diagnosis are also reviewed.

The effects produced by different kinds of time-varying loads are evaluated, stressing its implications in the diagnosis of rotor faults. It is shown that it is possible to discriminate the effects produced by a motor load torque oscillation from the ones introduced by the presence of a rotor asymmetry. Simulation results show that when the motor has a rotor fault and is coupled to a time-varying load, it is still possible to detect the fault. On-site tests conducted in a cement-mill corroborate the results obtained by simulation.

This machine is referred to as a Transverse Flux Motor (TFM) because of the unique three-dimensional flux paths created within it. This paper considers the development of flux-based condition monitoring for this new machine. Although condition monitoring based on vibration and current analysis has proved valuable to conventional induction motor fault detection and diagnosis [1-5], the design configuration of the TFM is significantly different to require new techniques to be developed. One such technique that is currently being researched and proving particularly useful is that of flux monitoring. In this paper an outline of the novel motor will be provided and then focus will be concentrated on the use of magnetic flux-based monitoring using copper search coils permanently fixed around the machine. A theoretical understanding on the use of flux monitoring is then discussed, including the transformation from the measurement to flux domains. Real data will be presented and the identification and diagnosis of a failure mode will also be examined and validated.

The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective gears are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from both original and preprocessed signals are used in an ANN based diagnostic approach. The output layer consists of two binary nodes indicating the status of the machine - normal or defective gears. The selection of input features and the number of nodes in the hidden layer are optimized using a GA based approach in combination with ANN. For each trial, the ANN is trained using back-propagation algorithm with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANN is tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a gearbox. The roles of different vibration signals, obtained under both normal and light loads and at low and high sampling rates, are investigated. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in diagnosis of the machine condition.

This paper introduces the use of Smoothed Instantaneous Power Spectrum (SIPS) distribution in the detection of a local tooth defect in gears. The SIPS distribution is derived from the Instantaneous Power Spectrum (IPS) distribution defined in the frequency domain and provides a considerable reduction in the ringing effect of the IPS transform. The proposed method was later applied to real vibration data obtained from a two-stage helical gearbox and the results of which show a localised gear tooth defect can be clearly detected.

This provides important information to the maintenance team and reduces the plant operational and maintenance costs. A popular tool for automated condition monitoring systems uses artificial neural networks, whose performance is heavily dependent on the quality of the input training data, which must accurately contain the main features of the signal to be classified. This work compares the usage of two feature extraction techniques (cepstrum and cepstrum reconstruction), as pre-processing tools for automated monitoring systems. Here, a neural network is used to diagnose the condition of a model drive-line, consisting of many rotating parts. Including a pair of spur gears, bearings, and an electric motor. Firstly, the model drive-line was ran in its normal condition, and later it was run with different gear faults (simulated cracks of different sizes) introduced intentionally. The real time domain vibration signatures from the drive-line under different conditions were pre-processed using the different pre-processing techniques. The pre-processed signals are used as input to neural networks that perform fault detection. It is shown here, that the cepstrum reconstruction technique does in fact outperform the basic cepstrum technique as a feature extraction tool for automated monitoring systems. Hence although more computationally expensive, cepstral reconstruction is a better choice of preprocessing technique for automated condition monitoring systems.

The specific characteristics of the vibration spectrum that are associated with common fault conditions are quite well known, e.g. the BPOR spectral component reflecting beating defects and the peak at the rotational frequency in the vibration spectrum indicating the degree of imbalance. The typical use of these features would be to determine when a machine should be taken out of operation in the presence of deteriorating fault conditions. Reliable diagnostics of deteriorating conditions may however be more problematic in the presence of simultaneous fault conditions. This paper demonstrates that the presence of a bearing defect makes it impossible to determine the degree of imbalance based on a single vibration feature, e.g. the peak at rotational frequency. In such a case it is necessary to employ diagnostic techniques that are suited to the parallel processing of multiple features. Neural networks are the best known technique to approach such a problem. The paper demonstrates that a neural classifier using the X and Y components of both the peak at rotational frequency and the peak at BPOR frequency as input features, can reliably diagnose the presence of bearing defect and can at the same time indicate the degree of imbalance. Different supervised and unsupervised neural classification techniques are then evaluated for their ability to reliably model the degree of imbalance, while also identifying the presence of defects.

The condition-indicating information is condensed into the network's synaptic weights which can be used for further analysis. The paper is organised as follows. Firstly basics of SOM networks are discussed with emphasis on input vector distribution approximation, Secondly, the applications of SOM networks are verified with numerical examples. Thirdly, the SOM networks are applied to approximate the distribution of machine generated acoustic signals. Spectral information is extracted from network synaptic weights and used to compare different conditions. The spectral interpretation of the SOM synaptic weights provides an efficient and novel analysis technique.

This paper outlines the background to the technique and describes two alternative architectures for its implementation. The development of approaches in order to implement condition monitoring are then discussed. Finally an example of the capability of Componential Coding is given using real data from an induction motor test facility. Conventional methods of condition monitoring are well established but exhibit some shortcomings [1, 2, 3] related to the requirements for prior knowledge and development of machine-specific tools. Componential Coding however is a generic technique that can be applied with little domain specific knowledge. The approach was originally developed for high dimensional data (typically for image processing) [4]. In order to apply Componential Coding to condition monitoring of rotating machinery the algorithm was developed in two forms: one for single-channel data and one for multi-channel data inputs. This paper considers the training of the network, how it may be used in condition monitoring and also both empirical and automatic optimisation of the network in order to improve the detection and diagnostic capabilities. The results obtained through the application of both real vibration and acoustic data from a conventional induction motor operating under healthy and faulty conditions are then presented and discussed.

The particular application is the hydraulic system of machinery used in the mining of Western Canada's Oil Sands. The system, analyses transducer data from the machinery and determines the machine's condition, using various signal processing techniques and a combination of a neural network and an expert system. If at any given time a decision is made by the diagnostics system that a fault is imminent, it will communicate failures and relevant information to maintenance staff via the company local area network. The system makes use of both neural network and expert rule based approaches for fault detection of a system with many different types of inputs to address the practicalities of implementation. These inputs include mechanical vibrations, slowly changing mechanical parameters and operator inputs. The combination of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and expert systems attempts to address some of the weaknesses of either approach being used independently. While the ANN is being trained online, the expert system will serve as the primary mechanism for failure detection. Gradually, as a database of fault and normal running data is accrued and classified, the role of the ANN will become more prevalent. All of the signal processing, computation and communications are being implemented using commercially available, low cost, PC based data acquisition and monitoring technology. Once the system has been trained unnecessary parameters and corresponding hardware and transducers can be removed, This approach addresses the practicalities of implementation of a monitoring system to a machine where little advanced knowledge exists of the machine's behaviour. The structure of the expert system and the ANN will be somewhat parallel. The reasoning for this is that what one scheme does not catch, the other will. A challenge with this type of parallel system is the avoidance of false alarms. Preliminary results indicate that this is an economical and effective approach, flexible enough to be implemented for various other types of machinery and industries.

A large amount of research has been conducted to investigate good performance networks for practical problems including machinery fault diagnosis. However, due to the complexity of Artificial Neural Networks, there is no easy way to select the best models from amongst the numerous possibilities. Resulting from the fact that networks are initialised randomly, the other problem that multi-layer neural network users often experience is how to achieve network repeatedly. In this paper, a systematic way of finding the best performance networks for prediction of certain pump faults is presented, By comparing a series of network structures, network training times, simulation errors, and correct prediction rates, the performance of the networks were evaluated. The network repeatability was also achieved through Matlab programming. A water pump vibration monitoring system has been set up as a laboratory test-rig and common faults such as pump impeller wearing problems, impeller imbalance problems, and pump bearing faults were simulated on the test-rig. Vibration signals under different pump conditions were sampled and pre-processed before being applied as inputs to multi-layer neural networks.

However, these methods has serious drawbacks that are insensitive to the signal pulse phase shifting or small local change in amplitude, so it is difficult to find the faults of valves and other important elements in the reciprocating machines such as reciprocating compressors and internal combustion engines etc. In this paper, we propose a new method that can detect the signal pulse phase shifting and small local change in amplitude by introducing rotating angle density function and its normalized power density function (NPDF). By transforming this NPDF to Kullback-Leibler information function, It become possible for us to find and evaluate the faults in the reciprocating machinery very precisely.

The former covers wide vibration causes, relating the probability of the occurrence of symptoms to an underlying cause, while the latter based on IF-THEN clauses gives relatively specified diagnosis results. Thus, the combined algorithm can guarantee high accuracy of fault diagnosis and also be easily extended by adding new causes or symptoms. Some examples using experimental data show the good feasibility of the proposed algorithm for condition monitoring and diagnosis of industrial rotating machinery.

Conditions representing various speed ranges, different rates of change and different signal-to-noise ratios in the vibration signals are considered. A comparison of AR model based results with FFT based spectra is discussed. The method is also applied to vibration signals recorded from a rolling element bearing with and without an outer race fault. The results indicate that when applying the AR model based method to varying speed machines both the range of speed and the rate of change of the speed are important. Criteria and guidelines are recommended for the successful application of the AR model based method. This investigation shows that the AR model based spectral estimation procedure can generate clear and useful spectra for fault detection and diagnosis from relatively short vibration signals taken from machines operating under varying speeds.

The unbalance includes static unbalance, couple unbalance, quasi-static unbalance and dynamic unbalance. The misalignment includes parallel misalignment, angular misalignment and compound misalignment. As the directional characteristics of vibration change with the type of machine fault, it is extremely difficult for conventional unidirectional type of vibrometer to diagnose the fault of structure. We can observe the movement of the structure using orthogonal three directional vibration measurements, and it will be a great help to diagnose the fault of structure. But large and complex operations are necessary to realize it. We have developed a palm size vibrometer, which can measure vibrations in three orthogonal directions simultaneously and visualize the movement of the measuring point on LCD screen only by pressing the sensor onto a surface of machine. We call it the orbit visualizing vibrometer. The structure of the sensor is very unique. Three piezoelectric accelerometers are arranged at equal intervals around the sensor center axis with the sensitive axes of piezoelectric accelerometers facing the sensor tip. The principle of operation is quite different from conventional triaxial vibration pickups. A detailed operation principle of the new handheld type triaxial vibration pickup is reported, and applications of the orbit visualizing vibrometer are described.

Unfortunately, a poor accuracy of the model of the fully assembled machine, as well as errors in the evaluation of the experimental vibrations caused only by the impending fault, can affect the accuracy of the fault identification. This can make difficult to identify the type of the actual fault as well as to evaluate its severity and its position. This paper shows some methods that have been developed to measure the accuracy of the results obtained with model based techniques aimed to identify faults in rotating machines. The results of some first investigations on the capabilities of these methods, carried out using the machine response simulated with mathematical models, are shown in the paper.

These machines are structurally very robust and are primary source of motive power and speed control where do machines cannot be used. For closed loop control of these machines, sensorless speed estimation is usually preferred. Among the current estimation techniques available for speed- sensorless induction motor drives, speed measurement based on rotor slot related harmonic detection in machine line current happens to be a prominent one. While these harmonics can be strong in certain kind of machines, some other machines may exhibit very weak rotor slot harmonics that can be obscured by noise. Skewing, slot shapes and types, structural unbalances etc. also have a prominent effect on the detectability of these harmonics. The present paper attempts to investigate this problem based on the interaction of pole pairs, number of rotor bars and stator winding. Though the analysis and experimental results have been mainly provided for three phase squirrel cage induction motors, single phase and slip ring induction motors have also been addressed to. Further, it has been shown that eccentricity related fault detection could also be easily accommodated with this kind of speed detection technique at no or negligible extra cost when certain motors are selected.

It is based on the decomposition of the stator voltage and the stator current in a finite series of harmonics. For one harmonic present in both voltage and current, the model gives a dedicated impedance branch. For one harmonic in the current only, the model gives a specific current source. By neglecting saturation, the linear model gives an equivalent circuit with only voltage sources, current sources and impedances without any symmetry in the different phases. The parameters can be computed using only fast Fourier transform (FFT) of stator voltage and current. The application of this new technique has been performed for parameter determination of a three-phase 0.12kW, 220V/380V, 50Hz, 2 poles induction machine.

The proposed algorithm uses stator currents as input without any other sensors. First rotor speed is estimated from stator currents, then appropriate features are extracted. The produced feature vector is normalized and fed to the trained Bves minimum error classifier to determine if motor is healthy or has incipient faults (broken bar fault, static eccentricity or both). Only number of poles and rotor slots are needed as pre-knowledge information. Theoretical approach together with experimental results derived from a 3 hp ac induction motor show strength of this method. In order to cover many different motor load conditions data are derived from 10% to 130% of the rated load for both a healthy induction motor and an induction motor with a rotor having 4 broken bars and/or static eccentricity.

Hence, this approach can distinguish between the "fault signatures" of each of the following faults: eccentricities, broken bars, and broken end-ring connectors in such induction motors. Furthermore, the techniques presented here can extensively and economically predict and characterize faults from the induction machine adjustable speed drive design data without the need to have had actual fault data from field experience. This is done through the development of dual-track studies of fault simulations and hence simulated fault signature data. These studies are performed using our proven Time Stepping Coupled Finite Element-State Space method to generate fault case performance data, which contain phase current waveforms and time-domain torque profiles. Then from this data, the fault cases are classified by their inherent characteristics, so called "signatures" or "fingerprints". These fault signatures are extracted or "mined" here from the fault case data using our novel Time Series Data Mining technique. The dual-track of generating fault data and mining fault signatures was tested here on dynamic and static eccentricities of 10% and 30% percent of airgap height as well as cases of 1, 3, 6, and 9 broken bars and 3, 6, and 9 broken end-ring connectors. These cases were studied for proof-of-principle in a 208-volt, 60-Hz, 4-pole, 1.2-hp, squirrel cage 3-phase induction motor. The paper presents faulty and healthy performance characteristics and their corresponding so-called phase space diagnoses that show distinct fault signatures of each of the above mentioned motor faults.

To meet the requirement of rub fault diagnosis for rotating machinery, a mass-stiffness-damping rotor system with mufti-disks is investigated theoretically in this paper. By analyzing the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system and using the least-square method, the changes of stiffness and damping coefficient matrix are identified to diagnose the rub fault and detect the rubbing location. Various theoretical results are presented to show the relation between the rub fault and dynamic characteristics: the stiffness and damping coefficient of the rubbing location are sharply increased when the rotor-to-stator pub occurs.

The main features and advantages of this permanently installed continuous PD monitoring system that includes real time assessed condition trending and alarm initiation capability will be presented. The objective is to identify and evaluate condition changes of the stator winding insulation system and thus to improve condition-based and predictive maintenance strategies. This effectively reduces the overall total lifecycle cost of the unit. Examples are given where based on the assessment of on-line PD measurements on turbogenerators machines were shut down in order to avoid premature failure and to allow for corrective maintenance work to be performed.

Due to environment degraded conditions, direct measurements are not possible. Due to the rapidity of the machine, human intervention is not possible in case of position fault. So, an oriented vision solution is proposed. Degraded conditions are vibrations, water and chip of metal projections, dazzling... In this case, only one method cannot achieve a diagnostic problem: is it the right piece at the right place? That is why complementary methods presented in this paper are proposed to answer this question.

The method enables to decide if it is possible to identify, the faulty machine in the system, once faults have been detected in a system implementation. If this is possible, it also provides tests for locating the faulty component machine. Two examples are used to demonstrate the different steps of the method. The method can also lie used for locating faults within a machine when the system specification and implementation are given in the form of a single FSM.

Generally this work is beginning with vibration monitoring and analysis of hydroelectric generating set (sometimes called unit). However, the unit has a combined influence from water, machine, electricity and many other factors. The causes resulted in vibration are complicated. Here, the membership concept of fuzzy mathematics is employed to identify possible existence of specific faults linked to vibration characteristics of hydroelectric generating set. Dynamic fuzzy clustering is applied to analyze the vibration causes. The fuzzy dynamic ISODATA(Iterative self Organizing Data Analysis Technique A) algorithm is also introduced to diagnose the unit vibration faults. It is feasible and has a degree of reliability. In which a fuzzy relationship matrix, corresponding symptom matrix and related fault matrix can be constructed based on each unit's structure and design parameters. They are realized by changing the columns and row of matrix. It shows by a real example that calculation results are in good agreement with actual inspection records. It is considered that this method has good prospects for future use.

Smart machines are able to evaluate on line a number of its own vitalities helping operators to diagnose faults. Most of time the origins of the problems are buried into intractable and not usually relevant data. Some neural architectures are presented in this paper for recognizing those operational trajectories that are the early symptoms of faults in these smart machines. In order to cope with such classification problem, a neural architecture defined as PREMON (Predictive Maintenance Oriented Network) has been designed. The main advantage of the system is its brain-inspired philosophy that allow it to be applied to a great deal of systems that are degraded or damaged because of their interaction with its environment.

Multiresolution signal decomposition based on wavelet transform or wavelet packet provides a set of decomposed signals in independent frequency bands, which contain independent dynamic information due to the orthogonality of wavelet functions. Also wavelet transform and wavelet packet in tandem with some signal processing methods, such as autoregressive spectrum, energy monitoring, fractal dimension, etc., can produce desirable results for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of induction motor. In the proposed method, broken bar detection is based on the decomposition of the stator currents, where wavelet coefficients of these signals have been extracted. Comparing these extracted coefficients is used for diagnosing the healthy machine from faulty machine. Experimental results are presented for healthy, and machines with two, three, four, and five broken bars in their rotor. Deviation of wavelet coefficients in healthy mode from faulty modes depicts the number of broken bars in rotor cage. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for broken rotor bar detection in squirrel cage induction motors.

J	Kang, H; Wen, JT				Kang, H; Wen, JT			Robotic assistants aid surgeons during minimally invasive procedures	IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY MAGAZINE			English	Article								This article presents the design and implementation of a new robotic system for assisting surgeons in performing minimally invasive surgical procedures. This system is designed for collaborative operation between the surgeon and the rebut. In addition, it has the following attributes: quick interchangeable end tools, programmable collaboration with the surgeon, and coordinated motion of multiple robotic devices for performing complex procedures. Two such devices have been built, with a variety of end-tools. The system has demonstrated direct manual operation and surgeon-supervised autonomous stitching and knot tying. In addition to the mechanical design and kinematic analysis, several autonomous knot-tying algorithms and the associated kinematic requirements are discussed. Note that, as the focus here is on the robot design and control, other important aspects on the clinical deployment of surgical robots such as safety, fault detection and amelioration, man-machine interface design, etc., are not addressed here.

Vibration monitoring can be used to spot mechanical problems, trigger preventative maintenance and diagnose the health of rotating machinery. Accelerometers are used in this role to detect defects in rotating components through analysis of harmonics in the power-frequency distribution. Further, high frequency acoustic emission sensors can be used to determine crack growth in metal components or failures in composite structures. Currently, a variety of MEMS accelerometers and piezoelectric acoustic emission sensors are used in health monitoring that are limited by their size, cost, and performance. Optical fiber sensors are rapidly emerging as viable alternatives to these devices as effective means of health monitoring in harsh environments. These sensors are tolerant to extreme temperature, EMI, shock and vibration, and offer reduced weight and increased accuracy over conventional instrumentation. As a result, these sensors have begun to replace conventional sensors in harsh environment applications. Optical fiber sensors offer much smaller size, reduced weight, ability to operate at temperatures up to 2000 degreesC, immunity to electromagnetic interference, resistance to corrosive environments, inherent safety within flammable environments, and the ability to multiplex multiple sensors on a single optical fiber. This paper presents the research and development of both low-profile fiber optic-based acoustic emissions sensors for use in nondestructive evaluation systems and fiber optic accelerometers for harsh environment health monitoring applications.

Therefore, the successful management of a TPS development program is of crucial importance. This paper will attempt to encompass the various management issues involved in the TPS development process. To begin with, a careful review of the TPS must be effected during the bid process. Task evaluation tools are a distinct aid in management's ability to scope and estimate a TPS development task. Old fashioned engineering experience is used to check the results provided by these automatic tools. Once a job is won, rigid management controls must be kept in place to track the percentage completion against the formal plan (e.g. how often have we seen 90% of the available funds expended halfway through the technical effort). Software evaluation tools are a significant aid in keeping a development program on track. Management must try to balance its TPS staff between experienced engineers, middle range people and newer hires. The transfer of knowledge with such a mix is indeed beneficial. Management must look to create a broad experience base on different level UUT (i.e. systems, subsystems, modules, boards, etc.) spanning the overall circuitry spectrum (i.e. digital, analog, RF, etc.). Providing their designers with truly modem ATE software is a must. The operating system and test language must contribute features including incremental compilation, advanced edit/debug aids, links to major simulators and ATPGs, advanced fault isolation techniques, automated instrument programming, extensive use of graphics and more. Newer aids including analog simulators must also be made available by the TPS management team. Today another major factor to be addressed by management is the need to deal with TPS conversion from legacy ATE systems. The large investment in TPSs must be converted to modem ATE systems as the older ATE machines become totally unsupportable. These and other aspects of successful TPS management will be the focus of this paper.

This has driven the need for automated test and diagnostic tools. As test and diagnosis is a high-level human activity, Al-based solutions have been pursued. This has been an active research area for some decades, but the industrial acceptance of Al approaches, particularly in cost-sensitive areas, has not been high. This paper reviews the history and current state of Al in test and diagnosis, discusses future challenges, and introduces the authors' work in addressing some of these challenges in a diagnostic context.				billy_fenton@intertesttech.com; tm.mcginnity@ulst.ac.uk; lp.maguire@ulst.ac.uk		Maguire, Liam/0000-0001-6153-3298; McGinnity, Thomas Martin/0000-0002-9897-4748			Abramovici M, 1990, DIGITAL SYSTEMS TEST; ALJUMAH AA, 1998, P ICCAS, V2, P304; ALLRED D, 1991, P INNOVATIVE APPL AR; Back T., 1997, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, V1, P3, DOI 10.1109/4235.585888; Balakrishnan A, 1999, DECIS SUPPORT SYST, V25, P251, DOI 10.1016/S0167-9236(99)00015-9; BEARSE TM, 1998, RES PERSPECTIVES CAS; BENBASSAT M, 1998, RES PERSPECTIVES CAS; BosPlachez C, 1997, INT J INTELL SYST, V12, P849, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-111X(199711/12)12:11/12<849::AID-INT4>3.0.CO;2-X; Bourseau P, 1995, AI COMMUN, V8, P119; Chandrasekaran B, 1999, IEEE INTELL SYST APP, V14, P20, DOI 10.1109/5254.747902; Chandrasekaran B, 1994, ADV COMPUT, V38, P73; Chess B, 1999, IEEE T COMPUT AID D, V18, P346, DOI 10.1109/43.748164; COX E, 1994, FUZZY SYSTEMS HDB; Cunningham P, 1998, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V11, P239, DOI 10.1016/S0950-7051(97)00049-X; Cunningham P, 1998, ARTIF INTELL ENG, V12, P283, DOI 10.1016/S0954-1810(97)10004-8; Dague P., 1994, Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, V11, P439, DOI 10.1007/BF01530755; DAGUE P, 1990, P 9 EUR C ART INT, P173; DAGUE P, 1987, P AAAI 87 SEATTLE, P600; Darwiche A, 2000, AI MAG, V21, P57; DAVIS R, 1984, ARTIF INTELL, V24, P347, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(84)90042-0; DAVIS R, 1992, READINGS MODEL BASED; DEKLEER J, 1986, ARTIF INTELL, V28, P127, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(86)90080-9; DEKLEER J, 1991, PROCEEDINGS : NINTH NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2, P842; DEKLEER J, 1992, READINGS MODEL BASED; DEKLEER J, P IJCAI, P104; DEKLEER J, 1987, ARTIF INTELL, V32, P163; DEV N, 1997, P INNOVATIVE APPL AR; DRESSLER O, 1996, PRINCIPLES KNOWLEDGE, P267; Dubois D., 1988, NONSTANDARD LOGICS A, P287; FERET MP, 1992, APPL ARTIF INTELL, V7, P679; Frank PM, 1997, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V10, P3, DOI 10.1016/S0952-1976(96)00072-3; FRANK PM, 1995, P 34 C DEC CONTR, P2414; GARTNER D, 1996, P AUTOTESTCON, P468; HAMSCHER WC, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE, V51, P223; Han B, 1999, APPL INTELL, V10, P37, DOI 10.1023/A:1008333430997; Holland JH., 1992, ADAPTATION NATURAL A, DOI 10.7551/mitpress/1090.001.0001; Isermann R, 1998, IEEE T SYST MAN CY A, V28, P221, DOI 10.1109/3468.661149; JAKUBOWICZ O, 1989, P INT C NEUR NETW, V2, P611; KIRSCH H, 1993, P INT C FAULT DIAGN, P748; Kolodner J.L., 1993, CASE BASED REASONING; KOLODNER JL, 1996, CASE BASED REASONING; LENG GW, 1992, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V5, P121, DOI 10.1016/0952-1976(92)90052-L; LIM JH, 1991, P INT JOINT C NEUR N, V2, P1693; LIU ZQ, 1995, P IEEE C NEUR NETW, V6, P3107; Luger G.F., 1998, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE, V3rd ed.; MAGUIRE LP, 1998, P JOINT C INF SYST, P283; Maidon Y, 1997, IEE P-CIRC DEV SYST, V144, P149, DOI 10.1049/ip-cds:19971146; MITTELSTADT D, 1994, P ASME, V1, P391; Mohamed F, 1996, J ELECTRON TEST, V9, P203, DOI 10.1007/BF00137575; Mohamed F, 1996, EUR CONF DESIG AUTOM, P259, DOI 10.1109/EDTC.1996.494158; PENG Y, 1987, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V17, P146, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1987.4309027; PENG Y, 1987, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V17, P395, DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1987.4309056; PREIST C, 1997, HPL9722; Rich E., 1991, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE; ROWLAND JG, 1993, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V6, P437, DOI 10.1016/0952-1976(93)90004-H; SATYANARAYANA T, 1995, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V8, P355, DOI 10.1016/0952-1976(95)00012-P; SAUTER D, 1993, P 1 EUR C FUZZ INT T, P781; SHEPPARD JW, 1998, RES PERSPECTIVES CAS; SHEPPARD JW, 1992, P IEEE AUTOTESTCON C, P159; Shimomura Y, 1995, AI MAG, V16, P41; SHIRLEY M, 1983, P INT IEEE C COMP DE; Simpson W.

Diagnostic decisions reflect two important factors: current technical status of the operating machinery and the cumulative history of its exposure to adverse operational and environmental conditions. The feedback approach in system diagnostics is aimed at the early detection of incipient failures and implies the analysis of dynamic responses of particular system components to various stimuli and detecting deviations of these responses from the "nominal response". The feedforward approach is based on the compilation of the "history of abuse" of system components, such as abnormal operational regimes, exposure to vibration, excessive temperature, etc.	SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA		Skormin, VA (corresponding author), SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.

The present paper describes early attempts to prove the feasibility of doing this based on the optical measurement of the stress in the oxide that attaches the coating to the metal component. Both standard regression methods and neural network methods are compared and it was found that the neural network approach was superior for the case where multiple signal features were present. All methods provide useful predictions for the idealized case considered.

Predicting time-to-failure accurately and reliably is absolutely essential if such maintenance practices are to find their way into the industrial floor. Moreover, means are required to assess the performance and effectiveness of these algorithms. This paper introduces a prognostic framework based upon concepts from dynamic wavelet neural networks and virtual sensors and demonstrates its feasibility via a bearing failure example. Statistical methods to assess the performance of prognostic routines are suggested that are intended to assist the user in comparing candidate algorithms. The prognostic and assessment methodology proposed here may be combined with diagnostic and maintenance scheduling methods and implemented on a conventional computing platform to serve the needs of industrial and other critical processes.

Early detection of abnormalities in the motors contributes to avoid expensive failures. It has been shown that rotor faults can be detected thanks to the spectral analysis of the stator current using FFT/DFT algorithms. They are usually performed and analysed off-line after data acquisition. The proposed method allows to obtain the DFT immediately after the arrival of each new sample. This technique is suitable for the on-line running spectral analysis of the stator current in order to detect the components due to rotor broken bars while the machine is operating. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed method for an on-line diagnostic.

The technique can extensively and economically characterize and predict faults from the induction machine adjustable speed drive design data. This is done through the development of dual-track proof-of-principle studies of fault simulation and identification. These studies are performed using our proven Time Stepping Coupled Finite Element-State Space method to generate fault case data. Then, the fault cases are classified by their inherent characteristics, so called "signatures" or "fingerprints." These fault signatures are extracted or mined here from the fault case data using our novel Time Series Data Mining technique.

This paper is devoted to investigating the possibility of performing on-line monitoring of the condition of asynchronous machines. The fault detection scheme uses a neurofuzzy model of the static characteristics of the motor to generate residuals. Although the influence of cracked rotor bar and an increase in the motor loading are similar, simulation results show that the neurofuzzy model-based fault detector is able to detect the presence of a partially broken bar regardless of the loading conditions.

The proposed algorithm uses only stator currents as input without the need for any other variables. First rotor speed is estimated from the stator currents, then appropriate features are extracted. The produced feature vector is normalized and fed to the trained classifier to see if motor is healthy or has broken bar faults. Only number of poles and rotor slots are needed as pre-knowledge information. Theoretical approach together with experimental results derived from a 3 hp ac induction motor show the strength of the proposed method. In order to cover many different motor load conditions data are obtained from 10% to 130% of the rated load for both a healthy induction motor and an induction motor with a rotor having 4 broken bars.

The input data are vibration signals from different points of washing machine's surface when it operates for a couple of minutes in centrifuge mode. The signal is normalized and transformed to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). An adequate example database is constructed from samples of different machine status. Our approach lends basic concepts contained in the algorithmic family of ID3 and C4.5. Certain parts of the algorithmic process contained in the above machine learning tools are used in order to construct a feature selection methodology based on information entropy criteria. The selected features are then used by specific classification techniques for achieving successful discrimination among different types of fault and normal operation. The overall methodology, using real data acquired within the European Community funded project called MEDEA, obtains a high rate of fault detection exceeding 87% of successful classification.

C	Weaver, C; Austin, T			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Weaver, C; Austin, T			A fault tolerant approach to microprocessor design	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2001)	JUL 01-04, 2001	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN	IEEE Comp Soc, TCFTC, IFIP Working Grp 10 4, Chalmers Univ Technol, LAAS CNRS, LASIGE Univ Lisboa, Carnegie Mellon Univ			SYSTEMS; BIST	We propose a fault-tolerant approach to reliable microprocessor design. Our approach, based on the use of an on-line checker component in the processor pipeline, provides significant resistance to core processor design errors and operational faults such as supply voltage noise and energetic particle strikes. We show through cycle-accurate simulation and timing analysis of a physical checker design that our approach preserves system performance while keeping area overheads and power demands low. Furthermore, analyses suggest that the checker is a fairly simple state machine that can be formally verified, scaled in performance, and reused. Further simulation analyses show virtually no performance impacts when our simple checker design is coupled with a high-performance microprocessor model. Timing analyses indicate that a fully synthesized unpipelined 4-wide checker component in 0.25um technology is capable of checking Alpha instructions at 288 MHz. Physical analyses also confirm that costs are quite modest; our prototype checker requires less than 6% the area and 1.5% the power of an Alpha 21264 processor in the some technology. Additional improvements to the checker component are described which allow for improved detection of design, fabrication and operational faults.

J	Ong, SK; An, N; Nee, AYC				Ong, SK; An, N; Nee, AYC			Web-based fault diagnostic and learning system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						expert systems; fault diagnosis; knowledge acquisition; multi-agent sysems		Web-based technology holds great potential for enabling the rapid dissemination of information and facilitating distributed decision-making. This paper presents a novel knowledge-based multi-agent system for remote fault diagnosis, which is composed of diagnostic and learning agents (DLAs), machine agents (MAs) and a central management agent (CMA). Machines are remotely diagnosed by the DLAs through the communication channels between the MAs and the DLAs. In addition, the DLAs can learn new expertise from the users, and the CMA can update the central knowledge base (CKB) shared by all the DLAs with the valuable expertise. When faults that cannot be solved with the present knowledge base occur, the DLA can acquire new knowledge, translate it into rules using a rule builder, and update the rules into the CKB. The CKB will become mature through a continuous learning process. A prototype system has been developed and used for remote fault diagnostics of tool wear in computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining.

J	Ray, LR; Townsend, JR; Ramasubramanian, A				Ray, LR; Townsend, JR; Ramasubramanian, A			Optimal filtering and Bayesian detection for friction-based diagnostics in machines	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						nonlinear estimation; friction diagnostics; nonlinear process modeling	TIRE FORCE ESTIMATION; IDENTIFICATION	Non-model-based diagnostic methods typically rely on measured signals that must be empirically related to process behavior or incipient faults. The difficulty in interpreting a signal that is indirectly related to the fundamental process behavior is significant. This paper presents an integrated non-model and model-based approach to detecting when process behavior varies from a proposed model. The method, which is based on nonlinear filtering combined with maximum likelihood hypothesis testing, is applicable to dynamic systems whose constitutive model is well known, and whose process inputs are poorly known. Here, the method is applied to friction estimation and diagnosis during motion control in a rotating machine. A nonlinear observer estimates friction torque in a machine from shaft angular position measurements and the known input voltage to the motor. The resulting friction torque estimate can be analyzed directly for statistical abnormalities, or it can be directly compared to friction torque outputs of an applicable friction process model in order to diagnose faults or model variations. Nonlinear estimation of friction torque provides a variable on which to apply diagnostic methods that is directly related to model variations or faults. The method is evaluated experimentally by its ability to detect normal load variations in a closed-loop controlled motor driven inertia with bearing friction and an artificially-induced external line contact. Results show an ability to detect statistically significant changes in friction characteristics induced by normal load variations over a wide range of underlying friction behaviors.

New features that are of multiple frequency resolutions are extracted by wavelet packet decomposition of the stator current. These features can then clearly differentiate the healthy and faulty conditions. Features with different frequency resolutions together with the slip speed of the induction motor ate used as the input sets for a neuro-fuzzy inference system. Two common electrical faults, the rotor bar breakage and the air gap eccentricity are considered. The system is validated on a 5 HP three-phase induction motor. Successful implementation of the proposed diagnostic system has been demonstrated.

J	Lee, JH; Yang, SH				Lee, JH; Yang, SH			Fault diagnosis and recovery for a CNC machine tool thermal error compensation system	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						thermal error compensation system; fault diagnosis; recovery; correlation coefficient; multiple linear regression model	NEURAL-NETWORK	The major role of temperature sensors in a machine tool thermal error compensation system is the improvement of machining accuracy through the supply of reliable temperature data on the machine structure. This paper presents a new method for the fault diagnosis of temperature sensors along with the recovery of faulty data, thereby protecting the reliability of a thermal error compensation system. The proposed method of detecting a fault and its location is based on the correlation coefficients among the temperature data produced by the sensors. Thereafter, a multiple linear regression model, prepared using the complete normal data, is used for the recovery of faulty data. The effectiveness of this method was tested by comparing computer simulation results with measured data from a CNC machining center.

Heat inputs that cause temperature elevation and gradients come from many sources internal and external to the machine tool and make thermal errors difficult to control without some form of compensation. Many thermal error modelling and compensation systems have been proposed which use neural networks, multi-regression analysis, heat modelling or probing techniques. However, each method suffers from one or more major drawbacks that limits its effectiveness when used in a practical machining environment. One feature of all the thermal error compensation techniques is their lack of flexibility that makes them difficult to apply to more than one machine type in a timely and cost-effective way. This paper describes a combined thermal and geometric error compensation system with a flexible structure that is general purpose in its application to any machine tool. The system can accept input from any number of temperature sensors. Information from the temperature sensors is acted upon by a novel programming language based model that estimates thermal movement and directs error components to a number of outputs for compensation by axis position modification. The entire compensation system can be applied either in a stand-alone computer that accepts a wide range of feedback signal types, or integrated into an open architecture machine controller. The system allows the management of temporary or permanent input failures and displays every thermal error component as an aid to fault diagnosis. Both position independent and position dependent thermal errors can be reduced through compensation. The system has been applied to several machine tools.

The total amount of sensors is reduced by exhausting the information derived from the sensors far beyond the scope of traditional engineering through the application of various features and high-dimensional decision-making. The feature selection plays a crucial role in modelling an early fault detection system. Due to presence of noisy features with outliers and correlations between features a correctly determined subset of features will distinctly improve the classification rate. In addition the requirements for the hardware to monitor the pump decrease therefore its price. Wrappers and filters, the two major approaches for feature selection described in literature [4] will be investigated and compared using real-world data.

The Technical Research Centre of La Poste has been studying how the manual checking of a mechanical part present in each of the 700 trolleys which compose the parcel sorting machine B+/Beumer could be replaced by an auto-test. If any problems are detected, the identification number of the defective fork trolleys are listed on the computer, with the characteristics of the problem. A chronological account of the events can be analysed too, in order to see if there is a shift from the normal maintenance characteristics or to see if there are recurrent problems on certain trolleys. In 2001, this system will be installed on the 5 parcel sorting machines of La Poste to increase the efficiency of equipment and productivity of maintenance staff.

Cutting is executed by an asynchronous 3-phase AC motor. The motor is controlled via PD feedback yielding disturbance rejection with simultaneous command matching, namely perfect output control. Two basic cutting irregularities in turning and milling operations are considered; progressive tool wear and chatter instability. The estimation is carried out in real time without requiring prediction or a priori knowledge of the toolpath and/or the workpiece materials properties. The estimation provides the appropriate basis for an anti-wear and chatter free strategy via adjustment of machining conditions and tool replacement. The real time characteristic of the method offers additional perspectives in CNC programming. Copyright (C) 2000 IFAC.

Many of these motors, which may be large as 25 MW, are used in critical duties in mining and oil production, where sudden failure of a machine can cause drastic results. The early detection of incipient motor failures increases mining equipment availability and safety. If a potential failure can be predicted, the drive can be removed from the service at a time which will minimise lost production and make the best use of maintenance facilities. Three kinds of fault have been identified as the main failures to be expected in induction motors used in mining industry. In order of size these faults are bearing, stator and rotor related. The remaining failures are scattered amongst a variety of effects. The electromagnetic interaction between the air-gap flux, produced by the stator winding, and the induced rotor currents results the rotor movement in an induction motor. Radial magnetic forces produced between the stator and rotor surfaces cause vibration in stator winding and core. The normal air-gap flux is altered by faults associated with stator and rotor windings. This means that stator core vibration, stray flux and motor current signal can be used for monitoring the condition of induction motors. After a synopsis of the main mechanic and electric faults of three-phase-squirrel cage induction motors this paper describes various methods to detect beginning failures using among other techniques the mechanical vibration, the magnetic stray flux and the motor current signature analysis.

J	Lin, J				Lin, J			Feature extraction of machine sound using wavelet and its application in fault diagnosis	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; wavelet; feature extraction	TRANSFORMS	Machine sound always carries information about the working of the machine. But in many cases, the sound has a very low SNR. To obtain correct information, the background noise has to be removed or the sound must be purified. A de-noising method is given in this paper and is successfully used in feature sound extraction. We can easily diagnose a machine using the purified sound. This de-noising method is based on the wavelet technique and uses the Morlet wavelet as the mother wavelet, because its time-frequency resolution can be adjusted to adapt to the signal to be analyzed. The method is used for extracting the sound of some vehicle engines with different types of failure. The feature sound is extracted successfully. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Often it would not be economically feasible to experience the number and range of actual failures that would be necessary to train a network to recognise all possible failure modes. In the particular case of faults in rolling element bearings, the situation is made somewhat easier in that envelope analysis reveals consistent patterns for different types of faults, which can be made almost independent of size, speed etc. This paper proposes a hybrid experimental/simulation way of generating feature vectors to train neural networks to cover a wider range of cases than the experiments on which the simulation is based. Feature vectors were formed from the dominant components of the envelope spectra of the individual fault types, normalised by the median value in the spectrum which represents the noise level. Simulated feature vectors were generated using a three times larger standard deviation than that measured in a range of experiments on a test rig, and neural networks trained on this basis. When a later attempt was made to test these networks on a number of case histories from a much wider range of machine sizes and speeds, it was found necessary to make logarithmic conversions to reduce the spread of the data. However, after retraining on this basis, it was found that the networks were able to correctly identify the fault type in almost every case.

The need for system fault localisation indicates demand for application of structural model based approach. Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) method might be used in such Structural Health Monitoring systems. OMA method permits to achieve modal parameters based on output only measurements performed during operation for actual excitation and boundary conditions and can be applied in case when application of controlled vibration excitation is unpractical, technically difficult or even impossible. The presented case study comprises 4 industrial examples of use of OMA method for diagnostic purpose in case of a big fan and a high power gearbox. These examples deal with: structural design and assembly validation, description of mutual forced influence of closely localised machines and decomposition of a polyharmonic vibration response signal into harmonic components.

Using the basic components of MATLAB SIMULINK toolboxes, the drive system is modeled. Induction motor with mechanical faults is modeled using Winding Function Method (WFM) and is integrated with the drive model using S-function. The influence of the harmonics produced by synchronous or asynchronous PWM converter on the induction motor stator current fault-related components is studied. The current waveform patterns for various modes of inverter device failures are investigated. It is shown that the stator current can be used for detection of the electrical faults in either the induction motor or the inverter.

Due to the destructive and rapidly propagating nature of insulation failure, it is critical to detect turn faults in an early stage to minimize the financial loss. The motor non-idealities such as the variation in the supply voltage unbalance, slip-dependent influence of inherent motor asymmetry, and measurement errors must be taken into account in order to reliably detect a turn fault in its incipient stage. Simulation and experimental results on a 5 hp induction machine are given to confirm the validity of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed turn fault detection scheme is simple and is capable of providing reliable fault detection that is immune to the motor non-idealities.

Experimental results are provided for an induction machine stator winding turn-fault detection scheme that uses a feed-forward NN to compensate for machine and instrumentation non-idealities, to illustrate the feasibility of the new training algorithm for real-time implementation.

Having recognised that a vibration level increases a growing fault, the plant engineer then has to localise the fault to a particular machine element. Wide band vibration measurements provide very little information to help pinpoint faults. Generally, a frequency spectrum is the key to diagnosis. In this article, the assembly function and her effects on the system conditions were emphasised. More than three hundred factory systems were treated with methods of technical diagnosis (vibration analysis). The main conclusion after all of these analysis shows that the main problem and possible fault machine systems were recognised as an assembly problem.

Now, after 18 months, data size exceeds 300 TB, and according to prognosis, it is a small fraction of the size of data coming in the next few months. In order to keep up with the data, significant effort was put into tuning the database system. It led to great performance improvements, as well as to inevitable system expansion 450 simultaneous processing nodes alone used for data reconstruction. It is believed, that further growth beyond 600 nodes will happen soon. In such an environment, many complex operations are executed simultaneously on hundreds of machines, putting a huge load on data servers and increasing network traffic. Introducing two CORBA servers halved startup time, and dramatically offloaded database servers: data servers as well as lock servers.
