The LDMR introduces a software compilation strategy that enforces error containment inside a basic block, allowing for a simplified error correction policy. This paper evaluates how the LDMR and its architectural components behave in the presence of permanent faults. It also classifies how sensitive the error detection and rollback machinery is to hard faults. By including permanent fault detection and diagnosis, the LDMR becomes a comprehensive fault tolerant architecture for embedded computing, covering a broad range of fault models. This paper also evaluates the LDMR's performance overhead using a MiBench subset, which is currently 1.54 in average.

The task of discriminating true chRNA from the false ones poses an interesting Machine Learning (ML) challenge. First of all, the sequencing data may contain false reads due to technical artefacts and during the analysis process, bioinformatics tools may generate false positives due to methodological biases. Thus predicting the real signal from the noise can be a hard task. Furthermore, even if we succeed to have a proper set of observations (enough sequencing data) about true chRNAs, chances are that the devised model can not be able to generalize beyond it. Like any other machine learning problem, the first big issue is finding the good data, observations, to build the prediction model. Unfortunately, as far as we were concerned, there is no common benchmark data available for chRNAs. And, the definition of a classification baseline is lacking in the related literature. In this work we are moving towards a benchmark data and a fair comparison analysis unraveling the role of ML techniques in finding chRNAs. We have developed a benchmark pipeline incorporating a mutated genome process and simulated RNA-seq data by Flux Simulator. These sequencing reads were aligned and annotated by CRAC. CRAC offers a new way to analyze the RNA-seq data by integrating genomic location and local coverage, allowing biological predictions in one step. The resulting data were used as a benchmark for our comparison analysis. We have observed that the no free lunch theorem do not hold for ensemble classifiers. Ensemble learning strategies demonstrated to be more robust to this classification problem, providing an average AUC performance of 95% (ACC=94%, Kappa=0.87%).

In this paper, Alpha-stable distribution was introduced for feature extraction from faulty bearing vibration signals.Such a non-Gaussian model can accurately describe statistical characteristic of bearing fault signals with impulsive behavior. After extracting feature vectors by Alpha stable distribution parameters, the weighted support vector machine (wSVM) was applied to automate the fault diagnosis procedure. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is a very powerful algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis and has much better performance.

The prognostic method allows to obtain data on otherwise costly to test failure mechanics, while also providing information on the component degradation physics and their performance alteration. Failure in a system is commonly considered to be dependent on the detected malfunctioning of one or more items, as per the standard FMECA approach. A system failure though may also be caused by the concurrent degradation of multiple items performances which brings the system performance below a critical level. The performance degradation of those items is insufficient to trigger an alarm, which leads to cases of system failures with all components nominally in a working state. By using the degradation data obtained by the new prognostic models this paper introduces an analysis (named CoDeF) alternative to the RBD (Reliability Block Diagram). This approach is potentially able to take into consideration this latter type of system failure in the determination of the system Ai.

Over the years, the use of learning machine and artificial intelligence techniques has transformed the process of diagnosing breast cancer. However, the accurate classification of breast cancer is still a medical challenge faced by researchers. Difficulties are routinely encountered in the search for sets of features that provide adequate distinctiveness required for classifying breast tissues into groups of normal and abnormal. Therefore, the aim of this study is to propose a system for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of breast abnormality using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models based on two dimensional wavelet transform. Three major approaches were taken in this study; preprocessing, wavelet decomposition analysis and neural network approaches. The first approach entails the preprocessing step for breast profile extraction, carried out by eliminating the low frequency components of the mammogram, leaving behind subbands containing high frequency coefficients, based on the idea that microcalcifications signify high frequency coefficients. The next approach involves features extraction derived from wavelet decomposition analysis. The final approach is referred to as the classification stage that utilizes back propagation neural network to distinguish abnormal tissue from normal ones. The proposed system was tested on the MIAS database, resulting in 91.64% succession rate of classification.

Locating Stator Winding Insulation Failure in Induction Machines Under Different Load Conditions	2015 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS OF DIELECTRIC MATERIALS			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 IEEE 11th International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials (ICPADM)	JUL 19-22, 2015	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	UNSW, IEEE DEIS, Cigre AUSTRALIA, ACPE, OMICRON, MACEYS'S ELECTRICAL		condition monitoring; induction motor; stator winding failure; finite element; insulation degradation	FAULT	This paper aims to investigate stator winding insulation failure (SWIF) in induction motors. The location of the SWIF is considered as a new factor that affects the diagnosis of the stator winding short circuit faults. In case of small rating IMs, removing the whole stator winding is done during maintenance program. However, this is not economical and reasonable for large rating induction motors whilst it is costly and time consuming. Thus, there is a need for an effective condition monitoring system that can detect the faulty section where SWIF is present. In this paper, finite element method is employed in order to model the SWIF in an accurate and inexpensive manner. This modelling technique considers all material properties, machine geometries, non-linear features of core materials, saturation and rotor bar skewing effects. Turn-to-turn and coil-to-coil short circuit faults have been modelled in different stator slots, precisely. Also, achieving a resolution of two turn-to-turn short circuit fault in any arbitrary slot indicates the advantage of the proposed modelling technique over previous methods. The orientation of current vector locus in q-d plane at steady state indicates the SWIF location. In order to improve the resolution and fault detection accuracy, an enhanced phase lock loop system is also employed. The simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic technique for location of turn-to-turn and coil-to-coil stator winding short circuits under different operating load conditions.

As high reliability is demanded, there is strong effort to keep continuous energy supply without any interruption caused by unplanned outages. Therefore monitoring systems and devices are involved to follow and describe the state of operated machinery and alert if unexpected situation occur. In case of electrical machines and transformers especially, the key part to monitor is the insulation subsystem of the machine. Various diagnostic parameters are to be monitored, e.g. loading, temperature, gas analysis, partial discharges activity, bushings condition, etc. The more parameters is obtained, the more precise may be the further actions. Of course for the most precise description of insulating system state it is necessary to include all available information. However the more parameters are monitored, the harder is to make a simple overview and future development prognosis and the more complex the matter gets. A simple, however widely applicable methodology of evaluation of these diagnostic parameters must be applied to perform simple description of operated object. The paper deals with the most important aspects of monitoring. The choice of diagnostic parameters and accessible points to measure is discussed. Further setting the criteria values and evaluation of diagnostic parameters with regards to material lifetime expectancy is described. As measured parameters are obtained, a simple methodology for evaluation with strong explanatory power is proposed. The field experience with such monitoring systems brings another trouble, which is false alarm alerts and the reliability of monitoring system itself, which is further discussed in the paper.

Inter-turn short-circuits is one of the most common fault occurring in induction machine. Healthy machine behavior and effects of such fault on the induction machine behavior are evaluated. This motivates the necessity of early fault detection. A high order sliding mode observer is developed and confirmed for different operating conditions. Detection method is based on calculating the difference between the actual behavior of induction machine and the expected behavior given by high order sliding mode observer. That produces a set of residuals sensitive to fault. Numerous simulations results are given to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.

The test vector omission procedure requires fault simulation for every test vector (or subsequence) that it considers for omission. It was noted earlier that it is possible to reduce the set of simulated faults based on the clock cycles where the faults are detected. However, this reduction is effective only for the later test vectors of a sequence. This paper defines a minimal set of faults that need to be simulated for the omission of a test vector by considering, in addition to detection clock cycles, also clock cycles where test subsequences start. The former are computed by a conventional sequential fault simulation process. For the latter, the paper introduces a sequential reverse order fault simulation process, and an approximation with a reduced computational complexity. Experimental results show significant reductions in the run time for test vector omission without affecting the level of compaction.

In order to manage the complexity of such an approach, an integrated system is partitioned into multiple modules where each module can be periodically tested, diagnosed and repaired if necessary. The limitation of on-chip memory and computing capability, coupled with the inherent uncertainty in diagnosis, causes the occurrence of misdiagnoses. To address this challenge, a novel incremental-learning algorithm, namely dynamic k-nearest-neighbor (DKNN), is developed to improve the accuracy of on-chip diagnosis. Different from the conventional KNN, DKNN employs online diagnosis data to update the learned classifier so that the classifier can keep evolving as new diagnosis data becomes available. Incorporating online diagnosis data enables tracking of the fault distribution and thus improves diagnostic accuracy. Experiments using various benchmark circuits (e.g., the cache controller from the OpenSPARC T2 processor design) demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy can be more than doubled.

This model is used during operation to detect anomalies due to attacks or design faults. Ensemble methods have been used to improve the overall detection accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models. Existing Boolean combination techniques either require an exponential number of combinations or sequential combinations that grow linearly with the number of iterations, which make them difficult to scale up and analyze. In this paper, we propose PBC (Pruning Boolean Combination), an efficient approach for selecting and combining anomaly detectors. PBC relies on two novel pruning techniques that we have developed to aggressively prune redundant and trivial detectors. Compared to existing work, PBC reduces significantly the number of detectors to combine, while keeping similar accuracy. We show the effectiveness of PBC when applying it to a large dataset.

The classifier agent employs concepts of Self-Organized Maps and Multiple Instance Learning. The motivation for this proposal was the need of a classifier for the processing of signals from partial discharges (PD) in electrical power systems. The monitoring of these signals allows building a database that can be a reference for the detection of failures in equipment and thus support predictive maintenance routines. The simplicity of calculations, which are based on the Manhattan distance (City Block metric), makes it very suitable for use in embedded systems, field-programmable-logic based systems (e.g. FPGAs) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Further improvements can be achieved with pipelining and parallelism techniques, leading to significant maximization of sample rates. The classifier can operate with multiple classes without requiring complex configurations. Other advantages include automatic fitting to the complexity of the problem, the ability to deal with input vectors with different characteristics (inheritance of multiple instance learning) and, depending on implementation, it may be easily upgraded to allow operation with new input patterns (other than those used in the initial training). To evaluate the proposal, we used a set of PD databases obtained by simulations and laboratory measurements. We performed comparisons with standard form classifiers based on Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines. The results show that the technique gives the same orders of accuracy and generalization of those classifiers, but with the advantages of low computational costs, self-scalability, dimensional independence and high potential for parallelization.

Our system architecture has many software layers and has a heterogeneous hardware, which cause problems with fault isolations and defining fault types and fault identities. There is a need to know which fault appeared where and also to know if the very same failure appeares in the same software. Another important aspect is to discover if the deployed systems for one operator got the correct versions of software updates/corrections whereas the same fault should have been fixed. One idea used in Ericsson is to start identify faults and categorize them to avoid duplicated troubleshooting and enforce correct software corrections into a radio network. This idea is now used in a trial and has been applied to a large number of crash reports with an automatic process to perform fault identification. The result so far is very promising as it will be leveraged by introduction of a more sophisticated fault identification based on machine learning combined with data mining.

The concept of asset condition monitoring and performance prediction along with optimizing maintenance operation is proposed by leveraging existing fleet-level PHM and Decision Support Tools (DST). Dynamic clustering methodology is adopted to equip the prediction model with the ability to adaptive update. And the impact of performance degradation to production loss is evaluated through risk assessment to link asset performance with production.

Lacking the corresponding features of failure historical data, similar abnormal events are insufficient to be used for identifying the root causes of faults. On the basis of a novel event-oriented process monitoring and backtracking (EOPMB) method and the clustering non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (CNSGA), this paper proposes a cloud diagnosis architecture for identifying failure causes by extracting relevant features of various faults from different machine tools. Results show that the proposed architecture can assist users in improving diagnosis performance.

Practically, prognostics can be quite complicated when there is absence of prior knowledge about these interactions. To optimize the availability and reliability of the system, it is required to embed a dependency model that implements component strength and the component's health status. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed in order to emphasize the importance of interactions between complex system's components in the RUL's calculating. The effectiveness of the approach is judged by applying it to numerical studies in order to estimate system's remaining useful life.

Anomaly detection techniques are used to model normal behavior of the machines and raise an alarm if any anomaly is observed. But traditional anomaly detection techniques do not identify type and severity of aberrance in terms of amplitude, pattern or both. Once the anomalous behavior is observed then fault detection techniques are applied to diagnose faults. For machine independent condition monitoring (MICM) a range of features transforms are needed for autonomous learning of the fault classifiers for different parameters to identify variety of fault types which requires huge amount of time. In this paper a novel complex anomaly plan (CAP) representation has been proposed with amplitude anomalies on real and pattern anomalies on imaginary axis. To plot amplitude and pattern anomalies in the CAP, normal state vibrations frequency features are used to train Gaussian models for each of the frequency. The dynamic location of the anomaly plotted in the CAP gives a measure of the intensity of the anomaly, where real and imaginary axis components help the fault classifier to make an appropriate selection of the transform and thus enhances the efficiency of MICM framework.

This paper proposes Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach for accurate RUL prediction of high speed milling cutters. Developed ANN model uses time and statistical features, selected through stepwise regression feature subset selection technique, as input. By doing this, the strong correlation model is achieved and the performance of cutting tool prognosis is enhanced. An examination is carried out in this work on functioning of distinctive models established with same data. Developed ANN model demonstrates improved performance over conventional Multi-Regression Model (MRM) and Radial Basis Functional Network (RBFN).

Criticality is an important concept in the maintenance task because it points out which piece of equipment has a higher probability to fail, and how this failure may impact the general productive process. The paper proposes a definition of criticality of equipment, based on an expert's experience and on historical data of seven asset management variables of a mining process. We propose a criticality semaphore and a method to classify the criticality of the next month and the subsequent month, based on the present values of the asset management variables. This is a preliminary work, however the results show a good prediction performance of criticality.

The non-linear analysis method is effectively applied to electroencephalogram signals to study the dynamics of the complex underlying behavior. Analyzing EEG signals with the aid of nonlinear dynamics takes the advantage of requiring much lower quantity of data. The objective of our research is to analyze the acquired EEG signals for non linearity by applying signal processing tools and use the non linear features for design of CAD system to classify epileptic seizures. To ensure the soundness of the proposed method and the suitability of the selected parameters, exhaustive statistical analysis of the descriptor components was performed. Highest classification accuracy of 98.4% was obtained with MLPNN classifier with high sensitivity and specificity followed by SVM and KNN classifiers. The promising performances observed are demonstrative of the efficiency and efficacy of systems developed for classification and prediction of normal and ictal conditions of epileptic patients.

Torsional vibration does lots harm to ship shaft system, brings a serious threat to the safe navigation of the ship. The method of power flow considers the amplitude and phase of force as well as response in the system, reveals the vibration transmission mechanism in the aspect of power, which overcomes the limitations of the traditional method. In this paper, we introduced the power flow theory and its energy and partial balance equations, proposed the power flow distribution calculation method of ship propulsion shafting torsional vibration based on the theory of power flow, and conducted the finite element analysis. From the perspective of theoretical analysis and finite element simulation, we studied the power flow distribution characteristics of typical shafting macro power distribution and micro power flow transfer, thus to provide methods and technical supports for the ship condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

However, model-based diagnostic methods, like non-linear gas path analysis (GPA) and genetic algorithms, need an accurate gas turbine model, and diagnostic methods without gas turbine model, like artificial neural networks, need a large number of experimental data. Both are difficult to gain. Support vector machine (SVM), a novel computational learning method with excellent performance, seems to be a good choice for gas path fault diagnostic of gas turbine without engine model. In this paper, SVM is employed to diagnose a deteriorated gas turbine. And the diagnostic result of SVM is compared to the result of artificial neural networks. The comparing result confirms that SVM has an obvious advantage over artificial neural networks method based on a small sample of data, and can be employed to gas path fault diagnostic of gas turbine. Additionally, SVM with radial basis kernel function is the best choice for gas turbine gas path fault diagnostic based on small sample.

The technologies for diagnosis and prognosis of PVP systems need to take the thermal effect into account and compensate it on sensing and monitoring of PVP structures. One of the extensively employed sensor technologies has been permanently installed piezoelectric wafer active sensor (PWAS) for in-situ continuous structural health monitoring (SHM). Using the transduction of ultrasonic elastic waves into voltage and vice versa, PWAS has been emerged as one of the major SHIM sensing technologies. However, the dynamic characteristics of PWAS need to be explored prior its installation for in-situ Electro-mechanical impedance spectroscopy (EMIS) method has been utilized as a dynamic descriptor of PWAS and as a high frequency local modal sensing technique by applying standing waves to indicate the response of the PWAS resonator by determining the resonance and anti-resonance frequencies. Another SHM technology utilizing PWAS is guided wave propagation (GWP) as a far-field transient sensing technique-by transducing the traveling guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) into substrate structure. The paper first presents EMIS method that qualifies and quantifies circular PWAS resonators under traction-free boundary condition and in an ambience with increasing temperature. The piezoelectric material degradation was investigated by introducing the temperature effects on the material parameters that are obtained from experimental observations as well as from related work in literature. GWP technique is also presented by inclusion of the thermal effects on the substrate material. The MATLAB GUI under the name of Wave Form Revealer (WFR) was adapted for prediction of the thermal effects on coupled guided waves and dynamic structural change in the substrate material at elevated temperature. The WFR software allows for the analysis of multimodal guided waves in the structure with affected material parameters in an ambience with elevated temperature.

An Interactive Learning Framework for Scalable Classification of Pathology Images	PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2015	Santa Clara, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Natl Sci Fdn, CCF, HUAWEI, Springer, ELSEVIER, CISCO, Intel		machine learning; interactive systems; biomedical image processing; pathology	QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; INFORMATICS	Recent advances in microscopy imaging and genomics have created an explosion of patient data in the pathology domain. Whole-slide images (WSIs) of tissues can now capture disease processes as they unfold in high resolution, recording the visual cues that have been the basis of pathologic diagnosis for over a century. Each WSI contains billions of pixels and up to a million or more microanatomic objects whose appearances hold important prognostic information. Computational image analysis enables the mining of massive WSI datasets to extract quantitative morphologic features describing the visual qualities of patient tissues. When combined with genomic and clinical variables, this quantitative information provides scientists and clinicians with insights into disease biology and patient outcomes. To facilitate interaction with this rich resource, we have developed a web-based machine-learning framework that enables users to rapidly build classifiers using an intuitive active learning process that minimizes data labeling effort. In this paper we describe the architecture and design of this system, and demonstrate its effectiveness through quantification of glioma brain tumors.

Therefore, a time and cost-effective qualification test for accurately predicting the long-term lifetime of an LED package is a critical economic and business requirement for adoption of new LEDs. Previous research usually applied offline photometric measurements to collect the direct performance degradation data of LEDs (e.g. luminous flux and chromaticity coordinates). However, these methods incurred measurement errors and significant testing costs. In this paper, an in-situ monitoring method with sensing the indirect performance data (e.g. lead temperatures, input driven current, and forward voltage) is proposed to detect the health of LEDs. In this proposed method, a data-driven method using a Mahalanobis distance (MD) approach is employed to detect early anomalies of LEDs before failures happen and transformed MD values are defined as a real-time health indicator to reflect the LED's degradation. The experimental results show that the proposed MD-based anomaly detection approach can provide an early anomaly warning at around 45% of lifetime before actual failure happens for all test LEDs evaluated.

However, to the authors knowledge, there are few published works that address complete and systematic methods describing the steps required to develop data-driven prognostics approaches for complex systems. This paper presents a generic component-based prognostics methodology that can be customized for different applications and which can be useful for new researchers and engineers. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part provides a description of the procedures required before constructing data-driven prognostics, such as identifying critical components, selecting physical parameters to monitor, choosing monitoring sensors and defining the data acquisition system. The second part presents a novel data-driven prognostic method for direct remaining useful life (KUL) prediction. This method relies on two phases: oftline and online. In the online phase, a method for constructing health indicators (HI) from sensor data is presented. Such HIs can be used as offline models to display the deterioration evolution of components over time. In the online phase, similar ills are constructed from the sensor data for a new component. Then, a discrete Bayesian filter is applied to estimate the current health status. Finally, the offline database is searched to find the closest group to the online Ills. The selected oftline ills can be used for estimating the RUL of the new component under operation. The performance of the method is demonstrated using two real data sets taken from the NASA Ames prognostics data repository.

Nevertheless, from an industrial point of view, even if this V&V procedure is successfully performed during the design and testing phase, it only considers data and knowledge available at the time the V&V procedure is carried out. However, it is possible that the systems evolve during operations causing a drift from the initial assumptions which could lead to a loss of performance, especially as the systems age. This paper aims at taking into consideration the total lifecycle of a PHM function, from the design and testing phase to the operation phase (after its entry into service).

However, prognosis approaches addressing degradation process including recoveries are rarely mentioned by the existing literature. In this paper, an approach is presented to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of systems with alternative degradations and recoveries, which are related to the switching state transitions during the system's operation process. To depict the stochastic characteristic of the operating process, a continuous-time Markovian model (CTMM) is constructed and incorporated into the RUL estimate procedure. After identifying the degradation, recovery models and the operating model based on the available historical information, RUL distribution is obtained through a Monte-Carlo simulation based algorithm. The proposed approach differs from other degradation modeling based methods in that the influence of recoveries on the degradation paths has been considered. At the end of the paper, a case study of the aging of Li-ion batteries has also been provided to illustrate and demonstrate the proposed approach.

At the same time, Human Machine Interaction (HMI) devices are used in many places of service and interaction by removing humans from the loop. Although these devices have advanced recently, they are still far away from replacing the human from the interaction loop. Their major problem is that they cannot reliably and efficiently respond to human requests; they mainly behave as "answer" machines. In response to this problem we propose a new HMI scheme, capable of offering a better communication and interaction to human users, based on SPN dialogue rather than answers to questions.

The concept of the instantaneous energy in time-frequency analysis, based on Hilbert time-frequency spectrum, was used to measure the energy distribution of the signal in time-frequency domain. The gear vibration signal is decomposed into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are band limited and the frequency families are separated effectively according to the signal characteristics with empirical mode decomposition. The fault feature of the gear vibration signal can be extracted effectively from Hilbert time-frequency spectrum which can represent the instantaneous frequency of the gear vibration signal with the change of the time. The analysis results from the experimental vibration signal show that HHT analysis can extract the character.

Firstly, vibration and rotational speed signals of gearbox are synchronously sampled with constant time increment, and then the vibration signal is resampled with constant angle increments of shaft angle, by which the non-stationary vibration in the time domain is converted into the stationary one in the angle domain. And then, the vibration signal is processed by using the angle synchronous averaging (RDA), thus, the components that have nothing relevance to the shaft rotational frequency are weaken. Finally, the narrowband demodulation technique is applied to the signal after RDA. In this way, vibration components whose periods are an integer multiples of the running speed can be easily identified. Experiment has demonstrated this analyzing method is valid.

However, vibration generated by incident faults of rolling bearings are weaker, non-stationary and nonlinear. Therefore, the interesting components extraction from the observed vibration is important for the whole process of diagnosing analysis. In order to improve the effectiveness of fault diagnosis of rolling bearings, this paper presents a diagnosis method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and spectral kurtosis. Firstly, the raw vibration signal is preprocessed by AR filtering. Secondly, the vibration is decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) through EMD. Thirdly, we can calculate factors called "Cross-correlation coefficient" which could reconstruct selected IMFs. Finally, we can calculate the cross-correlation coefficient and spectral kurtosis (SK) value for every IMF component.

It is necessary to identify the type of fault during early running stages of rotor for the selection of appropriate operator actions to prevent a more severe situation. In this situation, the Faults diagnosis method based on continuous HMM is proposed. Feature vectors of main FFT spectrum component are extracted from vibration signals and looked up as observation vectors of HMM. Several HMMs which substitute the types of faults in rotor system are modeled. Decision- making for faults classification is performed. The results of experiment are shown the proposed method is executable and effective.

According to the information entropy, the fluctuation entropy is defined to descript the vibration characteristics. Then the fluctuation entropy of hydraulic side of water injection pump was extracted as feature vectors. The extracting mechanism is analyzed and the corresponding extracting program is designed. The fault diagnosis model based on probability neutral network is constructed, and the basic frame is designed. The experimental results on hydraulic side of water injection pump have shown that the proposed approach is able to effectively extract important intrinsic information content of the test signals and increase the overall fault diagnostic accuracy, as compared to conventional BP methods. It has very good application prospect in the alarm processing system of machinery.

Recently it has been shown that the stromal elements of tumors hold prognostic as well as response-predictive information. This work proposes a multi-scale image analysis and machine learning pipeline for epithelial versus stromal tissue identification in images of H&E stained breast cancer specimens. Unlike many studies that perform pixel or block-based epithelium-stroma classification, this pipeline includes an explicit image segmentation module. We first partition the H&E stain images into coherent partitions/superpixels, then extract a number of regional color and texture features from these partitions, and finally use support vector machine classifiers to classify them into epithelium and stroma classes. We propose a multi-scale hierarchical fuzzy c-means (HFCM) approach for segmentation of the images. We also investigate multi-scale feature extraction and descriptors. Our experimental results on Stanford Tissue Microarray Database show that multi-scale regional feature descriptors outperform single-scale feature descriptors. Experimental results also show that when the same set of regional features are used, classification of HFCM-based partitions outperforms classification of both regular blocks and SLIC superpixels.

We design a computer model that comprises the entire process of central line insertion and maintenance. The model attempts to capture all major events in patient care from entrance to the hospital through the time at which the central line is ultimately removed. CLABSI data is analyzed to identify areas of potential increased risk of patient death from CLABSI. Specifically, we attempt to predict death among patients affected with CLABSI while minimizing Type II (false negative) error. By crafting the model to prioritize against this type of error, and thus identifying patients most likely to die, providers will have the best chance of intervening to reduce CLABSI-related deaths. The study led to implementation of reminders and protocols that result in a reduction of 18% of CLABSI over a period of 12 months. The predictive analysis identifies high-risk individuals to allow for proper intervention to prevent CLABSI-related deaths.

Predicting patient survival is critical to patient awareness and developing a proper treatment regimens. Previous prediction models built upon molecular feature analysis are limited to just gene expression data. In this study we investigate the difference in predicting five year survival between unimodal and multimodal analysis of RNA-seq data from gene, exon, junction, and isoform modalities. Our preliminary findings report higher predictive accuracy as measured by area under the ROC curve (AUC) for multimodal learning when compared to unimodal learning with both support vector machine (SVM) and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) methods. The results of this study justify further research on the use of multimodal RNA-seq data to predict survival for other cancer types using a larger sample size and additional machine learning methods.

By designing machine Y-connected windings with a secondary neutral point (NP), a voltage difference between two NP's appears once a turn fault occurs. Because this fault signal is induced by the voltage difference between two independent windings, only the turn fault reflected signal is resultant. It leads to an important improvement on the fault detection of standard electric machines since NP voltage difference is immune to the influence of saliency and saturation. In addition, the load and speed affect the signal level and frequency but not the diagnostic accuracy. It is possible to monitor a minor turn fault for the operation at zero and very low speed.

The Real-World Challenges and Opportunities of Distributed Generation	2015 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition	SEP 20-24, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Microgrid load management; support vector machine; power forecasting		Whilst distributed generation, particularly in the form of solar photovoltaics, is appearing as one of the key components of future power systems, it brings many challenges. Challenges such as intermittent generation supply, fault detection, anti-islanding operation and voltage control have received a great deal of research and practical attention. One practical challenge that hasn't been examined in detail is the ability of power system operating with a significant amount of distributed generation (and thus relatively less rotating inertia) to cope with sudden shifts in load. This paper presents the results of a practical investigation in to such an issue. One way of managing intermittent generation supply is to use output forecasting techniques, that give a forecast of generation availability at some future time, to ensure supply will be matched with likely future demand. We also present the results of an investigation in to the performance of one such solar output forecasting technique, based around the use of support vector machine approaches that take weather forecasts to provide detailed future generation forecasting.

Post-Demagnetization Characteristics of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines	2015 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 18-24, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Permanent magnet machines; demagnetization; fault detection; interior PM machines; surface PM machines	ECCENTRICITY; FAULTS; MOTORS	This work investigates post-demagnetization characteristics of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). A combination of closed-form analysis using a magnetic equivalent circuit model and finite element (FE) analysis is used to provide physical insights into the flux paths associated with demagnetizing electromotive force (MMF). Post demagnetization behavior in several types of PMSMs is studied to better understand post-fault PM machine performance and the key characteristics that can be used to monitor demagnetization faults. Topics include the key role of magnet flux leakage paths in interior PM machines for attenuating the negative impact of demagnetizing stator MMF, and the particular vulnerability of PM machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings to progressive accumulated degradation following exposure to multiple demagnetization events. FE analysis is used to build confidence in the demagnetization predictions of the developed model and to provide more insights that are difficult to obtain using the analytical model.

Thus this paper presents detection techniques for interturn short circuit in an axial-flux permanent magnet machine based on a combination of torque and current monitoring using finite element analysis and experimental validation. Using fast Fourier transform, fault features are extracted from the line current in steady-state. Furthermore, these features are tracked during startup transient through a decomposition of the analytical signal of the line current using the wavelet transform. Results obtained overcome the transient detection of interturn faults using current signature analysis.

Influence of Rotor Topologies and Cogging Torque Minimization Techniques on Axial-Flux Permanent Magnet Machine under Static Eccentricities	2015 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 18-24, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc			PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; LOSSES; MOTORS	In this paper, axial-flux permanent magnet machine is modelled to precisely imitate static eccentricities. From the model, the effect of the non-uniform airgap permeance which arises from static eccentricities on current harmonics and torque is experimentally studied. The influence of two cogging torque minimization techniques on both signatures, in the presence of static eccentricity is also examined and a comparison is made between the single-sided and double-sided rotor topologies. Static eccentricity incited significant increases in the amplitudes of space and sub-harmonics in the single sided topology. The double-sided topology, unlike the single sided topology, is found to be tolerant to the presence of static eccentricity due to opposing effect of the resulting asymmetrical properties of the airgap. Also, the cogging torque minimization techniques do not impair on the fault detection technique.

The faults are attributed to insulation degradation between adjacent coils in a phase and, they cause distortions in the magnetic fields, which affect the harmonic components in line currents. To analyze the harmonic components under the asymmetric magnetic fields in a faulty motor, a system matrix is developed. As a result, the third harmonic components in line currents are noticeably generated in comparison to other harmonics, and the fault can be detected by determining whether the third harmonics exist.

By superimposing a pulsating voltage on d-axis with respect to the rotor-referred synchronous frame, measurable winding fault reflected signals occur in the injection induced current ripples. Comparing to prior diagnostic techniques, the proposed injection method is immune to the rotor saliency because saliency reflected current harmonic is decoupled once the pulsating voltage is exactly injected on rotor d-axis. It results in the improved fault diagnostic performance on interior PM (IPM) machines as well as other salient machines. An IPM machine with three sets of turn-to-turn short is built to verify the proposed fault diagnostic method.

It is a way to reduce or eliminate the dependence on hydraulic, mechanical and the bleed air/pneumatic systems and pursue efficiency, reliability and maintainability. This paper presents a review of the main stress factors affecting the lifespan of insulation materials in aerospace applications. A special test bed is also proposed, to assess insulation lifespan modelling under various stress conditions, especially investigating the interaction between ageing factors. The test bed will allow to characterize insulation degradation under variable ambient and power supply parameters for simple models such as twisted pairs, up to coil form and complete machine operated at rated load. The proposed approach is based on the design of experiments (DOE). The results of the work that will be carried out will allow to identify the most influential factors affecting insulation lifetime and the interactions between them.

Influence of Voltage Excitation and Current Sensors on Monitoring of Stator Winding Insulation based on Transient Current Step Response	2015 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 18-24, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		AC machines; Fault detection; Insulation testing; Electric breakdown; Accelerated aging component		Stator insulation defects in traction drives machine windings can be analyzed by evaluating the current response after a voltage step excitation. The status of the stator insulation material regarding aging, is observed in a longer perspective. Because of the fact that insulation degradation of a stator winding system is a long developing process, a deviation of the parasitic electrical components (parasitic winding capacitances), can be monitored with the high frequency behavior of the transient current responses. Incipient stator insulation defects can be detected comparing the measured transient current response obtained when a drive was set into service with measurements taken during operation of the drive. Using the current sensors (transducers) already applied for the current control, no additional sensor hardware is necessary for the application of the method. The influence of voltage step shape and current transducer performance on the ability to detect parasitic insulation capacitance changes is investigated. Measurements are based on a silicon carbide voltage source inverter enabling high dv/dt rates up to 25kV/us and a 1.4 MW induction machine designed for traction application having preformed coils with fiber-insulation and winding taps.

If the irregularities are not identified in the early stage, the reliable operation of the machines are affected which may become catastrophic to the operation of the rotating machines. Therefore, this paper presents an online condition monitoring based fault detection of induction motor (IM). Characteristic features of motor current and vibration signals are analyzed in time domain as a fault diagnosis technique which is a key parameter to the fault threshold. Motor current and vibration signals are analyzed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Hilbert Transform (HT) to detect the severity of the fault and its possible location under different load conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed FFT and HT based analysis to predict the fault is verified using experimental data and its rate of success under different load conditions is also recorded. It is found that the HT can more precisely identify the fault using vibration signal as compared to the conventional FFT method. The magnitudes of the spectral components are extracted for the pattern reorganization of the fault. Spectrum analysis techniques are used under normal and bowed rotor condition to a 3-phase, 2 pole, 1/3 hp, 60 Hz, 2950 rpm IM drive.	[Uddin, M. Nasir; Rahman, Md.

In harsh operating environments, the power devices are subjected to various mechanical and electrical stresses, wear, and vibration that contribute to increased equipment failure rate, where a failed component can cause unexpected interruptions, serious safety issues, or easily account for millions of dollars in repair costs. Developing prognosis tools is vital for the reliability of these systems. This paper focuses on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of degraded power MOSFETs which are stressed by thermal cycling. The relative change in on-state resistance is identified as the fault signature. A multiple device ageing platform is designed and built to collect experimental data. An exponential degradation model that fits successfully with the experimental data is developed. The experimental data is processed with Kalman Filter, and RUL estimation with limited field data is demonstrated.

On Line Detection of Inverter Fed AC Machine Insulation Health State using High Frequency Voltage Excitation	2015 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 18-24, 2015	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		AC machines; Fault diagnosis; Insulation; Electric breakdown	SYSTEMS	Condition monitoring is gaining more and more importance in the past few years. As inverter fed operation puts additional stress on the machine's insulation system a breakdown of a drive system associated with costly outage of industrial processes or production plants is getting more likely. To enable a monitoring of the insulation system health state before an actual short circuit and breakdown occurs extensive test procedures are usually necessary that need both, additional equipment as well as disconnected drive. In order to enable a continuous monitoring a method is presented that enables the detection of changes in the machines insulation system during operation of the inverter. The method is based on a voltage excitation of the machine with a specific frequency range and measuring the corresponding current reaction. By observing changes at a specific frequency range, an insulation health indicator can be calculated that is able to detect deteriorations before an actual short circuit establishes. No additional sensors or measurement equipment is needed and the method can be implemented in modern inverter fed drives with minimum changes of configuration.	[Wolbank, Th.

Stator Current Signature Analysis for Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Wind Generators	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS (ICRERA)	International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)	NOV 22-25, 2015	Palermo, ITALY			component; Permanent magnet; Wind; Fault; Hilbert Huang; Diagnosis		Inter-turn short circuit faults are the most common stator winding faults in permanent magnet wind generators. Their early detection is vital to avoid subsequent damages which can led to catastrophic machine failures. To accomplish this task stator current signature analysis has been recently proposed for identifying inter-turn faults via a non-invasive, non-destructive and cost effective approach. Since no best stator current signature analysis approach is recognized as optimal, the paper takes in consideration the one able to offer the minimum severity degree which is Hilbert Huang Transform. To propose some improvements of the latter in stator current signature analysis, a real 60 kW-25 rpm permanent magnet wind generator is firstly designed via finite element based approach in FLUX (R) environment. Then SCSA in faulty conditions is performed via proprietary software highlighting how the introduced modifications could further enhance the signal processing algorithm performance.

Reliability knowledge of resources can be used in numerous ways by scientist of systems administrators: (1) it can be used to improve the quality of service of the machine; (2) to reduce performance loss due to unexpected failures either by reliability-aware scheduling or by reliability-aware checkpointing; (3) to design more resilient applications, programming models or machines in the future. This chapter focuses on offering an overview of failures observed in real large-scale systems and their characteristics, with an emphasis on modeling, detection, and prediction.

The simulation model is established based on finite element analysis (FEA) software in order to analyze PMSM's various operation performance parameters both normal condition and asymmetry condition caused by single-phase power voltage sag, and the experimental and simulation results show that the relationship between output torque and power voltage sag is linear, and the output torque fluctuation is raised with aggravation of power asymmetry level; it is take a long time to make the PMSM run in steady state; the current of fault phase is degraded, and the fluctuation is raised, and the third harmonic of the fault phase is raised so significant compared with normal condition that it can be as a feature for fault diagnosis; the flux linkage of three phases is no remarkable change and the flux linkage of the fault phase has a little more obvious change than the other two phase; the PMSM output torque contains harmonic components caused by negative sequence component, and these results of the paper can provide the basis for catching fault character and regaining healthy operation as fast as possible.

Comparison among different ways of training the system can provide useful conclusions about the behaviour of the different models in poor conditions. The goal of this paper is to establish a baseline for comparing the performance between different algorithms. A wide variety of research objectives throughout the literature makes it difficult to provide a feasible comparison between results. The evaluation is intended to provide detailed, empirical information on the effectiveness and impact of different model parameters on the performance of the different approaches. The pros and cons of the approaches used are discussed. In order to predict the quality of a plastic part, we extract a set of salient features that characterise an injection cycle and then match these features against a database of stored examples of predefined classes by using supervised classification. The database was created from 199 real plastic injections without any overlap between training and testing datasets.

Online condition monitoring systems are customized to each type of machine and need to be reconfigured when conditions change, which is costly and requires expert knowledge. Basic feature extraction methods limited to signal distribution functions and spectra are commonly used, making it difficult to automatically analyze and compare machine conditions. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to automate the condition monitoring process by continuously learning a dictionary of optimized shift-invariant feature vectors using a well-known sparse approximation method. We study how the feature vectors learned from a vibration signal evolve over time when a fault develops within a ball bearing of a rotating machine, We quantify the adaptation rate of learned features and find that this quantity changes significantly in the transitions between normal and faulty states of operation of the ball bearing.

WEAK SIGNAL DETECTION BASED ON TWO DIMENSIONAL STOCHASTIC RESONANCE	2015 23RD EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO)	European Signal Processing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	AUG 31-SEP 04, 2015	Nice, FRANCE	EURECOM		stochastic resonance; weak signal detection; non linear signal processing	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	The analysis of vibrations from rotating machines gives information about their faults. From the signal processing perspective a significant problem is the detection of weak signals embedded in strong noise. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a mechanism where noise is not suppressed but exploited to trigger the synchronization of a non-linear system and in its one-dimensional-form has been recently applied to vibration analysis. This paper focuses on the use of SR in a two-dimensional system of gradient type for detection of weak signals submerged in Gaussian noise. Comparing the traditional one-dimensional system and the two-dimensional used here, this paper shows that the latter can offer a more sensitive means of detection. An alternative metric is proposed to assess the output signal quality, requiring no a priori knowledge of the signal to be detected, and it is shown to offer similar results to the more conventional signal-to-noise ratio.

This method provides efficient and reliable fault detection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The traditional PCA technique is modified to enable multivariate modelling using the machine's phase voltages, excitation current and shaft voltage. Hotelling's statistic and the model residuals are used to detect incipient faults on the machine and avoid false alarms. The presented method is tested and validated using an experimental system.

Influence of Fast Inverter Switching based on SiC Semi-conductors on Online Insulation Monitoring of High Power Traction Machines	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	MAR 17-19, 2015	Seville, SPAIN	IEEE		AC machines; fault diagnosis; insulation; electric breakdown; current sensors; switching converters		In modern drive applications fed by voltage source inverters, monitoring systems are of advantage to reduce the maintenance costs and prevent outages. The proposed insulation monitoring method detects stator insulation defects by evaluating the current's transient response after step excitation by the inverter. Due to fast switching of the voltage source inverter at high output voltage dv/dt rates, increased stress appears on the insulation and leads to deterioration. Prior an actual breakdown occurs, the machine's high-frequency behavior is altered and a change in the transient part in the current response following a step excitation can be used to indicate insulation degradation. The paper presents experimental results of a 1.4 MW induction machine, fed by SiC semiconductor inverter technology. Additionally, variations of the inverter output voltage switching rate were implemented and the effect on the monitoring method is analyzed.	[Zoeller, C.; Ertl, H.; Wolbank, Th.

The electromagnetic aspect is based on the analytical calculation of the Maxwell pressure in the air-gap. An existing mechanical approach is improved to compute natural frequencies of the machine taking into account its different parts. A better agreement has been obtained between analytical results and those issued from a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) applied to two different stator structures. The dynamic displacement signal of the stator is finally estimated in the space-time domain. Different operating modes of the machine can be simulated by changing some model parameters. In this paper, the rotor eccentricity fault is investigated and detected by the analysis of the vibration signal. Therefore, the proposed multiphysical model could provide healthy and faulty characteristics and could be suitably used for fault detection and diagnosis tasks.

PEMFC are promising source of renewable energy that can operate on low temperature and have the advantages of high power density and low pollutant emissions. However, PEMFC technology is still in the developing phase, and its large-scale industrial deployment requires increasing the life span of fuel cells and decreasing their exploitation costs. In this context, Prognostics and Health Management of fuel cells is an emerging field, which aims at identifying degradation at early stages and estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for life cycle management. Indeed, due to prognostics capability, the accurate estimates of RUL enables safe operation of the equipment and timely decisions to prolong its life span. This paper contributes data-driven prognostics of PEMFC by an ensemble of constraint based Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine (SW-ELM) algorithm to improve accuracy and robustness of longterm prognostics. The SW-ELM is used for ensemble modeling due to its enhanced applicability for real applications as compared to conventional data-driven algorithms. The proposed prognostics model is validated on run-to-failure data of PEMFC stack, which had the life span of 1750 hours. The results confirm capability of the prognostics model to achieve accurate RUL estimates.

Comparison of different wavelet families for broken bar detection in induction motors	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	MAR 17-19, 2015	Seville, SPAIN	IEEE			DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORM; FAULTS	In previous research works dealing with induction motor rotor assessment it has been shown that, when broken rotor bars exist, the analysis of the stator start-up current using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) leads to clearly recognizable patterns associated with the failure. This is valid for different operating conditions (loaded and unloaded machine, periodical fluctuation in the supply voltage, pulsating load torques.) and for distinct start-up modalities (direct start-up, star-delta start-up, soft-starter-operated motors). However, this fault-related pattern can significantly vary or even may not appear depending on the wavelet family used for the analysis. This paper discusses about some fundamental mathematical properties of wavelet families and how these properties influence the appearance of the characteristic pattern caused by failure. For this purpose, Daubechies, Meyer and Symlet families are considered in the work, since they have provided the most satisfactory results regarding the pattern detection.

Nevertheless, even induction machines are prone to faults. Among them, the faults related to the breakage of rotor bars have received special attention by the research community with a number of methods proposed both for the case of steady state as well as for transient operation. For the latter, methods relying on the analysis of the start-up transient have proven to be able to effectively isolate the faulty component that is created by the asymmetry caused by the bar breakage. However, very little work has been done concerning the soft starting of induction machines. In this work, preliminary results of the application of a symbolic time series technique for the analysis of the transient, when the motor is controlled by a soft starter, will be presented and experimentally evaluated.

Due to complicated operation conditions, it is necessary to derive and implement the prognostics with uncertain situations. In this paper, a Bayesian filtering approach based on the adaptive learning for the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is presented for the SOH estimation of system under uncertain conditions. Instead of assuming the certain state space model for the degradation trend directly, the distribution of the degradation process is investigated to learn from the inputs based on available measurements. In order to capture the time-varying degradation behavior, the proposed method represents the statistical property of the degradation process through distribution learning with the GPR model. By exploiting the distribution information of degradation process, the particle filter can be implemented to predict the SOH of system. Experiments and comparison analysis are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

So it is very important for the recognition of bearing faults. Aiming at identifying the common faults of bearing, for the problem about isolated points or noises mixed in vibration signal, in this paper, a classification model is proposed, which is based on the affinity fuzzy support vector machine. And compared with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), the introduced model of fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) works better.

In this regard, this paper presents an extensive study of the degradation mechanism of NMC/Graphite cells based on the study of both incremental capacity (IC) and differential voltage (DV) curves. Moreover, based on the obtained IC curves, a linear relationship was identified between capacity and IC peak intensity for both calendar and cycling ageing.

The method is generic in that it analyzes control loops individually based on their signal triplets of set-point, measurement, and control output. The model of normal operation is a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for a two-dimensional feature vector identified at regular intervals, e.g., once per day for a two-week period. When a process disturbance occurs, the relevant control loops are chosen based on their poor correspondence to the normal operating model. Data for hundreds of control loops can be reduced to data for 10-30 relevant loops, thus focussing the analysis significantly. The efficiency of GMM modeling methods is discussed. The method is demonstrated with real-life paper production data involving hundreds of control loops.

The methods developed here are directed to trawling archival data records to reconstruct a sufficiently informative experiment in lieu of dedicated testing. The central novel observation is the modification to subspace system identification methods to permit their application to multiple concatenated, but non-contiguous data sets, which jointly can be sufficiently rich for identification while individual records are not. This is a break from traditional system identification, where one uses a single contiguous synchronous input-output record.

Our objective is to predict the degradation trends by studying their effects on the engine measurable parameters, such as the temperature, at critical points of the gas turbine engine. The first prognostic scheme is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. This architecture enables ONE to learn the engine degradations from the available measurable data: The second prognostic scheme is based on a nonlinear auto-regressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network architecture. It is shown that this network can be trained with fewer data points and the prediction errors are lower as compared to the RNN architecture. To manage prognostic and prediction uncertainties upper and lower threshold bounds are defined and obtained. Various scenarios and case studies are presented to illustrate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed neural network-based prognostic approaches. To evaluate and compare the prediction results between our two proposed neural network schemes, a metric known as the normalized Akaike information criterion (NAIC) is utilized. A smaller NAIC shows a better, a more accurate and a more effective prediction outcome. The NAIC values are obtained for each case and the networks are compared relatively with one another.

The vibration signals measured from rotating machinery are usually non-stationary and nonlinear. Especially, the useful fault characteristics are too weak to be identified at the early stage. In order to solve the problem, a novel method called improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) with second generation wavelet for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is proposed. According to the local characteristics of vibration signal and selecting the proper criterion of minimizing the squared error, an optimal predicting operator is constructed for a transforming sample, so that the second generation wavelet basis function is able to fit the local characteristics of the vibration signal. Using the self-adaptive second generation wavelet as the pre-filter to improve EMD decomposition results, EMD is further improved to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of the decomposition results. The proposed method is applied to analyze the rub-impact rotor experimental setup, and the results show that the proposed method is accurate and efficient, and is expected to be applied in engineering practice effectively.

What's more, the machining accuracy can be effectively ensured. Unfortunately, the early fault signal of rolling bearing is extremely weak, which can be easily covered by others. And the endpoint effect will appear in several Intrinsic Mode functions (IMFs) when it is decomposed by Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), which make it difficult to find the fault position accurately. To get the real components, the minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) method is proposed here to obtain the effective impact components with an inverse filter, which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The MED method which can effectively extract the useful information of the rolling bearing's fault signal, and fully suppress the endpoint effect of Empirical Mode decomposition (EMD), as well as greatly improve the ability to precisely find the fault position, which has been confirmed by a lot of experiments, which has a great practical value in the practical production.

This method is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimension reduction. However, the incomplete classification will lead to great influence on performance evaluation accuracy. Based on this, another feature extraction strategy by Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) is proposed. LPP should be seen as an alternative unsupervised approach to Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This method properly obtains a local space that best detects the essential manifold structure. In this paper, the fault diagnosis can be recognized via the Global and Local Preserving based Semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (semi-supervised Global LSSVM). The experiment takes a typical Sallen-key low-pass circuit as diagnosis object. In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper, the traditional fault diagnosis method based on standard support vector machine (SVM) is employed also. The diagnosis speed and accuracy are all proved via numerical simulation.

This location method requires the installation of a grounding resistance in the secondary winding of the excitation transformer. First, the third-harmonic reference voltage is obtained by the voltage measurements in the excitation system. Then, the third-harmonic voltage at the grounding resistor is compared to the reference voltage. The ground fault is detected when the phase angle between those voltages is under the trip setting value. This new algorithm has been tested in a 5 kVA Synchronous generator with satisfactory results.

Investigation of Sampling Frequency and Jitter Effects on Transient Current Signal Evaluation for Insulation Condition Monitoring	2015 17TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS (EPE'15 ECCE-EUROPE)	European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	17th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE ECCE-Europe)	SEP 08-10, 2015	Geneva, SWITZERLAND			Induction motors; Degradation; Fault detection; Condition monitoring; Pulse inverters; Sampling methods	SEPARATION; BEHAVIOR	The proposed online monitoring method detects insulation defects in a machine by evaluating the current response after a certain voltage step excitation is applied. The transient current response is analyzed to determine the status of an electrical machine insulation regarding aging, in a longer perspective. If insulation degradation occurs the parasitic winding components (e.g. winding capacitances) have changed and as a consequence the high frequency characteristic. A deviation in the frequency components can be interpreted as insulation deterioration of the insulation state. This work includes a strategy to improve the performance of the monitoring method with limited hardware and software resources (e.g. quite low sampling frequency of ADC units, usage of standard current sensors only). Different test scenarios conducted on a 1.4MW induction machine have been made to prove the applicability.	[Zoeller, C.; Wolbank, T.

Although various indicators have been proposed for detection of this fault in low-voltage induction machines, no comparison has been studied and there is no guide to industrial applications towards advanced health monitoring systems where failure prognosis is installed besides diagnosis. This paper sumarizes and analyzes various indicators for stator winding inter-turn fault detection in induction machines to fill up this gap. Since induction machines are complex multi-physics systems, the primary focus will be on fault indicators regarding physical model-based and signal-based methods. The survey compares different indicators, proposes suitable indicators and some recommendations for further work.

Early detection and diagnosis of faults that may occur are desirable to ensure that operational effectiveness of an induction motor can be improved. In this paper, faults detection and classification using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) are presented. A series of simulations using the models of three phase cage induction motor is performed in different fault conditions, such as static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity and broken rotor bars. Designed models were implemented with the help of finite element method to provide data that makes it possible to diagnose presence of any type of faults, as well as to analyze obtained and calculated results. Models were designed on the basis of characteristics and parameters of real motor. The results are illustrated in the form of graphs and tables that make visible illustration for effectiveness of the used diagnosis method.

DC components and trend terms can't be avoided in acceleration signal and it will be magnified during integration, causing distortion of the displacement waveform acquired. To eliminate the influence of the trend term, the method of high-pass frequency domain filtering, polynomial curve fitting and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are tried in this paper to deal with the experimental data collected from our rotor-bearing-casing coupled vibration experiment system. EMD shows its significant effect extracting the trend of displacement data integrated from the acceleration.

It can not only improve the safety and reliability of vehicles, but also reduce the cost of preventive maintenance. Fault diagnosis and isolation methods of rail train suspension system will he discussed in this paper, using the SIMPACK and MATLAB co-simulation environment, the experiment platform of fault simulation was built and used to generate data for fault diagnosis. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network (FMMNN) were applied to the issue of fault isolation. The simulation results demonstrated that both of them could achieve fairly good accuracy and the method of SVM could obtain a higher one than FMMNN. Besides, the approach proposed in this paper provides a new solution for fault isolation application of suspension system.

Secondly, parameters in the model are obtained in virtue of the maximum likelihood estimation method, and then the lifetime is prognosed. Finally, an example is given to verify its effectiveness and reliability.

In order to achieve concurrent fault diaposis for rotating machinery, an integrated method using artificial immune algorithm and evidence theory is proposed in this research work. The self-nonself recognition mechanism of artificial immune system for data analysis and processing has been derived from the negative selection algorithm. Five kinds of dimensionless immune detectors are generated based on negative selection algorithm, then the local diagnosis result of dimensionless immune detector is gotten. Combining with evidence theory fusion rules, the final diagnosis can be obtained. Experimental result demonstrates that the method can realize effectively concurrent fault diagnosis for rotating machinery.

Firstly, MFICA is used to abstract rapid information which belongs to non-Gaussian hatch process. Secondly, the faults are sorted by FFRLSSVM rapidly. Owning to the forgetting factor application, history data are forgotten which reduce the complexity of computational. Experiment shows, compared with conventional single fault diagnosis methods, the accuracy and the adoption of MFICA-FFRLSSVM algorithm is higher.

They serve to detect the state characteristic parameters over rotating machinery using multi-sensor. A fusion centre (FC) is operating to collect the raw observations data from the multi sensor in the network and make the final decisions over the information fusion. The optimal weights of the proposed multi-sensor feature information sensing methods are the multiple eigenvectors of the signal sample autocorrelation matrix or the maximum eigenvector. The proposed algorithms demand no a prior knowledge of the noise power and the mechanical signal. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the proposed methods are robust against the noise power uncertainty and require less sensing data to yield the same performance, compared with the conventional feature extraction methods.

Firstly multiple fault-features were extracted by the genetic programming. Each fault feature was separately used to act as evidence and the initial diagnosis accuracy was regarded as the weight coefficient of the evidence. Then through the negative selection algorithm, the diagnosis ability of the local diagnosis was advanced and an impersonal means of obtaining basic probability assignment was given. Finally the fusion result was obtained by utilizing the weighted evidence theory into the decision-making information fusion for the preliminary result. By comparing the diagnosis results with other artificial intelligence algorithm, experiment result indicates that using multiple weighted evidences fusion can improve the diagnostic accuracy of compound fault.

In order to identify aircraft engine lubrication system abnormal state, a method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) is presented in this paper. Firstly, a fault monitoring model is established by using PCA based on the engine normal samples in order to not only monitor the running condition of the aircraft engine, but also extract fault features. Then, a classifier is built by using SVM based on the score vectors selected as fault feature vectors which is used to identify the engine fault once a fault occurs. The performance of fault diagnosis is tested by the lubrication system of an aircraft engine. The experimental results show that PCA and SVM fault diagnosis method can effectively identify the engine fault and has a good application value.

However, natural language in maintenance data is a big challenge for fault diagnosis due to its irregular feature and uncertainty semantics. Some researchers have introduced text mining methods to deal with this problem, but they lose sight of the real meaning of the topics and some prior knowledge related to these topics which are important to efficient feature extraction. In this paper, we put forward prior Latent Dirichlet Allocation (prior LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based fault diagnosis. Firstly, Term Frequency & Inverse Topic Frequency (TFITF) method is proposed to extract prior knowledge around fault symptom, which then is integrated into basic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to build prior LDA model. Next, we extract feature for classifiers with the prior LDA model from maintenance records. Thirdly, we give hierarchical classification model based on SVM and feature fusion method which are used for fault diagnosis. Finally, F-measure method is introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed model with real data from high speed railway system in Guangzhou Railway Corporation. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms text mining method which reckons without prior knowledge and other common methods of fault diagnosis.

Expert system provides a new and effective way for the tribology researchers to solve and overcome the difficulties of recognition technology. This paper proposes a new multi-structure complex decision tree to solve diagnostic testing of diesel engine wear causes. This method combines the decision tree and the thought of the nearest, using the information of the wear surface and abrasive grains during the process of component wear, which acquired by experiment, qualitatively analysing the correspondence between the various typical abrasive wear conditions and the information of produced abrasive grains, to achieve the correct identification cause of the failure of machine wear. Experimental results show that the proposed method is highly accurate of the applied knowledge which acquired from instances, the extracted knowledge rules can accurately find fault factors caused by abrasion state, the method is simple and efficient, and reliable conclusions, without the need of a strong knowledge.

Data driven methods of fault detection give the chance to monitor the plant state purely based on gathered measurements. However, they especially nonlinear, still suffer from a lack of efficient and effective learning methods. In this paper we propose the two stages learning algorithm for designing the kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) model parameters in two cases: with access to data reflecting the faulty states of the plant and without such data. The method is explained on simple testing example and verified in the case study showing the efficiency of detecting the leakages in drinking water distribution systems.

Time and time-frequency-domain methods were applied to extract fault related features from current and voltage measurements. The resulting features were transformed to enhance class separability using either Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Optimal Transformation. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction was performed employing a modified Fisher-ratio. Fault detection was carried out using a Support-Vector-Machine classifier trained with randomly selected data subsets. Results showed, that not only the used feature sets (time-domain/time-frequency-domain) are crucial for fault detection and classification, but also feature pre-processing. PCA transformed time-domain features allow fault detection and classification without misclassification, relying on current and voltage measurements making two sensors necessary to generate the data. Optimal transformed time-frequency-domain features allow a misclassification free result as well, but as they are calculated from current measurements only, a dedicated voltage sensor is not necessary. Using those features is a promising alternative even for detecting purely supply voltage related faults.

Cutting accuracy significantly affects the quality of the product and because there are many different causes of errors, their identification requires a sound knowledge and experience of the service staff. The authors observed that the sources of errors can be characterized by a probability density function (pdf) of these errors. Therefore, they proposed a diagnostic method based on classification of sources of disturbances via the analysis of pdf calculated by a kernel density estimator. The multilayer perceptron is proposed as a classifier. Classification procedure is discussed with emphasis on generalization properties of the classifier. The application for data acquired from a real industrial process is presented.

Vibration signals acquisition of 13 kinds of running states are achieved on the 4-73 No.8D centrifugal fan test bench. The wavelet packet energy feature vector of each vibration signal is rapidly extracted through the wavelet packet denoising, decomposition and reconstruction. The vibration signal wavelet packet energy feature vector of the five measuring points in the same instantaneous running state are fused into the fan fault feature vector. Finally, the fault diagnosis of the fan is achieved by using improved SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier, and the accuracy rate is 94.6%. A new fan fault feature vector is put forward, which is the integration of the vibration signal sample entropy of the five measuring points in the same instantaneous running state, and then the fault diagnosis of the fan is achieved by using improved BP (Back Propagation) neural network, and the accuracy rate is 99.23%. The diagnostic results show that these two methods are able to effectively diagnose the category, severity and site of the fan mechanical failures, suitable for online diagnosis.

Thus in the area of electric drives manufacturing the rejection rate is required to be reduced by early fault detection. This can be achieved by measuring the rotor excitation field created by permanent magnets prior to the assembly of rotor and stator. In this Paper an apparatus for fully automated inspection of both internal and external rotors within a wide range of dimensions is presented. This is done with the aid of a one dimensional Hall-Sensor line array, which is manufactured with high accuracy and the use of an open source CNC system. The presented device is capable for in-line operation at the end of the rotor assembly process chain to detect possible magnetization and assembly faults prior to the final assembly of the electric drive by visualization of the rotor excitation field.

Vibration signal analysis is a well-known and widely used diagnostic approach for bearing fault identification, and usually leads to good results in terms of effectiveness and detection capability. However, small defects, at an early stage of development, can be hard to find and require advanced signal processing techniques to facilitate the extraction of the fault characteristic frequencies from the noisy vibration signals. This work compares three different techniques applied to vibration signals to facilitate the extraction of the fault frequency components, namely the Teager-Kaiser operator, discrete wavelet transform and the Hilbert transform. A test bench was built and several types of defects were introduced in the motor bearings to compare vibration signals obtained with a healthy and a faulty motor. Comparative graphs of the results obtained with the three techniques are presented and the results are discussed.	[Goncalves, Mario J. M.; Marques, Emanuel G.; Cruz, Sergio M.

Open slots introduce harmonics in the magnetomotive force distribution over the air gap, resulting in additional losses and parasitic torques. In order to reduce these effects, wedges of magnetic material are used. These wedges are prone to apartial or total detachment, which in turn may result in other failures. In this paper a strategy to detect faults in magnetic wedges is presented. This strategy consists of the injection of a zero sequence voltage signal of high frequency. The resulting currents are highly dependent on the magnetic irregularities both the rotor and stator and thus sensitive to asymmetries produced by faults in the wedges. In this way, it is possible to detect and quantify wedges faults without the need to disassemble or remove the IM from the production line. The proposed strategy is applicable offline and required only disconnect the motor of the power supply. Laboratory experimental results are presented to validate the proposal.

Effect of the Short-Term Temperature Changes on Diagnostic Indicator In Online Insulation Monitoring by Parametric Identification	2015 IEEE 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE)	Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	24th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	JUN 03-05, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro, Fed Univ Mato Grosso do Sul, State Univ Rio de Janeiro		Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; insulation; parameter estimation; sensitivity analysis	STATOR	Electrical generators of offshore wind or tidal current turbines are exposed to harsh marine and operating conditions. Predictive maintenance is therefore a key issue for the competitiveness of these energy generation systems. Generally speaking, the predictive maintenance is based on the monitoring of a Diagnostic Indicator (DI): the interpretation of its value or drift is used for the optimal planning of the corrective maintenance. In this work, we present briefly our new online monitoring technique of electrical machine winding insulation. This model-based approach consists in monitoring the drift of a DI built from the in-situ estimation of high-frequency electrical model parameters. The involved model structures are derived from the RLC network modeling of the winding insulation, with more or less lumped parameters. In the second part of the work, we investigate the effects of temperature changes on the estimated parameters of diagnostic models. A 1.5 kW low power wound stator is exposed to different temperature levels, from 30 degrees C to 160 degrees C, and for each temperature a series of experimental acquisitions is realized. Identification results show that resistance and inductance of a simple HF model structure are almost independent of temperature changes, while insulation capacitance increases with temperature increases: at 160 degrees C it is 8% higher than its initial value at room temperature.

Specifically, it proposes to process the stator currents using Hilbert-Huang transform. This approach is composed of two steps. First, the empirical mode decomposition is used in order to estimate the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), then the Hilbert transform is employed to compute the instantaneous amplitude (IA) and instantaneous frequency (IF). The energy of the instantaneous amplitude of the IMFs is used as fault indicator. The proposed approach is used for bearing fault detection in induction machine at several fault degrees. The effectiveness of the proposed Hilbert-Huang Transform technique is verified by a series of experimental tests corresponding to different bearing fault conditions.

Constraints imposed to such systems need to be thoroughly checked in order to ensure a proper service delivery to the client. The current paper proposes a monitoring solution for large-scale distributed systems relying on abstract state machines. Data gathered from the monitoring components are used in calculating metrics and establishing a diagnosis for the system. Emphasis is put on failure detection and on ensuring non-functional requirements of the system such as fault-tolerance and resilience. The model introduced in this paper will be integrated in a cloud-enabled large-scale distributed system. The novelty of the solution consists of finding the best integration architecture for state-of-the-art algorithms and tools and refining them to an efficient version for large-scale distributed systems.

In reactive maintenance damage is corrected after it has occurred. On the other hand, predictive maintenance anticipates the damage in the future. Predictive maintenance can be periodic with fixed time intervals or predictive with forecasted failure times. Maintenance planning is intelligent when maintenance needs are predicted and optimised. Intelligent maintenance systems require data collection, data transfer, data storage, data processing and Decision Support Systems to be in place. Machine learning algorithms in forecasting and optimisation can take increasing quantity of collected data into consideration in intelligent maintenance planning. Two types of forecasting models-time-series and causal methods can be used for intelligent maintenance planning. Optimisation algorithms can be divided into local and population search methods. Hybrid methods combining more than one algorithm have been used efficiently for maintenance planning. Maintenance planning is important in the transport sector and various models and methods have been applied both in road and vehicle maintenance. In practice, it is important to have accurate deterioration and cost models in place. In research, both data-driven and mathematical models have been applied, but data-driven methods are becoming more practical as computation is increasingly more feasible.

For that, a Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) technique has been introduced in the IM fault diagnosis world. MUSIC has the highest frequency resolution among all FFT-based methods, non parametric and parametric methods. Despite its effectiveness in improving the freqency resolution, MUSIC is computationally too complex to implement in real time and it takes a long computation time to find more frequencies by increasing the order of the frequency signal dimension. To address this problem, a zoom MUSIC algorithm (ZMUSIC) that combined the zoom technique and the MUSIC algorithm was proposed. We present the results obtained for real data to verify the proposed method for monitoring of Wound Rotor Induction Machine.

Therefore, the condition monitoring of the induction motors have been a challenging topic for many electrical machine researchers. Indeed, the effectiveness of the fault diagnosis and prognosis techniques depends very much on the quality of the fault features selection. However, in induction-motor drives, rotor defects are the most complex in terms of detection since they interact with the supply frequency within a restricted band around this frequency, especially in the low load case. To overcome this drawback, an efficient and new method to diagnose the induction-motor rotor fault based on the association of the Time Synchronous Averaging technique and Discrete Wavelet Transform is presented. However, there are different types of the wavelet function that can be used for signal decomposition. This paper intends to investigate the ability of different types of wavelet functions for early rotor fault detection. Experimental results are presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The obtained results indicate that the reliability of the fault detection depends on the type of wavelet function applied for decomposition of the signal.

The increase in the gold price has motivated the industry search for alternative to the gold wire used in wire bonding and the transition to copper wire bonding technology. Potential advantages of transition to Cu-Al wire bond system includes low cost of copper wire, lower thermal resistivity, lower electrical resistivity, higher deformation strength, damage during ultrasonic squeeze, and stability compared to gold wire. However, the transition to the copper wire brings along some trade-offs including poor corrosion resistance, narrow process window, higher hardness, and potential for cratering. Formation of excessive Cu-Al intermetallics may increase electrical resistance and reduce the mechanical bonding strength. Current state-of-art for studying the Cu-Al system focuses on accumulation of statistically significant number of failures under accelerated testing. In this paper, a new approach has been developed to identify the occurrence of impending apparently-random defect fall-outs and pre-mature failures observed in the Cu-Al wirebond system. The use of inteimetallic thickness, composition and corrosion as a leading indicator of failure for assessment of remaining useful life for Cu-al wirebond interconnects has been studied under exposure to high temperature and temperature humidity. Damage in wire bonds has been studied using x-ray Micro-CT. Microstructure evolution was studied under isothermal aging conditions of 150 degrees C, 175 degrees C, and 200 degrees C till failure. Activation energy was calculated using growth rate of intermetallic at different temperatures. Effect of temperature and humidity on Cu-Al wirebond system was studied using Parr Bomb technique at different elevated temperature and humidity conditions (110 degrees C/ 100%RH, 120 degrees C/ 100%RH, 130 degrees C/100%RH) and failure mechanism was developed. The present methodology uses evolution of the IMC thickness, composition in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to identify accrued damage in wire bond subjected to thermal aging. The proposed method can be used for quick assessment of Cu-Al parts to ensure manufactured part consistency through sampling.

Prospective treatments for slowing down or pausing the process of AD require identification of the disease at an early stage. Many patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may eventually develop AD. In this study, we evaluate the significance of using longitudinal data for efficiently predicting MCI-to-AD conversion a few years ahead of clinical diagnosis. The use of longitudinal data is generally restricted due to missing feature readings. We implement five different techniques to compute missing feature values of neuropsychological predictors of AD. We use two different summary measures to represent the artificially completed longitudinal features. In a comparison with other recent techniques, our work presents an improved accuracy of 71.16 % in predicting pre-clinical AD. These results prove feasibility of building AD staging and prognostic systems using longitudinal data despite the presence of missing values.

Recent advances in machine learning have helped to improve classification and prognosis rates. We present here a classification framework for Alzheimer's disease which extracts triangulated surface meshes from segmented binary maps in MRI, and establishes reliable point-to-point correspondences among a population of hippocampus 3D surfaces using their spectral representation. Morphological changes between groups are detected using a manifold learning algorithm based on Grassmannian kernels in order to assess similarity between shape topology in control normals and patients. A second manifold using discriminant embeddings is then generated to maximize the class separability between three clinical groups recognized in dementia. We test the method to classify 47 subjects with Alzheimers Disease (AD), 47 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 47 healthy controls enrolled in a clinical study. Classification rates compare favorably to standard classification methods based on SVM and traditional manifold learning methods evaluated on the same database.

During the welding process, substandard solders are caused by some random failure factors. In this paper, in order to evaluate the quality of solders a secondary evaluation method was put forward based on electrode displacement signals. Firstly, characteristic parameters of singularity signals were extracted by analyzing the electrode displacement signal of normal state and fault state welding. Then, on-line diagnosis of fault state appearing in the welding process was achieved based on a first-class SVM (support vector machine) recognition model for singular solder joints. Secondly, characteristic parameters as the representation of singularity joints' quality were extracted from the electrode displacement signal of fault state welding. Then, a second-class SVM model of solder joints quality evaluation was established based on shear strength and indentation depth of solder joints. Further, the quality of singular solder joint was identified. Its verifying results shows that the accuracy rate of the evaluation model come up to 97.1429 %.

To exploit value, one must focus on extracting knowledge from these Big Data sources. To extract knowledge and value from unstructured text we propose using a Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification process called Semantic HMC that uses ontologies to describe the predictive model including the label hierarchy and the classification rules. To not overload the user, this process automatically learns the ontology-described label hierarchy from a very large set of text documents. This paper aims to present a maintenance process of the ontology-described label hierarchy relations with regards to a stream of unstructured text documents in the context of Big Data that incrementally updates the label hierarchy.

The concept of relative rule is put forward and the method for finding absolute reduction decision rule through combining rules of relative decisional requirement sets is given in this paper. Using this concept, the relative discernibility matrix between decision classes can be created to decide the relative decision requirements which are conjoined to find the decision requirements of all the decision classes. The relative decision requirements are extracted by creating relative discernibility matrix, so that scales of computing can be cut down substantially and saving storage space.

Previous research either talks about luminous maintenance or color shift, because luminous flux degradation usually takes very long time to observe. In this paper, the impact of a VOC (volatile organic compound) contaminated luminous flux and color stability are examined. As a result, both luminous degradation and color shift had been recorded in a short time. Test samples are white, phosphor-converted, high-power LED packages. Absolute radiant flux is measured with integrating sphere system to calculate the luminous flux. Luminous flux degradation and color shift distance were plotted versus aging time to show the degradation pattern. A prognostic health management (PHM) method based on the state variables and state estimator have been proposed in this paper. In this PHM framework, unscented kalman filter (UKF) was deployed as the carrier of all states. During the estimation process, third order dynamic transfer function was used to implement the PHM framework. Both of the luminous flux and color shift distance have been used as the state variable with the same PHM framework to exam the robustness of the method. Predicted remaining useful life is calculated at every measurement point to compare with the tested remaining useful life. The result shows that state estimator can be used as the method for the PHM of LED degradation with respect to both luminous flux and color shift distance. The prediction of remaining useful life of LED package, made by the states estimator and data driven approach, falls in the acceptable error-bounds (20%) after a short training of the estimator.

As a improved support vector machine (SVM) method, Twin support vector machine (TWSVM) is a powerful tool for supervised learning, which are successfully applied to classification and regression problems. This paper proposes an effective fault diagnosis method for roller bearings based on EEMD and TWSVM. First, the vibration signals collected from the roller bearings are decomposed using EEMD and intrinsic mode functions (IMF) are produced. Second, the sample entropy of the most IMFs are calculated as the feature of initial signal. At last, these features, as training and recognition samples, are fed into TWSVM to identify the bearing fault conditions. The experiment results show that the proposed method can accurately recognize the bearing normal, inner race, outer race and ball fault under small samples.

The construction of the pond started in 1998 and has a surface of 93 ha with an exterior contour pier with 2 m height, inside which is built a priming pier. This pond is known as follow up of January 2000 accident where within the pier of the pond a breach was created thru which were overflowed approx. 100 000 m3 of material. The impact of this accident was aggravated by the presence of cyanide and the media ampleness. The construction of this pond continue after the accident, till 2006 when the activity was interrupted for different reasons, lately, related preponderant to local administration. Till now, in terms of construction the pond is inactive but he continues to be very reactive chemically due to the presence of sulfurs and the fact that rain water has a lower pH that industrial water utilized to transport the construction material of the pond. Researches were oriented towards studying the reactivity material from the pond, cyanide behavior and evolution. Sulfurs became reactive generating acid pH and heavy metal content. The current mining company built a wastewater treatment plant of accumulated water in the pond, treating them constantly, with significant costs. With regard of cyanide content, it decreased constantly, being situated - currently - close to water drinking limits. Cyanide concentration were exceeded 250 mg/l in December 2005 (when the last deposits were made on the pond) reaching 0.228 mg/l total cyanide in 2014. This fact confirms the capacity of cyanide degradation in a tailing pond. "Aurul" tailing pond has a particularity compared to similar others: there were deposited approx. 5.5 million tons of material, reactive chemically thru the presence of sulfurs and the construction activity was stopped for more than 8 years, period of time in which the evolution of chemistry evolved significantly. This particularity attracted our research interest and it is the object of a case study, especially that the pond has such a big contact surface with exterior environment, stimulating his reactivity. One of the work hypothesis regarding the pond's reactivity is based on the balance sheet of accumulated wastewater in the pond that are above the imposed safety limit regarding the foreshore that are evacuated and treated. The treated water quantity allows the estimation of heavy metals, sulfurs, etc. from the sludge which represents indices of the pond's reactivity. Another hypothesis is based on mineralogical and chemical determination of material samples from different sampling points of the pond: canopy, beach and slope. We consider finding some unconventional solutions for the pond's reactivity diminishing (besides calk or lime tampons) thru the utilizing of cellulosic nanofibers obtain in the laboratories of Oulu University of Finland. The behavior of these fibers is already the object of research to mine wastewater treatment in the CELMIN international partnership. The research steps are following to highlight the environmental impact of this pond in his actual condition and the necessity to finalize its construction in order to find optimal rehabilitation solutions.

A robust fault diagnosis algorithm is presented to detect suspected saturation type of nonlinearity associated with a power amplifier. A five degree-of-freedom AMB system consisting of four opposing pair of radial magnets and a pair of axial magnets is considered. In this paper failure of an industrial grade AMB system is investigated using Sinusoidal Input Describing Function (SIDF) method. SIDF predicts the gain and frequency at which failure occurs. It is demonstrated that the predicted frequency is in agreement with the frequency at which failure occurs.

In this paper, feed-forward ANN input-layer-weights have been used for the adaptive selection of the least number of features, without fault model information, reducing the computations significantly but assuring the required accuracy by mitigating the noise. In the proposed approach, under the assumption that presented features should be translation invariant, ANN uses entire set of spectral features from raw input vibration signal for training. Dominant features are then selected using input-layer-weights relative to a threshold value vector. Different instances of ANN are then trained and tested to calculate F1_score with the reduced dominant features at different SNRs for each threshold value. Trained ANN with best average classification accuracy among all ANN instances gives us required number of dominant features.

It is not easy to detective and recognize faults of transaxle with traditional diagnostic methods as "Listening, Observation and Touch", because it has complex inner structures, especially number of meshing gears. In order to find fault components and distinguish failure types, analyzing the vibration signal of the transaxle. In the present paper, vibration signals of a certain type head-feed combine harvester transaxle are extracted by SENDIG S956Y vibration analyzer; fault shaft (frequency is 6.34Hz) and meshing gears (quefrency is 3.9ms) of the transaxle are located by cepstrum and the zoom amplitude spectrum and failure types of fault shaft and meshing gears are diagnosed out based on the exclusive characteristics of vibration signal of different faults in rotating machine. The results show that cepstrum and the zoom amplitude spectrum approaches that are proposed in the paper are successfully to ascertain the combine harvester transaxle fault.

A real-time simulation model of an electric vehicle is used to study the behavior of available sensor signals and control commands, with specific measured quantities, during vehicle operation. Those quantities could be, but are not limited to, mean values of the phase currents, DC bus current, and traction motor speed (if available), in addition to control command quantities. Those quantities carry information of offsets and disturbances that could occur under faulty operating conditions compared to nominal operation. They are thus observed and studied under nominal conditions and then when a fault is injected. Finally a methodology is developed using these observations based on simple combinational logic to diagnose a fault occurring at any time during a vehicle drive cycle. The proposed method is presented and validated by real-time simulations to capture four different power electronics faults injected at different drive cycle times. Results show that the proposed method is able to diagnose different faults irrespective of when would they occur. The method can be extended to diagnose electric machine, sensor, and transmission faults.

Fingerprint search for source-side duplicate detection is resource intensive when the backup service for VMs is co-located with other cloud services. This paper presents the design and analysis of a fast VM-centric backup service with a tradeoff for a competitive deduplication efficiency while using small computing resources, suitable for running on a converged cloud architecture that cohosts many other services. The design consideration includes VM-centric file system block management for the increased VM snapshot availability. This paper describes an evaluation of this VM-centric scheme to assess its deduplication efficiency, resource usage, and fault tolerance.

By applying suitable online condition monitoring accompanied with signal processing techniques, machines irregularity can be detected at early stage. Therefore, this paper presents an online unbalanced rotor fault detection of an induction motor (ENT). Characteristic features of motor current and vibration signals are analyzed in time domain as a fault diagnosis technique which is a key parameter to the fault threshold. Motor current and vibration signal analyses are also done based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Transform (HT) and Envelope Detection (ED) with low pass filter method to detect the severity of the fault and its possible location under different load conditions. The effectiveness of the electrical and mechanical fault detections based on FFT, HT and ED analyses are verified using the captured experimental data while the motor is running under different load conditions. The magnitudes of the spectral components are extracted for the pattern reorganization of the fault. Techniques are used under normal and unbalanced rotor conditions to a 3-phase, 2 pole, 0.246 KW, 60 Hz, 2950 rpm MT drive.	[Rahman, Mizanur; Uddin, M.

The fuel cells show multiple advantages compared to conventional energy sources. They need only hydrogen and air during operation, meanwhile, produce only water which is 100% environmental friendly. However, PEMFCs are vulnerable to the impurities of hydrogen or fluctuation of operational condition etc., which can lead to the degradation of output performance over time when operating. The prediction of the performance degradation is quite important for the PEMFC system management. In this work, a novel prediction method based on a modified Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is proposed, followed by a comparison with classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach. Firstly, the mathematical theory of RVM is explained, then the implementation of RVM using the experimental aging data sets of PEMFC stack output voltage is discussed. By considering the specific feature of aging data prediction problem, an innovative modified RVM formulation is proposed. The results from proposed RVM method are analyzed and compared with the results getting from SVM. The results have demonstrated that, the RVM can achieve better performance than the SVM, especially in the cases with relatively small initial experimental data sets. This novel method based on modified RVM approach has been demonstrated to be a good candidate to predict the degradation of output performance of PEMFCs,	[Wu, Yiming; Breaz, Elena; Gao, Fei; Miraoui, Abdellatif] Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, IRTES SET, F-90010 Belfort, France		Wu, YM (corresponding author), Univ Technol Belfort Montbeliard, IRTES SET, F-90010 Belfort, France.

By leveraging the binding and scheduling flexibility of high-level synthesis, we detect errors through diverse binding and minimize area cost through intelligent checkpoint scheduling and modulo-3 reducer sharing. We evaluated our technique with 12 high-level synthesis benchmarks using FPGA emulated netlist-level error injection. We observe coverages of 99.13% for stuck-at faults, 99.46% for soft errors, and 99.67% for timing errors with a 25.7% area cost and negligible performance impact. Leveraging error detection latencies on the order of 10 cycles (3 orders of magnitude faster than end result check) for soft errors, we also explore a rollback recovery method with an additional area cost of 28.0%, observing a 175x increase in reliability against soft errors.

The paper considers two approaches to Preventive Maintenance (PM) interval optimization, shows their advantages and disadvantages, and proposes improvements to both: 1. Traditional approach based on reliability distribution characteristics of the entire population of items (systems), 2. Innovative approach, a Prognostic Health Management (PHM) using the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of each individual item. For the traditional approach, a unique universal algorithm of "random search" is proposed. The main advantage of this algorithm is its versatility. In contrast to the classical optimization algorithms this methodology does not require complex analytical formulas. As a result, one gets an ability to analyze all possible experimental data types: exact failure times, interval data, suspended times, grouped data, etc. Optimal selection of Inspection/Replacement Interval value then can be made using parameters found as a result of data analysis. The optimization is demonstrated for a loss function of a special type of asymmetry of losses due to premature and late replacement, non-linearity of the Target Function, etc. As for an innovative PHM-based approach, an advanced Prognostic Methodology and unique Model have been developed. This Model implements Critical Zone Recognition (instead of classical Regression method) to verify whether Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a particular (individual) item exceeds a predefined critical value. Reaching this critical value serves as a trigger for item's PM performance.

In this context, reliability analysis and efficient maintenance decision-making are strongly required. Reliability analysis needs collecting, modeling and analysis different types of measure especially for deteriorating systems. In presence of information data on system deterioration level or health indicator, the development of an accurate mathematical model describing the system behavior is indispensable. Stochastic processes are suitable tools to model the system behavior by taking into account its dynamic evolution and the possible influencing random phenomenon. The stochastic processes are largely used in reliability modeling and prognostics e.g. Markov chains, birth processes, counting processes, Gamma processes, and Wiener processes. In the case of gradually deteriorating systems, mainly Gamma and Wiener processes are considered to model the evolution of the deterioration in time respectively for monotonically deteriorating systems [1] and for non-monotone phenomenon [2]. A more general framework that encompasses these latter models is the diffusion process. In this framework the process is defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation which means that each infinitesimal increment of degradation is described by the sum of drift and a random perturbation. Sudden events and relatively large fluctuations that may appear in real data variation can also be represented by allowing the stochastic process to include "jumps factors". One important type of stochastic process that has the ability to describe the general behavior of data evolution as well as the particular large fluctuations is the jump-diffusion process. In this paper, based on a case study related to real collected data, the aim is to predict as precise as possible the failure time presented by the first crossing time of a given failure threshold by the deterioration level. In this purpose, a jump-diffusion process is used to model the data evolution and predict the future behavior of the system under consideration. The given dataset consists in several independent non-monotone trajectories considered as the deterioration trajectories of different items. The variance behavior is found to be similar for the different independent trajectories. According to the variance behavior a division of the time domain into three different states is proposed. The transition between these states is supposed to be controlled by an explanatory variable, called covariate, following a Markov chain. At each state, data evolution is considered to follow the jump-diffusion process with Log-Uniform Jump Amplitude (log-normal distributed increments with jumps). The data fitting and parameters estimations are detailed in the rest of this paper. Eventually, the resulting model is used in forecasting and risk prediction. Giving an estimation of the future evolution of system within a certain confidence interval, this model permits to schedule the maintenance actions.

The prognostic method extracts a series of health indices (HIs) with on-line monitoring parameters to conduct indirect RUL prediction. As a result, in-orbit cycle life estimation for satellite can be achieved. The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is applied, in which an optimized AutoRegressive (AR) model is integrated to improve the longterm predicting performance. Consequently, this method constitutes a probabilistic prognostic framework with uncertainty management capability using a heterogeneous mixture distribution fusion, which provides a more comprehensive criterion for decision makers in scientific maintenance. The actual satellite lithium-ion battery data is used to evaluate and verify the proposed approach, and the experimental results prove its effectiveness.

The methodology is based on the exploitation of historical data for knowledge extraction and representation in the form of relevant patterns. Since the technique used is non statistical, none of the usual statistical assumptions, such as the independency of failure modes, are necessary. The idea of the proposed methodology is to merge the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) approach with a set of non-parametric cause-specific survival functions. The former reflects the effect of the condition monitoring data of each failure mode, which is collected from the monitored equipment, on its failure time. The latter provides estimate of the marginal probability of each failure mode in the presence of the other competing failure modes. The results obtained show that the proposed methodology is capable of describing accurately the state of each individual equipment based on the collected condition monitoring data, and to use this information in order to provide accurate prognostics.

In other words, by clustering products into fleets based on categories of interest (e.g. subsets of assets belonging to the same customer or installed in the same region or operating for the same industrial application) the fleet-specific usage and degradation profiles can be extracted by statistically analyzing the operational, monitoring and failure data of the assets belonging to the selected fleets. In this paper we describe the process of extracting reliability knowledge (in terms of usage and degradation profiles) at the single product level and at the fleet level. The extracted knowledge is then exploited to determine the remaining useful life of a unit in the fleet. In this context, a simple but an effective data-driven prognostic algorithm is proposed. The algorithm makes use of the knowledge extracted at a fleet level to enhance its forecasting capabilities.

However, sometimes in the actual application, there is only one product and it is successively used in different stress conditions, like different tests, different service environment and so on. As the stresses' type and amount are different in these conditions, the product's degradation process is complex and the data size is small in each condition, so it is hard to utilize them for reliability extrapolation with the previously modeling and evaluation method. To solve the problems above, firstly, the general log-linear model is introduced to take into the consideration of the relationship between different stress conditions and their effects on the degradation process, in which the stress variables and various conditions are all described as parameters in an entirety model. Secondly, to understand the relationship and to estimate the reliability accurately, Bayesian approach is introduced to fuse this complex and high dimensional model into the reliability extrapolation and integrate all available information to infer unknown parameters. Then, with the obtained parameters, the accumulated effects from different conditions are quantified, and the reliability of the product can be estimated or predicted. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by one example and relevant simulation analysis.

Specifically, the design of residual generation is then formulated as to solve a convex optimization problem by combining ideas from the over-parameterization and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs), and thus provides residual signals directly from process data. To solve the multiply-outputs (MOs) problem, a modified approach is proposed by means of the socalled mixed block Hankel matrices. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a parity space are established and proved. A benchmark example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

To complicate matters, Li-ion batteries can experience different degradation trajectories that depend on storage and cycling history of the application environment. Rates of degradation are controlled by factors such as temperature history, electrochemical operating window, and charge/discharge rate. We present a generalized battery life prognostic model framework for battery systems design and control. The model framework consists of trial functions that are statistically regressed to Li-ion cell life datasets wherein the cells have been aged under different levels of stress. Degradation mechanisms and rate laws dependent on temperature, storage, and cycling condition are regressed to the data, with multiple model hypotheses evaluated and the best model down-selected based on statistics. The resulting life prognostic model, implemented in state variable form, is extensible to arbitrary real-world scenarios. The model is applicable in real-time control algorithms to maximize battery life and performance. We discuss efforts to reduce lifetime prediction error and accommodate its inevitable impact in controller design.

These stress conditions accumulate damages to the electronic system, adversely affecting its components and interconnects including solder joints. Solder joint degradation can cause system malfunctioning, which eventually results in catastrophic failures. In order to prevent system failures, it is required to manage the system health continuously by monitoring damages such as solder joint degradation. Regardless of stress conditions, solder joints often start to degrade from their surface where high speed signals in an electric circuit are concentrated due to the phenomenon referred to as the skin effect. Thus, high speed signals such as digital signals can serve as a sensitive means of detecting solder joint degradation at early stages. This paper presents a diagnosing method of assessing solder joint reliability based on digital signal characterization. Accelerated life tests are conducted to generate solder joint failure. The test setup consists of a circuit board with solder joints, a digital signal transceiver, an environmental test chamber and a stress application fixture. Constant mechanical shear stress is applied to the solder joints of a circuit board at an elevated temperature. A digital signal transceiver generates high speed signals travelling through the solder joints, and continuously monitors the signal characteristics which indicate signal integrity. The test results confirm that the signal characteristics show statistically significant variations between intact and cracked state of the solder joint, and the parameter variations indicate the deterioration of the signal integrity. These results suggest that digital communication signals can be used as a non-destructive diagnostic tool of physical degradation. It can be improved as a tool which provides early warning of impending system failures without installing additional fault sensing instruments. This diagnostic approach may serve as a proactive prognostic module that allows for real-time health management of electronic products and systems.

There is a need to explore new human-machine interface strategies stemming from the proliferation over the past years of accidents due to system complexity, failure modes and human errors. Concepts of autonomy establish the foundational elements of the work. We pursue a rigorous systems engineering process to analyze and design the tools and techniques for automated vehicle health monitoring, human-automation interface and conflict resolution enabled by innovative methods from game theory and reasoning algorithms. The general structure is illustrated in the paper. This paper addresses the general interface framework while emphasizing the human's (pilots) intended actions following an adverse event on-board the vehicle, i.e. critical component fault/failure modes. When combined with automated health state assessment means on-board the aircraft, the proposed strategy assists to improve the reliability of estimated actions the pilot must execute to mitigate possible catastrophic consequences. A "smart" knowledge base is exploited as the reasoning paradigm where cases are stored and new ones are compared with similar ones available in the case library. Learning and adaptation tools are used to improve the decision making process. The emphasis of this contribution is on methods and tools for conflict resolution when the automated system's advisories are coincident with the human's intended actions. Appropriate similarity metrics are defined and used for this purpose. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated via an interface built in MATLAB highlighting the performance of the algorithmic modules for assessment and conflict resolution.

Battery Health Degradation and Optimal Life Management	2015 IEEE AUTOTESTCON	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	51st Annual IEEE AUTOTESTCON Conference	NOV 02-05, 2015	National Harbor, MD	IEEE, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc		battery health degradation; optimal life management; battery capacity modeling; capacity fade; time to charge; state of charge	PROGNOSTICS	In this paper, we discuss the battery health degradation and optimal battery life management. As the first contribution of the paper, we discuss how battery health degradation manifests itself as the battery capacity fading due to repeated charging and discharging cycles. We present two models, namely, LAR-alpha beta gamma and CVD (control variable-dependent) regression models, for battery capacity fade modeling, which are characterized as functions of the number of cycles and two charge control parameters, viz., maximum terminal voltage of the battery and maximum charge current. The development of these models is based on curve-fitting of data from copious aging experiments performed on Samsung GS4 batteries. These models are compared to a bi-exponential capacity model and the superiority of the proposed capacity models over the bi-exponential capacity model is demonstrated using the experimental data. The CVD battery capacity fade model is integral to a battery life management scheme, which is the second contribution of this paper. The battery life management scheme consists of a two-level strategy which provides fast charging, while minimizing long term health degradation effects. At level-I, the CVD battery capacity fade model is used for developing an optimal charging parameter selection method, which provides the best control variables, viz., the maximum terminal voltage and the maximum charge current to achieve a pre-specified desired " useful cycle life", while attaining the fastest possible time-to-charge (TTC). The selection of the best control variables utilizes information about the present condition of the battery, such as the number of cycles that the battery has been exposed to, the normalized capacity of the battery, and the battery resistance at the present cycle. Practically, estimates of the required parameters may be obtained by a battery fuel gauge. At level-II, the maximum terminal voltage and the maximum charge current calculated at level-I are used as limiting conditions for the optimal charging strategy. The proposed optimal charging parameter selection method is illustrated via numerical results.	[Ahdollahi, A.; Raghunathan, N.; Han, X.; Pattipati, B.; Balasingam, B.; Pattipati, K.

The need to detect the end of life for these batteries has increased in the recent past due to a large manufacturing variation between suppliers and storing practices. It has become a challenge to explore the ways to access the health of these batteries in field due to the difficulty in measuring the internal state variables of the battery and also due to its inaccessibility. Failures of batteries in the field not only result in inconvenience and reduced availability of the wireless sensor, but also risk catastrophic consequences due to the unavailability of sensors to detect the anomaly. As a result, the current research work focuses on evaluating the battery end of life through a laboratory testing that could reproduce the field environment. Using the measured state variables an attempt is made to predict the battery health before it is introduced to the field. The research also entails developing a bulk capacitance system that can act as secondary charge storage to help increase the primary battery life during peak current draw. Using a tree based classifier a prediction methodology is developed considering both the battery and bulk capacitance parameters to estimate the overall battery health or end of life.

These faults are even more significant for medical wireless sensor networks, which simply cannot afford such inconsistencies. To combat this issue, various fault detection mechanisms have been developed. We tried enhancing the performance of one such mechanism, and our findings are presented in this paper. Using machine learning algorithms, we will show through our experiments on real medical datasets that our approach gives more accurate results than other existing fault detection mechanisms. This research will be critical in detecting sensor faults quickly, accurately and with a low false alarm ratio. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Proper FDCA enhance the machine's operational life, efficiency and reducing catastrophic failure. This paper describes a realistic FDCA method for three phase induction motors (IMs) using readily available data. External faults experienced by IM are monitored by Multi-class Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and compared its performance with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network which revealed that ELM algorithm is quite faster in investigations leading to reduction in computational load. RMS value of 3-phase voltages and currents are utilized as input variable in ELM model to identify six types of external faults experienced by IM and normal operating (NF) condition. Testing analysis of 160 instances has been performed to represent the robustness of the investigated seven status conditions of IM for wide changes in operating and loading condition perturbation.

A number of advancements have facilitated this advancement including solutions for porting modeling components across process and equipment types, mechanisms for incorporating process and equipment knowledge into models, mechanisms for determining model context (e.g., recipe) dependency, methods for model optimization to fab financials, and methods for rejecting run-time disturbances in PdM modeling.

Degradation pattern classification for early diagnosis has not been explored in many researches yet. This paper will use hybrid ensemble model for degradation pattern classification. Supervised training of deep models (e.g. many-layered Neural Nets) is difficult for optimization problem with unlabeled datasets or insufficient data sample. Shallow models (SVMs, Neural Networks, etc ...) are unlikely candidates for learning high-level abstractions, since they are affected by the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, deep learning network (DBN), an unsupervised learning model, in diagnosis problem has been investigated to do classification. Few researches have been done for exploring the effects of DBN in diagnosis. In this paper, an ensemble of DBNs with MOEA/D has been applied for diagnosis to handle failure degradation with multivariate sensory data. Turbofan engine degradation dataset is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. We believe that deep learning with multi-objective ensemble for degradation pattern classification can shed new light on failure diagnosis, and our work presented the applicability of this method to diagnosis as well as prognostics.

It is observed that a vibration signal of an onset fault in different parts of the bearing (inner race, outer race and ball) describes certain stable profile among their respective cycles. A methodology to estimate the stability of two dynamic handwriting signatures has been proposed using the Direct Matching Points (DMP) of the elastic align function Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This methodology is evaluated in this paper and extrapolated to machinery vibration signals affected by an early bearing fault. Results confirm the feasibility to study the stability in both free-fault and fault bearing signals to detect automatically early faults in the bearings by using recorded vibration signals.

With the virtualization technology, each physical machine in a datacenter can be logically divided into several virtual machines, on which different types of software services can host. However, many reasons may decrease the availability of the whole system. For example, a failed physical machine automatically fails all virtual machines on the physical machine, and consequently fails every software service on the virtual machines. It is difficult to detect failures efficiently in a general-purpose computer architecture because the hardware cannot provide enough information for fast failure detection. On the contrary, the ATCA (Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture) physical machines provide high hardware availability, and support IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) that can quickly detect the hardware status. In this paper, we developed a novel failure model and designed a symmetric fault-tolerant mechanism using ATCA physical machines and KVM to provide a solution for high system availability. The proposed fault-tolerant mechanism divides ATCA physical machines into pairs, such that each machine of a pair supports fault tolerance for each other. Once a failure is detected in the physical machine layer or the virtualization layer, the failed virtual machines are then recovered on the other physical machine. We have compared the proposed fault-tolerance mechanism with another prior VM-based fault-tolerance tool. The results show that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the service downtime. That is, it provides better system availability for software services running on the virtual machines.

It is a key device in the railway vehicles for monitoring work states to ensure high reliability and better performance of rotating machine. The states of rolling bearings can be detected by the measurement of vibration signals with effective process, features extraction and analysis. The propose of this paper is to establish an efficient and robust signal processing technique and classification mechanism to detect the fault of rolling bearing. Firstly Fast Fourier Transform is used to extract features and then these parameters are input into various classification schemes for accurate fault detection. Ensemble Rapid Centroid Estimation is proposed and then compared with Artificial Neural Network, and Principal Components Analysis. The simulation analyses the approaches of fault detection and the accuracy of identification. Then the linear performance of the data is proved by least square regularized regression. Finally various schemes are compared and analyzed to obtained the most efficient method for fault detection.

The vibration in rotating machinery is mostly caused by unbalance, misalignment, mechanical looseness, shaft crack, and other malfunctions. The diagnostics of rotor faults have been gaining importance in recent years. To examine the vibration characteristics of cracked shaft, a steel shaft with disk mounted at its center and supported by two bearings was used. An artificial crack was introduced to detect the vibration characteristics of the rotor. Initially, the signature data was obtained with no crack using spectrum analyzer. There after crack was introduced with depths ranging from 1mm to 6mm on the rotor of 25mm diameter. A significant change in vibration characteristic was examined when the crack depth has exceeded 3mm. On observing the first three peak amplitudes of right and left bearings, a different in the values was observed. This indifference in the magnitude of the peak amplitude is because of the combined effect of coupling and position of the crack. The work extended by assuming simplified model of an experimental setup is designed in ANSYS and the harmonic analysis was performedfor different combinations of crack depths and crack locations, and results were obtained. A Significant increase in deflection was observed when the crack depth had reached 4mm when compared to no-crack condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Kumar, V.

To enhance the reliability of condition monitoring systems, wireless sensor systems are developed. In the recent years, researchers have placed considerable emphasis on developing cost-effective scheme using wireless sensor systems for fault diagnosis of equipments in industry. As broken rotor bar is one of the main causes of malfunction in electrical motors, this paper proposes a method for early detection of this failure in induction machines using wireless sensor system. In this respect, a test bed is developed where a sensor measures the motor current and then a microcontroller connected to this current sensor read and send the data to wireless sensor for remote real time data analysis. In the receiver unit, a Lab VIEW based program is developed to store data in a database and MATLAB is used for signal processing and fault.

The approach uses a combination of case-based reasoning and information fusion to do classification. The approach consists of two steps. First, we perform local anomaly detection on-board a machine to identify anomalous individual cases. Then, we monitor the stream of anomalous cases using a stream anomaly detector based on a sliding window approach. When the stream anomaly detector identifies an anomalous window, the anomalous cases in the window are classified using a CBR classifier. Thereafter, the individual classifications are aggregated into a composite case with a single prediction using a information fusion method. We compare three information fusion approaches: simple majority vote, weighted majority vote and Dempster-Shafer fusion. As baseline for comparison, we use the classification of the last identified anomalous case in the window as the aggregated prediction.

Nonlinearities can initiate oscillations in process variables that may cause plantwide oscillations, which in turn results in loss of plant profitability and rapid wear and tear of plant machinery. Thus, quantification of nonlinearity is important for designing appropriate controllers, troubleshooting process faults and ensuring smooth operation of a process plant. In this paper, two data-based nonlinearity measures namely, bicoherence and surrogate-data based measures are compared using physical models of a few common processes to identify which method works better for which process.

This paper presents a novel fast training method for SVM, which has been applied in the fault diagnosis of a service robot. First, sensor data were sampled under different running conditions of the robot and those samples were divided as training sets and testing sets. Second, the sampled data were preprocessed and a principal component analysis (PCA) model was established for fault feature extraction. Third, the feature vectors were used to train the SVM classifier, which achieved the fault diagnosis of the robot. To speed up the training process of the SVM, on the one hand, sample reduction was done using the proposed support vectors selection (SVS) algorithm, which can ensure good classification accuracy and generalization capability. On the other hand, we took advantage of the excellent parallel computing abilities of a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to pre-calculate the kernel matrix, which avoids recalculation during the cross validation process. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the training time without decreasing the classification accuracy.

The latter should well capture the trend of the fault progression. In situation where the development of degradation model is difficult, we must be addressed to the identification of new features having an obvious trending quality. in this context, This paper present a new selection method based upon a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to identify the advanced prognosis feature and a particle filtering for the prediction of the remaining useful life.

J	He, C; Li, JM; Vachtsevanos, G				He, Cheng; Li, Jiaming; Vachtsevanos, George			Prognostics and Health Management of an Automated Machining Process	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Machine failure modes are presenting a major burden to the operator, the plant, and the enterprise causing significant downtime, labor cost, and reduced revenue. New technologies are emerging over the past years to monitor the machine's performance, detect and isolate incipient failures or faults, and take appropriate actions to mitigate such detrimental events. This paper addresses the development and application of novel Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technologies to a prototype machining process (a screw-tightening machine). The enabling technologies are built upon a series of tasks starting with failure analysis, testing, and data processing aimed to extract useful features or condition indicators from raw data, a symbolic regression modeling framework, and a Bayesian estimation method called particle filtering to predict the feature state estimate accurately. The detection scheme declares the fault of a machine critical component with user specified accuracy or confidence and given false alarm rate while the prediction algorithm estimates accurately the remaining useful life of the failing component. Simulation results support the efficacy of the approach and match well the experimental data.

Whole slide images of tissue sections are used clinically for diagnosing biologically distinct subtypes, as opposed to different grades of the same disease. This new grading scheme for ovarian carcinomas results in a low to moderate interobserver agreement among pathologists. In practice, the majority of cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and the overall prognosis is typically poor. In this work, we propose an automatic system for the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma subtypes from large-scale histopathology images. Our novel approach uses an unsupervised feature learning framework composed of a sparse tissue representation and a discriminative feature encoding scheme. We validate our model on a challenging clinical dataset of 80 patients and demonstrate its ability to diagnose whole slide images with an average accuracy of 91% using a linear support vector machine classifier.

As a result, estimation of the remaining service life and optimization of the maintenance program of steel bridge decks become a great challenge. A comprehensive structural health monitoring (SHM) system comprising acoustic emission (AE), guided waves (GW), and strain measurements has been developed and implemented on a test bridge deck subject to fatigue loading in the laboratory environment. These measurement systems provided the necessary information to a crack growth model, e.g. crack location by AE, crack size using GW, and stress distribution from the strain measurements. It has been demonstrated that the prognosis accuracy can substantially be improved when proper crack diagnosis is performed. The estimated crack growth showed good correlation with the reference time-of-flight diffraction (ToFD) measurements: less than 20% error in length and depth estimation over 8,000,000 cycles was shown to be feasible.

Fatigue damage growth in composites can be characterized through estimating strain energy release rates and observed through stiffness reduction in the structure. The work reported herein investigates several existing models for the estimation of strain energy release rate and reduction in effective stiffness of cross-ply laminates under multiple damage modes. These models account for co-existence of matrix cracks and delamination, and have been examined using publicaly available fatigue data on carbon fiber-reinforced polymers coupons. This study is driven by the desire to identify suitable models in a prognostic context, i.e., to predict the remaining useful life of composite laminates subject to fatigue loads. Therefore, the capability of models in estimating the strain energy release rate and in accurately describing progressive degradation of the material has been analyzed. Selected models will then be used in conjunction with modified Paris' law to predict the evolution of damage progression in cross-ply laminates.

In this contribution, the application of Wavelet Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition to selected industrial data for fault identification is presented. The data originate from a seven-stand hot strip mill. The suitability of these methods to detect characteristic features to allocate the patterns to specific faults is shortly reviewd. Classification is done with a Support Vector Machine. The results of Empirical Mode Decomposition respectively the Intrinsic Mode Functions are classified by evaluating the results of a cross-correlation. In previous contributions, the authors analyzed the aptitude of selected data-driven methods to detect conspicuous behavior of production plant in the field of non-stationary signals [1]. Based on these previous results, the authors broaden in this contribution the statistical basis and thus improve the reliability of the interpretation by applying the method of four-fold cross-validation to the data. The results of these classifications are evaluated with the McNemar-Test. An approach for fault prediction is discussed.

Components monitored include running gear of trains (wheel-sets, axle box, primary suspension etc.), turnouts, track irregularities, point machines, TVS fans, etc. The warnings are structured on the 3A principle (Alert, Alarm and Action) so that simple procedures could be followed by the duty controller. Maintenance staff could also download signal analysis results from the diagnostic module to trace and analyze the fault.

However, damage evolution in realistic structures is physically complex. Accurately representing this behavior requires high-fidelity models which are typically computationally prohibitive. In this paper, high-fidelity fatigue crack growth simulation times are significantly reduced using a surrogate model trained via finite element analysis. The new approach is applied to experimental damage diagnosis data to form a probabilistic prediction of remaining useful life for a test specimen under mixed-mode conditions.

Firstly, circuit fault features are extracted, and then hidden Markov model and least squares support vector machine are used to establish combination diagnosis model of analog circuit fault, and finally the simulation experiment is used to analyze the performance of combination models. The results show that compared to other analog circuit fault diagnosis models, the proposed model not only improves the accuracy of analog circuit fault detection, but also has faster speed of fault diagnosis.

We accomplish this objective using advanced Bayesian non-parametric analysis of in situ heterogeneous sensor data. The proposed method can ultimately lead to intelligent decision making and closed loop control in AM processes. Experiments are conducted on a desktop FFF machine (MakerBot Replicator 2X) instrumented with a heterogeneous sensor array including thermocouples, accelerometers, an infrared temperature sensor, and a real-time miniature video borescope. FFF process failures are detected online using the non-parametric Bayesian Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture model and evidence theory based on the experimentally acquired sensor data. This sensor data-driven defect detection approach facilitates real-time identification and correction of FFF process drifts with an accuracy and precision approaching 85% (average F-score). In comparison, the F-score from existing approaches, such as Probabilistic Neural Networks, Naive Bayesian Clustering, Support Vector Machines, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis was in the range of 55% to 75%.

Maintaining reliability, precision and safety for LSMs is very important. However, LSMs always work under extreme condition and are prone to degradation or failure. Therefore, maintenance is important for them. Compared with preventive maintenance, predictive maintenance is cost-saving. Besides, predictive maintenance is a more sustainable way by reducing failure and enhancing safety. Condition perception is needed in predictive maintenance. Due to the complex structure and large scale of LSMs, the perception data can be characterized as Big Data. Therefore, the storage and processing of Big Data needs to be integrated into maintenance. Considering that LSMs can be distributed all over the word, cloud service can be a proper way to support maintenance in a global environment. In this paper, a framework of service-oriented predictive maintenance for LSMs based on perception Big Data is synthesized to meet those demands. The methodologies are discussed as well. Finally, an industry case is studied to illustrate the implementing of predictive maintenance.

Apache Hadoop brings a cost-effective opportunity for Big Data analysis, including the data generated in various industries. Integrating Hadoop into industrial environments creates new possibilities, as well as many challenges. The authors of this paper are involved into commercial and scientific projects utilizing Hadoop for industry as predictive analytics platform. In such initiatives the lack of standardization of monitoring of the industrial process in terms of Hadoop cluster utilization is especially perplexing. In this paper, authors propose the methodology of monitoring Hadoop in industrial environments, based on dedicated ontology and widely adopted standards: OPC Unified Architecture and RESTful Web Services.

Depending on the coupling used in the set-up, angular and/or parallel misalignment can be brought in the rotating system. Traditionally, the data captured by accelerometers is transferred into the frequency domain in order to interpret the vibrations measured by the accelerometers. The frequency domain has proven its usefulness but even the time domain can come in handy to draw the right conclusions regarding to misalignment in a rotating set-up.

The proposed FTC method is not limited to certain faults in the reconfiguration manner and but it also includes a reconfiguration mechanism with direct on-line controller calculation. Here, PID type controller is utilized within the method as a reconfiguration sub-system. The reconfiguration mechanism and the diagnosis unit work independently within the method. Therefore, there is no need for the isolation of faults before tolerating them. In diagnosis and reconfiguration stages of the method, support vector regression machines are used. This FTC technique uses the real-time data generated by the system and it produces the appropriate gains of the controller in an on-line manner. The PID controller coefficients or the gains to be used in the training stage for faulty and non-faulty cases are all obtained by using the Genetic Algorithm optimization approach in an off-line manner. Moreover, it has also been shown that the proposed method can handle multiple and simultaneous occurrences of various types of faults. The performance of the proposed method is tested on a simulation model of two tank level control system for various fault scenarios.

This paper employs the machine learning regression algorithms for constructing survival model. The paper suggests a new Bayesian framework for feature selection in high-dimensional Cox regression problems. The proposed approach gives a strong probabilistic statement of the shrinkage criterion for feature selection. The proposed regularization gives the estimates that are unbiased, possesses grouping and oracle properties, their maximal risk diverges to a finite value. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is competitive on both simulated data and publicly available real data sets.

Poka Yoke system based on image analysis and object recognition	MODERN TECHNOLOGIES IN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING (MODTECH2015)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Modern Technologies in Industrial Engineering (ModTech)	JUN 17-20, 2015	Mamaia, ROMANIA	Profess Assoc Modern Mfg Technol, Constanta Maritime Univ, Silesian Univ Technol, Tech Univ Chisinau Republ Moldova, Donetsk Natl Tech Univ				Poka Yoke is a method of quality management which is related to prevent faults from arising during production processes. It deals with "fail-safing" or "mistake-proofing". The Poka-yoke concept was generated and developed by Shigeo Shingo for the Toyota Production System. Poka Yoke is used in many fields, especially in monitoring production processes. In many cases, identifying faults in a production process involves a higher cost than necessary cost of disposal. Usually, poke yoke solutions are based on multiple sensors that identify some nonconformities. This means the presence of different equipment (mechanical, electronic) on production line. As a consequence, coupled with the fact that the method itself is an invasive, affecting the production process, would increase its price diagnostics. The bulky machines are the means by which a Poka Yoke system can be implemented become more sophisticated. In this paper we propose a solution for the Poka Yoke system based on image analysis and identification of faults. The solution consists of a module for image acquisition, mid-level processing and an object recognition module using associative memory (Hopfield network type). All are integrated into an embedded system with AD (Analog to Digital) converter and Zync 7000 (22 nm technology).

Its dimensional precision is significant to the quality of the aeroplane engine. In the rear casing manufacturing process, the assembly variation of its corresponding wax dramatically affects the final dimensions. In this paper, a polar-coordinate based model is proposed to calculate the assembly variation of ring-shaped rear casing wax part. It avoids the variation caused by the coupling relationship between Cartesian coordinate systems and locating position. We also compare the polar-coordinate based model with the ordinary one in practical application. The results show that the polar-coordinate based model can simplify the calculating process and improve the computational accuracy for the assembly variation analysis of the ring-shaped part.

For this we propose a framework for data-driven prediction of RUL. To solve the problem of lacking direct condition information in predicting equipment residual useful life (RUL), particle-filtering model is built for equipment's RUL prediction with indirect information, which is easy to get.This paper introduces a particle-filtering modeling approach for predicting the remaining lifetime of the wind turbine gearbox based on information of SCADA system monitoring. Data from the SCADA system for the wind turbine gearbox were used to validate the proposed methodology. The outcome shows that the PF method has a better effect on RUL prediction. Finally, the model verified through on-site data collection. It shows that the method is practical value in the prediction of remaining life. A new way for state recognition of complex equipment is provided.

Based on this theory, hidden Markov model serves as an extension of Markov model to present an event from observations rather than states in Markov model. Moreover, due to successful applications in speech recognition, it attracts much attention in machine fault diagnosis. This paper presents two architectures for machine performance degradation assessment, which can be used to minimize machine downtime, reduce economic loss, and improve productivity. The major difference between the two architectures is whether historical data are available to build hidden Markov models. In case studies, bearing data as well as available historical data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the first architecture. Then, whole life gearbox data without historical data are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the second architecture. The results obtained from two case studies show that the presented architectures have good abilities for machine performance degradation assessment.

Cancer treatment relies on chemotherapy or radiation therapy that kills neoplastic cells by causing immense damage to the DNA. In many cases, escalated DNA repair mechanism leads to resistance against these therapies and therefore, there is a need to expand the interest in developing drugs that can sensitize the cells to such therapies by interfering with the DNA repair mechanism. Several studies have suggested a link between over expression of the primary mammalian enzyme, Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease (APE1), responsible for abasic (or AP) site removal in the DNA and resistance of these cells to cancer therapy, whereas APE1 down-regulation sensitizes the cells to DNA damaging agents. Thus, the current treatment efficacy can be improved by aiding to selective sensitization of cancer cells and protection of normal cells. In the present study, we have used machine learning based approach by selecting assorted compounds with known activity for APE1 and constructed a range of in silico predictive classification models to discriminate between the inhibitors and non-inhibitors. These models can be applied to numerous other unscreened compounds to select the ones which are more likely to be the inhibitors for APE1.

J	Chen, GJ; Zhang, XY; Wang, ZJ; Li, FL				Chen, Guijun; Zhang, Xueying; Wang, Zizhong John; Li, Fenglian			An Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony-Based Support Vector Machine for Image-Based Fault Detection	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS; SELECTION	Fault detection has become extremely important in industrial production so that numerous potential losses caused from equipment failures could be saved. As a noncontact method, machine vision can satisfy the needs of real-time fault monitoring. However, image-based fault features often have the characteristics of high-dimensionality and redundant correlation. To optimize feature subsets and SVM parameters, this paper presents an enhanced artificial bee colony-based support vector machine (EABC-SVM) approach. The method is applied to the image-based fault detection for the conveyor belt. To improve the optimized capability of original ABC, the EABC algorithm introduces two enhanced strategies including the Cat chaotic mapping initialization and current optimum based search equations. Several UCI datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of EABC-SVM and the experimental results show that this approach has better classification accuracy and convergence performance than the ABC-SVM and other ABC variants-based SVM. Furthermore, the EABC-SVM can achieve a significant detection accuracy of 95% and reduce the amount of features about 65% in the conveyor belt fault detection.

J	Shin, K; Lee, SH				Shin, Kihong; Lee, Sang-Heon			Machinery Fault Diagnosis Using Two-Channel Analysis Method Based on Fictitious System Frequency Response Function	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; IDENTIFICATION	Most existing techniques for machinery health monitoring that utilize measured vibration signals usually require measurement points to be as close as possible to the expected fault components of interest. This is particularly important for implementing condition-based maintenance since the incipient fault signal power may be too small to be detected if a sensor is located further away from the fault source. However, a measurement sensor is often not attached to the ideal point due to geometric or environmental restrictions. In such a case, many of the conventional diagnostic techniques may not be successfully applicable. In this paper, a two-channel analysis method is proposed to overcome such difficulty. It uses two vibration signals simultaneously measured at arbitrary points in a machine. The proposed method is described theoretically by introducing a fictitious system frequency response function. It is then verified experimentally for bearing fault detection. The results show that the suggested method may be a good alternative when ideal points for measurement sensors are not readily available.

The kNN method is modified to adapt the fault diagnosis of tools that can determine thresholds of multifault classes and is applied to detect potential faults. An experimental analysis in NC milling machine tools is developed; the testing result shows that the proposed method is outperforming compared to the other two methods in tool fault diagnosis.

First, the nonlinear and non-stationary vibration signals are decomposed using LMD into several product functions (PFs). Then, the PFs are processed by SVD to obtain more stable and compact feature vectors. Finally, the health states are identified by an IG-SVM classifier, which is less-dependent on the selected kernel function and parameters than SVM. In addition, the comparisons between LMD, EMD, and WPD demonstrate the superiority of LMD in feature extraction. Compared with SVM and BP neural network, IG-SVM shows higher classification accuracy and computational efficiency in dealing with small-sample fault diagnosis. From the experimental results, it was concluded that the proposed method can effectively realize fault diagnosis for hydraulic pumps under small-sample conditions.

To optimise performance in control and supervision, appropriate modelling is crucial, and this regards both the ability to capture reality and the computational complexity to be useful in real-time. Here, a new low complexity model of the electric machine is proposed and developed. The new model treats the machine constants in a different way compared to a previous standard model, which results in a different expression for power losses. It is shown that this increases model expressiveness so when adapted to real data the result is significantly better. The significance of this modelling improvement is demonstrated using a task in vehicle diagnosis where it is shown that the separation between the non-faulty and faulty cases is better and the resulting performance is improved.

When occurring on embedded computing systems, these anomalies may severely hamper the corresponding devices; on the other hand, embedded systems are designed to perform autonomously, i.e., without any human intervention, and thus it is difficult to debug an application to manage the anomaly. Runtime anomaly detection techniques are the primary means of being aware of anomalous conditions. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to detect an anomaly during the execution of one or more applications. Our approach describes the behaviour of the applications using the sequences of memory references generated during runtime. The memory references are seen as signals: they are divided in overlapping frames, then parametrized and finally described with Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for detecting anomalies. The motivations of using such methodology for embedded systems are the following: first, the memory references could be extracted with very low overhead with software or architectural tools. Second, the device HMM analysis framework, while being very powerful in gathering high level information, has low computational complexity and thus is suitable to the rather low memory and computational capabilities of embedded systems. We experimentally evaluated our proposal on a ARM9, Linux based, embedded system using the SPEC 2006 CPU benchmark suite and found that it shows very low error rates for some artificially injected anomalies, namely a malware, an infinite loop and random errors during execution.

To model hidden trends and predict deterioration failure utilizing volatile state indicators, an adaptive support vector regression (ASVR) machine is proposed. In ASVR, the width of an error-insensitive tube, which is a constant in the traditional support vector regression, is set as a variable determined by the transient distribution boundary of local regions in the training time series. Thus, the localized regions are obtained using a sliding time window, and their boundaries are defined by a robust measure known as the truncated range. Utilizing an adaptive error-insensitive tube, a stabilized tolerance level for noise is achieved, whether the time series occurs in low-volatility regions or in high-volatility regions. The proposed method is evaluated by vibrational data measured on descaling pumps. The results show that ASVR is capable of capturing the local trends of the volatile time series of state indicators and is superior to the standard support vector regression for state prediction.

While traditional inspection depends on the trained human inspectors, which is time-consuming and lower efficient. With the development of machine vision, vision-based inspection methods get more railway on-spot applications. The cross rod end fastening bolts are important components on both sides of the train body that fixing locking plates together with the freight car main structure. In our experiment, we get the images containing fastening bolt components, and accurately locate the locking plate position using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) locating model trained with Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. Then we extract the straight line segment using the Line Segment Detector (LSD) and encoding them in a range, which constitute a straight line segment dataset. Lastly we determine the locking plate's working state by the linear pattern. The experiment result shows that the localization accurate rate is over 99%, the fault detection rate is over 95%, and the module implementation time is 2f/s. The overall performance can completely meet the practical railway safety assurance application.

There exist two main issues in predictive maintenance. The first challenge is the system operation region definition, detection and modelling; and another one is estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL). To address these issues, this paper proposes a particle filter (PF)-based model fusion approach for estimating RUL by classifying the system states into different operation regions in which a data-driven model is developed to estimate RUL corresponding to each region, and combined with PF-based fusion algorithm. This paper reports the proposed approach along with some preliminary results obtained from a case study.

However, it still remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a Particle filter (PF)-based method to estimate remaining useful life for predictive maintenance by employing PF technique to update the nonlinear predictive models for forecasting system states. In particular, we applied PF techniques to estimate remaining useful life by integrating data-driven modeling techniques in order to effectively perform predictive maintenance. After introducing the PF-based algorithm, the paper presents the implementation along with the experimental results through a case study of Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) starter prognostics. The results demonstrated that the developed method is useful for estimating RUL for predictive maintenance.

Under the phase space reconstructed by single vibration signal, the self-organization mapping (SOM) with expectation maximization iteration algorithm is used to divide the local neighborhoods adaptively without manual intervention. After that, the local tangent space alignment algorithm is adopted to compress the high-dimensional phase space into low-dimensional feature space. The proposed method takes advantages of the manifold learning in low-dimensional feature extraction and adaptive neighborhood construction of SOM and can extract intrinsic fault features of interest in two dimensional projection space. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the Lorenz system was simulated and rotation machinery with nonlinear faults was obtained for test purposes. Compared with the holospectrum approaches, the results reveal that the proposed method is superior in identifying faults and effective for rotating machinery condition monitoring.

Based on vibration signals, this paper presents an implementation of deep learning algorithm convolutional neural network (CNN) used for fault identification and classification in gearboxes. Different combinations of condition patterns based on some basic fault conditions are considered. 20 test cases with different combinations of condition patterns are used, where each test case includes 12 combinations of different basic condition patterns. Vibration signals are preprocessed using statistical measures from the time domain signal such as standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In the frequency domain, the spectrum obtained with FFT is divided into multiple bands, and the root mean square (RMS) value is calculated for each one so the energy maintains its shape at the spectrum peaks. The achieved accuracy indicates that the proposed approach is highly reliable and applicable in fault diagnosis of industrial reciprocating machinery. Comparing with peer algorithms, the present method exhibits the best performance in the gearbox fault diagnosis.

J	Miao, Q; Zhou, QH				Miao, Qiang; Zhou, Qinghua			Planetary Gearbox Vibration Signal Characteristics Analysis and Fault Diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAILURE	Planetary gearboxes are widely used in helicopters, wind turbines, mining machinery, and so forth. The structure and motion type of a planetary gearbox are more complex in comparison with a fixed-shaft one, which makes condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox a challenging issue in practical applications. In order to understand the fundamental nature of planetary gearbox vibration, this paper conducts an investigation on vibration characteristics of a single-stage planetary gearbox. Assuming that the gearbox and the sensor revolve inversely at the speed of planet carrier, the problem can be transformed into two easier parts: research on fixed-shaft gearbox signal model and research on influence of sensor spinning.

For that reason, researches have been done for the early detection of faults through the analysis of their vibration signals. Modern day machines, due to their complexities, can have many vibration generating sources in addition to noises. Therefore it is important that the vibration signal of faulty gear to be recognized and recovered for the diagnostics. In this paper Back-Propagation neural network has been used for the classification of RPM and oil level related gearbox faults that can occur during operation. With the help of Power spectrum technique, signal was more refined in order to make the feature selection process much more accurate.

A performance assessment was carried out using fuzzy logic theory. This, in turn, was used to judge the ownership of various signals. It then defined the level that each ownership group belonged to in order to determine whether the performance was broken or not. If normal, the system determined specified rules for such normality. During the process of extracting the vibration and noise signals, the system used Fourier transform to analyze any changes made to each signal in the frequency field, and then principal component analysis was used to decrease the data dimensions. We then evaluated the work status of the machine tool on the basis of the signal features. Furthermore, we built a feature math model from the recorded signals using a back propagation neural network and further determined the abnormal items using an error function. Finally, we obtained a diagnostic feature for the performance of the machine tool using physical signals through diagnostic reports from a human-machine interface. The machine tool diagnostic system is able to provide maintenance personnel with a proper way of responding quickly to any reduction in the output from the machine tool so as to avoid further damage.

A large number of feature extraction and classification methods have been widely applied in the related research, but the practical fault alarm and the accuracy of diagnosis have not been effectively improved. Developing feature extraction and classification methods to meet the requirements of typical fault alarm and automatic diagnosis in practical engineering is urgent task. The typical mechanical faults of reciprocating compressor are presented in the paper, and the existing data of online monitoring system is used to extract fault feature parameters within 15 types in total; the inner sensitive connection between faults and the feature parameters has been made clear by using the distance evaluation technique, also sensitive characteristic parameters of different faults have been obtained. On this basis, a method based on fault feature parameters and support vector machine(SVM) is developed, which will be applied to practical fault diagnosis. A better ability of early fault warning has been proved by the experiment and the practical fault cases. Automatic classification by using the SVM to the data of fault alarm has obtained better diagnostic accuracy.

However, the acoustical signals directly measured by the sensors in essential are the mixed signals of all the sources, and normally it is very difficult to be used for source identification or operating feature extraction. Therefore, this paper studies the acoustical source tracing problem using independent component analysis (ICA) and identifies the sources using correlation analysis: the measured acoustical signals are separated into independent components by independent component analysis method, and thus all the independent information of all the sources is obtained; these independent components are identified based on the prior information of the sources and correlation analysis. Therefore, all the source information contained in the measured acoustical signals can be independently separated and traced, which can provide more purer source information for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

The cause of node failure was analyzed at first. Then a diagnosis node was designed and made to check network connectivity. LCD1602 served as man-machine interface, and 4x4 matrix keyboard was used to input command which would control wireless communication module nRF905 to check the information of nodes. Compared connectivity messages of gateway node and sensor node, fault nodes and reason would be distinguished.

Acquired mechanical vibration signals can be converted into color time-frequency spectrum images by the processing of pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution. Then a feature extraction method based on quaternion invariant moment was proposed, combining image processing technology and multiweight neural network technology. The paper adopted quaternion invariant moment feature extraction method and gray level-gradient cooccurrence matrix feature extraction method and combined them with geometric learning algorithm and probabilistic neural network algorithm, respectively, and compared the recognition rates of rolling bearing faults. The experimental results show that the recognition rates of quaternion invariant moment are higher than gray level-gradient cooccurrence matrix in the same recognition method. The recognition rates of geometric learning algorithm are higher than probabilistic neural network algorithm in the same feature extraction method. So the method based on quaternion invariant moment geometric learning and multiweight neural network is superior. What is more, this algorithm has preferable generalization performance under the condition of fewer samples, and it has practical value and acceptation on the field of fault diagnosis for rotating machinery as well.

The paper extends the Latent Nestling Method based in Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) to hybrid systems in such a manner that IGBTs performance can be modeled. CPNs allow for an enhanced capability for synthesis and modeling in contrast to the classical phenomena of combinational state explosion when Finite State Machine methods are applied. We present an IGBT model with different fault modes including those of intermittent nature that can be used advantageously as predictive symptoms within a predictive maintenance strategy. Ageing stress tests have been experimentally applied to the IGBTs modules and intermittent faults are diagnosed as precursors of permanent failures. In addition, ageing is validated with morphological analysis (Scanning Electron Microscopy) and semiqualitative analysis (Energy Dispersive Spectrometry).

Firstly, the signal is purified by the morphological filter; the filter's structure element (SE) is selected by PSO method. Then the filtered signals are decomposed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, and the extract features are mapped into the LTSA to extract the character features; then the support vector machine (SVM) model is used to achieve the rotating machine fault diagnosis.

Considering the vibration signals collected from different bearing health conditions' having different complexity, a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis method was proposed based on TESPAR (Time Encoded Signal Processing and Recognition) combined with envelopes signal and SVMs (Support Vector Machines). The envelope signals of vibration signals with the same fault type and severity possess the similar characteristics of waveform and energy distribution. Then the envelope signals were firstly obtained by Hilbert transform of original vibrations. An SVM was then trained by the S matrix resulting from time encoded signal processing and recognition which were extracted from the envelope signals. The trained SVM was then used to simultaneously judge bearing fault type and severity. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and have a lower false alarm rate.

However, due to harsh operation conditions, the gears are prone to failures. Hence, it is crucial to diagnose the gear faults. It is manifested that the vibration analysis is very useful for gear fault diagnosis. But, the gear failures are always complex and reliable intelligent techniques are needed to handle this big problem. To address this issue, a new approach is proposed based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). As a new generation of artificial intelligence, KELM is more powerful than neural network and has strong ability in pattern recognition. We have evaluated the fault detection performance of the KELM in a gear fault test-bed. The detection results indicate that the KELM can detect the gear fault reliably and accurately. Moreover, through comparison with other existing methods, the proposed method produced the best detection rate of 88.3%.

When part was processed and transmitted in multiple stages, dimensional variation of part will be accumulated, coupling and transformed as well. Since the high precision requirements of the CMP, there are more process parameters impacted the machining errors than general multistage process, and more diverse process parameters should be considered in CMP's processing. To describe machining variation propagation process accurately and effectively, the variation propagation model for CMP processing was proposed. Firstly, the parts and fixtures in CMP processing are described by differential motion vector based on the robot's kinematics principle, and the change of theirs space pose are obtained by homogeneous transformation. Then, the fixture-induced variation, datum-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation are analyzed and derived. The machining-induced variation is the dimension deviation produced by cutting force impacting on part's machining surfaces, and the cutting-tool wear induced variation is mainly caused by tool's normal wear. Lastly, the coupling relationship of datum-induced variation, fixture-induced variation, machining-induced variation and cutting-tool wear induced variation of each process stage is described, and the state space model of variation propagation is developed. The relationship of dimensional variation from all work stages and all kinds of variations is explored. By a real case study, feasibility and effectiveness of the model is validated. The model has great potential to be applied in the fault diagnosis, root cause identification of variation, sensor placement optimization, variation simulation, machining parameter and fixture design and optimization in quality control and improvement of complex product.

Then arc fault was effectively identified by using the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) where wavelet entropy was classified. Identification results show that arc fault was entirely recognized under the experiment conditions, it is conclude that this method can not only identify arc fault for the single loads, but also can avoid disturbances which generated by some inhibitory loads.

The multi-scale approximate entropy of screw vibration signal were selected as the feature vectors. Initialization parameters of GNN were optimized by means of QGA. Feature vectors were inputted to GNN for training, and then got the screw fault diagnosis model. Test results show that using QGA to optimize initialization parameters of the GNN, can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the network.

The technique is used in order to remedy the problem from using the classical signal-processing technique FFT by analysis of stator current envelope. The proposed method is based from using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and Hilbert transform. The Hilbert transform is used to extract the stator current envelope. Then this signal is processed via DWT. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by simulation tests.

Therefore, the work on the identification of small molecular weight compounds as inhibitors of cysteine proteases is of great therapeutic significance. In the present work, we report the synthesis of a small library of chalcones and a study of their role as inhibitors of cysteine proteases. After a preliminary screening of the compounds as inhibitors of cysteine proteases in general, studies were carried out to evaluate their inhibitory effects on cathepsin B, H and L. The most potent inhibitors among all the compounds were nitro substituted compounds for cathepsin B and cathepsin L and chloro substituted compounds for cathepsin H, respectively.

The development of the average age of machinery and equipment could be used as an indicator of the modernisation process and the picture of investment support in the industry. For the purposes of the analysis, the official model of the perpetual inventory method is transformed into the Markov chain model. The analysis shows significant differences in the institutional sectors. The average age of machinery and the age distribution depicts the situation in agriculture and it indicates the lower competitiveness of small farmers. The paper contains the prognosis of development of the average age of machinery and equipment in the case of permanent investment on the level of the current year. The international comparison shows that the average age of machinery and equipment in the Czech Republic is close to the level of developed countries. However, the estimated development shows a decreasing average age of the machinery and equipment.

SDA of BDS is the problem of analyzing, modeling and extracting information from huge amounts of data that continuously come from several sources in real time through computational aware solutions. Among others, CBM for Rail Transportation is one of the most challenging SDA problems, consisting of the implementation of a predictive maintenance system for evaluating the future status of the monitored assets in order to reduce risks related to failures and to avoid service disruptions. The challenge is to collect and analyze all the data streams that come from the numerous on-board sensors monitoring the assets. This paper deals with the problem of CBM applied to the condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of train axle bearings based on sensors data collection, with the purpose of maximizing their Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In particular we propose a novel algorithm for CBM based on SDA that takes advantage of the Online Support Vector Regression (OL-SVR) for predicting the RUL. The novelty of our proposal is the heuristic approach for optimizing the trade-off between the accuracy of the OL-SVR models and the computational time and resources needed in order to build them. Results from tests on a real-world dataset show the actual benefits brought by the proposed methodology.

Along with the continuous advance of science and technology, the structures of rotating machinery become increasingly of larger scale and higher speed and more complicated, which result in higher probability of various failure in practice. In case one of the most critical components of machinery or equipment breaks down, it cannot only cause enormous economic loss, but also easily cause the loss of many people's lives. It is important to enable reliable, safe, and efficient operation of large-scale and critical rotating machinery, which requires us to achieve accurate and fast diagnosis of fault which has occurred. Aiming at dynamic real-time vibration monitoring and vibration signal analysis for large machine unit in petrochemical industry, which cannot realize real-time, online, and fast fault diagnosis, an intelligent fault diagnosis system using artificial immune algorithm and dimensionless parameters is developed in this paper, innovated with a focus on reliability, remote monitoring, and practicality and applied to the third catalytic flue gas turbine in a petrochemical enterprise, with good effects.

An Improved PSO Algorithm and Its Application on Fault Diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING (AIIE 2015)	Advances in Intelligent Systems Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Industrial Engineering (AIIE)	JUL 26-27, 2015	Phuket, THAILAND			particle swarm optimization; multi-population; support vector machine; fault diagnosis	OPTIMIZATION	For the disadvantages of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm, such as premature convergence and easily getting into local extremum, an improved PSO algorithm was presented in this paper. On the one hand, the population with worse performance moved near the global optimization value of the other population with certain probability; on the other hand, one population was randomly chosen to mutate to stimulate the particles jump out the local extremum when the two populations continuously trapped into the same local extremum. The simulation results showed that the improved PSO had a better optimization performance. SVM (Support Vector Machine) trained the improved PSO was applied to fault diagnosis of diesel engine valve. The simulation results showed that the improved PSO-SVM acquired higher accuracy.	[Liu, X. L.; Cao, L. H.; Wang, S. T.; Li, J.

Uncertainty Reduced Novelty Detection Approach Applied to Rotating Machinery for Condition Monitoring	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							POWER-FLOW; OUTLIER DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Novelty detection has been developed into a state-of-the-art technique to detect abnormal behavior and trigger alarm for in-field machine maintenance. With built-up models of normality, it has been widely applied to several situations with normal supervising dataset such as shaft rotating speed and component temperature available meanwhile in the absence of fault information. However, the research about vibration transmission based novelty detection remains unnoticed until recently. In this paper, vibration transmission measurement on rotor is performed; based on extreme value distributions, thresholds for novelty detection are calculated. In order to further decrease the false alarm rate, both measurement and segmentation uncertainty are considered, as they may affect threshold value and detection correctness heavily. Feasible reduction strategies are proposed and discussed. It is found that the associated multifractal coefficient and Kullback-Leibler Divergence operate well in the uncertainty reduction process. As shown by in situ applications to abnormal rotor with pedestal looseness, it is demonstrated that the abnormal states are detected. The higher specificity value proves the effectiveness of proposed uncertainty reduction method. This paper shows novel achievements of uncertainty reduced novelty detection applied to vibration signal in dynamical system and also sheds lights on its utilization in the field of health monitoring of rotating machinery.

Complex systems modelling could be addressed by signal based procedures, which are able to learn the complex system dynamics from data provided by sensors, which are installed on the system in order to monitor its physical variables. In this chapter the aim of diagnosis is to detect if the electrical machine is healthy or a change is occurring due to abnormal events and, in addition, the probable causes of the abnormal events. Diagnosis is addressed by developing machine learning procedures in order to classify the probable causes of deviations from system normal events. This chapter presents two Fault Detection and Diagnosis solutions for rotating electrical machines by signal based approaches. The first one uses a current signature analysis technique based on Kernel Density Estimation and Kullback Liebler divergence. The second one presents a vibration signature analysis technique based on Multi-Scale Principal Component Analysis. Several simulations and experimentations on real electric motors are carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. The results show that the proposed signal based diagnosis procedures are able to detect and diagnose different electric motor faults and defects, improving the reliability of electrical machines. Fault Detection and Diagnosis algorithms could be used not only with the fault diagnosis purpose but also in a Quality Control scenario. In fact, they can be integrated in test benches at the end or in the middle of the production line in order to test the machines quality. When the electric motors reach the test benches, the sensors acquire measurements and the Fault Detection and Diagnosis procedures detect if the motor is healthy or faulty, in this last case further inspections can diagnose the fault.

J	Adhikari, A				Adhikari, Animesh			Intelligent Decision Technologies 9	INTELLIGENT DECISION TECHNOLOGIES-NETHERLANDS			English	Book Review						Test theory; rough set; logical analysis of data; decision table; granular computing; machine learning		The book Three Approaches to Data Analysis [1] presents three approaches to data analysis: (1) Test Theory (TT), founded by Sergei V. Yablonskii; (2) Rough Sets (RS), founded by Zdzislaw I. Pawlak and (3) Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), founded by Peter L. Hammer. These three approaches have much in common. They all are related to Boolean functions and Boolean reasoning. All three data analysis approaches use decision tables for data representation. The first part of the book, written by Igor Chikalov, Mikhail Moshkov and Beata Zielosko, is devoted to Test Theory. Authors present three main areas of TT: (i) theoretical results related to tests, (ii) applications to control and diagnosis of faults, and (iii) applications to pattern recognition. This chapter consists of seven sections. The first three sections include theoretical results on tests, trees and rules. The following three sections deal with applications of TT. The second part of this book, written by Hung Son Nguyen and Andrzej Skowron, is dedicated to rough sets as a tool to deal with imperfect data, in particular, with vague concepts. This chapter presents vague concepts, indiscernibility and discernibility relations, approximation of concepts, rough sets, decision rules, dependencies, reducts, discernibility and Boolean reasoning and rough membership functions. Some comments on relationships of rough sets and logic are discussed. Some challenging issues for rough sets are included in the last section. The third part of the book was written by Vadim Lozin and Irina Lozina and is devoted to LAD. This chapter is divided into three sections: Theory, Methodology and Applications. The first section presents partially defined Boolean function, pattern and discuss various problems associated with these notions. This section contains binarization, attribute selection, pattern generation, model construction and validation. In the section devoted to applications; authors illustrate LAD methodology with a number of particular examples.

C	Huang, HF; Ouyang, HJ; Gao, HL			IOP	Huang, Haifeng; Ouyang, Huajiang; Gao, Hongli			Blind Source Separation and Dynamic Fuzzy Neural Network for Fault Diagnosis in Machines	11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF STRUCTURES (DAMAS 2015)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures (DAMAS)	AUG 24-26, 2015	Ghent Univ, Ghent, BELGIUM		Ghent Univ		SYSTEMS	Many assessment and detection methods are used to diagnose faults in machines. High accuracy in fault detection and diagnosis can be achieved by using numerical methods with noise-resistant properties. However, to some extent, noise always exists in measured data on real machines, which affects the identification results, especially in the diagnosis of early-stage faults. In view of this situation, a damage assessment method based on blind source separation and dynamic fuzzy neural network (DFNN) is presented to diagnose the early-stage machinery faults in this paper. In the processing of measurement signals, blind source separation is adopted to reduce noise. Then sensitive features of these faults are obtained by extracting low dimensional manifold characteristics from the signals. The model for fault diagnosis is established based on DFNN. Furthermore, on-line computation is accelerated by means of compressed sensing. Numerical vibration signals of ball screw fault modes are processed on the model for mechanical fault diagnosis and the results are in good agreement with the actual condition even at the early stage of fault development. This detection method is very useful in practice and feasible for early-stage fault diagnosis.

C	Wang, TY; Cheng, WD; Li, JY; Chu, FL			IOP	Wang, Tianyang; Cheng, Weidong; Li, Jianyong; Chu, Fulei			A new angular resampling algorithm for the bearing fault diagnosis under the time-varying rotational speed	11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DAMAGE ASSESSMENT OF STRUCTURES (DAMAS 2015)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Damage Assessment of Structures (DAMAS)	AUG 24-26, 2015	Ghent Univ, Ghent, BELGIUM		Ghent Univ		SPECTRAL KURTOSIS	Order tracking is one of the most effective algorithms to eliminate the effect of time-varying rotational speed on the rotary machines. However, this algorithm is not suitable for the faulty rolling bearing unless the peak time of the fault-induced impulse is set as zero which cannot be met in the real engineering, The traditional resembling process will cause uneven intervals between the adjacent impulse peaks in the angular domain and then affect the envelope analysis-based diagnosis result. To solve this problem, a new resembling algorithm with three parts is proposed: (a) linearly fitting the instantaneous rotational speed measured by the tachometer, (b) resembling the vibration signal from the time domain to the angular domain using the traditional method, (c) calculating the envelope deformation amount and then compensating the resembled result. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated by both the simulated and experimental bearing vibration signals.

J	Hussain, S				Hussain, Sajid			Fuzzy information system for condition based maintenance of gearbox	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy logic; vibration analysis; features extraction; clustering; gearbox fault diagnosis	WAVELET TRANSFORM; INFERENCE; NETWORK; MODEL	Gearbox is an inseparable part of any rotating machinery today. Gearbox transfers speed and torque from one shaft to another. Hence, correct diagnosis of gearbox faults is an important and critical task for maintenance operators. But, due to nonlinear, time-varying behavior and imprecise measurement information of the systems it is difficult to deal with gearbox failures with precise mathematical equations. Human operators with the aid of their practical experience can handle these complex situations, with only a set of imprecise linguistic if-then rules and imprecise system state. The purpose of this study is to provide a correct and timely diagnosis of gearbox failures in the context of condition based maintenance. The diagnosis is performed by knowledge acquisition through a fuzzy rule-based inference system which could approximate human reasoning. The proposed approach is tested and applied to an experimental data emanating from a gearbox system.

Failure Diagnosis System for a Ball-Screw by Using Vibration Signals	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Recently, in order to reduce high maintenance costs and to increase operating ratio in manufacturing systems, condition-based maintenance (CBM) has been developed. CBM is carried out with indicators, which show equipment's faults and performance deterioration. In this study, indicator signal acquisition and condition monitoring are applied to a ball-screw-driven stage. Although ball-screwis a typical linearly reciprocating part and is widely used in industry, it has not gained attention to be diagnosed compared to rotating parts such as motor, pump, and bearing. First, the vibration-based monitoring method, which uses vibration signal to monitor the condition of a machine, is proposed. Second, Wavelet transform is used to analyze the defect signals in time-frequency domain. Finally, the failure diagnosis system is developed using the analysis, and then its performance is evaluated. Using the system, we estimated the severity of failure and detect the defect position. The low defect frequency (approximate to 58.7Hz) is spread all over the time in the Wavelet-filtered signal with low frequency range. Its amplitude reflects the progress of defect. The defect position was found in the signal with high frequency range (768 similar to 1,536Hz). It was detected from the interval between abrupt changes of signal.

Principal Components of Superhigh-Dimensional Statistical Features and Support Vector Machine for Improving Identification Accuracies of Different Gear Crack Levels under Different Working Conditions	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT; DAMAGE	Gears are widely used in gearbox to transmit power from one shaft to another. Gear crack is one of the most frequent gear fault modes found in industry. Identification of different gear crack levels is beneficial in preventing any unexpected machine breakdown and reducing economic loss because gear crack leads to gear tooth breakage. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis method for identification of different gear crack levels under different working conditions is proposed. First, superhigh-dimensional statistical features are extracted from continuous wavelet transform at different scales. The number of the statistical features extracted by using the proposed method is 920 so that the extracted statistical features are superhigh dimensional. To reduce the dimensionality of the extracted statistical features and generate new significant low-dimensional statistical features, a simple and effective method called principal component analysis is used. To further improve identification accuracies of different gear crack levels under different working conditions, support vector machine is employed. Three experiments are investigated to show the superiority of the proposed method. Comparisons with other existing gear crack level identification methods are conducted. The results show that the proposed method has the highest identification accuracies among all existing methods.

According to such problems of the traditional TLBO as low optimizing efficiency and poor stability, this paper proposes an improved TLBO algorithm mainly by introducing the elite thought in TLBO and adopting different inertia weight decreasing strategies for elite and ordinary individuals of the teacher stage and the student stage. In this paper, the validity of the improved TLBO is verified by the optimizations of several typical test functions and the SVM optimized by the weighted elitist TLBO is used in the diagnosis and classification of common failure data of the TE chemical process. Compared with the SVM combining other traditional optimizing methods, the SVM optimized by the weighted elitist TLBO has a certain improvement in the accuracy of fault diagnosis and classification.

J	Zhang, JF; Liu, ML; Wang, KQ; Sun, LJ				Zhang, Jianfeng; Liu, Mingliang; Wang, Keqi; Sun, Laijun			Mechanical Fault Diagnosis for HV Circuit Breakers Based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition Energy Entropy and Support Vector Machine	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								During the operation process of the high voltage circuit breaker, the changes of vibration signals can reflect the machinery states of the circuit breaker. The extraction of the vibration signal feature will directly influence the accuracy and practicability of fault diagnosis. This paper presents an extraction method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Firstly, the original vibration signals are decomposed into a finite number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, calculating the envelope of each IMF and separating the envelope by equal-time segment and then forming equal-time segment energy entropy to reflect the change of vibration signal are performed. At last, the energy entropies could serve as input vectors of support vector machine (SVM) to identify the working state and fault pattern of the circuit breaker. Practical examples show that this diagnosis approach can identify effectively fault patterns of HV circuit breaker.

J	Fei, SW; He, Y				Fei, Sheng-wei; He, Yong			Fault Diagnosis of Bearing Based on Cauchy Kernel Relevance Vector Machine Classifier with SIWPSO	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; PSO	Bearing is an important component of mechanical system; any defects of bearing will lead to serious damage for the entire mechanical system. In this paper, Cauchy kernel relevance vector machine with stochastic inertia weight particle swarm optimization algorithm (SIWPSO-CauchyRVM) is proposed to fault diagnosis for bearing. As the selection of the Cauchy kernel parameter has a certain influence on the diagnosis result of relevance vector machine, stochastic inertia weight PSO is used to select the Cauchy kernel parameter. The relative energies of 16 wavelet coefficients of the forth layer of vibration signal of bearing can be used as the diagnosis features of bearing. The experimental results indicate that fault diagnosis method of bearing based on SIWPSO-CauchyRVM has excellent diagnosis ability.

As working under adverse environment, the performances of slurry pumps are often degraded or the pump system even fails unexpectedly. Therefore, significant resources are invested in programs maintenance to avoid unscheduled downtimes and ensure that the required performance of system is maintained at the maximum efficiency. This work is developed from a particular need in oil-mining industry to monitor the health of slurry pumps. In this study, relevance vector machines (RVM) are utilized to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of field impellers combined with two-summed exponential function. To solve the non-stationary problem emerged in the data, a novel feature extracting process is designed. Finally, one field dataset is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed prognosis model. The application result shows good performance on degradation trend and remaining useful life prediction of the pump impellers. Hence the model can well solve the problem when to replace the related components before they area absolutely out of service to avoid the sudden downtime.

Unfortunately, an air-conditioner has many parameters in it, i.e., inlet temperature, outlet temperature of a condenser or an evaporator, pressure of each component and input power for a compressor and so on. Furthermore, it is very difficult to identify failures in an air-conditioner because of small difference of parameters between normal and abnormal condition. In this paper, we proposed diagnosis technique by using support vector machine (SVM) with identified system parameters by ARX model. Because dynamic property of an air-conditioner identified by ARX model did not depend on operation condition, i.e., room temperature, outside temperature, our proposed technique did not need a lot of data. Finally, our proposed technique well identified the clogging in heat exchanger very well.

This would cause the continuous wear of the components, especially the impeller, in the pumps. As a result, the efficiency and useful life will be greatly reduced. Every unexpected failure of slurry pumps could cost companies high up to millions of dollars. To avoid this problem, traditional scheduled maintenance strategies are usually adopted but it can not warn the impending failure and sometimes the components are replaced when they are still in healthy status. Consequently, effective condition monitoring and online health status assessment methods are of great significance and should be developed to conduct timely and effective slurry pump fault diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, an effective data driven technique for estimating the remaining useful life of slurry pumps are developed based on the health status probability estimation obtained by Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The signals collected by the sensors installed on an industrial slurry pump are used for analysis.

This chapter focuses on wavelet enveloping, and proposes an enhanced envelope demodulation method, called multi-scale manifold (MSM), for machinery fault diagnosis. The MSM addresses manifold learning on the high-dimensional wavelet envelopes at multiple scales. Specifically, the proposed method is conducted by three following steps. First, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with complex Morlet wavelet base is introduced to obtain the non-stationary information of the measured signal in time-scale domain. Second, a scale band of interest is selected to include the fault impulse envelope information of measured signal. Third, the manifold learning algorithm is conducted on the wavelet envelopes at selected scales to extract the intrinsic manifold of fault-related impulses. The MSM combines the envelope information of measured signal at multiple scales in a nonlinear approach, and may thus preserve the factual impulses of machinery fault. The new method is especially suited for detecting the fault characteristic frequency of rotating machinery, which is verified by means of a simulation study and a case of practical gearbox fault diagnosis in this chapter.

However, decision making based on these predictions is still an underexplored area of maintenance management. Furthermore, maintenance relies on the availability of spare parts for replacement in order to reduce failure downtime and costs. Accurate predictions of component failure times can be used to improve both maintenance and inventory decisions. During the past decades, several joint maintenance and inventory optimization systems have been studied in literature. Compared to the separate optimization of both models, these publications reported a remarkable improvement on total cost due to joint optimization. However, the inclusion of RUL in joint maintenance and inventory models for multi-component systems has not been considered before. The objective of this chapter is to quantify the added value of predictive information (RUL) in joint maintenance and inventory decision making for multi-component systems considering different levels of inter-component dependence (i.e. economic, structural and stochastic). A dynamic predictive maintenance policy is developed, which optimizes both maintenance and inventory parameters while minimizing the long-term average maintenance and inventory cost per unit time.

This paper describes an approach to autonomously identify if a faulty signal report has been correctly classified. The proposed approach builds on our previous experience in developing embedded intelligent maintenance systems and helps in avoiding the occurrence of "false positive" interpretations, which means, when the maintenance system indicates a possible fault that does not occur. This index would be useful for real-time monitoring and evaluation on fault detection systems, taking into account several degradation model characteristics. In order to validate the proposed methodology a test bench was developed in a lab reproducing some common faults and degradation processes that may occur in the field. The proposed approach makes use of a data acquisition equipment to store information from sensors to monitor specific physical variables from mechanical components such as gears. A test sequence is applied to the valve control actuators with the following steps: a few seconds of faulty free operational cycle sensor data (which means the opening and closing operations are executing without failure) are collected and then a faulty system behavior is emulated changing some mechanical actuator parts to faulty ones. In the faulty emulation case, a malfunction event must be identified and reported by the fault detection system. The preliminary results indicate that the index is extremely useful especially when the degradation stage of a system is below, for example, catastrophic failure or a predefined level.

While Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of the signals can identify exact frequency components in the vibration spectrum easily, conventional wavelet analysis is generally incapable of discriminating closely located frequency components in vibration signals due to overlapping and interference appearing in wavelet results. Wavelet transforms based on wavelet reassignment algorithm to improve time-frequency resolution display is presented in this chapter. The proposed reassigned (modified) Morlet wavelet was tested using simulated signal and experimental data obtained from a multi-stage blades rotor test rig. This study showed that this method was capable of segregating close BPF components which were otherwise lumped together in conventional wavelet analysis display. The reassigned Morlet wavelet analysis was shown to be useful for multi stage blade rubbing diagnosis as well as other general condition monitoring applications such as those for gear and bearing faults diagnosis.

The acoustic emission (AE) signal is very sensitive to rubbing occurrence and development. However, it is still very difficult to identify the rubbing AE signal from other faults AE signals such as crack AE signal, corrosion AE signal and so on. Rubbing AE signal is nonlinear and non-stationary, and Hilbert-Huang transform is powerful in processing nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Then Hilbert-Huang transform is used to extract the instantaneous frequency of the AE signal of rubbing fault.

However, the existence of much background noise in practice makes it difficult to detect the transient impulses. Thus, it is very necessary to de-noise the measured signal and extract the intrinsic machinery fault signal for a reliable fault diagnosis. In this chapter, a novel de-noising method based on the time-frequency manifold (TFM) is proposed. This method mainly includes the following several steps. First, the phase space reconstruction (PSR) is employed to achieve a group of high-dimensional signals. For each dimensional signal, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is then conducted. Third, a suitable band carrying fault information is used for learning the TFM. Finally, the TFM is used to reconstruct the fault signal based on time-frequency synthesis and PSR synthesis. As the TFM has the merits of noise suppression and resolution enhancement to represent the inherent time-frequency structure, the reconstructed fault signal also has satisfactory de-noising effect, as well as good effect of inherent transient feature keeping. The proposed method has been employed to deal with a set of bearing data with rolling-element defect and outer-race defect, and the results show that the method is rather superior to two traditional methods in machinery fault signal de-noising.

Regarding the use of IVHM technology in legacy aircraft, one has to keep in mind that hardware modifications to improve the reliability of components is not normally considered a viable alternative to diagnostic and prognostic tools due to high certification costs. At the same time, the data and expertise gathered over years of operating the aircraft help to estimate much more accurately how different health monitoring tools could impact maintenance activities. Consequently, selecting the optimal combination of health monitoring tools for legacy aircraft is significantly easier than for a new design. While computer simulations of the maintenance process are essential to determine how different IVHM tools generate value for the stakeholders, it is not practicable to simulate all possible combinations in order to select which tools are to be installed. This paper describes a process to reduce their number of toolsets to be simulated starting with the identification of those components that present a higher potential to reduce maintenance costs and times in case their faults could be detected and/or predicted. This is followed by the definition of the minimum required accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic tools for each component. This enables designers to determine which tools-available or still being developed-can be implemented to achieve the expected improvement in maintenance operations. Different combinations of IVHM tools are then subjected to a preliminary risk and cost-benefit analysis. A significantly reduced number of combinations are then simulated to select the optimal blend of technologies.

Correlation dimension can be determined by G-P algorithm and relevant parameters' selection methods are discussed. C-C method is used to calculate the time delay of phase space reconstruction. The example of bearing shows that the correlation of bearing in fault condition is much higher than that in normal condition, which can help to recognize bearing's state and discover bearing's fault promptly.

The two improvements enhance abilities to computed order tracking analysis in terms of better order spectrum resolution and alternative implementation procedure to obtain order spectrum of the signals.

All types of maintenance are determined by the current state of engineering, degree of wear, the duration and conditions of operation. Therefore, various types of maintenance define various financial and time costs. Recent trends in the development of different maintenance strategies are aimed at the creation of self-maintenance and selfrecovery engineering systems. However, to support such systems are required new models and methods of determining the technical state of engineering and its prognosis. That is, each of the stages of engineering object maintenance must be supported by appropriate methods of diagnosis of the condition of engineering objects, methods of accurate prognosis and assessment of time intervals of prognosis reliability. Consequently, the problem of supporting various types of maintenance and the development of appropriate formalisms, methods and algorithms to analyse the condition of object and prognosis for each type of maintenance should be included in the PHM problems. PHM problems should represent the universal concept and system of algorithms and rules, capable also to an estimation of efficiency of chosen strategy maintenance, minimization of cost and reduce operating costs. These necessary methods should diagnose condition at all operation phases and estimate time of achievement of borders of each operation phase. Thus, PHM problems and determining the time hierarchy predictors of engineering conditions become the base for the development of maintenance and self-maintenance, but not only that. The paper is a review of actual problems for PHM in the context of the practice of application of computing clusters, algorithms and scenarios for the organization of the global system of development of self-maintenance systems based on of computing clusters are specified. This review is based on testing the PHM hierarchical models and algorithms for the pilot version of the PHM cluster at the analysis of failures of internal combustion engines and mechanisms of high complexity.

Facing with such cases, the missing data is usually ignored or even the whole group of data is abandoned. And the loss of valuable information may leads to inaccurate result in the following work. At present, there are various imputation methods have been applied to handling missing data in the field of statistics. These methods estimate the missing values by utilizing the observed data. Unlike most statistical data, degradation data changes over time. But the observed degradation data can still provide valuable information for the estimating. It is therefore reasonable to use these imputation methods to deal with the missing degradation data. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the possibility of using these methods for estimating missing values in degradation data. The missing mechanisms of degradation data are studied at first. Then three of the most widely used imputation methods are researched and used. And comparisons are carried out to show the efficiency of the three methods.

In order to use the quantitative information and qualitative knowledge efficiently to predict the fault, a new model is proposed on the basis of belief rule base (BRB). Moreover, an evidential reasoning (ER) based optimal algorithm is developed to train the fault prediction model. The screw failure in computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine servo system is taken as an example and the fault prediction results show that the proposed method can predict the behavior of the system accurately with combining qualitative knowledge and some quantitative information.

Health monitoring of rotating machines is important to avoid failure of the system in advance. Principally, this paper consists of two parts: in the first part, a gear dynamic model including localized tooth defect has been developed. The model consists of a spur gear pair, two inertias. The model incorporates the effects of time-varying mesh stiffness and damping, excitation due to gear errors. The results of a dynamic modeling of the gears transmission are calculated by using the Newmark integration scheme. The second part consists of signal processing of simulated and experimental signals using the wavelet transform. It is shown that the kurtosis of the vibration signal is a sensitive indicator of the existence of damage in the gear pair.

J	Nguyen, DN; Dieulle, L; Grall, A				Danh Ngoc Nguyen; Dieulle, Laurence; Grall, Antoine			Remaining Useful Lifetime Prognosis of Controlled Systems: A Case of Stochastically Deteriorating Actuator	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; TOLERANT CONTROL-SYSTEM; MODEL; DEGRADATION	This paper addresses the case of automatic controlled system which deteriorates during its operation because of components' wear or deterioration. Depending on its specific closed-loop structure, the controlled system has the ability to compensate for disturbances affecting the actuators which can remain partially hidden. The deterioration modeling and the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) estimation for such closed-loop dynamic system have not been addressed extensively. In this paper, we consider a controlled system with Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller. It is assumed that the actuator is subject to shocks that occur randomly in time. An integrated model is proposed to jointly describe the state of the controlled process and the actuator deterioration. Only the output of the controlled system is available to assess its health condition. By considering a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process, the RUL of the system can be estimated by a two-step approach. In the first step referred as the "Diagnosis" step, the system state is estimated online from the available monitoring observations by using a particle filtering method. In the second step referred as the "Prognosis" step, the RUL is estimated as a conditional reliability by Monte Carlo simulation. To illustrate the approach, a simulated tank level control system is used.

J	Ma, J; Xu, JN				Ma, Jie; Xu, Jianan			Fault Prediction Algorithm for Multiple Mode Process Based on Reconstruction Technique	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ONLINE MONITORING STRATEGY; IDENTIFICATION; BATCH; DIAGNOSIS	In the framework of fault reconstruction technique, this paper studies the problems of multiple mode process fault detection, fault estimation, and fault prediction systematically based on multi-PCA model. First, a multi-PCA model is used for fault detection in steady state process under different conditions, while a weighted algorithm is applied to transition process. Then, describe the faults quantitatively and use the optimization method to derive the fault amplitude under the sense of fault reconstruction. Fault amplitude drifts under different conditions even if the same fault occurs. To solve the above problem, consistent estimation algorithm of fault amplitude under different conditions has been studied. Last, employ the support vector machine (SVM) to predict the trend of the fault amplitude. Effectiveness of the algorithms proposed in this paper has been verified using Tennessee Eastman process as the study object.

In order to monitor and diagnose the EGT effectively, a fusion approach based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classification model is proposed in this paper. Considering the distribution characteristics of gas turbine EGT, FCM clustering algorithm is used to realize clustering analysis and obtain the state pattern, on the basis of which the preclassification of EGT is completed. Then, SVM multiclassification model is designed to carry out the state pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. As an example, the historical monitoring data of EGT from an industrial gas turbine is analyzed and used to verify the performance of the fusion fault diagnosis approach presented in this paper. The results show that this approach can make full use of the unsupervised feature extraction ability of FCM clustering algorithm and the sample classification generalization properties of SVM multiclassification model, which offers an effective way to realize the online condition recognition and fault diagnosis of gas turbine EGT.

When the conflict of evidence is too big, it will result in uncertainty of diagnosis. This paper presents a diagnosis method for rotation machinery fault based on dimensionless indexes combined with K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. This method uses a KNN algorithm and an evidence fusion theoretical formula to process fuzzy data, incomplete data, and accurate data. This method can transfer the signals from the petrochemical rotating machinery sensors to the reliability manners using dimensionless indexes and KNN algorithm. The input information is further integrated by an evidence synthesis formula to get the final data. The type of fault will be decided based on these data. The experimental results show that the proposed method can integrate data to provide a more reliable and reasonable result, thereby reducing the decision risk.

This leads to incompleteness for training sample types and furthermore a decrease of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, the relationship between sample-type incompleteness and the classifier-based diagnostic accuracy is discussed first. Then, a support vector data description-based approach, which has taken the effects of sample-type incompleteness into consideration, is proposed to refine the construction of fault regions and increase the diagnostic accuracy for the condition of incomplete sample types. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on both a Gaussian distributed dataset and a practical dataset. Satisfactory results have been obtained.

J	Yu, CQ; Jiang, C				Yu, Chuanqiang; Jiang, Cheng			A Well-Designed Parameter Estimation Method for Lifetime Prediction of Deteriorating Systems with Both Smooth Degradation and Abrupt Damage	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMPETING FAILURE PROCESSES; MAINTENANCE POLICIES; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; MODEL; PROGNOSIS; SUBJECT	Deteriorating systems, which are subject to both continuous smooth degradation and additional abrupt damage due to a shock process, can be often encountered in engineering. Modeling the degradation evolution and predicting the lifetime of this kind of systems are both interesting and challenging in practice. In this paper, we model the degradation trajectory of the deteriorating system by a random coefficient regression (RCR) model with positive jumps, where the RCR part is used to model the continuous smooth degradation of the system and the jump part is used to characterize the abrupt damage due to random shocks. Based on a specified threshold level, the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the lifetime can be derived analytically. The unknown parameters associated with the derived lifetime distributions can be estimated via a well-designed parameter estimation procedure on the basis of the available degradation recordings of the deteriorating systems. An illustrative example is finally provided to demonstrate the implementation and superiority of the newly proposed lifetime prediction method. The experimental results reveal that our proposed lifetime prediction method with the dedicated parameter estimation strategy can get more accurate lifetime predictions than the rival model in literature.

To achieve training and testing data for the models, four field tests were presented, especially for the vibration in Y-direction of lower generator bearing (LGB) and pressure in draft tube (DT). A heuristic method such as a neural network using Backpropagation (NNBP) is introduced as a comparison model to examine the feasibility of forecasting performance.

In recent years, PHM has emerged as an essential approach for achieving competitive advantages in the global market by improving reliability, maintainability, safety, and affordability. Concepts and components in PHM have been developed separately in many areas such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and statistical science, under varied names. In this paper, we provide a concise review of mainstream methods in major aspects of the PHM framework, including the updated research from both statistical science and engineering, with a focus on data-driven approaches. Real world examples have been provided to illustrate the implementation of PHM in practice.

We demonstrate that the proposed technique contributes to the solution of an open research problem: to design a robust FDI procedure, correctly functioning with different operating conditions and fault sizes, specifically settled for an electric generation system based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). By using a quantitative model of the generation system coupled to an optimized SVM classifier, a satisfactory FDI procedure is achieved, which is robust against modeling and measurement errors and is compliant with practical deployment.

However, applications for DNA devices are thought to be limited by rapid enzymatic degradation in serum and blood. Here, we demonstrate that a key aspect of DNA nanotechnology-programmable molecular shape-plays a substantial role in device lifetimes. These results establish the ability to operate synthetic DNA devices in the presence of endogenous enzymes and challenge the textbook view of near instantaneous degradation.

Recognition of contact states between parts during robotized part mating represents a significant element of the system for active compliant robot motion. All proposed information machines for contact states recognition will recognize one of the possible contact states even when irregular events in the process occur, and the active motion planner will continue to send commands to robot controller according to the planned trajectory. Design/methodology/approach - The presented framework is based on the general theory of automata and formal languages. Starting from possible regular contact states transitions in part mating, the authors create an automaton for diagnostics, which, besides regular, accepts all irregular (observable and unobservable) process sequences. Findings - Contact states do not appear arbitrarily during regular processes, but in certain context. Theory of automata represents a solid basis for contextual recognition and diagnosis of irregularities in part mating. Research limitations/implications - The proposed methodology is elaborated and experimentally verified using an example of cylindrical part mating, and stick-slip effect as an observable irregularity. The future work will address the generation of diagnosers for other types of part mating tasks and extension of the set of observable irregularities. Practical implications - The process diagnosis increases the robustness of active compliant motion system. Originality/value - Although very important feedback information provider for active motion planner, part mating process monitoring was not frequently addressed in the past. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology for generation of part mating process diagnoser that is based on general automata theory.

The paper presents multidisciplinary technologies devoted to development and implementation of methods and systems that realize inspection and damage detection by non-destructive methods. The paper covers several disciplines which are based on topics such as piezoelectric transducers, elastic waves propagation phenomenon, structural vibrations analysis, electro-mechanical impedance method, terahertz technique, laser induced fluorescence and 3D laser vibrometry applications. Among various techniques available the paper presents selected numerical simulations and experimental validations of considered structures. Authors address also the problem of adhesive bonding in the case of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Techniques for detection of weak bonds are presented together with signal processing approaches. The reported investigations concern weak adhesive bonds caused by both manufacturing (e.g. release agent, poor curing) and in-service contaminations (e.g. moisture). Also the paper provides helpful information about dispersion, mode conversion and wave scattering from stiffeners and boundaries. It addresses the problem of optimisation of excitation signal parameters and sensor placement, as well as analysis of signals reflected from damage. It also includes a variety of techniques being related to diagnostics (damage size estimation and damage type recognition) and prognostics.

J	Takacs, G; Vachalek, J; Rohal'-Ilkiv, B				Takacs, Gergely; Vachalek, Jan; Rohal'-Ilkiv, Boris			Online Structural Health Monitoring and Parameter Estimation for Vibrating Active Cantilever Beams Using Low-Priced Microcontrollers	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DAMAGE DETECTION; CRACK DETECTION; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEM	This paper presents a structural health monitoring and parameter estimation system for vibrating active cantilever beams using low-cost embedded computing hardware. The actuator input and the measured position are used in an augmented nonlinear model to observe the dynamic states and parameters of the beam by the continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (EKF). The presence of undesirable structural change is detected by variations of the first resonance estimate computed from the observed equivalent mass, stiffness, damping, and voltage-force conversion coefficients. A fault signal is generated upon its departure from a predetermined nominal tolerance band. The algorithm is implemented using automatically generated and deployed machine code on an electronics prototyping platform, featuring an economically feasible 8-bit microcontroller unit (MCU). The validation experiments demonstrate the viability of the proposed system to detect sudden or gradual mechanical changes in real-time, while the functionality on low-cost miniaturized hardware suggests a strong potential for mass-production and structural integration. The modest computing power of the microcontroller and automated code generation designates the proposed system only for very flexible structures, with a first dominant resonant frequency under 4Hz; however, a code-optimized version certainly allows much stiffer structures or more complicated models on the same hardware.

With a machine learning technique known as function approximation, we use a neural network to gain insight to how known contributors, such as those collected with scanner metrology, influence the on product overlay budget. The result is a sufficiently trained function that can approximate overlay for all wafers exposed with the lithography system. As a real world application, inline metrology can be used to measure overlay for a few wafers while using the trained function to approximate overlay vector maps for the entire lot of wafers. With the approximated overlay vector maps for all wafers coming off the track, a process engineer can redirect wafers or lots with overlay signatures outside the standard population to offline metrology for excursion validation. With this added flexibility, engineers will be given more opportunities to catch wafers that need to be reworked, resulting in improved yield. The quality of the derived corrections from measured overlay metrology feedback can be improved using the approximated overlay to trigger, which wafers should or shouldn't be, measured inline. As a development or integration engineer the approximated overlay can be used to gain insight into lots and wafers used for design of experiments (DOE) troubleshooting. In this paper we will present the results of a case study that follows the machine learning function approximation approach to data analysis, with production overlay measured on an inline metrology system at SK hynix.

The diagnosis is performed by a pathologist based on the morphological features in the image of a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue sample. This manuscript proposes algorithms to perform morphometric analysis on the H&E images, quantify the features in the images, and discriminate bladder cancers with different grades, i.e. high grade and low grade. The nuclei are separated from the background and other types of cells such as red blood cells (RBCs) and immune cells using manual outlining, color deconvolution and image segmentation. A mask of nuclei is generated for each image for quantitative morphometric analysis. The features of the nuclei in the mask image including size, shape, orientation, and their spatial distributions are measured. To quantify local clustering and alignment of nuclei, we propose a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) algorithm which measures nearest neighbor distance and nearest neighbor parallelism. The global distributions of the features are measured using statistics of the proposed parameters. A linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is used to classify the high grade and low grade bladder cancers. The results show using a particular group of nuclei such as large ones, and combining multiple parameters can achieve better discrimination. This study shows the proposed approach can potentially help expedite pathological diagnosis by triaging potentially suspicious biopsies.

Now, condition-based maintenance of train axle box bearing has been a research hotspot around the world. Vibration signals generated by train axle box bearing have nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics. The methods used in traditional bearing fault diagnosis do not work well with the train axle box. To solve this problem, an effective method of axle box bearing fault diagnosis based on multifeature parameters is presented in this paper. This method can be divided into three parts, namely, weak fault signal extraction, feature extraction, and fault recognition. In the first part, a db4 wavelet is employed for denoising the original signals from the vibration sensors. In the second part, five time-domain parameters, five IMF energy-torque features, and two amplitude-ratio features are extracted. The latter seven frequency domain features are calculated based on the empirical mode decomposition and envelope spectrum analysis. In the third part, a fault classifier based on BP neural network is designed for automatic fault pattern recognition. A series of tests are carried out to verify the proposed method, which show that the accuracy is above 90%.

Their state conditions are very important for safety and normal operation of entire nuclear power plant. Vibration based condition monitoring is more complicated for the gear and bearing of planetary gearbox than those of fixed-axis gearbox. Many theoretical and engineering challenges in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis have not yet been resolved which are of great importance for nuclear power plants. A detailed vibration condition monitoring review of planetary gearbox used in nuclear power plants is conducted in this paper. A new fault diagnosis method of planetary gearbox gears is proposed. Bearing fault data, bearing simulation data, and gear fault data are used to test the new method. Signals preprocessed using dilation-erosion gradient filter and fast Fourier transform for fault information extraction. The length of structuring element (SE) of dilation-erosion gradient filter is optimized by alpha stable distribution. Method experimental verification confirmed that parameter alpha is superior compared to kurtosis since it can reflect the form of entire signal and it cannot be influenced by noise similar to impulse.

DETECTION OF NON-LINEAR SIGNAL DISTORTIONS DUE TO EXTERNAL IMPULSE STIMULATIONS IN ROLLING BEARING EXPERIMENTAL DEVICE	Journal of the Balkan Tribological Association			English	Article						ball bearings; diagnostic methodology; Hilbert Huang Transform; machinery mounting; Zhao-Atlas-Marks-Distribution		Machinery diagnostics is an important research area that requires inter-disciplinary expertise. Typically, machines operate in complicated, uncertain and varying environments. A good diagnostic methodology is expected to work accurately in tough conditions. Early and accurate fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings is important for improving mechanical system reliability and performance. Signals, even from experimental setups, let alone from industrial machinery monitoring and control, can be interfered by environmental noise. A worst-case condition is impulsive noise, caused by external stimulations, e.g. hydraulic hummers; it can cause strong and complicated interferences and it can lead to erroneous conclusion concerning the performance of the ball bearing. On the other hand, avoiding external stimulations by employing optimised machinery mounting, although vital, is not always possible in an industrial environment. The aim of this project is to analyse and assess the mounting of the experimental device to estimate non-linear signal distortions due to external impulse stimulations. Therefore, two signal processing methods are employed, the Zhao-Atlas-Marks time-frequency distribution (ZAMD) and the Hilbert Huang transform (HHT) to analyse non-stationary signals obtained from a ball bearing testing setup. Comparative results are provided by applying the two methods on vibration signals derived by the testing setup under an external stimulation.

However, as the decomposition process is sensitive to noise, there is a distinct limit when it is applied to analysis of the vibration signals of machinery with serious background noise. An improved LMD algorithm based on extracting the extrema of envelope curve is put forward to reduce the influence of high-frequency noise effectively. To verify its effect, three different de-noising methods i.e. band-pass filter method, wavelet method and lift wavelet method are respectively used. And the comparison result of the 4 methods shows that the proposed method has satisfactory reproducibility. Then the new algorithm is applied to real bearing signal, and experimental results show that it is effective and reliable. The method also has certain significance for the subsequent eigenvector research in intelligent fault diagnosis.

From almost any type of industrial applications to intelligent vehicles, smart city applications, and healthcare applications, we see a steady growth of the usage of various types of sensors. The rate of increase in the amount of data produced by these sensors is much more dramatic since sensors usually continuously produce data. It becomes crucial for these data to be stored for future reference and to be analyzed for finding valuable information, such as fault diagnosis information. In this paper we describe a scalable and distributed architecture for sensor data collection, storage, and analysis. The system uses several open source technologies and runs on a cluster of virtual servers. We use GPS sensors as data source and run machine-learning algorithms for data analysis.

Firstly, the nonlinear and nonstationary vibration signal produced by local faults of roller bearing is decomposed into intrinsic scale components (ISCs) by using local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) method and initial feature vector matrices are obtained. Secondly, fault feature values are extracted by singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to obtain singular values, while avoiding the selection of reconstruction parameters. Thirdly, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier based on Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) algorithm, called CRO-SVM method, is designed for classification of fault location. Lastly, the proposed method is validated by two experimental datasets.

J	Guesmi, H; Ben Salem, S; Bacha, K				Guesmi, Hattab; Ben Salem, Samira; Bacha, Khmais			Smart wireless sensor networks for online faults diagnosis in induction machine	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						WSN; Induction motor; Fault diagnosis; Smart sensor; MCSA; Online monitoring	MOTORS; ECCENTRICITY	Online induction machine faults diagnosis is a concern to guarantee the overall production process efficiency. Nowadays, the industry demands the integration of smart wireless sensors networks (WSN) to improve the fault detection in order to reduce cost, maintenance and power consumption. Induction motors,can develop one or more faults at the same time that can produce sever damages. The origin of most recurrent faults in rotary machines is in the components: stator, rotor, bearing and others. This work presents a novel methodology for the online faults diagnosis in induction motors. This technique uses the smart WSN to obtain the machine condition based on the motor stator current analysis. The implementation of the proposed smart sensor methodology allows the system to perform online fault detection in a fully automated way. Simulation results presented show the efficiency of the proposed method to detect simple and multiple faults in induction machine. It provides detailed analysis to address challenges in designing and deploying WSNs in industrial environments, and its reliability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this research is to use artificial neural network (ANN) computational modelling to correlate spur gear data from acoustic emissions, lubricant temperature, and specific film thickness (lambda). The approach is using an algorithm to monitor the oil film thickness and to detect which lubrication regime the gearbox is running either hydrodynamic, elastohydrodynamic, or boundary. This monitoring can aid identification of fault development. Feed-forward and recurrent Elman neural network algorithms were used to develop ANN models, which are subjected to training, testing, and validation process. The Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation algorithm was applied to reduce errors. Log-sigmoid and Purelin were identified as suitable transfer functions for hidden and output nodes. The methods used in this paper shows accurate predictions from ANN and the feed-forward network performance is superior to the Elman neural network.

The wavelet representation of a function is a new technique. Wavelet transform of a function is the improved version of Fourier transform. Fourier transform is a powerful tool for analyzing the components of a stationary signal. But it is failed for analyzing the non-stationary signal whereas wavelet transform allows the components of a non-stationary signal to be analyzed. In this paper, our main goal is to find out the advantages of wavelet transform compared to Fourier transform in rotor failure diagnosis of induction motors.

J	Kalkat, M				Kalkat, Menderes			Investigations on the effect of oil quality on gearboxes using neural network predictors	INDUSTRIAL LUBRICATION AND TRIBOLOGY			English	Article						Neural networks; Oils; Acceleration analysis; Fault detection; Gearbox		Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to perform an experimental investigation to analyze vibration and noise of unloaded gearbox with different oil quality. All motor-driven machinery used in the modern world can develop faults. The maintenance plans include analyzing the external relevant information of critical components, in order to evaluate its internal state. From the beginning of the twentieth century, different technologies have been used to process signals of dynamical systems. Design/methodology/approach - A proposed neural network (NN) is also employed to predict vibration parameters of the experimental test rig. Moreover, four types of oils are used for gearbox to predict reliable oil. Vibration signals extracted from rotating parts of machineries carry lot many information within them about the condition of the operating machine. Further processing of these raw vibration signatures measured at a convenient location of the machine unravels the condition of the component or the assembly under study. The experimental stand for testing an unloaded gearbox is composed by actuated direct current (DC) driving system. Findings - This paper deals with the effectiveness of wavelet-based features for fault diagnosis of a gearbox using two types of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and stress analyzed with computer-based software ANNs. The results improved that the proposed NN has superior performance to adapt experimental results. Practical implications - This paper is one such attempt to apply machine learning methods like ANN. This work deals with extraction of wavelet features from the vibration data of a gearbox system and classification of gear faults using ANNs. Originality/value - These kind of NN-based approaches are novel approaches to predict real-time vibration and acceleration parameters of unloaded gearbox with five types of oils.

J	Saidi, L; Ben Ali, J; Friaiech, F				Saidi, Lotfi; Ben Ali, Jaouher; Friaiech, Farhat			Application of higher order spectral features and support vector machines for bearing faults classification	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Bi-spectrum analysis; Feature extraction; Bearing defects; Principal component analysis; Support vector machine; Vibration analysis; Receiver operating characteristic	DIAGNOSIS; COMBINATION	Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings timely and accurately are very important to ensure the reliability of rotating machinery. This paper presents a novel pattern classification approach for bearings diagnostics, which combines the higher order spectra analysis features and support vector machine classifier. The use of non-linear features motivated by the higher order spectra has been reported to be a promising approach to analyze the non-linear and non-Gaussian characteristics of the mechanical vibration signals. The vibration bi-spectrum (third order spectrum) patterns are extracted as the feature vectors presenting different bearing faults. The extracted bi-spectrum features are subjected to principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. These principal components were fed to support vector machine to distinguish four kinds of bearing faults covering different levels of severity for each fault type, which were measured in the experimental test bench running under different working conditions. In order to find the optimal parameters for the multi-class support vector machine model, a grid-search method in combination with 10-fold cross-validation has been used. Based on the correct classification of bearing patterns in the test set, in each fold the performance measures are computed. The average of these performance measures is computed to report the overall performance of the support vector machine classifier. In addition, in fault detection problems, the performance of a detection algorithm usually depends on the trade-off between robustness and sensitivity. The sensitivity and robustness of the proposed method are explored by running a series of experiments. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve made the results more convincing. The results indicated that the proposed method can reliably identify different fault patterns of rolling element bearings based on vibration signals. (C) 2014 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we propose Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMMs) with (i) no constraints on the state duration density function and (ii) being applied to continuous or discrete observation. To deal with such a type of HSMM, we also propose modifications to the learning, inference, and prediction algorithms. Finally, automatic model selection has been made possible using the Akaike Information Criterion. This paper describes the theoretical formalization of the model as well as several experiments performed on simulated and real data with the aim of methodology validation. In all performed experiments, the model is able to correctly estimate the current state and to effectively predict the time to a predefined event with a low overall average absolute error. As a consequence, its applicability to real world settings can be beneficial, especially where in real time the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of the machine is calculated.

Both this kind of changing operational conditions and machine fault could make the mechanical vibration characteristics change. Therefore, effective health monitoring method for rotating machinery must be able to adjust during the change of operational conditions. This paper presents an adaptive threshold model for the health monitoring of bearings under changing operational conditions. Relevance vector machines (RVMs) are used for regression of the relationships between the adaptive parameters of the threshold model and the statistical characteristics of vibration features. The adaptive threshold model is constructed based on these relationships. The health status of bearings can be indicated via detecting whether vibration features exceed the adaptive threshold. This method is validated on bearings running at changing speeds. The monitoring results show that this method is effective as long as the rotational speed is higher than a relative small value.

J	Voigt, T; Flad, S; Struss, P				Voigt, Tobias; Flad, Stefan; Struss, Peter			Model-based fault localization in bottling plants	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Model-based fault localization; Automatic fault diagnosis; Consistency-based diagnosis; Bottling plant; Packaging line	DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; LINES	The bottling of beverages is carried out in complex plants that consist of several machines and material flows. To realize an efficient bottling process and high quality products, operators try to avoid plant downtimes. With actual non-productive times of between 10% and 60%, the operators require diagnosis tools that allow them to locate plant components that cause downtime by exploiting automatically acquired machine data. This paper presents a model-based solution for automatic fault diagnosis in bottling plants. There are currently only a few plant-specific solutions (based on statistical calculations or artificial neural networks) for automatic bottling plant diagnosis. In order to develop a customizable solution, we followed the model-based diagnosis approach which allows the automatic generation of diagnosis solutions for individual plants. The existing stochastic and discrete-event models for bottling plants are not adequate for model-based diagnosis. Therefore, we developed new first-principle models for the relevant plant components, validated them numerically, and abstracted them to qualitative diagnosis models. Based on the diagnosis engine OCCM Rafr, application systems for two real plants and one virtual plant (based on discrete-event simulation) were generated and evaluated. Compared to the reasons for downtime identified by experts, we obtained up to 87.1% of compliant diagnosis results. The diagnosis solution was tested by practitioners and judged as a useful tool for plant optimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jerkan, D; Marcetic, D				Jerkan, Dejan; Marcetic, Darko			Advanced model of IM including rotor slot harmonics	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Finite element analysis; Induction motor; Fourier series of inductance matrix; Multiple coupled circuits; Rotor slot harmonics; Time-stepping FEA	INDUCTION MACHINES; STATOR; ECCENTRICITY; MOTORS	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a detailed advanced dynamical model of induction machine (IM) with unskewed rotor bars, including rotor slot harmonics. Design/methodology/approach - Procedure of IM modeling using results from finite element analysis (FEA). Series of magneto-static FEA simulations are used to obtain matrix of IM inductances as a function of rotor angular position and geometry. Each element in this matrix is represented by Fourier series (FS) and incorporated in proposed dynamical model. Using or neglecting various elements in FS of inductance matrix may be useful for determining which component of the series has dominant influence on harmonic content of stator currents, torque ripple or speed variation. The usefulness of application of presented model is verified comparing with time-stepping FEA simulations. Findings - Although the model is not suitable for usage in on-line regulation of IM drives, but the results of simulations may be used to thoroughly explain origins of higher order harmonics in stator currents of IM and help improve sensorless speed estimation algorithms and fault diagnostics. Originality/value - This paper shows an approach to the modeling of IM which includes effects of non-uniform air gap and non-sinusoidal distributions of magneto-motive forces. Inductance matrix elements are complex functions of rotor position, geometry and winding distributions and it gives an opportunity for detail analysis of IM behavior in numerous applications.

The main objects are: First, ameliorate the reliability of the rotor fault detection task especially under very low load in the presence of industrial frequency inverter. Second, allow even relatively unskilled users to make an automatic, fast and reliable decision on machine health with low requirements. Basing on the concept of multiple signature processing, the proposed algorithm uses Relative Harmonic Indexes (RHI) as a new fault indicator. The RHI are computed starting from many harmonics selected carefully according to their sensitivity to the occurrence of rotor bar faults, this represents its main advantage compared to the classical fault indicators which use only one or two fault signatures leading commonly to erroneous diagnosis especially under low load. The proposed algorithm requires only the stator current signal. For each data acquisition, the algorithm computes, normalises and classifies the RHI then it displays the obtained results in a simple manner. Extensive experimental tests, carried out on a 3 kW squirrel cage induction motor fed from an industrial frequency inverter, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting of rotor bar fault under different operation conditions even with very low loads.

Using this method, the position of minimum air gap of static eccentricity also can be detected. The sideband components around the fundamental frequency of magnetic flux leakage in stator yoke is particularly analyzed based on magnetic circuit. The magnitudes of induced voltage harmonics in search coils are also investigated by finite element method. The algorithm is implemented for a 4-pole three-phase cage induction machine with static, dynamic and mixed eccentricity. It is highlighted that dynamic eccentricity can be detected by any one of the search coils, static eccentricity and the position of minimum air gap can be detected by the magnitudes of induced voltages in all the search coils. The theoretical results have been validated by finite element method.

J	Li, JY; Li, SM; Chen, XH; Wang, LL				Li, Jiyong; Li, Shunming; Chen, Xiaohong; Wang, Lili			The Hybrid KICA-GDA-LSSVM Method Research on Rolling Bearing Fault Feature Extraction and Classification	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; TRANSFORM; PCA	Rolling element bearings are widely used in high-speed rotating machinery; thus proper monitoring and fault diagnosis procedure to avoid major machine failures is necessary. As feature extraction and classification based on vibration signals are important in condition monitoring technique, and superfluous features may degrade the classification performance, it is needed to extract independent features, so LSSVM (least square support vector machine) based on hybrid KICA-GDA (kernel independent component analysis-generalized discriminate analysis) is presented in this study. A new method named sensitive subband feature set design (SSFD) based on wavelet packet is also presented; using proposed variance differential spectrum method, the sensitive subbands are selected. Firstly, independent features are obtained by KICA; the feature redundancy is reduced. Secondly, feature dimension is reduced by GDA. Finally, the projected feature is classified by LSSVM. The whole paper aims to classify the feature vectors extracted from the time series and magnitude of spectral analysis and to discriminate the state of the rolling element bearings by virtue of multiclass LSSVM. Experimental results from two different fault-seeded bearing tests show good performance of the proposed method.

J	Ortac Kabaoglu, R				Ortac Kabaoglu, Rana			A fault detection, diagnosis, and reconfiguration method via support vector machines	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Fault-tolerant control; fault detection and diagnosis; support vector machines; PID controllers; two-tank liquid level system	NOVELTY DETECTION; TOLERANT CONTROL; SYSTEMS; MODEL	This paper presents a fault detection, diagnosis, and reconfiguration method based on support vector machines. This method is appropriate for certain or predetermined faults and involves a fault detection and diagnosis unit and an online controller selection type reconfiguration mechanism. In this method, when a fault is detected and diagnosed by the fault detection and diagnosis unit, a suitable controller, which has been determined via an optimization algorithm in an off-line fashion, is activated to maintain proper closed-loop performance of the system in an on-line manner. In the detection, diagnosis, and reconfiguration stages of the method, support vector classification and regression machines are used and the performance is tested on a simulation model of a two-tank level control system for various fault scenarios.

Recent Advances and Prospects in Condition Monitoring	VIBRATION ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY OF MACHINERY	Mechanisms and Machine Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Vibration Engineering and Technology of Machinery (VETOMAC)	SEP 09-11, 2014	Univ Manchester, Manchester, ENGLAND	Vibrat Inst India	Univ Manchester	Rotating machine; Condition monitoring; System identification; Modelling; Diagnostics	MODEL-BASED IDENTIFICATION; SUPPORTING STRUCTURE; ROTATING MACHINERY; RUN-DOWN; PARAMETERS; BEARINGS; SYSTEM	The underlying reason for pursuing Condition Monitoring activities is to enhance the overall performance of plant either by accurately predicting the end of effective life or by diagnosis and location of incipient faults. The achievement of both these objectives requires the use of a combination of measurement, modelling and statistical techniques, but the balance of these three strands varies with the plant under study. Practitioners of these different disciplines sometimes develop rivalries, but in reality all three are essential. The fundamental problem involved is the determination of the physical process within a machine which cannot be measured directly and so must be inferred from external measurements, the most common of which is vibration. This inference from measurement to diagnosis requires some form of model, whether physics or statistics based. The paper describes some work on the monitoring of large turbines and in particular, the ways in which measurements and models can be combined to enhance insight into a machine's operation. Similarly, our understanding of complex data can be enhanced by the use of Artificial Neural Networks and these can be used to enhance understanding. Combining various approaches leads to some new possibilities which are briefly outlined.

In the present research study, the dynamics of the blades both in the healthy and crack conditions are studies on a small experimental rig using the on-bearing and on-casing vibration, which are measured using the accelerometer on bearing pedestals and on casing cover towards on blades. The measured vibration data are analyzed by computing the responses at different engine orders (EOs) related to the blade resonance frequencies and their higher harmonics to understand the blade(s) dynamics behavior. The observations suggest that the on-bearing and on-casing vibration measurements can be extended to the non-intrusive method for the blade health monitoring (BHM). Comparative study between the on-bearing and on-casing vibrations on the simple experimental rig further allow to understand which method is more effective for blade damage detection.

This was, however, developed on an experimental rig with relatively rigid supports. The objective of the current study is to investigate the transferability of the said approach on rotating machines with relatively flexible supports. A fault diagnosis (FD) method which compares vibration data acquired from similar machines with different flexible supports is also considered here. The experimental rig used in the previous study was modified to accommodate two different relatively flexible supports. The results of the previously proposed technique showed that diagnosis is insensitive to the support types used. The result of the newly introduced combined FD approach gave improved diagnosis over the previously proposed technique. The observations made are presented in this paper.

The current paper is also related to the use of CS, CB and a newly introduced coherent composite trispectrum (CCT) for faults identification in flexibly supported rotating machines. Six experimentally simulated cases have been considered on two sets of flexibly supported (FS1 and FS2) rotating machines, at 1,200 RPM (20 Hz) speed. Vibration data were then collected from both FS1 and FS2, using only four accelerometers (one per bearing pedestal in the diagonal direction), for the computation of CCS, CCB and CCT. Some combinations of CCB and CCT components were then used to further test the robustness of the techniques in rotating machines' faults differentiation. The observations and results of the experiments are hereby discussed here.

The typical application is the fault diagnosis in the anti-friction bearings and gearboxes. Hilbert transformation (HT) is often used to extract the envelope signals (upper and lower) from a time domain signal. However it is observed that the envelope signals obtained by the HT are not always without any error. In this paper, 4 different signals, 3 simulated; sine, amplitude modulated and random, and measured vibration data on anti-friction bearings are analyzed using the HT. The paper compares the accuracy of the envelope data obtained for these different signals using the HT.

It has been shown previously that it is possible to use motor current signature analysis to detect and diagnose this fault in motor drives. However, with a variable speed drive (VSD) system, it becomes difficult to detect faults as the drive compensates for the small changes from fault effects and increased noise in the measured data. In this paper, motor current signatures including dynamic and static data have been investigated for misalignment diagnosis in a VSD system. The study has made a systemic comparison of different control parameters between two common operation modes: open loop and sensorless control. Results show that fault detection features on the motor current from the sensorless mode can be the same as those of the open loop mode, however, the detection and diagnosis is significantly more difficult. In contrast, because of the additional frictional load, features from static data show results of early detection and diagnosis of different degrees of misalignment is as good as that from conventional vibration methods.

A Frequency-Based Criterion for Automatic Selection of the Optimal Intrinsic Mode Function in Diagnostics of Localized Gear Tooth Faults	VIBRATION ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY OF MACHINERY	Mechanisms and Machine Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Vibration Engineering and Technology of Machinery (VETOMAC)	SEP 09-11, 2014	Univ Manchester, Manchester, ENGLAND	Vibrat Inst India	Univ Manchester	Empirical mode decomposition; Intrinsic mode function; Time synchronous average; Gearbox; Diagnostics		To date gearboxes remain one of the most important elements of virtually every power transmission system as far as a continuous operation of the shaft line is concerned. Any failure or breakdown may result in putting the whole production line, supply chain or even peoples life in jeopardy. Endeavours to detect an incipient fault within the system serve multiple purposes from increasing the safety of the people responsible for operating the machines, through to decreasing running and operational costs, allowing time to plan for the inevitable repairs and making sure that the downtime of the machine is kept to an absolute minimum. This, in turn, makes this branch of condition monitoring of rotating machinery one of the most intensively studied. The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a relatively new method of signal decomposition, which breaks the original signal up into a number of so-called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). The decomposition represents a type of adaptive filtering which outputs a number of IMFs which, acquired according to two strict criteria, contain portions of the filtered version of the original signal and so can carry different information about the content of the signal. EMD has already been used in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machinery, but the selection of the optimal IMF for the task often requires the experience of a condition monitoring specialist. This paper proposes a frequency-based tool for automatic selection of the IMF that is best suited for the detection of localized gear tooth faults.

Bearings are subjected to degradation in various manners, e. g. scuffing, pitting, brinelling, electro erosion. In the early stage of degradation, faults emerge on the rolling surface locally. These tiny surface defects are hardly visible but do not cause problems in system operation. As time progresses, the process further deteriorates the rolling surface. The damage on the rolling surface widens in size and becomes distributed fault. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach for detection of distributed bearing faults. It is based on assumption that these faults excite particular vibrational pattern that can make them distinguishable from local faults. For this purpose, a lumped parameter model capable of simulating vibrational response of damaged bearing was adopted. The model was extended by incorporating fluctuations in ball diameter. By analyzing envelope spectra of simulated and measured vibrations we show that vibrational patterns produced by localized and distributed faults differ. The main contribution of the paper is a new feature which combines BPFO (ball pass frequency outer) and FTF (fundamental train frequency) component of the envelope spectrum. A simulation study dealing with broad range of damage propagation scenario is performed in order to assess performance of the proposed features. Finally, validation is performed on the set of damaged bearings.

Two classifiers are used to distinguish cup, cone, and roller defects, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Time domain vibration data is collected from normal bearings, and defective bearings with combinations of cup, cone, and roller defects. Features are used to train both ANNs and SVMs, and performance is compared for both classifiers. Mutual information between time domain features and target classes is computed in order to rank features with the highest relevance. Excellent performance was observed using laboratory data and the trained ANNs and SVMs, with testing accuracy as high as 100 % in some cases.

They can be subjected to various defects which could lead to catastrophic results. This includes inner and outer race defects and hence it is of interest to analyze the system response under such defects. A better understanding of the system performance under such defects can be beneficial when performing system diagnostics and system design. In this paper we are focused on the outer race defect and perform a comparative nonlinear time series analysis of a healthy system and a defective system. We consider various levels of outer race defects. The analysis is based on the recurrence properties of the system in its reconstructed state space. After determining the appropriate time lags through the average mutual information technique and the corresponding embedding dimensions through the false neighbor technique, we perform a sequential analysis of the system by subdividing the time series into bins and investigating the system response through recurrence quantification analysis parameters along with the entropy. This contributes to the enhancement of the science of diagnostics of outer race defects by analyzing the signature of various recurrence quantification analysis parameters as the system goes from a healthy state to a severely defective state.

Multiple Fault Classification Using Support Vector Machine in a Machinery Fault Simulator	VIBRATION ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY OF MACHINERY	Mechanisms and Machine Science		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Vibration Engineering and Technology of Machinery (VETOMAC)	SEP 09-11, 2014	Univ Manchester, Manchester, ENGLAND	Vibrat Inst India	Univ Manchester	Vibration; Rotational speed; Time domain; Compensation distance evaluation technique	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS	The classification of various faults using a fault simulator and support vector machines (SVMs) has been studied. A database is created for number of faults by measuring vibration signals using seven accelerometers mounted on a machinery fault simulator (MFS). Statistical features are extracted in time domain from the vibration signals. Then, the sensitive features are selected using compensation distance evaluation technique. Multi-class SVMs ensemble algorithm is implemented for classification of the various faults by considering SVMs created by the possible combinations of sensitive features for each class of the fault. The effect of distance evaluation criterion for selection of sensitive features amongst the extracted twelve statistical features has been addressed. By using the developed algorithm, the effective location of accelerometer among seven accelerometers for better classification of the faults has been investigated. Measurements are done at five different rotational speeds. The robustness of the developed algorithm has been tested at different speeds.	[Fatima, S.; Mohanty, A. R.; Naikan, V. N.

J	Chongwatpol, J				Chongwatpol, Jongsawas			Prognostic analysis of defects in manufacturing	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Manufacturing; Analytics; Defects; Data mining	DATA MINING APPROACH; YIELD	Purpose-Since works-in-process (WIPs) are highly vulnerable to defects because of the variety and complexity of manufacturing processes, the purpose of this paper is to describe how to utilize existing analytics techniques to reduce defects, improve production processes, and reduce the cost of operations. Design/methodology/approach-Three alternatives for diagnosing causes of defects and variations in the production process are presented in order to answer the following research question: "What are the most important factors to be included in prognostic analysis to prevent defects?" Findings-The key findings for the proposed alternatives help explain the characteristics of defects that have a great impact on manufacturing yield and the quality of products. Consequently, any corrective action and preventive maintenance addressing the common causes of defects and variations in the process can be regularly evaluated and monitored. Research limitations/implications-Although the focus of this study is on improving shop-floor operations by reducing defects, further experimentation with business analytics in other areas such as machine utilization and maintenance, process control, and safety evaluation remains to be done. Practical implications-This study has been validated with several scenarios in a manufacturing company, and the results demonstrate the practical validity of the approach, which is equally applicable to other manufacturing sub-sectors. Originality/value-This study is different from the others by providing alternatives for diagnosing the root causes of defects. Control charts, costs of defects, and clustering-based defect prediction scores are utilized to reduce defects. Additionally, the key contribution of this study is to demonstrate different methods for understanding WIP behaviors and identifying any irregularities in the production process.

Prognosis of the probability of failure in tool condition monitoring application-a time series based approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Tool condition monitoring; Prognostics; Delay coordinate embedding; Bayesian multilayer perceptron	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; SYSTEM; LIFE	Tool condition monitoring (TCM) system serves as the link between the cutting tool condition and the maintenance decision. The recent prognostic system employs highly complex models, which might need long calculation time. This long calculation time is acceptable for machine health prognostics, as machines' maintenance interval is in the unit of month. However, a cutting tool's life varies between minutes to hours. The calculation time might be critical to achieve a valid prognosis. In this paper, a novel prognostic system is proposed for TCM prognostics. This system consists of two parts: (1) online cutting force prediction part and (2) tool wear estimation part. The first part predicts the future cutting force segmentation by projecting the embedded historical cutting force with function approximation methods. Three function approximation methods are compared in the aspect of prediction error and calculation time. It is found that the Saucer's local linear model could achieve the lowest prediction error (4.71 %) and calculation time (2.717 s) compared with global linear model and nonlinear model. The second part estimates the tool wear by inputting the predicted cutting force to a Bayesian-multilayer perceptron. It is found that this system can trace the progress of tool wear accurately (95 % successful rate has been achieved). Moreover, good generalization for different cutting conditions is also achieved.

J	Amarnath, M; Sujatha, C				Amarnath, M.; Sujatha, C.			Surface Contact Fatigue Failure Assessment in Spur Gears Using Lubricant Film Thickness and Vibration Signal Analysis	TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Lubricant; Specific Film Thickness; Spur Gear; Wavelet	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; BREAKDOWN; BEARING; DAMAGE; WEAR	Gears are very common machine elements that are used to transmit power. During power transmission, the gear teeth are subjected to high contact pressure, leading to wear and tear, even though adequate lubrication is used. When gears operate near their maximum load capacity, very high contact pressure occurs at the mesh interference. This may lead to partial breakdown of the lubricant film at the gear teeth contact surface, thereby triggering distributed faults on gear teeth, viz. scuffing, scoring, spalling, pitting, and mild wear. Currently there are three different approaches to the detection of faults in geared systems: vibration analysis, oil/wear particle analysis, and acoustic signal analysis. Generally, in an industrial environment, vibration analysis and oil/wear particle analyses are conducted independently, but of late there are requirements in the diagnostic world for more reliable and effective diagnostic information regarding fault growth in machinery components. In the present work, experimental investigations are carried out to assess surface fatigue wear on spur gear teeth of back-to-back power recirculation-type spur gearbox; in particular, vibration signal analysis using continuous wavelet transform is used in conjunction with specific film thickness studies. Specific film thickness analysis provided details of lubrication regimes in gear teeth contacts and corresponding wear propagation on gear teeth, and the vibration signals acquired from a gear pair are postprocessed using Morlet wavelet transform. Results obtained from the integration of specific film thickness analysis and wavelet transform provide better diagnostic information than the lubricant film thickness estimation alone for detection of gear faults.

According to the progress of patients, we partition 81 ACLF patients into three groups. Group I includes 40 improved patients, group II contains 18 death patients, and group III is composed of 23 unlabeled patients. For the imbalanced characteristic of groups I and II, we construct an imbalanced prediction model based on small sphere and large margin approach (SSLM). SSLM classifies two classes of samples by maximizing their margin and then is an effective classification method for imbalanced data. For groups I, II and III, we present a prediction model based on semi-supervised twin support vector machine (TSVM), which integrates 23 unlabeled samples into the training process and improves testing accuracy. Compared with other three algorithms, our two proposed prediction models produce better testing accuracy. Finally we apply them to predict 23 not confirmed patients, and integrate them with the MELD method to obtain their prediction labels.

J	Inacio, M; Lemos, A; Caminhas, W				Inacio, Maurilio; Lemos, Andre; Caminhas, Walmir			Fault Diagnosis with Evolving Fuzzy Classifier Based on Clustering Algorithm and Drift Detection	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							INFERENCE SYSTEM	The emergence of complex machinery and equipment in several areas demands efficient fault diagnosis methods. Several fault diagnosis methods based on different theories and approaches have been proposed in the literature. According to the concept of intelligent maintenance, the application of intelligent systems to accomplish fault diagnosis from process historical data has been shown to be a promising approach. In problems involving complex nonstationary dynamic systems, an adaptive fault diagnosis system is required to cope with changes in the monitored process. In order to address fault diagnosis in this scenario, use of the so-called "evolving intelligent systems" is suggested. This paper proposes the application of an evolving fuzzy classifier for fault diagnosis based on a new approach that combines a recursive clustering algorithm and a drift detection method. In this approach, the clustering update depends not only on a similarity measure, but also on the monitoring changes in the input data flow. A merging cluster mechanism was incorporated into the algorithm to enable the removal of redundant clusters. Multivariate Gaussian memberships functions are employed in the fuzzy rules to avoid information loss if there is interaction between variables. The novel approach provides greater robustness to outliers and noise present in data from process sensors. The classifier is evaluated in fault diagnosis of a DC drive system. In the experiments, a DC drive system fault simulator was used to simulate normal operation and several faulty conditions. Outliers and noise were added to the simulated data to evaluate the robustness of the fault diagnosis model.

J	Hu, BB; Li, B				Hu, Bingbing; Li, Bing			Blade Crack Detection of Centrifugal Fan Using Adaptive Stochastic Resonance	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; FAILURE; GEARBOX	Centrifugal fans are widely used in various industries as a kind of turbo machinery. Among the components of the centrifugal fan, the impeller is a key part because it is used to transform kinetic energy into pressure energy. Crack in impeller's blades is one of the serious hidden dangers. It is important to detect the cracks in the blades as early as possible. Based on blade vibration signals, this research applies an adaptive stochastic resonance (ASR) method to diagnose crack fault in centrifugal fan. The ASR method, which can utilize the optimization ability of the grid search method and adaptively realize the optimal stochastic resonance system matching input signals, may weaken the noise and highlight weak characteristic and thus can diagnose the fault accurately. A centrifugal fan test rig is established and experiments with three cases of blades are conducted. In comparison with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) analysis and the traditional Fourier transform method, the experiment verified the effectiveness of the current method in blade crack detection.

J	Gao, HZ; Liang, L; Chen, XG; Xu, GH				Gao Huizhong; Liang Lin; Chen Xiaoguang; Xu Guanghua			Feature Extraction and Recognition for Rolling Element Bearing Fault Utilizing Short-Time Fourier Transform and Non-negative Matrix Factorization	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						time-frequency distribution; non-negative matrix factorization; rolling element bearing; feature extraction	ROTATING MACHINERY; DIAGNOSIS; RECONSTRUCTION; SEPARATION; MODEL	Due to the non-stationary characteristics of vibration signals acquired from rolling element bearing fault, the time-frequency analysis is often applied to describe the local information of these unstable signals smartly. However, it is difficult to classify the high dimensional feature matrix directly because of too large dimensions for many classifiers. This paper combines the concepts of time-frequency distribution(TFD) with non-negative matrix factorization(NMF), and proposes a novel TFD matrix factorization method to enhance representation and identification of bearing fault. Throughout this method, the TFD of a vibration signal is firstly accomplished to describe the localized faults with short-time Fourier transform(STFT). Then, the supervised NMF mapping is adopted to extract the fault features from TFD. Meanwhile, the fault samples can be clustered and recognized automatically by using the clustering property of NMF. The proposed method takes advantages of the NMF in the parts-based representation and the adaptive clustering. The localized fault features of interest can be extracted as well. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the 9 kinds of the bearing fault on a test bench is performed. The proposed method can effectively identify the fault severity and different fault types. Moreover, in comparison with the artificial neural network(ANN), NMF yields 99.3% mean accuracy which is much superior to ANN. This research presents a simple and practical resolution for the fault diagnosis problem of rolling element bearing in high dimensional feature space.

J	Baraldi, P; Mangili, F; Zio, E				Baraldi, Piero; Mangili, Francesca; Zio, Enrico			A prognostics approach to nuclear component degradation modeling based on Gaussian Process Regression	PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY			English	Article						Remaining useful life; Prognostics; Bayesian inference; Gaussian Process Regression; Creep; Filter clogging	SYSTEM	Advanced diagnostics and prognostics tools are expected to play an important role in ensuring safe and long term operation in nuclear power plants. In this context, we use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to build a stochastic model of the equipment degradation evolution and apply it for prognostics. GPR is a probabilistic technique for non-linear non-parametric regression that estimates the distribution of the future equipment degradation states by constraining a prior distribution to fit the available training data, based on Bayesian inference. Training data are taken from sequences of degradation measures collected from a set of similar historical equipment which have undergone a similar degradation process. Given new degradation measures from a currently degrading equipment (test trajectory), the distribution of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) before failure is estimated by comparing with a failure criterion the distribution of the future degradation states predicted by GPR. Applications are shown on simulated data concerning the evolution of creep damage in ferritic steel exposed to high stress and on real data concerning the clogging of sea water filters placed upstream the heat exchangers of a BWR condenser.

The analysis of no-load and loading operations shows the potential fault-tolerance capability. On the basis of comparative analysis on structure characteristics between five-phase non-FTDSEG (NFTDSEG) and five-phase FTDSEG, the variation of rotor pole number from NFTDSEG to FTDSEG is revealed. Meanwhile, the flux linkage and electromotive forces (EMFs) of five-phase NFTDSEG and five-phase FTDSEG are investigated with finite element method and five faults of five-phase FTDSEG are analysed in detail. Especially when single phase short-circuit fault happens, the magnetic field of the motor, flux linkage of short-circuit phase and short-circuit currents without load are investigated in four different short-circuit moments and the fault is in consideration of armature winding resistance. The ultimate variation trend of flux linkage is irrelevant to moment when the short-circuit fault happens. The flux linkage and EMF of short-circuit phase are also analysed. The laws of fault operating influence on external and power characteristics of FTDSEG are researched in five faults with different exciting currents. The fault-tolerant ability of five-phase FTDSEG has been demonstrated by the experimental results.

In this paper, independent component analysis with reference method is proposed to extract the fault features using reference signals established based on the a priori knowledge of machine faults; experimental studies based on both simulated and actual fault signals of rotating machinery have been performed; and the results show that the proposed approach can effectively extract fault features under the situation of interferences and coexistence of multiple faults.

Athula			D-Q Current Signature-Based Faulted Phase Localization for SM-PMAC Machine Drives	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						AC motor drives; fault detection; fault diagnosis; open circuit fault	TOLERANT CONTROL; DIAGNOSIS; INVERTER	Fault diagnostic algorithms in motor drives prevent damage to the motor, drive, and overall system by providing an additional level of safety. A single phase open (SPO) fault in a field-oriented controlled drive is one of the perilous faults that require immediate detection due to resulting oscillatory electromagnetic torque. SPO fault results in a significantly high electromagnetic torque ripple. The rapid mechanical vibration caused by the torque ripple exposes the system to failure modes. The single open phase fault detection algorithm proposed in this paper enables the rapid detection of the fault, with minimal system resources, compared to existing methods. Proof of accurate fault detection capability for a wide speed range is presented through simulation and experimental results. The proposed method is also capable of localizing the faulted phase via a novel time domain rotor reference frame current signature analysis.

J	Yu, M; Wang, DW; Luo, M				Yu, Ming; Wang, Danwei; Luo, Ming			An Integrated Approach to Prognosis of Hybrid Systems With Unknown Mode Changes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Hybrid systems; mode-dependent degradation rate (MD-DR); particle filter; probability density function (pdf); remaining useful life	FAULT-DETECTION; APPROXIMATION; DIAGNOSIS	A new framework to design model-based prognosis for hybrid systems with unknown mode changes is proposed in this paper. The key step is the construction of an interacting diagnostic hybrid bond graph-particle filter (IDHBG-PF) module in the framework. In the module, the diagnostic hybrid bond graph (DHBG) part is employed for mode tracking after fault occurrence and fault isolation, and the particle filter (PF) part is used for joint state and parameter estimation as well as remaining useful life prediction. The DHBG part provides the set of suspected faults (SSF) to augment the dynamic model for the PF part, whereas the PF part outputs true faults for SSF refinement to facilitate prognosis and further fault isolation. During the prognosis, the probability density function (pdf) of the predicted remaining useful life under different operating modes can be calculated using the estimated mode-dependent degradation rate (MD-DR) and the user-selected failure threshold. The key concepts of the developed prognosis framework are validated by experimental results.

This paper introduces an innovative approach to perform laser welding process monitoring and welded defect diagnosis. The laboratory-scale sensor can be replaced with industrial-scale sensors after the data-driven model has been established by applying multivariate statistics and machine learning methods. In addition, industrial-scale sensor makes effective diagnosis of welded defect by using pattern recognition. Experimental results show that the feature vector affecting estimation and classification accuracy can be obtained by using wavelet packet decomposition principal component analysis. Image processing technology was applied to quantify geometrical parameters of welding process. The feedforward neural network prediction model and the support vector machine classification model built in this research help to guarantee accurate estimation on welding status and effective identification of welded defect. The method proposed by this paper provides an innovative data-driven-based approach for laser welding process monitoring and defects diagnosis.

J	Gaied, KS				Gaied, Khalaf Salloum			Wavelet-based prognosis for fault-tolerant control of induction motor with stator and speed sensor faults	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						Condition monitoring; control systems design; damage detection; diagnostics; prognosis; electrical machines	SLIDING MODE CONTROL; DIAGNOSIS	This paper presents a wavelet-based prognosis technique for fault-tolerant control (FTC) of an induction motor (IM) drive. The wavelet is used for analysis in fault detection due to its good filtering characteristics, localized capability and superior de-noising. The fault-tolerant algorithm is applied to a 1-kW IM to maintain the performance of the machine at an acceptable level. The FTC algorithm has been implemented in a new topology to ensure the best performance recovery in case of open and short stator winding faults, as well as speed sensor faults. In the worst-case scenario of operation, a protection stage has been implemented to stop motor operation. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the technique for diagnosis and prognosis of stator and speed sensor faults. The Texas Instrument TMS 320F28335 is used for the real-time implementation of the proposed wavelet-based prognosis and the FTC of the IM drive under different fault situations.

LS-SVM based spectral clustering and regression for predicting maintenance of industrial machines	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Kernel spectral clustering; LS-SVMs; Time-series prediction; Fault detection; Machine degradation; Artificial intelligence	PROCESS FAULT-DETECTION; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; DIAGNOSIS	Accurate prediction of forthcoming faults in modern industrial machines plays a key role in reducing production arrest, increasing the safety of plant operations, and optimizing manufacturing costs. The most effective condition monitoring techniques are based on the analysis of historical process data. In this paper we show how Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) can be used effectively for early fault detection in an online fashion. Although LS-SVMs are existing artificial intelligence methods, in this paper the novelty is represented by their successful application to a complex industrial use case, where other approaches are commonly used in practice. In particular, in the first part we present an unsupervised approach that uses Kernel Spectral Clustering (KSC) on the sensor data coming from a vertical form seal and fill (VFFS) machine, in order to distinguish between normal operating condition and abnormal situations. Basically, we describe how KSC is able to detect in advance the need of maintenance actions in the analysed machine, due the degradation of the sealing jaws. In the second part we illustrate a nonlinear auto-regressive (WAR) model, thus a supervised learning technique, in the LS-SVM framework. We show that we succeed in modelling appropriately the degradation process affecting the machine, and we are capable to accurately predict the evolution of dirt accumulation in the sealing jaws.

This paper compares and analyses breast cancer classifications with different machine learning algorithms using k-Fold Cross Validation (KCV) technique. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine algorithm with three different kernel functions are used as classifier to classify original and prognostic Wisconsin breast cancer. The comparative analysis of the studies are focusing on the impact of k in k-fold cross validation and achieve higher accuracy. We have used the benchmarking dataset in UCI in the experiments. In theory the common choice is to select k=10 for KCV. However this comes at an increased computational cost whereby the more the folds the more models you need to train. The overall results showed important conclusion; we cannot always expect to have more accurate result by having greater value of k in k-fold cross validation.

During fault detection, rms values of the three phase currents are calculated and two currents are subtracted from each other to form the residuals. After the fault is detected through evaluating the developed residuals, a harmony search algorithm is adopted to estimate the fault size, i.e., the fraction of shorted turn and the fault insulation resistance. Simulation experiments are conducted and results validate the developed method.

The challenge of developing a scalable, fault-tolerant and resilient monitoring system that can handle data in real-time and at a massive scale is nontrivial. We present a novel framework for real time network traffic anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms. The proposed prototype system uses existing big data processing frameworks such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, and Apache Storm in conjunction with machine learning techniques and tools. Our approach consists of a system for real-time processing and analysis of the real-time network-flow data collected from the campus-wide network at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Furthermore, the network anomaly patterns were identified and evaluated using machine learning techniques. We present preliminary results on anomaly detection with the campus network data.

The main idea of this paper is that by estimating the variations of on resistance, we can detect fault of FET of motor inverter. In this paper, the induction motor inverter is considered. A model of induction machine driver which include the on resistance of inverter FET as state variable is derived. Since the derived model is nonlinear, the EKF is used to estimate the on resistance and other state variables. The Matlab simulation results show that the proposed method can detect and isolate the faults in FETs.

In addition, for mostly configurations in all types of rotating machines, gearbox is an essential part to transfer rotating power source to other devices and provide speed and torque conversions. The goal of this paper is the proposition of a diagnosis procedure for real time gearbox fault detection and diagnosis while basing itself on the vibration signal. The analyzed faults can appear in the gear and bearing with various combinations under different speeds and loads. The proposed fault diagnosis technique is based on the application of the Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform DWPT and Principal Component Analysis PCA to extract the features of the different sub-bands frequencies in the vibration signal. The Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System ANFIS is used to fault classification. Experimental results can verified that the proposed procedure can classify with precision various types of faults according to the fault location and type.

In this sense, the monitoring of lithium-ion battery is very significant for planning repair work and minimizing unexpected electricity outage. As the RUL estimation is essentially a problem of pattern recognition, the most valuable feature extraction techniques and more accurate classifier are needed to obtain higher prognostic effectiveness. Consequently, this paper discusses the importance of non linear feature reduction techniques for more adequate prognosis feature data base. For more convenience, the isometric feature mapping technique (ISOMAP) is used to reduce some features extracted from lithium-ion batteries, with different health states, in both modes of charge and discharge. Experimental results show that non linear feature reduction techniques are very promising to provide some trend parameters for industrial prognostic.

Most gearbox failures initiate in bearings. High-speed bearings and planetary bearings exhibit a high rate of premature failure. A critical work of bearing fault diagnosis is finding the optimum frequency band that covers faulty bearing signal, which is a challenging task in practice. The kurtogram is a high technic used to characterize non-stationarities hidden in a signal. Thus, allows responding to the given problem. It consists to determine the central frequency (resonance) and the appropriate bandwidth witch maximizes the kurtosis. This paper addresses a squared envelope based spectral kurtosis method diagnosis for skidding in high-speed shaft bearings. We have verified the potential of the spectral kurtosis diagnostic strategy in performance improvements for single-defect diagnosis using real measured data from a drive train wind turbine.

They gave us the chance of collecting data from noisy environment. So it becomes possible to obtain precise and continuous monitoring of different phenomenons. However wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is affected by many anomalies that occur due to software or hardware problems. So various protocols are developed in order to detect and localize faults then distinguish the faulty node from the right one. In this paper we are concentrated on a specific type of faults in WSN which is the outlier. We are focus on the classification of data (outlier and normal) using three different methods of machine learning then we compare between them. These methods are validated using real data obtained from motes deployed in an actual living lab.	[Ayadi, Hayfa; Zouinkhi, Ahmed; Boussaid, Boumedyen; Abdelkrim, M.

Essentially, fault diagnosis is a problem of classification. A method based on Local Outlier Factor (LOP) anomaly detection and BP neural network is proposed to apply to steel plates fault diagnosis. The LOF method is firstly used to find the anomaly samples and process the relevant samples detected. Then the processed samples are used to train a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to classify steel plate faults. It is to be noted that the LOF method's effect of outlier elimination nicely overcomes the specific defect of the BP neural network model in which the training process is very sensitive to singularities in the training samples. Results of contrastive experiments indicate that the proposed method can reliably improve the classification accuracy and decrease the training time.

Feature extraction is the crucial part of rolling bearing fault diagnosis, which determines the diagnosis performance greatly. However, features extracted by many available methods cannot guarantee the sensitiveness to every interested fault category, which leads to incomplete diagnosis results and ability absence of handling with the situation that unknown-category fault appears. To solve this issue, the feature extraction method based on deep neural network (DNN) is proposed to extract a meaningful representation for bearing signal in this article. DNN is a new kind of machine learning tool with strong power of representation, which has been utilized as the feature extractors in lots of practical applications successfully. Afterwards, the effectiveness of this proposed approach is presented by using the actual rolling bearing data.

A numerical discrete-time method has been proposed to machine modeling in voltage-fed case, and an exact analytical method is proposed to calculate the machine's currents and torque. A method is introduced for both static and dynamic eccentricity fault diagnosis, which is proposed for first time. A mathematical base method is introduced for machine modeling, and new results are obtained to a novel method addressing for eccentricity fault diagnosis. The method is validated by Finite-Element-Method (FEM) so accuracy of the proposed method is proofed.

Hence, the definition of dynamic eccentricity fault (DEF) and air gap length in DEF in axial flux machine is presented. Then, definition of voltage variations with DEF is presented. A machine with different degrees of dynamic eccentricity is simulated and the flux distribution in the air gap and coil voltages is obtained.

This paper puts forward a cutterhead driving system dynamic model which can be used to fault diagnosis and model control. As some of the system parameters are time-varying, such as gear backlash which is one of the main factors causing deterioration in the dynamic and static performance of gear mesh process. This paper designs an adaptive observer with exponential forgetting factor to estimate the undetermined parameters. Compared to the adaptive observer without forgetting factor, the estimated parameter in proposed observer has a better performance in noise resisting ability and accuracy. The simulation results of cutterhead driving system show the estimated parameters can track the changing of the true values rapidly with an extremely small error.

Due to distinct system responses for different road levels, the sprung mass acceleration signal was utilized for classification. To analyze the properties of various road inputs from different perspectives, the acceleration signal was first decomposed into 5 categories via wavelet transform, and 11 statistic features were calculated for each category. Then, an improved distance evaluation technique was applied to remove irrelevant features. With the extracted superior features, a new 2-layers ANFIS classifier was implemented to calculate overall road level. Simulation results revealed that the proposed classifier had significantly improved performance compared to all 1-layer ANFIS classifiers for individual category, and can accurately classify road level with negligible time delay.

Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been used as an efficient tool for modeling the deterioration mechanisms as well as for estimating the RUL of monitored equipment. However, due to some assumptions not always justified in practice, the applications of HMM on real-life problems are still very limited. To tackle this issue and to relax some of these unrealistic assumptions, this paper proposes a multi-branch Hidden semi-Markov modeling (MB-HSMM) framework. The proposed deterioration model comprises several different branches, each one being itself an HSMM. The proposed model offers thus the capacity to 1) explicitly model the sojourn time in the different states and 2) take into account multiple co-existing and competing deterioration modes, even within a single component. A diagnosis and RUL prognosis methodology based on the MB-HSMM model is also proposed. Thanks to its multiple branches property, the MB-HSMM model makes it possible not only to assess the current health status of the component but also to detect the actual deterioration mechanism. Based on the diagnostic results, the component RUL can then be calculated. The performance of the proposed model and prognosis method is evaluated through a numerical study. A Fatigue Crack Growth (FCG) model based on the Paris-Erdogan law is used to simulate deterioration data of a bearing under different operation conditions. The results show that the proposed MB-HSMM gives a very promising performance in deterioration mode detection as well as in the RUL estimation, especially in the case where these deterioration modes exhibit very different dynamics.

Currently, the prognostics and health management research of the power electronic system, including switch mode power supply (SMPS), are based primarily on field data with specified usage stress. The usage stress (including input voltage, temperature, load, etc.) is specific, therefore, it is difficult to adapt to the measurement in other stress conditions. The tolerance of the system is rarely considered. In addition, the basis of the health- assessment is the database containing degradation features of multi-component degradation. However, the degradation degree of components can rarely be controlled by experiment. By injecting degradation parameters of components into the high fidelity SMPS model, a health-assessment methodology for SMPS based on simulation is proposed. Firstly, SMPS with multi-component degradation in various tolerance and stress conditions is simulated by using the design of experiment (DOE) method; Secondly, the testable signals in the system such as output signals and gate-source voltage of MOSFET are pre-treated to reduce dimensionality and to eliminate redundant information, and the database containing degradation characteristics is created. Then, based on the database, the degradation status of SMPS is identified by Mahalanobis Distance (MD) calculation. The methodology proposed in this paper provides a general platform for prognostics and health- management research of SMPS. A flyback SMPS is studied to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of proposed methodology.

Due to the limitation of distance relays and over current relays like insensitive to detect very low value fault current, it is unreliable to apply as a fault detector for HIF in distribution line. As wavelet transform (WT) is a very useful tool for analyzing transient fault signal which also provides both time and frequency information, the same has been considered for High impedance fault detection. This method based on various features like the sum of energy contents, standard deviation and entropy of coefficients in multiresolution analysis (MRA) based on wavelet transform. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used as a machine learning technique to discriminate the HIF from other transient phenomenon (Load switching, capacitor Switching) and normal fault. The proposed schemes are fully analyzed by extensive MATLAB simulation studies that clearly reveal that the proposed method can detect HIF in high voltage distribution line with high accuracy.

Locality Constrained Linear Coding for Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machines using Vibration Analysis	2015 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	12 IEEE Int C Elect Energy Env Communications Computer Control	DEC 17-20, 2015	New Delhi, INDIA				DECISION TREE	Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an important machine learning algorithm widely used for the development of machine fault diagnosis systems. In this work, we use an SVM back-end classifier, with statistical features in time and frequency domain as its input, for the development of a fault diagnosis system for a rotating machine. Our baseline system is evaluated for its speed dependent and speed independent performances. In this paper, we use locality constrained linear coding (LLC) to map the input feature vectors to a higher dimensional linear space, and remove some of the speed specific dimensions to improve the speed independent performance of the fault diagnosis system. We use LLC to do the feature mapping to the higher dimensional space, and select only the k nearest neighbour basis vectors to represent the input feature vector and thus reduce/minimize the effect of speed specific factors from the input feature vector, and thus improve the speed independent performance of the fault diagnosis. We compare the performance of the LLC-SVM system for the time and frequency domain statistical features. The proposed approach has improved the overall classification accuracy by 11.81% absolute for time domain features and 10.53% absolute for frequency domain features compared to the baseline speed independent system.

Condition monitoring and fault diagnostic systems ominously plays an important role in offshore wind turbine in order to cut down maintenance and operational costs. Condition monitoring techniques which describing complex faults and failure mode types and their generated traceable signs to provide cost-effective condition monitoring and predictive maintenance and their diagnostic schemes. Continuously monitor the condition of critical parts are the most efficient way to improve reliability of wind turbine. Implementation of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy provides right time maintenance decisions and Predictive Health Monitoring (PHM) data to overcome breakdown and machine downtime. Fault detection and CBM implementation is challenging for off shore wind farm due to the complexity of remote sensing, components health and predictive assessment, data collection, data analysis, data handling, state recognition, and advisory decision. The rapid expansion of wind farms, advanced technological development and harsh installation sites needs a successful CM approach. This paper aims to review brief status of recent development of CM techniques and focusing with major faults takes place in gear box and bearing, rotor and blade, pitch, yaw and tower system and generator and control system.

A novel fault diagnosis approach is presented for rolling bearing system based on support vector machine (SVM) in this paper. Data acquired for rotatory machinery has a large quantity as well as a high dimensionality, both principal component analysis (PCA) method and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method are introduced to solve the problem of high dimensionality. In the proposed approach, PCA and LDA are separately applied to reduce data dimensions and extract data features from raw data first. Then the classic SVM method is used to classify fault types. With PCA and LDA methods applied, reduced number of inputs leads to fewer iterations and less time of training procedures. The experiment results show that accuracy of fault diagnosis has improved and cost of SVM training has decreased evidently, and prove that the proposed approach is practical and efficient for fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing system.

As the strength of permanent magnet (PM) decreases, inductance of the PMSM changes since flux density affects electrical steel's nonlinear characteristics. It makes difficult to estimate exact flux linkages of the PMSM to diagnose demagnetization fault. In this paper, we suggested analytic inductance prediction considering magnetic saturation effect and varying flux linkages of PMSM, which shows better results in estimation of flux linkages. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results demonstrate that the proposed method works well.

Monitoring of transitions in multi-grade continuous processes	2015 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 15-17, 2015	Linz, AUSTRIA				PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS	Modern process industries are adapting to the global competitiveness by equipping themselves to be flexible and producing products of different grades. This paper proposes an offline monitoring scheme which is suitable for such a dynamic environment where process transitions occur in a multi-grade continuous process. Modeling of every possible grade change is required for proper fault detection and isolation. The proposed technique uses Multiway Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) to eliminate the necessity to develop an individual model for monitoring every grade change performed in the process and is illustrated on an industrial case study of paper machine, a typical example of a production line where multiple grade changes occur naturally.

This phenomenon has been given many explanations in the past. Many causes have been reported that may produce and influence the third current harmonic, such as saturation, manufacturing imbalances, supply asymmetries, etc. This paper constitutes an effort to analyze and evaluate previous knowledge regarding the third line current harmonic in induction motors suffering from a stator inter-turn fault. The work is carried out with Finite Element Analysis (FEM). In this investigation, FEM is a valuable tool, because it allows the investigation of each parameter's influence on the third current harmonic, independently from the others.

In this context, this work presents a novel monitoring scheme applied to diagnose faults in the main rotatory element of an industrial packaging machine, the camshaft. The developed diagnosis method considers a coherent procedure to process the acquired measurement. First, the current signals acquired from the main motor are processed in a normalized time-frequency map. Next, the characteristics fault patterns are identified and numerically characterized. A double self-organized map structure is proposed to manage the information till compress it to just two features by means of a topology codification of the data space. Finally, a neural network based classification algorithm is used to classify the condition of the camshaft. The effectiveness of this condition monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from industrial machinery.

In this paper, an original method to detect camshaft defaults from the monitoring of the motor phase current is presented. This method is based on the short-time Fourier transform in order to analyze the spectral variations over each cycle of the system. The time-frequency maps are then normalized using statistical techniques in order to create a reference of the healthy functioning of the system. Normalized time-frequency maps allow the detection of changes from the reference that are statistically significant. The method is evaluated on data from an industrial packing machine at three different speeds and for two noise levels. It obtains excellent results with 100% correct detections and 0% false alarms in each case. Results are compared to those obtains with classical spectral approaches.

Novelty Detection Methodology based on Multi-Modal One-class Support Vector Machine	2015 IEEE 10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics, and Drives (SDEMPED)	SEP 01-04, 2015	Guarda, PORTUGAL	IEEE, Electromechantron Syst Res Ctr, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Univ Beira Interior, IPG		Artificial Intelligence; Novelty Detection; Machine Learning; OC-SVM; Fault Detection		The lack of information of complicated industrial systems represents one of the main limitation to implement condition monitoring and diagnosis systems. Novelty detection framework plays an essential role for monitoring systems in which the information about the different operation conditions or fault scenarios is unavailable or limited. In this context, this work presents a novelty detection approach applied to a main rotatory element of an industrial packaging machine, a camshaft. The developed novelty detection method begins with the assumption that only data corresponding to a healthy operation of the machine is available, and the objective is to detect anomalies in the behavior of the machine. To monitor the packing machine, first, the current signals acquired from the main motor are processed by means of a normalized time-frequency map. Next, a set of features are calculated from the frequency maps. Then a set of novelty models are trained. When abnormal data is detected, an alarm will be activated to be confirmed by the user. The proposed methodology includes the re-training of the novelty detection models to include such behaviors. The proposed methodology shows a good performance to identify abnormal behavior on the machine and successfully incorporate novel scenarios.	[Carino, J. A.; Zurita, D.; Delgado, M.; Ortega, J.

In this work, a classical ANFIS forecasting scheme is enhanced by the proposal of a dynamics boosting strategy. First, the objective signal is decomposed by means of the Empirical Mode to highlight the main characteristics functions. Next, the dynamics of the functions in regard to the performance of the ANFIS is analyzed. Thus, the functions are separated into different sets. Then, the forecasting is faced with the employment of multiple ANFIS models focused on different dynamics modes. The performance of the proposed system is validated experimentally. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach outperforms the classical methods and represents a reliable and feasible methodology suitable to multiple applications.

However, degradation mechanisms of winding insulation are not yet fully understood. The main contribution of this article is analysis of the impact of thermal ageing on the electrical properties of winding insulation. The insulation samples have been aged thermally at 200 - 275 degrees C and for 100 - 1600 hours. After aging, impedance spectroscopy measurements were undertaken on the samples and equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters fitted for each measurement. This allows the impact of thermal ageing on ECM parameters to be analysed, giving insight into the changes of the electrical properties of the insulation. Ultimately this will lead to development of new methods for remaining life prediction of electrical machine windings.	[Sumislawska, M.; Burnham, K.

NSTX TOROIDAL FIELD COIL TURN TO TURN SHORT DETECTION	2015 IEEE 26TH SYMPOSIUM ON FUSION ENGINEERING (SOFE)			English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE Symposium on Fusion Engineering (SOFE) colocated with the 20th IEEE Pulsed Power Conference (PPC)	MAY 31-JUN 04, 2015	Austin, TX	IEEE				The National Spherical Toms Experiment (NSTX) was designed, installed, and commissioned in the existing facilities at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in 1999. Most of the hardware, plant facilities, auxiliary subsystems, and power systems originally used for the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) were used with suitable modifications to reflect NSTX needs. A major upgrade was undertaken on NSTX. The TF has been upgraded to provide one tesla field from the present 0.5 tesla field. This entailed a much higher Toroidal Field Current from 71.2kA to 129.8kA, and required major configuration changes including doubling the number of parallel strings of rectifiers along with associated power loop changes. Before the planned upgrade the machine developed turn to turn fault of the Toroidal Field Coil bundle. The machine was shut down and the Upgrade work started earlier than planned. It was decided to provide a turn to turn fault detection and trip for the upgraded toroidal field coil. A unique scheme was developed to detect a turn to turn fault in TF. This paper gives a description of the turn to turn short detection scheme that has been implemented.

The method can be applied on different categories of MEMS to assess their health state, calculate the remaining useful life (RUL) and take appropriate decisions to anticipate the failures. In this paper a detailed description of the proposed method is presented. It consists of combining both degradation and nominal behavior models in order to estimate the current and future MEMS health states. A test bed for several MEMS is designed to acquire data in relation with the health state of the MEMS. The data processing obtained with this platform aims at deriving degradation models. Physical modeling is used to build the nominal behavior model of the valve. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method and in order to validate the implementation of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) models on MEMS, two simulated degradations of the valve MEMS are considered.

This minimizes the risks of unpredicted failures and consequent plant outages. Since all failure modes can cause an increase in machine vibrations, monitoring this area is the predominant and most widely used method to determine equipment condition, and to predict failures. The objective of this study is to detect faults in rotating equipment with the use of vibration analysis. A motor condition monitoring experiment is set up, and the motor's operational speed is controlled by an AC motor drive. The vibration of the motor is measured and monitored. The measured vibration data is analyzed using spectrum analysis software and a MATLAB program. The overall vibration level is monitored, the vibration severity is compared with the standard severity table and is used to determine the condition of the motor. The specific natural frequency corresponds with which kind of fault or failure mode is identified. This information provide insight on the condition of the machine.

Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Systems Subject to Multiple Degradation Mechanisms	2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	JUN 22-25, 2015	Austin, TX			Battery; Monte Carlo; Multiple degradation mechanisms; Particle filter; Remaining useful life (RUL)	LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; PARTICLE FILTER; PROGNOSTICS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CRITERION	Most recent studies on prognostics and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for engineering systems are based on the underlying assumption that there is only one degradation / failure mechanism inherent in the system that is being tracked. This is often an overly simplistic assumption as systems in general are complex enough to be subject to degradation by multiple mechanisms that have different intensities in different individual units being operated. The system degrades under a cumulative effect of these multiple mechanisms and the number of competing mechanisms is many a times unknown as well. In this study, we shall present a particle filter based methodological framework that can be used to track and estimate the RUL distribution of systems with more than one mechanism of degradation / failure. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is effectively used here to determine the number of inherent competing degradation mechanisms and ensure that the data is not over-fitted with many redundant degradation terms. Our methodology is illustrated here with a practical example of resistance degradation in lithium ion batteries.

The existing fault prognostic methods can generally be categorized into three major classes: case-based, data-driven, and model-based methods. This paper proposes a novel case-based data-driven prognostic framework based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and big data concept. The framework contains two phases. One is an offline learning phase, in which big historical data are used to build an ANFIS model-case library. The other is the online prognostic phase, in which the fault prognosis of a new machinery system (i.e., a new case) is accomplished by using the proper ANFIS model(s) chosen from the model-case library. The proposed framework is tested by using the experimental data of bearing faults collected from a bearing test rig. Result shows that it has better fault prognostic accuracy than the traditional data-driven method.

FailSafe: A Generalized Methodology for Converter Fault Detection, Identification, and Remediation in Nanogrids	2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES (ICBEST)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Building Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Technologies (ICBEST)	AUG 31-SEP 01, 2015	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc			MULTICLASS; CLASSIFICATION	We present the design, implementation, and experimental validation of FAILSAFE-a generalized methodology for fault detection, identification, and remediation (FDIR) for switching power converters in nanogrids. FAILSAFE is a dynamical systems approach to FDIR for switching power converters, and can be applied to a broad class of converters and fault types. FAILSAFE operates as part of the control loop of a switching power converter, and uses the measurements and inputs of the converter to achieve both fault detection and identification (FDI) and fault remediation. In this paper, we present two Modules for FDI-a model-based residual approach and a data-driven multiclass Support Vector Machine (one-vs-one) approach. Moreover, we describe the design of a fault remediation Module by designing optimal control actions in a pre-computed reach-avoid set. We present simulation and experimental results using a prototype nanogrid testbed. Simulation results for the multiclass Support Vector Machine (one-vs-one) FDI Module on a 6-phase interleaved boost converter demonstrate fault detection and identification with a classification accuracy of 98.9% for a current sensor fault and 90.8% for an output capacitor fault. Experimental results for the model-based residual FDI Module on a boost converter demonstrate fault detection and identification in 600 mu s for a capacitor fault and 250 mu s for a voltage sensor fault.

Variational Bayesian GMM (VBGMM) is used to automatically cluster operational data into steady-state and transient responses, where extraction of steady-state data is an important preprocessing scenario for fault detection. Important features are extracted from steady-state data, which are then fingerprinted to show any anomalies of patterns which may be due to machine faults. Field data measurements from vibration sensors are used to show that the extensions of GMMs provide a useful tool for machine condition monitoring, fault detection and diagnostics in the field. Through the use of experimental trials on IGTs, it is shown that GMM is particularly useful for the detection of emerging faults especially where there is a lack of knowledge of machine fault patterns.

First, a brief overview of prognostics techniques is provided. Accordingly, a prediction model combining fuzzy sets and Markov Chain is proposed for equipment performance degradation. This model can improve these traditional state division methods based on personal subjective experience, and increase the prediction accuracy. Then, a numerical example is provided in which the exhaust gas temperature margin is considered as the performance indicator. Through the computation results, it can be verified that the Fuzzy-Markov chain simplifies the calculation process, and achieves accurate prediction results with small sample and incomplete information. Moreover, compared with linear regression model, nonlinear regression model and GM (1, 1) model, the computation results illustrate that this prediction model performs better in dealing with the degradation data with high nonlinearity and random fluctuation.

In this paper, in order to take advantage from process relations and improve forecasting performance, a prediction method based in Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Self-Organizing Maps is presented. The novelties of the proposed method are based on considering, as an input of an ANFIS model, the interrelations of process variables regarding the signal that wants to be forecasted, by means of topology preservation SOM. An experimental study performed with real industrial data from a cooper manufacturing plant indicated the suitability of the proposed method in time series forecasting applications.

Few methods are implemented for fault diagnosis or prognosis of the electrolytic capacitors. Most of these methods are based on the parameter like equivalent series resistance (ESR), capacitance (C), operating temperature (T-c, DC operating voltage (V-o), output ripple voltage (V-r or ripple current (Id. This paper presents a easy, comprehensive method for the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of the electrolytic capacitor. The proposed method of online RUL prediction of electrolytic capacitor is based on a lifetime model which is implemented using parameters T-c,V-o and I-r. of the electrolytic capacitor. This method is simulated using MATLAB-Simulink and also implemented on hardware using dsPIC33FJ64GS406. The experimental setup is composed of switched mode DC-DC buck converter and a data acquisition system (DAS). Simulation results and experimental results are compared to validate the proposed method. The proposed method implies industrial applications due to its simplicity, less hardware requirements and result orientation.	[Khandebharad, A. R.; Dhumale, R. B.; Lokhande, S. S.; Lokhande, S.

The rub-impact fault signal may be nonlinear and non-stationary. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is based on time-frequency signal processing technology, which is suitable for nonlinear and non-stationary signals. In this paper, the HHT transform is used to analyze the time-frequency characteristic of the rub-impact fault signal of a rotor test rig. The velocity sensor is used to measure the vibration signal of the rub-impact fault rotor. The experimental result shows that the HHT transform can effectively detect the rub-impact fault of the rotor, which implies great potential of the HHT transform in the fault diagnosis of rotor system.

The conventional healthcare systems suffer from a general lack of intelligence, they are successful in offering basic patient management capabilities, but they do not offer consistent and holistic decision support capabilities for clinicians working under tight deadlines in a fast paced environment. The conventional healthcare information management systems are designed using branching logic based rigid architectures, which are hard to maintain and upgrade without considerable labour intensive effort. The proposed ontology and machine learning driven hybrid clinical decision support framework comprises of two key components (1) ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system and (2) machine learning driven prognostic system. The key aim of our research is to utilise information collected through the knowledge based ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system and non-knowledge based/evidence based machine learning driven prognostic system to deliver a holistic clinical decision support framework in the cardiovascular domain. The ontology driven clinical risk assessment and recommendation system could be used as a triage system for cardiovascular patients as a preventative solution, this could help clinicians prioritise patient referrals after reviewing a snapshot of patient's medical history (collected through an ontology driven intelligent context aware information collection using standardised clinical questionnaires) containing patient demographics information, cardiac risk scores, cardiac chest pain score, medication and recommended lab tests details. The machine learning driven prognostic system is developed using a chest pain clinical case study identified by the consultant cardiologist, Professor Stephen Leslie from Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. The key aim of this clinical case study UK is to provide a clinical decision support mechanism for Raigmore Hospital's Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic (RACPC) patients by combining evidence, extrapolated through legacy patient data (based on machine learning driven techniques) to facilitate evidence based cardiovascular preventative care. The machine learning driven prognostic system provides cardiac chest pain prognosis through a cardiac chest pain specific prognostic model which is validated through consultant cardiologist from Raigmore Hospital. The cardiac chest pain prognostic model could help clinicians diagnose cardiac chest pain patients efficiently and could also help clinicians reduce load on overly prescribed angiography treatment in a cost effective manner. Additional two clinical case studies in the heart disease and breast cancer domains are considered for the development and clinical validation of the machine learning driven prognostic system. The proposed novel ontology and machine learning driven hybrid clinical decision support framework will also be validated in other application areas.

Although SOH diagnosis and remaining life predication for individual cell is relatively sophisticated, module diagnosis especially for electric vehicle(EV) has rarely been reported and applied due to complexity of system. This paper focused on the performance degradation of EV power module during practical conditions, and proposed a diagnosis approach based on wavelet transformation and statistical analysis. This approach provides not only the performance degradation information of entire module, but also the individual cell information at different frequency range, with which ageing process of module, potential failure of individual cell, location of worst cell and fault mechanism can be obtained to guarantee the safety of battery system and reduce maintenance costs.

This puts new requirements on the methodologies for condition monitoring through the communication and analysis of big data. In this paper we classify the different aspects of electrical machine diagnosis and investigate their relation with remote monitoring. The main emphasis is on two aspects out of four identified. The first one is the use of numerical simulations of faulty machines to generate the virtual data and relate global quantities to local ones. The second is the monitoring integration in the industrial internet, which means the hardware and software packaged within the monitored machine as well as the required information and communication technology. New trends in these fields are identified and analyzed and a synthesis of future needs is presented.

Design and Development of a Wind Turbine Test Rig for Condition Monitoring Studies	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL (ICIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Industrial Instrumentation and Control	MAY 28-30, 2015	Coll Engn Pune, Pune, INDIA	IEEE Pune Sect	Coll Engn Pune	Wind Turbine; Condition Monitoring; Gearbox and Bearing Fault Diagnosis; Artificial Neural Network	GEARBOX	Wind energy is an emerging, clean and renewable source of energy. It is estimated that by year 2035, wind energy will be generating more than 25% of the world's electricity according to International Energy Agency (IEA). With the increase in demand for wind energy, its maintenance issues are becoming more prominent. The scheduled maintenance is more economical than unscheduled repair resulting from failure. So a continuous condition monitoring of various critical components like bearings, gearbox, and shafts of wind turbine is essential in order to enable predictive maintenance. 10% of the total failure is contributed by the bearings, shaft and gear box failures, but the downtime is more than 50% of the total downtime. This paper discusses the development of a bench-top test rig which is designed to mimic the operating condition of an actual wind turbine and use it for monitoring its condition so as to diagnose the incipient faults in its critical components using latest machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Ltd		Semi-Supervised Fault Diagnostics; Concept Drift; COMPOSE; Bearing	SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINERY	In this work, we consider the problem of developing a fault diagnostic system for an industrial component operating in an evolving environment characterized by continuous modifications of the working conditions. The main difficult to be addressed in this context is that the labeled data available to train the empirical classification model do not cover all the possible working conditions that will be experienced by the component during its life. We propose a diagnostic model based on the COMPacted Object Sample Extraction (COMPOSE) algorithm, which has been developed in the domain of streaming data learning. The key idea of this algorithm is to learn the concept drift caused by the modification of the working conditions. This is done by i) aggregating the labeled training dataset with unlabeled new data collected in a different working condition, and it) identifying the data drift trend by performing a shrinkage of the aggregated dataset. In the present work, the original COMPOSE algorithm has been modified by introducing an automatic method for dynamically setting the COMPOSE internal parameters, taking into account the characteristics of the new collected data. The overall method has been verified with respect to the Case Western Reserve University Bearing dataset, considering the classification of bearing defects in an evolving environment characterized by modification of the motor load. The obtained performance is satisfactory: bearing defects at different motor loads from that considered for training the diagnostic model are classified with good accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed model overtakes that of the original COMPOSE method.

Ltd		ball bearings; sparse representation; RUL		Prognostics and health management (PHM) play an important role in improving the reliability and safety of systems in industry. A method using sparse representation to solve the PHM questions raised in the IEEE 2012 PHM Data Challenge Competition is presented. It is discovered that the sparse representation score could be a good health indicator of ball bearings compared with traditional acceleration signal or some extracted features like energy, root mean square, maximum peak value and skewness. A group of experimental datasets from seventeen ball bearings are provided by the FEMTO-ST Institute for the competition. The data consists of six groups of bearing acceleration data for algorithm training and another eleven groups of bearing accelerated data for testing. The training data groups are used to build the full score cures model in order to estimate the remaining useful life of the truncated test data groups of the ball bearings. The result is compared with the result using a mixture of traditional features like energy, maximum peak value, root mean square and skewness. Result using the sparse representation method is relatively promising and could well reflect the states of the rotating ball bearings.

A core component of the smart grid are phasor measurement units (PMUs) which offer the ability to capture time-coherent measurements across a geographically distributed area. However, due to the fast sampling rate of these devices, a significant volume of data is generated on a daily basis and this presents challenges for how to leverage the information most effectively. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying machine learning techniques to PMU data for the purpose of detecting line events in a wide-area power grid. Specifically, we use archived synchrophasor data from PMUs located across the Pacific Northwest to train and test a decision tree built using the J48 algorithm. In contrast to other studies exploring machine learning in the context of the smart grid, our work uses PMU data from a large, active, power grid as opposed to data obtained from a simulation. We show that our classifier performs as well as hand-coded rules developed by a domain expert when applied at locations near to a line fault and that it significantly outperforms hand-coded rules when identifying line faults from a distance.

Hence, their reliability, productivity, safety and availability are very important issues that are imposed to increase production with quality assurance as per given specification at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, because the bearing faults are the most frequent and critical defects in rotating machinery that may have a direct influence on the availability of the machine itself and also on those of the surrounding systems, a particular interest is carried in this paper to the analysis and diagnosis of these defects which can appear in the bearing's ball, inner race and outer race with various fault severity and rotating speed. This paper consists of the application of the Discrete Wavelet Transform DWT and Fast Fourier Transform FFT theories to extract the amplitude of the fundamental bearing defect frequencies in the vibration signal from a rotating machine. These parameters will be used by the Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System ANFIS to automate the fault detection and diagnosis process. Experimental results show that the proposed procedure can classify with precision various types of bearing faults according to the fault location and severity.

The methodology employs time and frequency domain techniques to extract features of diverse bearing defects. In addition, the proposed method introduces a new reliability measure (SVMReM) for individual SVMs in the multiclass framework. The SVMReM achieves optimum results irrespective of the test sample location by using a new decision strategy for the proposed OAA-MCSVM based method. Finally, each SVM is trained with optimized kernel parameters using a grid search technique to enhance the classification accuracy of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to conventional approaches, yielding an average classification accuracy of 97 % for five different rotational speed conditions, eight different fault types and two different crack sizes.

Nowadays, testing is the main verification technique used in industry, being a time and resource consuming activity. This has boosted the development of potentially more efficient testing techniques, like model-based testing, where test creation and execution can be automated, using an abstract system model as input. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in tool-supported model-based testing that starts from requirements-based models, by presenting and classifying some of the most mature tools available at this moment. Our goal is to get a deeper insight into the state-of-the-art in this area, as well as to form a position with respect to possible needs and gaps in the current tools used by industry and academia, which need to be addressed in order to enhance the applicability of model-based testing techniques. To achieve this, we extend an existing taxonomy with: (i) the test artifact, representing the type of information encoded in the model for the purpose of testing (i.e., functional behavior, extra-functional behavior, or the architectural description), and (ii) the mapping of test cases, which describes ways of using the generated test cases on the actual system under test. To provide further evidence of the inner-workings of different model-based testing tools, we select four representative tools (i.e, ProTest, UPPAAL Cover, MaTeLo, and CompleteTest) that we apply on a simple yet illustrative Coffee/Tea Vending Machine example, to show the differences in modeling notations, test case generation methods, and the produced test-cases.

The model takes account of singular products from several companies or industries, thus giving room for a share factor in the market population. The model is developed based on the factors of maintenance severity, production capacity, output production, production strategies and demand for the product. It also integrates conventional manufacturing, just-in-time (JIT) and automation with maintenance cultures such as predictive, preventive and breakdown, coupled with a spare parts inventory. The software was developed using C# to ease and consolidate the entire research. Production data and product turnout for the same products for twelve weeks from one industry with were collected and analysed to validate this concept. The output of the integrated maintenance product demand model is dynamic, as the suggested maintenance strategy based on product demand varies with time. The model formulated was able to assist in taking appropriate maintenance decisions on machinery, thereby reducing the mean time to failure (MTTF) and thus correcting the products backlog and enhancing overall equipment effectiveness, management of machinery, products flow and materials inventory.

J	Glowacz, A				Glowacz, Adam			Recognition of Acoustic Signals of Loaded Synchronous Motor Using FFT, MSAF-5 and LSVM	ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS			English	Article						acoustic signal; fault detection; loaded synchronous motor; signal processing; pattern recognition	SOUND RECOGNITION; FAULT-DETECTION; DC; DIAGNOSTICS; IMAGE	This article discusses a system of recognition of acoustic signals of loaded synchronous motor. This software can recognize various types of incipient failures by means of analysis of the acoustic signals. Proposed approach uses the acoustic signals generated by loaded synchronous motor. A plan of study of the acoustic signals of loaded synchronous motor is proposed. Studies include following states: healthy loaded synchronous motor, loaded synchronous motor with shorted stator coil, loaded synchronous motor with shorted stator coil and broken coil, loaded synchronous motor with shorted stator coil and two broken coils. The methods such as FFT, method of selection of amplitudes of frequencies (MSAF-5), Linear Support Vector Machine were used to identify specific state of the motor. The proposed approach can keep high recognition rate and reduce the maintenance cost of synchronous motors.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by malignant proliferation of plasma cells (PC) which accumulate in the bone marrow (BM). The advent of new drugs has changed the course of the disease from incurable to treatable, but most patients eventually relapse. One group of MM patients (10-15%) is considered high-risk because they relapse within 24 months. Recently, extramedullary relapse of MM (EM) has been observed more frequently. Due to its aggressivity and shorter survival, EM is also considered high-risk. Aims. The goal of this study was to determine if the so-called high-risk genes published by the University of Arkansas group (UAMS) are even more deregulated in EM patients than in high-risk MM patients and if these patients may be considered high-risk. Methods. Nine samples of bone marrow plasma cells from MM patients as well as 9 tumors and 9 bone marrow plasma cells from EM patients were used. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for evaluation of expression of 15 genes connected to the high-risk signature of MM patients. Results. Comparison of high-risk plasma cells vs extramedullary plasma cells revealed 4 significantly deregulated genes (CKS1B, CTBS, NADK, YWHAZ); moreover, comparison of extramedullary plasma cells vs extramedullary tumors revealed significant differences in 9 out of 15 genes. Of these, 6 showed significant changes as described by the UAMS group (ASPM, SLC19A1, NADK, TBRG4, TMPO and LARS2). Conclusions. Our data suggest that increasing genetic abnormalities as described by the gene expression data are associated with increased risk for EM relapse.

Cloud-enabled prognosis for manufacturing	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Predictive model; Condition monitoring; Cloud manufacturing	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; SEMI-MARKOV MODEL; ADAPTIVE NEURO-FUZZY; TOOL-WEAR; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; DEGRADATION MODELS; PARTICLE FILTERS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MONITORING DATA	Advanced manufacturing depends on the timely acquisition, distribution, and utilization of information from machines and processes across spatial boundaries. These activities can improve accuracy and reliability in predicting resource needs and allocation, maintenance scheduling, and remaining service life of equipment. As an emerging infrastructure, cloud computing provides new opportunities to achieve the goals of advanced manufacturing. This paper reviews the historical development of prognosis theories and techniques and projects their future growth enabled by the emerging cloud infrastructure. Techniques for cloud computing are highlighted, as well as the influence of these techniques on the paradigm of cloud-enabled prognosis for manufacturing. Finally, this paper discusses the envisioned architecture and associated challenges of cloud-enabled prognosis for manufacturing. (C) 2015 CIRP.

However, many cases of false indications due to interference from the motor or load have been reported. False indications can result in unnecessary inspection and outage costs (false positives) or major repair/replacement costs and loss of production (false negatives). The objective of this paper is to present the potential root causes of false indications, and provide guidelines on how commercially available off-line and on-line tests can be applied for identifying false indications from a field engineers' perspective. Case studies of false MCSA indications and results of alternative commercial tests for improving the reliability of the diagnosis are provided through measurements on 6.6 kV and laboratory motor samples. Finally, new test methods under research and development for reliable rotor fault detection are summarized and unresolved problems are listed.

This information can be leveraged effectively to identify patients who are similar to each for disease diagnosis and prognosis. In recent years, several machine learning methods 1 have been proposed to assessing patient similarity, although the techniques have primarily focused on the use of patient diagnoses data from EHRs for the learning task. In this study, we develop a multidimensional patient similarity assessment technique that leverages multiple types of information from the EHR and predicts a medication plan for each new patient based on prior knowledge and data from similar patients. In our algorithm, patients have been clustered into different groups using a hierarchical clustering approach and subsequently have been assigned a medication plan based on the similarity index to the overall patient population. We evaluated the performance of our approach on a cohort of heart failure patients (N=1386) identified from EHR data at Mayo Clinic and achieved an AUC of 0.74. Our results suggest that it is feasible to harness population-based information from EHRs for an individual patient-specific assessment.

Article describes a recognition method of early fault detection of DC generator. The proposed approach is based on an analysis of the patterns. These patterns are the armature currents of selected electrical machine. Information contained in signals of armature current is depending on generator state. Researches were carried out for four states of generator with the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), method of selection of amplitudes of frequencies (MSAF-1) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The results of analysis show that the method is efficient and can be used to protect DC generators. This method was verified with the aid of acoustic signals recognition method.

However, these methods have limitation, especially for in-service monitoring of motors, as their predictive time of the accidents is short and defective. Detection of metallic particle in engine oil can indirectly predict wear status of its bearings and gear etc., which is important to prevent engine failure caused by over wear. In this paper, an eddy current testing (ECT) method for inspection of metallic particles in engine oils, the design of the ECT system consisting of sensor, hardware and software, and the realization of the on-line monitoring are described. In addition, the prospect for the on-line "cloud" monitoring of engine oil abrasive particle is also discussed.

Robust model-based fault diagnosis for air handling units	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Fault detection and diagnosis; Air handling units; ARX model; Machine learning techniques; Parameter estimation; Recursive least squares	QUANTITATIVE MODEL; SYSTEMS; ARX; IDENTIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; VALIDATION; NETWORK; AHU	Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment significantly impact energy consumption in both residential and commercial buildings. In most modern building management systems (BMS), HVAC historical data logs in large quantity and high resolution are recorded and available for further online or offline analysis, including automated FDD. In this paper, a model-based fault diagnosis method is developed by applying support vector machine (SVM) techniques to model parameters recursively calculated by an online estimator. The estimator presumes an autoregressive time series model with exogenous variables (ARX). A real-world air handling unit (AHU) dataset containing process variables measured at regular intervals is pre-processed by the online estimation algorithm. Each data vector in the original dataset (measured), together with a small number of appropriately selected lags, is converted to a parameter vector representing the state at the same instant. The set of parameter vectors is sub-divided into classes by SVM, enabling fault classification. Validation via experimental data demonstrates that the proposed hybrid approach produce superior performance measured by F-measure scores compared to alternative methods. Robustness to model uncertainty is also established. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anomaly is referred to as different set of data that does not match with the real data set. Detecting an anomaly in a high dimensional data set is a chief data mining task there many techniques the existing work is based on the batch mode to detect an anomaly, and it cannot be easily extended to large-scale data. Batch mode takes unnecessary updates to the large data set, and computation takes longer time. The proposed work uses split and merge algorithm to split the large-scale database that reduces the size of the training sets into a smaller number of sub sets. The adaptive anomaly detection technique is used to determine the size of the training set with the actual data set. The extra added data or removed data by outlier can be identified by computing the data sets.

By applying WSNs to online monitoring, many problems existing in conventional wired monitoring are solved, e.g., wiring difficulties, large reroute engineering and immobility. WSNs play an important role in extending monitoring scope, improving the fault diagnosis quality and reducing monitoring the cost. In the paper, an online monitoring system based on vibration signals is developed to meet the needs of fault diagnosis in petrochemical plants work sites, especially for the rotating machinery. The feasibility of the system is verified by an experiment in the simulation model of petrochemical units. Experimental results show that the units running state can be monitored and identified by analyzing the vibration signals.

J	Amar, M; Gondal, I; Wilson, C				Amar, Muhammad; Gondal, Iqbal; Wilson, Campbell			Vibration Spectrum Imaging: A Novel Bearing Fault Classification Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Artificial neural networks (ANNs); bearing fault; fault diagnosis; image processing; machine health monitoring (MHM)	INDUCTION-MOTOR; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; PREDICTION; MACHINES; SIGNALS; FUZZY	Incipient fault detection in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions requires robust features for accurate condition-based machine health monitoring. Accurate fault classification is positively linked to the quality of features of the faults. Therefore, there is a need to enhance the quality of the features before classification. This paper presents a novel vibration spectrum imaging (VSI) feature enhancement procedure for low SNR conditions. An artificial neural network (ANN) has been used as a fault classifier using these enhanced features of the faults. The normalized amplitudes of spectral contents of the quasi-stationary time vibration signals are transformed into spectral images. A 2-D averaging filter and binary image conversion, with appropriate threshold selection, are used to filter and enhance the images for the training and testing of the ANN classifier. The proposed novel VSI augments and provides the visual representation of the characteristic vibration spectral features in an image form. This provides enhanced spectral images for ANN training and thus leads to a highly robust fault classifier.

J	Rauber, TW; Boldt, FD; Varejao, FM				Rauber, Thomas W.; Boldt, Francisco de Assis; Varejao, Flavio Miguel			Heterogeneous Feature Models and Feature Selection Applied to Bearing Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Fault Database; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; feature selection	CLASSIFICATION; SCHEME	Distinct feature extraction methods are simultaneously used to describe bearing faults. This approach produces a large number of heterogeneous features that augment discriminative information but, at the same time, create irrelevant and redundant information. A subsequent feature selection phase filters out the most discriminative features. The feature models are based on the complex envelope spectrum, statistical time-and frequency-domain parameters, and wavelet packet analysis. Feature selection is achieved by conventional search of the feature space by greedy methods. For the final fault diagnosis, the k-nearest neighbor classifier, feedforward net, and support vector machine are used. Performance criteria are the estimated error rate and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Experimental results are shown for the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data. The main contribution of this paper is the strategy to use several different feature models in a single pool, together with feature selection to optimize the fault diagnosis system. Moreover, robust performance estimation techniques usually not encountered in the context of engineering are employed.

J	Javed, K; Gouriveau, R; Zerhouni, N; Nectoux, P				Javed, Kamran; Gouriveau, Rafael; Zerhouni, Noureddine; Nectoux, Patrick			Enabling Health Monitoring Approach Based on Vibration Data for Accurate Prognostics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Data driven; feature extraction; monitoring; prognostics	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ROTATING MACHINERY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DEGRADATION; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM; SELECTION; SIGNALS	The performance of data-driven prognostics approaches is closely dependent on the form and trend of extracted features. Indeed, features that clearly reflect the machine degradation should lead to accurate prognostics, which is the global objective of this paper. This paper contributes a new approach for feature extraction/selection: The extraction is based on trigonometric functions and cumulative transformation, and the selection is performed by evaluating feature fitness using monotonicity and trendability characteristics. The proposition is applied to the time-frequency analysis of nonstationary signals using a discrete wavelet transform. The main idea is to map raw vibration data into monotonic features with early trends, which can be easily predicted. To show that, selected features are used to build a model with a data-driven approach, namely, the summation wavelet-extreme learning machine, that enables good balance between model accuracy and complexity. For validation and generalization purposes, the vibration data from two real applications of prognostics and health management challenges are used: 1) cutting tools from a computer numerical control machine (2010); and 2) bearings from the platform PRONOSTIA (2012). The performance of the proposed approach is thoroughly compared with the classical approach by performing feature fitness analysis, cutting-tool wear "estimation", and bearings' "long-term prediction" tasks, which validates the proposition.

This paper presents a new approach that combines the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), the support vector machine (SVM), and the support vector regression (SVR) for the monitoring of ball bearings. The proposed approach uses the HHT to extract new heath indicators from stationary/nonstationary vibration signals able to tack the degradation of the critical components of bearings. The degradation states are detected by a supervised classification technique called SVM, and the fault diagnostic is given by analyzing the extracted health indicators. The estimation of the remaining useful life is obtained by a one-step time-series prediction based on SVR. A set of experimental data collected from degraded bearings is used to validate the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the use of the HHT, the SVM, and the SVR is a suitable strategy to improve the detection, diagnostic, and prognostic of bearing degradation.

Corrosion Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Element Bearing under Constant and Variable Load and Speed Conditions	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IFAC Symposium on Control of Power and Energy Systems (CPES 2015)	DEC 09-11, 2015	New Delhi, INDIA			Fault analysis; features extraction; dimensionality reduction; dynamic recurrent neural network	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; INDUCTION MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VIBRATION	Rolling element bearing defects is one of the main reasons for breakdown in electrical machines. Robust fault analysis (FA) including the diagnosis of faults and predicting their level of fault severity is thus necessary to optimise maintenance, improve reliability and to avoid more catastrophic failure consequences. The proposed diagnostic methods in this paper use the innovative discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for feature extraction and an orthogonal fuzzy neighbourhood discriminative analysis (OFNDA) approach for feature reduction. The dynamic recurrent neural network predicts the conditions of components and classifies faults under different operating conditions.. The results obtained from the real time simulation demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed methodology in classifying the different faults faster and accurately.

J	Peng, Y; Xu, Y; Liu, DT; Li, JB				Peng, Yu; Xu, Yong; Liu, Datong; Li, Junbao			Locality structure preserving based feature selection for prognostics	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Prognostics; health assessment; feature selection; local structure preserving	PERFORMANCE; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; SCHEME; RULE	Feature selection in data-driven modelling is an important research topic for prognostics. The performance of prediction model may vary considerably under different feature subsets. Hence it is important to devise a systematic feature selection method, which offers the guidance for choosing the most representative features for prognostics. Nowadays, feature selection algorithms in the field of prognostics are largely studied to the type of learning: supervised or unsupervised, which leads to poor generalization between different prognostics applications. In this paper, a unified feature selection method, called locality structure preserving based feature selection (LSPFS), is developed to improve the robustness and accuracy of prognostics under both unsupervised and supervised learning conditions. In LSPFS, the local structure of original data is constructed according to the similarity between data points, and the representative features are selected based on their ability to preserve the local structure. Moreover, by designing different local structure via local information and actual degradation information of the data, the introduced method can unify supervised and unsupervised feature selection, and enable their joint study under a general framework. Experiments on NASA turbofan engine simulation dataset and lithium-ion battery dataset are conducted to test and evaluate the proposed algorithm.

In this study, we compared three imputation methods and their effects on different multiple measurement data sets with different sampling time periods. Data sets of liver cancer were used in this study for classification of liver cancer recurrence based on two types of classification models built by support vector machine (SVM) and random forests. The results report appropriate combinations of imputation methods and sampling time periods which achieve better classification results than those of other imputation methods and periods. These reported the leading imputation method with SVM is significantly different (P < 0.001) from mean imputation with SVM which is frequently used by data sets with missing values.

A new online hybrid learning method for adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) prediction model is presented in this paper based on square-root cubature Kalman filter (SCKF) and recursive least squares (RLS). SCKF and RLS are used to recursively optimise ANFIS nonlinear and linear parameters, respectively. Fault feature sensitive to system degradation process is selected as ANFIS predicting variable for fault prediction. The simulation results indicate that the higher forecasting accuracy or the lower computational complexity is obtained compared with other three online learning methods.

J	Lee, CJ; Lee, G; Lee, JM				Lee, Chang Jun; Lee, Gibaek; Lee, Jong Min			A Fault Magnitude-Based Strategy for Effective Fault Diagnosis and Isolation	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING OF JAPAN			English	Article						Fault Isolation; System Decomposition; Support Vector Machine; Dynamic Independent Component Analysis	SYSTEM DECOMPOSITION; QUANTITATIVE MODEL	Various multivariate statistical methods based on pattern recognitions for the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process have been developed to identify and diagnose the root cause of assumed faults. However, even if the same fault occurs, its patterns or traces generated from such conventional approaches can be different according to fault magnitudes. Thus, the fault magnitude should be considered. In this study, a signed digraph (SDG) based on process knowledge is used to identify the relationships between process variables and conceivable faults. A support vector regression (SVR) and dynamic independent component analysis (DICA) are then applied to construct empirical models as a function of process variables associated with assumed faults and their fault magnitudes for isolating a fault and handling non-Gaussian information. In addition, empirical models for predicting fault magnitudes are constructed. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by comparing it with the previous studies applied for the benchmark process.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of liver cancer. We applied a machine learning approach with maximum-relevance-minimum-redundancy (mRMR) algorithm followed by incremental feature selection (IFS) to a set of microarray data generated from 43 tumor and 52 nontumor samples. With the machine learning approach, we identified 117 gene probes that could optimally separate tumor and nontumor samples. These genes not only include known HCC-relevant genes such as MT1X, BMI1, and CAP2, but also include cancer genes that were not found previously to be closely related to HCC, such as TACSTD2. Then, we constructed a molecular interaction network based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data from the STRING database and identified 187 genes on the shortest paths among the genes identified with the machine learning approach. Network analysis reveals new potential roles of ubiquitin C in the pathogenesis of HCC. Based on gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, we showed that the identified subnetwork is significantly enriched in biological processes related to cell death. These results bring new insights of understanding the process of HCC.

In this paper, firstly, a power cablemodel based on FDTD simulation is built to get the typical discharge signals as training samples. Secondly, because the extraction of discharge signal features is crucial, fractal characteristics of the training samples are extracted and inputted into the recognizer. To make the results more accurate, multi-SVM recognizer made up of six Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed in this paper. The result of the multi-SVM recognizer is determined by the vote of the six SVM. Finally, the BP neural networks and ELM are compared with multi-SVM. The accuracy comparison shows that the multi-SVM recognizer has the best accuracy and stability, and it can recognize the discharge type efficiently.

After acquiring vibration signals of various elevator functions, their energy characteristics and time domain indicators were extracted by theoretically analyzing the optimal wavelet packet, in order to construct a feature vector of malfunctions for identifying causes of the malfunctions as input of LS-SVM. Meanwhile, parameters about LS-SVM were optimized by K-fold cross validation (KCV). After diagnosing deviated elevator guide rail, deviated shape of guide shoe, abnormal running of tractor, erroneous rope groove of traction sheave, deviated guide wheel, and tension of wire rope, the results suggested that the LS-SVM based on K-CV optimization was one of effective methods for diagnosing elevator malfunctions.

Application of core vector machines for induction motor drive fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article							DECISION-TREE; PWM INVERTER	This paper presents a core vector machine (CVM)-based framework for induction motor drive fault diagnosis. The proposed method can be used for diagnosis of different electrical drive faults such as switches short circuit, switches open circuit, etc. To classify motor drive faults, a CVM has been trained for each one. The proposed CVM-based fault detection algorithm has a very small training time and space in comparison with support vector machines (SVMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs)-based in addition to the other kinds of fault detection algorithms. The proposed algorithm produces few support vectors (SVs), and therefore is faster than existing algorithms. One of the main points in application of a machine learning method is feature selection. In this study, a new decision tree (DT)-based feature selection algorithm has been presented. The proposed CVM based framework has been applied to a test case. The simulation results show the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed method for fault diagnosis of induction motor drive. The effectiveness of the proposed feature selection algorithm has also been investigated. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection algorithm.

J	Bulutsuz, AG; Yetilmezsoy, K; Durakbasa, N				Bulutsuz, Asli G.; Yetilmezsoy, Kaan; Durakbasa, Numan			Application of fuzzy logic methodology for predicting dynamic measurement errors related to process parameters of coordinate measuring machines	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Coordinate measuring machines; fuzzy logic; measurement accuracy; uncertainty	MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTY; WASTE-WATER; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; CMM; REGRESSION; EFFICIENCY; REACTOR; DESIGN	Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) have a vital and enduring role in the manufacturing process because of their easy adaptation to the systems and high measurement accuracy. Owing to the demand for high accuracy and shorter cycle times of measurement tasks, determining the measurement errors has become more important in precision engineering. Additionally, manufactured components are becoming smaller and tolerances becoming tighter, and therefore, demands for accuracy are increasing. For this reason, dynamic error modeling has become a topic of considerable importance for improving measurement accuracy, manufacturing decisions and process parameter selections. A number of factors such as process parameters, measurement environment, measuring object, reference element, measurement equipment and set-up affect the measurement accuracy of CMM. Considering the complicated inter-relationships among a number of system factors, artificial intelligence-based techniques have become essential tools due to their speed, robustness and non-linear characteristics when working with high-dimensional data. In this study, a fuzzy logic-based methodology was implemented as an artificial intelligence approach for determining measurement errors related to the process parameters for coordinate measuring machines. A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system was developed within the framework of a graphical user interface. Eight-level trapezoidal membership functions were employed for the fuzzy subsets of each model variable. The product and the centre of gravity methods were performed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively. The proposed prognostic model provided a well-suited method and produced promising results in predicting measurement errors by monitoring the process parameters such as optimum measuring point numbers, probing speed and probe radius.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a promising algorithm for estimation of RUL because it can easily process small training sets and multi-dimensional data. Many SVM based methods have been proposed to predict RUL of some key components. We did a literature review related to SVM based RUL estimation within a decade. The references reviewed are classified into two categories: improved SVM algorithms and their applications to RUL estimation. The latter category can be further divided into two types: one, to predict the condition state in the future and then build a relationship between state and RUL; two, to establish a direct relationship between current state and RUL. However, SVM is seldom used to track the degradation process and build an accurate relationship between the current health condition state and RUL. Based on the above review and summary, this paper points out that the ability to continually improve SVM, and obtain a novel idea for RUL prediction using SVM will be future works.

J	Bumblauskas, D				Bumblauskas, Daniel			A Markov decision process model case for optimal maintenance of serially dependent power system components	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Continuous-time Markov decision model; Dependent components; Electrical power system maintenance	REPAIRABLE SYSTEM; POLICY; OPTIMIZATION; REPLACEMENT; REDUNDANCY	Purpose - Using a case study for electrical power equipment, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of dependence between series-connected system components in maintenance decisions. Design/methodology/approach - A continuous-time Markov decision model is formulated to find a minimum cost maintenance policy for a circuit breaker as an independent component while considering a downstream transformer as a dependent component. Maintenance of the dependent component is included implicitly in terms of the costs associated with certain state-action pairs. For policy and cost comparisons, a separate model is also formulated that considers only the circuit breaker as the independent component. After uniformizing the continuous-time models to discrete time, standard methods are used to solve for the average-cost-optimal policies of each model. Findings - The optimal maintenance policy and its cost differ significantly depending on whether or not the dependent component is considered. Research limitations/implications - Data used are from manufacturer databases; additional model validation could be conducted if applied to an electric utility asset fleet within their generation, transmission, and/or distribution system. This model and methodology are already being applied in other contexts such as industrial machinery and equipment, jet engines, amusement park rides, etc. Practical implications - The outcome of this model can be utilized by asset and operations managers to make maintenance decisions based on prediction rather than more traditional time-or condition-based maintenance methodologies. This model is being developed for use as a module in a larger maintenance information system, specifically linking condition monitor data from the field to a predictive maintenance model. Similar methods are being applied to other applications outside the electrical equipment case detailed herein. Originality/value - This model provides a structured approach for managers to decide how to best allocate their resources across a network of inter-connected equipment. Work in this area has not fully considered the importance of dependency on systems maintenance, particularly in applications with highly variable repair and replacement costs.

However, the data which represented by the time wave and vibration spectrum requires technically trained personnel to understand and diagnose. In this research, a simplified technique through visualization of the Operating Deflection Shape (ODS) is proposed. The technique combines both the data of vibration amplitude and phase measurement. An ODS of a general machinery arrangement can be visualized from 4 measurement points. The technique is performed and tested in laboratory condition. Future CBM program should implement this technique because it helps untrained personnel to be able to distinguish primary machinery fault such as unbalance and misalignment easily by visualizing the machine motion.

To reduce the possibility of such unanticipated failures, the system must he monitored for tell-tale symptoms of degradation that are suggestive of imminent failure. In this work, we introduce a novel time series analysis technique that allows the decomposition of the time series into trend and fluctuation components, providing the monitoring software with actionable information about the changes of the system's behavior over time. We analyze the underlying problem and formulate it to a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem that can be solved with existing QP-solvers. However, when the profiling resolution is high, as generally required by real-world applications, such a decomposition becomes intractable to general QP-solvers. To speed up the problem solving, we further transform the problem and present a novel QP formulation, Non-negative QP, for the problem and demonstrate a tractable solution that bypasses the use of slow general QP-solvers. We demonstrate our ideas on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that our method allows us to accurately extract the degradation phenomenon of time series. We further demonstrate the generality of our ideas by applying them beyond classic machine prognostics to problems in identifying the influence of news events on currency exchange rates and stock prices. We fully implement our profiling system and deploy it into several physical systems, such as chemical plants and nuclear power plants, and it greatly helps detect the degradation phenomenon, and diagnose the corresponding components.

The process of conducting condition based maintenance of tunnels	LIFE-CYCLE OF STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS: DESIGN, ASSESSMENT, MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	FOURTH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON LIFE-CYCLE CIVIL ENGINEERING	NOV 16-19, 2014	TOKYO, JAPAN				NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; CONCRETE STRUCTURES; POLICY; SYSTEM	It is important of maintenance strategy for it can ensure the infrastructures are managed to maximize the benefit of society. Condition based maintenance method aimed at promoting or maintaining the performance of structures in safe service condition in an economic, efficient and sustainable way. The application of this method can be divided into four steps: (1) Data acquisition. Getting the current service condition information timely and collecting inspection, repair or rehabilitation records as many as possible. (2) Performance prediction. Build mathematical or physical based models to assess the current condition and predict what will happen in the future. (3) Strategy optimization. Various factors are considered to minimize the life-cycle cost to give the best maintenance strategy. Optimization method is used in this process. (4) Implementation and feedback. Maintainers implement the optimal maintenance strategy, and collecting the feedback data to update the predictive model. This paper gives the procedure of executing condition based maintenance method of tunnel structures. Based on the defects of tunnels collected from manually record and some advanced automated inspection machine, a statistical predictive model is presented to show how the performance will develop without maintenance measures. With the consideration of maintenance cost and tolerant safety degree, an optimal model is generated to give the best maintenance strategy, which concerns how to decide the inspection interval and repair threshold to make life-cycle cost lowest. By using condition based maintenance strategy, it is convinced that the total maintenance cost of the tunnel can be reduced to keep the tunnel structure in a safety, reliable and serviceable condition during its designed life.

The Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) is one of the most popular models to calculate HF survival risk that uses multiple clinical variables to predict HF prognosis and also incorporates impact of HF therapy on patient outcomes. Although the SHFM has been validated across multiple cohorts [1-5], these studies were primarily done using clinical trials databases that do not reflect routine clinical care in the community. Further, the impact of contemporary therapeutic interventions, such as beta-blockers or defibrillators, was incorporated in SHFM by extrapolation from external trials. In this study, we assess the performance of SHFM using EHRs at Mayo Clinic, and sought to develop a risk prediction model using machine learning techiniques that applies routine clinical care data. Our results shows the models which were built using EHR data are more accurate (11% improvement in AUC) with the convenience of being more readily applicable in routine clinical care. Furthermore, we demonstrate that new predictive markers (such as co-morbidities) when incorporated into our models improve prognostic performance significantly (8% improvement in AUC).

In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of a remote monitoring medical system for heart failure prediction and management. The three-part system includes a patient-end for data collection, a medical data center as data storage and analysis, and a doctor-end to diagnosis and intervention. The main objective of the system is to prognose the occurrence risk of heart failure (HF) confirmed by the level of N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) based on the changes of the patients' (systolic and diastolic) blood pressure and body weight that are measured noninvasively in a home environment. The prediction of HF and non-HF patients was achieved by a structured support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. With the present system, we also proposed a scoring method to interpret the long-term risk of HF. We demonstrated the efficiency of the system with a pilot clinical study of 34 samples, where the NT-proBNP test was used to help train the prediction model as well as check the prediction results for our system. Results showed an accuracy of 79.4% for predicting HF on day 7 based on daily body weight and blood pressure data acquired over 30 days.

The offshore wind turbine, wind turbine generator and all renewable energy converting systems, where IM is essential, are the most relevant examples. The reliability of those systems and their availability are the important key of good service and lifetime prolongation. That requires the prediction of maintenance operations and to reduce their cost. In such situations, detection and diagnosis of fault require advanced signal processing techniques. A new method using Gabor transform is implemented to detect Rotor Electrical Fault (REF) in IM. The concept is validated with good experimental results. The purpose is the identification of ERF.

Reliability of wind turbine is critical to extract maximum amount of energy from the wind. The vibration signals in wind turbines rotation parts are of universal non-Gasussian and nonstationarity and the fault samples are usually very limited. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposed a wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on method based on a stable distribution and Wiegthed Support Vector Machines (WSVM). Firstly, the a staple from vibration rotating machine as the input feature vector. Secondly, the wiegthed support vector machine (SVM) was applied to automate the fault diagnosis procedure. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is a very powerful algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis and has much better performance, also we have noted that we can obtain excellent results despite of less training samples.

Not only is manual feature extraction time-consuming and laborious, but also the diagnostic result is easily affected by subjective experience. The stacked autoencoders (SAE) which has powerful learning and representation ability is applied in hydraulic pump fault diagnosis, and if is directly used for training and identification based on vibration signals, so that we don't need to extract features manually. To avoid gradient vanishing and to improve the performance for small training set, ReLU activation function and Dropout strategy are both introduced into SAE. Validated by experiments, proposed SAE is superior to the BP, SVM and traditional SAE. And if can recognize hydraulic pump condition accurately even if the training set is small, which satisfies the engineering application.

This phenomenon is called the relaxation effect of lithium-ion batteries. Studies have confirmed the relaxation effect is a key element within the remaining useful life prediction. However, due to the lack of related mechanism analysis for the relaxation effect, it's hard to deduce a convincing model. This paper tries to deduce a diffusion polarization model to describe relaxation effect by mechanism analysis. Subsequently, the model parameters are estimated and the simulation experiment is conducted to verify the model. The result is found to be satisfactory to quantify regeneration capacity and reflect the attenuation of relaxation effect.

The extraction of the vibration signal feature will directly influence the accuracy and practicability of fault diagnosis. This paper presents an extraction method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and correlation dimension. Firstly, original vibration signals are decomposed into a finite number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, calculate the correlation dimension of the top four IMF by the G-P algorithm. At last, calculate the root mean square value of the four correlation dimensions to be as the characteristic of vibration signal for HV circuit breaker. Practical examples show that the characteristics through the extraction approach put forward can represent effectively fault patterns of HV circuit breaker.

Recent advancement in sensor data collection in clinical sciences lead to a complex, heterogeneous data processing, and analysis for patient diagnosis and prognosis. Diagnosis and treatment of patients based on manual analysis of these sensor data are difficult and time consuming. Therefore, development of Knowledge-based systems to support clinicians in decision-making is important. However, it is necessary to perform experimental work to compare performances of different machine learning methods to help to select appropriate method for a specific characteristic of data sets. This paper compares classification performance of three popular machine learning methods i.e., case-based reasoning, neutral networks and support vector machine to diagnose stress of vehicle drivers using finger temperature and heart rate variability. The experimental results show that case-based reasoning outperforms other two methods in terms of classification accuracy. Case-based reasoning has achieved 80% and 86% accuracy to classify stress using finger temperature and heart rate variability. On contrary, both neural network and support vector machine have achieved less than 80% accuracy by using both physiological signals.

Diagnosis of Rotor Inter-Turn Fault of Electrical Machine at Speed Using Stray Flux Test Method	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2015 12TH IEEE AFRICON INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE - GREEN INNOVATION FOR AFRICAN RENAISSANCE (AFRICON)	Africon		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Green Innovation for Africon Renaissance (AFRICON)	SEP 14-17, 2015	Addis Ababa, ETHIOPIA	IEEE		Inter-Turn Fault; Recurrent Surge Oscillograph; Round rotor windings; Stray flux test	SHORT CIRCUITS	The problem of detecting and locating shorted turns in round rotor windings has always been difficult. This is because the winding is completely embedded in the steel and the turn's insulation is not physically loaded until it is subjected to the centrifugal forces produced at speed. Thus, this problem appears to be without practically known solution. However, efforts have been made by some researchers, especially in the Power Industry to develop systems for detecting and analysing rotor faults which could possibly be caused by shorted turns. Repetitive Surge Oscillograph (RSO) and some other methods developed are not effective enough. A new method called Stray flux test can be used effectively to determine and locate an inter-turn short circuited fault on generator rotor. This paper describes the design and operation of a new shorted turn detector method called Stray flux test. This method provides data at operating speed to locate the coil(s) which have shorted turns and gives indications as to the number of turns shorted in the affected coils while the rotor is at speed.

First, a multi-physical model of the machine, able to generate vibration displacements under different operating conditions, is simulated. The presented analytical modeling has been compared and validated, in various papers, by a Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Then, time and frequency domain signal processing techniques are applied to extract crucial features sets, related to healthy and different faulty cases, from vibration displacements. In this study, both rotor eccentricity and Permanent Magnet (PM) demagnetization faults are considered and simulated in the analytical model. The asymmetry coefficient (skewness) and the median frequency of the signal are selected as relevant fault-related indicators. Then, a pattern recognition method based on a Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP ANN) is used to detect the fault and to identify its type if existing. After all, an arbitrary set of aforementioned indicators is used to test and validate the performance of the proposed fault detection and diagnosis method.

He spent much of his time analyzing bearings, linkages, gears and numerous other mechanical transmission modes. Many of Da Vinci's ideas are still memorable in the engineering world today. Hertz stresslife advocates for ball and roller bearings respectively, The Lundberg-Palmgren prototypical was recycled to predict the life of commercial. In recent year roller bearings will goes under predict bearing lives. Tests were conducted with bearing No. 6204, Accelerometer used in the experiment is ADXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer works on 3V power supply, and it is an analog device and having a bandwidth range of 0.5Hz to 1600Hz. The microcontroller to be used is Aurdino UNO DAQ's which is needed to use the ADXL 335 accelerometer for getting the data of Vibration of Faulty Bearings. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a self-adaptive investigation method for signal process. The EMD method is highly efficient in non-stationary and nonlinear data analysis. It has been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machine. In this paper, a classification technique based on correlation coefficient was present, which can originate a one-on-one relationship between IMFs which decomposed from dissimilar signals by EMD method. And then, the feature of each IMF is extracted and calculated by using Support vector machines (SVMs). That will mark the intelligent fault diagnosis.

Special attention has been devoted to noninvasive methods capable of detecting faults using measured data without requiring motor disassembly and its structural parts. Some enterprises such as Mining, Petroleum and Water and Sewage Treatment process uses induction motor of large power flow, what are installed at remote sites. The electrical and mechanical failures of such motors often disrupt productivity and require maintenance. Currently the containment of maintenance costs, these remote sites work without the presence of a service technician. A fuzzy logic approach may help to diagnose induction motor faults at these sites and to transmit the fault diagnosis (via 3G technology) to maintenance central or a cell phone programmed. The contribution of this paper is the use of fuzzy logic for the automated practical detection of broken bars in induction motors in remote locations without the presence of an experienced technician.

A NOVEL SEMI-SUPEVISED MATHEMATICAL MORPHOLOGY-BASED FAULT DETECTION & CLASSIFICATION METHOD FOR ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 12-16, 2015	Florence, ITALY				VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION; OPERATORS	Rolling element bearings consist one of the most widely used industrial machine elements, being the interface between the stationary and the rotating part of the machine. The capability to detect fast and accurately the existence and severity of a fault in an installation during operation is crucial as an unexpected machine failure can lead to unacceptably long maintenance stops. In this paper, a novel online semi-supervised method is introduced for bearing fault detection and classification. A novel feature extraction method based on the "Mathematical Morphology" and the "Instantaneous Frequencies Estimation via Subspace Invariance Properties of (Complex Shifted Morlet) Wavelet Structures (IFESIS)" method is proposed. Initially the raw signal is transformed using a morphological operator by its interaction with a flat Structural Element (SE). The shape modified signal is further processed using IFESIS. The true (measured) bearing defect characteristic frequencies are detected by locating the highest Singular Values (SVs) of the corresponding Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) problem. The values of their harmonics are further calculated. Groups of characteristic harmonics are used by IFESIS in order to extract the nonzero SVs which consist the novel features and are further used as inputs to a Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) classifier focusing towards early abnormal change detection. Data captured during normal operation conditions are used for the training of the SVDD model fitting a tight hypersphere around them. The distance of the test data features from the center of the hypersphere is used as a health indicator. In case an abnormality is detected, a bearing fault classification is performed in a second step. The effectiveness of the proposed online method is validated using two bearing fault experimental cases from the NASA Prognostics Data Repository. The proposed method not only detects successfully anomalies at the early stage of failures bay additionally classifies the faults.

These defects can excite a tapered roller bearing into vibration. When defects exist on more than one roller, the relative locations and the phases of the rollers with defects can produce complex vibration signatures. Because gross bearing damage is more likely to affect multiple rollers than just a single roller, for rotary machine health monitoring and fault diagnosis it is important to understand the vibration characteristics created by multiple roller defects. In this paper, the vibration of a tapered roller bearing excited by localized defects on multiple rollers is studied using a 3D vibration model. The vibration characteristics exhibited in vibration waveforms and frequency spectra are analyzed both in the radial direction and in the axial direction with respect to the bearing geometry.

DAMAGE DETECTION IN ROTORS USING WAVELET ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONAL DEFLECTION SHAPES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 12-16, 2015	Florence, ITALY				IDENTIFICATION; BEAMS	Fatigue cracks in high speed rotating machinery are a vital source of catastrophic failures. Hence, the diagnosis of fatigue crack location identification in uninterrupted rotating systems is still an active and challenging research problem in equipment predictive maintenance. In the available literature, many damage detection techniques have been proposed with their own advantages and limitations. The operating deflection shape (ODS), which represents the deflection of a vibrating structure at a particular frequency to a specific structural loading, has been gaining importance for crack detection in recent years. In this study, obtained ODS of cracked rotor are processed, using continuous wavelet transforms to detect, localize and quantify the fault severity. Steady state or run-up vibration data will only provide information about the presence of the damage. On the other hand using spatial vibration information such as operation deflection shapes or mode shapes is more likely to detect the location of the fault. In the present study the operational deflection of displacement and strain energy are extracted from the finite element model at a particular speed of the rotor. The difference vectors obtained between undamaged and damaged ODS are used as input vectors for the wavelet transform analysis. The performance of the displacement and strain energy based damage detection is tested by including noise of signal data. The quantification of the damage severity is estimated using a parameter formulated from the distribution of wavelet coefficients with respect to the scales. The choice of mother wavelet selection and effect of scales on the quantification of the defect is evaluated. Diagnosis results for different damage cases such as single and multiple damages are presented.	[Prasad, S. Rathna; Sekhar, A.

ONLINE DETECTION OF BEARING HEALTH STATUS AND DEFECT TYPE IN GRINDING MACHINE SPINDLES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SOUND AND VIBRATION: MAJOR CHALLENGES IN ACOUSTICS, NOISE AND VIBRATION RESEARCH, 2015			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV)	JUL 12-16, 2015	Florence, ITALY					Application of a data fusion based methodology for online detection of health status and defect type in the bearing of a grinding machine is presented. In practice, knowing the exact defect status and type is infeasible. Information regarding the current health status and defect type of a bearing may help in building prognosis models. As the proposed detection methodology is based on data fusion, dependence on a single damage identification parameter is obviated. The fused data parameter takes into account the correlation among all the damage identification parameters considered. Diagnosis of a bearing with naturally induced and progressed defect may have multiple complexities. Typically used condition monitoring parameters, such as R.M.S. and peak may not have monotonically increasing trends. In the case of natural defects, one type of the defect may be prominent in the initial phase and later on, another type of defect may outgrow the first one or both may exist simultaneously. The methodology is verified with the help of a dataset acquired from a naturally induced and progressed defect on an accelerated test rig. The bearing is dismantled after the experiment to confirm the defect type identified through the method.

When faults are developed in inner race, outer race and rotating elements then diagnosis and interpretation is important. Vibration based condition monitoring technique is gaining importance duet to the fact that monitoring can be done without stopping machine. When defect is developed and component is rotating then impulsive force is generated. This phenomenon can be efficiently characterized with the help of signal processing techniques. In the proposed methodology base wavelets such as coiflet, symlet, morlet, complex Shannon are compared and minimum permutation entropy criteria are used for selection of base wavelet. Statistical parameters such as form factor, crest factor, permutation entropy along with loader condition and rotational speed for both horizontal and vertical responses are calculated from wavelet coefficients to construct feature vector for fault classification using supervised learning methods. Further to maximize classification accuracy feature ranking procedure using chi square attribute selection method is evaluated. The advantage of feature ranking technique is that irrelevant features are discarded thereby reducing the size of feature set. Chi square feature ranking is evaluated using support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron and random forest classifier. Fault classification of proposed methodology is evaluated with ten-fold cross validation efficiency since it provides statistical unbiased result. It is observed that 100 % training efficiency and 100 % ten-fold cross validation efficiency is obtained with only top two ranked features using random forest classifier.

J	An, D; Kim, NH; Choi, JH				An, Dawn; Kim, Nam H.; Choi, Joo-Ho			Practical options for selecting data-driven or physics-based prognostics algorithms with reviews	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Review						Data-driven prognostics; Physics-based prognostics; Neural network; Gaussian process regression; Particle filter; Bayesian inference	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL VALIDATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CRACK-GROWTH; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; BATTERY; IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETERS	This paper is to provide practical options for prognostics so that beginners can select appropriate methods for their fields of application. To achieve this goal, several popular algorithms are first reviewed in the data-driven and physics-based prognostics methods. Each algorithm's attributes and pros and cons are analyzed in terms of model definition, model parameter estimation and ability to handle noise and bias in data. Fatigue crack growth examples are then used to illustrate the characteristics of different algorithms. In order to suggest a suitable algorithm, several studies are made based on the number of data sets, the level of noise and bias, availability of loading and physical models, and complexity of the damage growth behavior. Based on the study, it is concluded that the Gaussian process is easy and fast to implement, but works well only when the covariance function is properly defined. The neural network has the advantage in the case of large noise and complex models but only with many training data sets. The particle filter and Bayesian method are superior to the former methods because they are less affected by noise and model complexity, but work only when physical model and loading conditions are available.

Machine Learning Applications	SPRINGER HANDBOOK OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Book Chapter							DECISION TREES; INTELLIGENCE; INDUSTRIAL; ALGORITHM; DESIGN; FUSION	We describe the process of building computational intelligence (CI) models for machine learning (ML) applications. We use offline metaheuristics to design themodels' run-time architectures and online metaheuristics to control/aggregate the object-level models (base models) in these architectures. CI techniques complement more traditional statistical techniques, which are the core of ML for unsupervised and supervised learning. We analyze CI/ML industrial applications in the area of prognostics and health management (PHM) for industrial assets, and describe two PHM case studies. In the first case, we address anomaly detection for aircraft engines; in the second one, we rank locomotives in a fleet according to their expected remaining useful life. Then, we illustrate similar CI-enabled capabilities as they are applied to risk management for commercial and financial assets. In this context, we describe three case studies in insurance underwriting, mortgage collateral valuation, and portfolio optimization. We explain the current trend favoring the use of model ensemble and fusion over individual models, and emphasize the need for injecting diversity during the model generation phase. We present a model-agnostic fusion mechanism, which can be used with commoditized models obtained from crowdsourcing, cloud-based evolution, and other sources. Finally, we explore research trends, and future challenges/opportunities for ML techniques in the emerging context of big data and cloud computing.

Based on SHM real-time data, in-service structure lifetime prognostic and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) can be performed. Maintenance timetable can be therefore predicted by optimizing inspection times. A probabilistic ap-proach is combined with phenomenological fatigue damage models for composite mate-rials to perform maintenance cost-effectiveness of composite structure. A Monte Carlo method is used to estimate the probability of failure of composite structures and com-pute the average number of composite structure components to be replaced over the component lifetime. The replacement frequency of a given structure component over the aircraft lifetime is assessed. A first application of aeronautical composite structure maintenance is considered. Two composite models to predict the fatigue life and several laminates have been used. Our study shows that maintenance cost-effectiveness depends on material and fatigue loading applied.	[Cot, D.

Given that the integration of diagnostic-prognostic models in these industrial systems is facilitated by these developments. In fact, the monitoring of the degradation indicators is used indirectly in failure prognostic models and is just a measurement of an unwanted situation. Therefore, the diagnostic is not only a failure detection procedure but it also indicates the actual state and the history of the system. Hence, a predictive maintenance is done by the subsequent prognostic model. Consequently, from a predefined threshold of degradation, the remaining useful lifetime is estimated. Based on a physical dynamic vehicle suspension system, this research paper elaborates a procedure to create a failure prognostic model. I will adopt here analytic laws of degradation such as the Paris-Erdogan law for fatigue degradation and the Palmgren-Miner law for cumulative damage instead of applying degradation abaci largely used in prognostic studies.

This holds for rotating machines or alternating currents. The resulting signals are then periodic signals or contain periodic parts. It can be used for fault detection of rotating machines. In this paper, we studied the periodic time series of the superposition of two oscillations from the multifractal point of view. The wavelet transform modulus maxima method was used for the singularity spectrum computations. The results show that the width and the peak position of the singularity spectrum changed significantly when the amplitude, frequency, or the phase difference changed. So, the width and the peak position of the singularity spectrum can be used as a new measure for periodic signals.

J	Torkaman, H; Karimi, F				Torkaman, H.; Karimi, F.			Measurement variations of insulation resistance/polarization index during utilizing time in HV electrical machines - A survey	MEASUREMENT			English	Review						Insulation quality measurement; Insulation resistance; Polarization index; Insulation faults; Fault analysis; High voltage electrical machine	STATOR WINDING INSULATION; PARTIAL DISCHARGE; ROTATING MACHINES; DIELECTRIC RESPONSE; ONLINE; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; MODEL; TRANSFORMERS; TEMPERATURE	The concept of insulation system is chiefly concerned with the stator winding lifetime of the high voltage (HV) electrical machines. Along with the insulation testing, insulation resistance (IR) and polarization index (PI) techniques are suitable for different types of HV electrical machines and transformers. Since the power plant industries have to move toward higher reliability, the IR/PI accurate analysis needs to be optimized. This precise study is necessary, since the results of resistance measurement during a period of time are variable and depend on different factors. This point of view indicates the important role of the IR/PI variations assessment over the utilization time. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to evaluate the dependency of IR/PI variations on the main profiles as; current components, insulation conditions, and constant time. For this purpose, deviation of the resistance values in the mentioned tests are presented and discussed to achieve the optimum trend of IR/PI results interpreting. A comprehensive review of literature was done and industry experts were surveyed for their ideas and experience under a research project. The main results are summarized in this paper.

Considering the nonlinear restoring force of ball bearing, the dynamic equation of a rotor-bearing system containing four typical faults was deduced with lumped mass method. Vibration responses of the system under various conditions of different rotational speeds, fault types and fault degrees were acquired. An alternative empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method improved by wavelet packet decomposition was developed to process the fault signals. Time-frequency characteristics calculated via the improved EMD as well as statistical parameters of the signal in time-and frequency-domains were extracted as fault features. Then, fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) optimized by multi-population genetic algorithm was adopted to identify the state of the system automatically. Fault diagnosis results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach as well as its superiority over commonly used support vector machines. The performances of different fault features and the anti-noise capability of the approach were also investigated.

The analyzed signal is preprocessed with the weighted Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) to suppress the interference of high-frequency intermittent components and other non-Gaussian noises. The denoised signal is extended with LS-SVM rolling forecast modeling. Next, the linear function is used to construct upper and lower envelopes of the extrapolated data in order to determine the temporary mean envelope curve which is then smoothed with the adaptive mapped LS-SVM to obtain the local mean curve. Signal decomposition is self-adaptively performed to achieve IMFs through removal of the smoothed local mean curve. The representative IMF containing fault information is selected for demodulation analysis to identify the fault characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by means of simulations and applications to bearing fault diagnosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fang, XL; Zhou, RS; Gebraeel, N				Fang, Xiaolei; Zhou, Rensheng; Gebraeel, Nagi			An adaptive functional regression-based prognostic model for applications with missing data	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Prognostics; Functional principal components analysis; Functional regression analysis; Remaining useful life	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; DEGRADATION SIGNALS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; RESIDUAL-LIFE; SPARSE; PREDICTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; TRAJECTORIES; MACHINE; SYSTEMS	Most prognostic degradation models rely on a relatively accurate and comprehensive database of historical degradation signals. Typically, these signals are used to identify suitable degradation trends that are useful for predicting lifetime. In many real-world applications, these degradation signals are usually incomplete, i.e., contain missing observations. Often the amount of missing data compromises the ability to identify a suitable parametric degradation model. This paper addresses this problem by developing a semi-parametric approach that can be used to predict the remaining lifetime of partially degraded systems. First, key signal features are identified by applying Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA) to the available historical data. Next, an adaptive functional regression model is used to model the extracted signal features and the corresponding times-to-failure. The model is then used to predict remaining lifetimes and to update these predictions using real-time signals observed from fielded components. Results show that the proposed approach is relatively robust to significant levels of missing data. The performance of the model is evaluated and shown to provide significantly accurate predictions of residual lifetime using two case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Finding a good strategy for fault diagnosis can help to reduce maintenance cost and enhance reliability. The S-statistic based on the comparison of two reconstructed attractors (RA's) in the phase space was applied to diagnose different types of faults in bearings (inner, ball, and outer faults). To achieve the aim, measured signals of a normal bearing and several faulty bearings were decomposed to sub-signals by wavelet packet so that frequency of each defect is located in a unique packet. Comparing the result for normal and faulty sub-signals using the S-statistic indicate that the method can be applied for fault diagnosis.

This paper presents a technique for accurate assessment of the remnant life of machines based on health state probability estimation technique. For comparative study of the proposed model with the proportional hazard model (PHM), experimental bearing failure data from an accelerated bearing test rig were used. The result shows that the proposed prognostic model based on health state probability estimation can provide a more accurate prediction capability than the commonly used PHM in bearing failure case study.

These growing requirements result in tandem rolling mill, which is of substantial interest to the steel industry, in order to improve quality and productivity. In such an environment, it is important to construct appropriate condition monitoring, which can lead to achieving the highest economic efficiency and avoiding equipment damage. This paper proposes a comprehensive condition monitoring methodology based on statistical feature extraction technique to increase the efficiency of feature extraction from high-dimensional feature space. It is examined that one can explore easily the effective features by using three-dimensional feature space for the condition monitoring. The method has been applied on condition monitoring of the stationary rolling in steel industry.

Equipment manufacturers can potentially provide services significantly more efficiently and effectively by utilizing information about their installed base (IB). We aim to recognize decision support functionality and required information contents for a system that supports service business in the context of services like 'full service', lease of maintained equipment, extended warranties, and operations and maintenance. A further supported function is product and service development. Eight cases from Finnish machine-building and telecommunications industries provide a basis for our view of business needs in decision support of operational and tactical levels of service business management. We present a vision of a decision-making tool for service business of equipment manufacturers-the service business management environment (SBME)-and identify decision-making situations ('use cases') of SBME. SBME integrates ideas and information content from engineering asset management, condition-based maintenance, standards to represent and exchange life cycle, reliability and maintenance data, and e-maintenance. If successful, SBME can support transformation of equipment manufacturers to service business. This takes place by aggregating information from whole IB, which enables better accuracy in health assessment, prognostics, cost estimation, awareness of service contract status in terms of defined KPIs, and analysis of profitability of service offerings. Furthermore, SBME supports product development by providing information on field reliability, maintainability, recognition of epidemics, and other inputs.

Bayesian Hierarchical Models for aerospace gas turbine engine prognostics	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Condition-based maintenance; Prognostics; Gas turbine engine; Bayesian Hierarchical Model	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; DEGRADATION SIGNALS; VARIANCE; TUTORIAL	Improved prognostics is an emerging requirement for modern health monitoring that aims to increase the fidelity of failure-time predictions by the appropriate use of sensory and reliability information. In the aerospace industry, it is a key technology to maximise aircraft availability, offering a route to increase time in-service and to reduce operational disruption through improved asset management. An aircraft engine is a complex system comprising multiple subsystems that have dependent interactions so it is difficult to construct a model of its degradation dynamics based on physical principles. This complexity suggests that a statistically robust methodology for handling large quantities of real-time data would be more appropriate. In this work, therefore, a Bayesian approach is taken to exploit fleet-wide data from multiple assets to perform probabilistic estimation of remaining useful life for civil aerospace gas turbine engines. The paper establishes a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to perform inference and inform a probabilistic model of remaining useful life. Its performance is compared with that of an existing Bayesian non-Hierarchical Model and is found to be superior in typical (heterogeneous) scenarios. The techniques use Bayesian methods to combine two sources of information: historical in-service data across the engine fleet and once per-flight transmitted performance measurement from the engine(s) under prognosis. The proposed technique provides predictive results within well defined uncertainty bounds and demonstrates several advantages of the hierarchical variant's ability to integrate multiple unit data to address realistic prognostic challenges. This is illustrated by an example from a civil aerospace gas turbine fleet data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By rotating the signal in the analysis window, the local instantaneous frequency has been reset to parallel to the time axis. Then the high frequency and time resolution have been achieved with the mono-frequency signal simultaneously. To find the optimal rotating angle of the local signal, an iterative approximation algorithm has been utilized, which makes the ANSTFT a non-parametric data driving method and have the better generalization ability than the conventional adaptive STFT. Moreover, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the aforementioned characteristics and the application of ANSTFT to echolocation signal analysis demonstrates its validity.

A new method of accurate broken rotor bar diagnosis based on modulation signal bispectrum analysis of motor current signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Induction motors; Conventional bispectrum; Modulation signal bispectrum; Motor current signal model; Broken rotor bar	INDUCTION MACHINES; FAULT	Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been an effective way of monitoring electrical machines for many years. However, inadequate accuracy in diagnosing incipient broken rotor bars (BRB) has motivated many studies into improving this method. In this paper a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) analysis is applied to motor currents from different broken bar cases and a new MSB based sideband estimator (MSB-SE) and sideband amplitude estimator are introduced for obtaining the amplitude at (1 +/- 2s)f(s) (s is the rotor slip and f(s) is the fundamental supply frequency) with high accuracy. As the MSB-SE has a good performance of noise suppression, the new estimator produces more accurate results in predicting the number of BRB, compared with conventional power spectrum analysis. Moreover, the paper has also developed an improved model for motor current signals under rotor fault conditions and an effective method to decouple the BRB current which interferes with that of speed oscillations associated with BRB. These provide theoretical supports for the new estimators and clarify the issues in using conventional bispectrum analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, W; Zhu, ZC; Jiang, F; Zhou, GB; Chen, GA				Li, Wei; Zhu, Zhencai; Jiang, Fan; Zhou, Gongbo; Chen, Guoan			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery with a novel statistical feature extraction and evaluation method	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Feature extraction; Fault classification; Rotating machinery	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; CLASSIFICATION; ENVELOPE; SYSTEM; SVMS	Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is receiving more and more attentions. Vibration signals of rotating machinery are commonly analyzed to extract features of faults, and the features are identified with classifiers, e.g. artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Due to nonlinear behaviors and unknown noises in machinery, the extracted features are varying from sample to sample, which may result in false classifications. It is also difficult to analytically ensure the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In this paper, a feature extraction and evaluation method is proposed for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Based on the central limit theory, an extraction procedure is given to obtain the statistical features with the help of existing signal processing tools. The obtained statistical features approximately obey normal distributions. They can significantly improve the performance of fault classification, and it is verified by taking ANN and SVM classifiers as examples. Then the statistical features are evaluated with a decoupling technique and compared with thresholds to make the decision on fault classification. The proposed evaluation method only requires simple algebraic computation, and the accuracy of fault classification can be analytically guaranteed in terms of the so-called false classification rate (FCR). An experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, where the unbalanced fault of rotor, inner race fault, outer race fault and ball fault of bearings are considered.

J	Tamilselvan, P; Wang, PF				Tamilselvan, Prasanna; Wang, Pingfeng			A tri-fold hybrid classification approach for diagnostics with unexampled faulty states	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnostics; Health monitoring; Unexampled faulty	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; OUTLIER DETECTION; TRANSFORMERS; PROPAGATION; MULTICLASS; ALGORITHM; MACHINE; MODELS	System health diagnostics provides diversified benefits such as improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for the operation and maintenance of engineered systems. Successful health diagnostics requires the knowledge of system failures. However, with an increasing system complexity, it is extraordinarily difficult to have a well-tested system so that all potential faulty states can be realized and studied at product testing stage. Thus, real time health diagnostics requires automatic detection of unexampled system faulty states based upon sensory data to avoid sudden catastrophic system failures. This paper presents a trifold hybrid classification (THC) approach for structural health diagnosis with unexampled health states (UHS), which comprises of preliminary VHS identification using a new thresholded Mahalanobis distance (TMD) classifier, VHS diagnostics using a two-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and exampled health states diagnostics using a multi-class SVM classifier. The proposed THC approach, which takes the advantages of both TMD and SVM-based classification techniques, is able to identify and isolate the unexampled faulty states through interactively detecting the deviation of sensory data from the exampled health states and forming new ones autonomously. The proposed THC approach is further extended to a generic framework for health diagnostics problems with unexampled faulty states and demonstrated with health diagnostics case studies for power transformers and rolling bearings.

The aim of the present study was to develop a new approach to screen SRSF2 mutation and analyze the clinical relevance of SRSF2 mutations in Chinese MDS. A protocol based on high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) was established to screen SRSF2-P95 mutation in 108 MDS patients and was compared with Sanger sequencing. The clinical relevance of SRSF2 mutations was further evaluated. HRMA identified five (4.6%) cases with SRSF2 mutation, completely validated by Sanger sequencing without false positive or negative results. The sensitivities of HRMA and Sanger sequencing were 10% and 25% for the detection of SRSF2-P95H mutation, respectively, against the background of wild-type DNA. Patients with SRSF2 mutation had shorter overall survival time than those with wild-type SRSF2 in both the whole cohort of cases and those with normal karyotype (P=0.069 and 0.023, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed SRSF2 mutation as an independent risk factor in both patient populations. We established a fast, high-throughput, and inexpensive HRMA-based method to screen SRSF2 mutation, which could be used in clinical diagnostic laboratories. SRSF2 mutations were significantly associated with mortality rate in the MDS affected Chinese.

In particular, with the growth in battery-powered electric vehicle development, the lithium-ion battery plays a critical role in the reliability of vehicle systems. In order to provide timely maintenance and replacement of battery systems, it is necessary to develop a reliable and accurate battery health diagnostic that takes a prognostic approach. Therefore, this paper focuses on two main methods to determine a battery's health: (1) Battery State-of-Health (SOH) monitoring and (2) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Both of these are calculated by using a filter algorithm known as the Support Vector Regression-Particle Filter (SVR-PF). Models for battery SOH monitoring based on SVR-PF are developed with novel capacity degradation parameters introduced to determine battery health in real time. Moreover, the RUL prediction model is proposed, which is able to provide the RUL value and update the RUL probability distribution to the End-of-Life cycle. Results for both methods are presented, showing that the proposed SOH monitoring and RUL prediction methods have good performance and that the SVR-PF has better monitoring and prediction capability than the standard particle filter (PF).

J	Zhou, DJ; Zhang, HS; Weng, SL				Zhou, Dengji; Zhang, Huisheng; Weng, Shilie			A novel prognostic model of performance degradation trend for power machinery maintenance	ENERGY			English	Article						Power machinery; Remaining useful life; Performance degradation trend prediction; Maintenance; Compressor washing	RESIDUAL LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; DIAGNOSTICS; COMPONENTS; SYSTEM	Power machinery has two types of fault modes. The first type leads equipment to stop working, and the second one results in performance degradation. The second type should not be ignored, because of its safe, economic and environmental consequence. Aiming at the second type of fault modes, current prognostic model for the remaining useful life of equipment is usually-based on the historical data of the equipment fault or malfunction, which can provide evidence for maintenance. However, this model just depends on the time based fault data, without taking the operation state into consideration. In this paper, a novel prognostic model of performance degradation trend is developed, which is based on current prognostic models for the remaining useful life. It combines the historical fault data and monitoring data in operation. This model can be used for maintenance optimization. Maintenance activities, according to the result of this model, actually combine the viewpoint of Time Based Maintenance and Condition Based Maintenance. Finally, compressor washing of a gas turbine engine is cited as an instance to validate this model. Maintenance strategies based on the new model infers that it not only keeps the reliability of equipment, but also reduces the maintenance cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These potentially dangerous pulsating torques may be effectively reduced by carefully setting the machine's drive control. A novel approach based on a complex finite element model and further postprocessing is used. Results obtained from electromagnetic calculations in the form of pulsating torques are used as mechanical loading of a structural dynamic model. This complex model intended for rotor vibration analysis is described in brief in the mechanical part of the paper. The proposed methodology is applied to the machine used as a propulsion unit for multisystem locomotives of 1600 kW power. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Incipient faults are monitored by conventional and artificial intelligence based models. Key gases, percentage value of gases, and ratio of the Doernenburg, Roger, IEC methods are input variables to artificial intelligence models, which affects the accuracy of incipient fault diagnosis, so selection of the most influencing relevant input variable is an important research area. With this main objective, Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software is applied to 360 simulated samples having different operating lives to find the most influencing input parameters for incipient fault diagnosis in the gene expression programming model. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis identifies%C2H2,%C2H4,%CH4, C2H6/C2H2, C2H2/C2H4, CH4/H-2, C2H4/C2H6, and C2H2/CH4 as the most relevant input variables in incipient fault diagnosis, and it is used for fault diagnosis using different artificial intelligence methods, i.e., artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, and gene expression programming. The compared results shows that gene expression programming gives better results than the artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, and support vector machine with accuracy variation from 98.15 to 100%, proving the gene expression programming method can be used in transformer fault diagnosis research.

However, experiments show that 1-class SVM is sensitive to the outliers included in the training data set. To cope with this problem, a robust 1-class SVM is proposed in this paper. With the designed penalty factors, the robust 1-class SVM can depress the influences of outliers. Fault detection scheme is constructed based on the robust 1-class SVM. The simulation example shows that the robust 1-class SVM is superior to the general 1-class SVM, especially when the training data set is corrupted by outliers, and the fault detection scheme based on robust 1-class SVM presents satisfactory performances.

Fault propagation analysis of oscillations in control loops using data-driven causality and plant connectivity	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Causal analysis; Fault propagation; Control loops; Paper machine; Connectivity information; Industrial application	SYSTEMATIC FRAMEWORK; SIGNED DIGRAPHS; DIAGNOSIS	Oscillations in control loops are one of the most prevalent problems in industrial processes. Due to their adverse effect on the overall process performance, finding how oscillations propagate through the process units is of major importance. This paper presents a method for integrating process causality and topology which ultimately enables to determine the propagation path of oscillations in control loops. The integration is performed using a dedicated search algorithm which validates the quantitative results of the data-driven causality using the qualitative information on plant connectivity. The outcome is an enhanced causal model which reveals the propagation path. The analysis is demonstrated on a case study of an industrial paperboard machine with multiple oscillations in its drying section due to valve stiction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP/p97)-Expression Correlates with Prognosis of HPV- Negative Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NF-KAPPA-B; HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION; EXPRESSION LEVEL; CANCER INCIDENCE; ORAL-CAVITY; VIRAL LOAD; HEAD; P97; DEGRADATION; ASSOCIATION	Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 has been shown to be associated with antiapoptotic function via activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) signaling pathway and with metastasizing of tumors in several studies. VCP is located on chromosome 9p13-p12, a region often deleted in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The clinical significance of VCP expression in OSCC however remains unclear. In this study, expression of VCP was determined in 106 patients (77 male (71.3%) and 31 female (28.7%); age-range: 34-79 years (mean age 57 years)) by immunohistochemistry and in a subset of 15 patients by quantitative PCR. HPV-DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction and p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry. The experimental findings were correlated with clinicopathological data and survival parameters. 47.2% of all OSCC specimens were analyzed as negative or weak staining intensity for VCP. 52.8% of all specimens showed a high staining intensity for VCP. 73.1% of all patients were tested HPV-negative, 26.9% were HPV-positive. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival probabilities of all patients were 71.2% and 55.7%, respectively. No correlation could be found between HPV-status and VCP expression. VCP overexpression in HPV-negative patients was associated with significantly better 5-year disease-free survival (86.4% vs., 45.6%, p=0.017). The level of VCP-intensity determined by immunohistochemistry could be an additional prognostic marker in HPV-negative OSCC. VCP expression seems not to correlate with the HPV-status.

Their fault diagnosis and prognosis are critical for the maintenance decision making. In reality, few bearings are working under constant operating conditions. So, robust features which are not sensitive to the operating condition are needed for bearing prognostics. Sometimes, even if they are working under stationary conditions, common-used degradation features are non-trendable and cannot be used to predict the remaining useful lives. In order to address these two issues, shock pulse method and frequency analysis are combined to detect the incipient fault and predict the remaining useful lives. Maximum normalized shock value which is extracted using shock pulse method can reflect the degradation process more robust under non-stationary conditions. And frequency analysis can identify the change points of degradation states when degradation features are non-trendable. Finally, a case study is conducted where the proposed methods are demonstrated by analyzing the 2012 PHM challenge data sets.

Gears are the most essential parts in rotating machinery. Their health status is a significant index to indicate whether machines can run continually or not. So, gear fault diagnosis and damage level identification is very important in engineering practice. An accuracy way to identify the state of gears is urgently needed for the maintenance decision making. In this paper, a novel gear fault diagnosis and damage level identification method based on Hilbert transform (HT) and Euclidean distance technique (EDT) is developed. The energies of six frequency bands are used as the fault feature through the contrast with other two parameters, kurtosis and skewness. Then HT is used to obtain analytic signal. Finally, EDT is utilized to recognize the different fault modes and damage levels. This method is implemented by two stages, i.e., classifying different fault modes and identifying damage levels for every fault mode. The effectiveness of this methodology is demonstrated by compare to fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) using experiment data acquired from a real gearbox. In addition, industrial data is also used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Considering that data batches collected from a repetitive operation will be similar unless in the presence of an abnormality, a condition change is inferred by comparing the monitored data against an available nominal batch. The method proposed considers the comparison of data in the distribution domain, which reveals information of the data amplitude. This is achieved with the use of kernel density estimates and the Kullback-Leibler distance. To decrease sensitivity to disturbances while increasing sensitivity to faults, the use of a weighting vector is suggested which is chosen based on a labeled dataset. The framework is simple to implement and can be used without process interruption, in a batch manner. The approach is demonstrated with successful experimental and simulation applications to wear diagnostics in an industrial robot gearbox and for diagnostics of gear faults in a rotating machine.

J	Pezzani, C; Bossio, G; De Angelo, C				Pezzani, C.; Bossio, G.; De Angelo, C.			Winding distribution effects on induction motor rotor fault diagnosis	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						Broken bars; Induction motor; MCSA; WFA; Winding distribution; Fault diagnosis	INCLUDING STATOR; BROKEN BARS; SIGNATURE; MACHINES; MODEL; COMPUTATION; VALIDATION; HEALTHY; SLOT; LOAD	The sidebands around stator currents harmonics as a potential tool for supporting the diagnosis of rotor faults in induction motors are analyzed in this paper. The presence of broken bars introduces high frequency components in the machine currents spectrum in addition to the characteristic sidebands around the fundamental component. These additional components are due to the interaction between, rotor asymmetry and either the voltage harmonics, or winding distribution, or rotor slots. In particular, the components at frequencies near to fifth and seventh harmonics, produced by the interaction between the rotor faults and the harmonics of the spatial distribution of stator windings, are analyzed in this work. A multiple coupled circuit model of the induction motor is used to evaluate the sensitivity of these components for different stator winding configurations, load level, supply voltage conditions, and different number of broken bars. Simulation results showed that a particular analyzed component near to fifth harmonic depends mainly on fifth harmonic of winding distribution, which remains almost constant for most common distributions. Therefore, it is expected that this component should be found in most motors with broken bars. Finally, experimental laboratory results and two industrial cases that validate the analysis are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, S; Kumar, N				Singh, Sukhjeet; Kumar, Navin			Combined rotor fault diagnosis in rotating machinery using empirical mode decomposition	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bent rotors; Fault diagnosis; Empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT); Unbalance	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; MASS FLEXIBLE ROTOR; RESIDUAL SHAFT BOW; UNBALANCE RESPONSE; TIME-SERIES; HILBERT; IDENTIFICATION; FREQUENCY; SPECTRUM; BEARING	Unbalance, misalignment, partial rub, looseness and bent rotor are one of the most commonly observed faults in rotating machines. These faults cause breakdowns in rotating machinery and create undesired vibrations while operating. In this study, an approach to detect combined fault of unbalance and bent rotors for advance detection of the features of the fault rotors diagnosis is proposed. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used efficiently to decompose the complex vibration signals of rotating machinery into a known number of intrinsic mode functions so that the fault characteristics of the unbalanced and bowed shaft can be examined in the time-frequency Hilbert spectrum. A test bench of Spectra-Quest has been used for performing experiments to illustrate the unbalance and the bent rotor conditions as well as the healthy rotor condition. Analysis of the results shows the usefulness of proposed approach in diagnosing the unbalance and bowed fault of the shaft in rotating machinery.

J	Kim, H; Na, MG; Heo, G				Kim, Hyeonmin; Na, Man Gyun; Heo, Gyunyoung			APPLICATION OF MONITORING, DIAGNOSIS, AND PROGNOSIS IN THERMAL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Thermal Efficiency; In-situ Analysis; Condition-Based Maintenance; Turbine Cycle; Nuclear Power Plant	FEEDWATER FLOW-RATE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GAS-TURBINE; MODEL	As condition-based maintenance (CBM) has risen as a new trend, there has been an active movement to apply information technology for effective implementation of CBM in power plants. This motivation is widespread in operations and maintenance, including monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis, and decision-making on asset management. Thermal efficiency analysis in nuclear power plants (NPPs) is a longstanding concern being updated with new methodologies in an advanced IT environment. It is also a prominent way to differentiate competitiveness in terms of operations and maintenance costs. Although thermal performance tests implemented using industrial codes and standards can provide officially trustworthy results, they are essentially resource-consuming and maybe even a hind-sighted technique rather than a foresighted one, considering their periodicity. Therefore, if more accurate performance monitoring can be achieved using advanced data analysis techniques, we can expect more optimized operations and maintenance. This paper proposes a framework and describes associated methodologies for in-situ thermal performance analysis, which differs from conventional performance monitoring. The methodologies are effective for monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis in pursuit of CBM. Our enabling techniques cover the intelligent removal of random and systematic errors, deviation detection between a best condition and a currently measured condition, degradation diagnosis using a structured knowledge base, and prognosis for decision-making about maintenance tasks. We also discuss how our new methods can be incorporated with existing performance tests. We provide guidance and directions for developers and end-users interested in in-situ thermal perfamiance management, particularly in NPPs with large steam turbines.

J	Coble, J; Hines, JW				Coble, Jamie; Hines, J. Wesley			INCORPORATING PRIOR BELIEF IN THE GENERAL PATH MODEL: A COMPARISON OF INFORMATION SOURCES	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						General Path Model; Bayesian Updating; Type III Prognostics		The general path model (GPM) is one approach for performing degradation-based, or Type III, prognostics. The GPM fits a parametric function to the collected observations of a prognostic parameter and extrapolates the fit to a failure threshold. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of systems when a sufficient number of prognostic parameter observations are available. However, the parametric fit can suffer significantly when few data are available or the data are very noisy. In these instances, it is beneficial to include additional information to influence the fit to conform to a prior belief about the evolution of system degradation. Bayesian statistical approaches have been proposed to include prior information in the form of distributions of expected model parameters. This requires a number of run-to-failure cases with tracked prognostic parameters; these data may not be readily available for many systems. Reliability information and stressor-based (Type I and Type II, respectively) prognostic estimates can provide the necessary prior belief for the GPM. This article presents the Bayesian updating framework to include prior information in the GPM and compares the efficacy of including different information sources on two data sets.

The experiment used polypropylene as the experimental material. The machine processing parameters included nine factors, including temperatures in three extruder barrel sections, temperature of metering pump, die temperature, spinneret temperature, speed of an extruder screw, speed of metering pump and speed of take-up roll. The biaxial laser sensor measured the yarn diameter instantly, and the optimum parameter combination for minimum diameter variation was obtained by Taguchi method and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The degree of influence of various processing parameters on the diameter variation was determined. The optimum parameter combination was used as parameter setting value, and the processing parameters of various factors were changed for experiment, so as to obtain the signals of abnormal condition. Two methods were used for feature extraction. The minimum entropy of wavelet transform signal was used as eigenvector, and two features were selected by analyzing the statistical process control chart, which are skewness and kurtosis. The abnormal processing parameters and normal condition were recognized effectively and accurately by using the three eigenvalues and back-propagation neural network. With enough training samples, the recognition success rate was as high as 100 %. For complete abnormity diagnosis of melt spinning machine, a two-factor classification process was established by using the single-factor classification result and back-propagation neural network. The experimental results proved that the proposed method can recognize various abnormal conditions successfully and effectively.

Moreover, the vibrations from a machine are affected greatly by the conditions of its operation (speed, load and so on). A significant challenge remains with the monitoring of gears under fluctuating operating conditions. An unexpected fault of gear may cause huge economic losses, even personal injury. In this study, a new method based on adaptive Morlet wavelet (AMW) is proposed for the analysis of vibration signals produced from a gear system under test in order to detect early the presence of faults. The mother Morlet wavelet is adapted with the gear vibration signal by setting parameters of the wavelet to balance the time-frequency resolution. The obtained optimal pair of parameters results in the best time-frequency resolution for the given vibration signal; and the fault detection problem is considered just as a simple signature search in the time-scale domain using scalograms. An early indication of the presence of a gear defect is obtained at the 10th day of experimentation using the AMW-based method. Whereas, the gear system has a defect on the 12th day corresponding to the tooth damage which results in a complete change in the location of the AMW coefficients.

The uniqueness of the proposed architecture is the ability of MAM to evolve in the wake of an attack of malicious intent by mutation, thus always monitoring power system buses remotely. The architecture interacts with the mutated agents using a voting methodology, thus alleviating the effect of agent malfunction in the presence of an attack. In addition, this proposed architecture enables inter-agent communication, thus developing a collaborative framework and increasing the degree of fault tolerance. This method is tested on a two-area five-machine eight-bus power network for abnormal condition detection and generator bus isolation, as well as for restoring power to the area that is affected by the bus isolation. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed methodology is not only capable of detecting the power grid attack but also capable of continuously monitoring and isolating the generator bus even in the presence of sustained attack as the agents are regenerated.

Hence, modeling a turn-to-turn short-circuit fault in more than one phase and a phase-to-ground fault is the first novelty of this paper for calculating phase currents under faulty conditions. This strategy uses the extracted features from the corresponding three-phase current pattern in 3-D space. Identification of faulty phases and of the severity of the fault is the outcome of this technique. This technique is also capable of detecting a phase-to-ground fault. This method just requires current sensors that are available in most drive systems to provide good controllability, and details of the machine design are not necessary.

The main bearing acceleration vibration signal from wind turbine is captured under four conditionsgood bearing, outer race fault, inner race fault and roller fault. The proposed method consists of the following steps. First, the main bearing acceleration vibration signal is decomposed into several proper rotation components by using the intrinsic time-scale decomposition method. Second, the frequency spectrum of the first few proper rotation components (containing dominant fault features) is analyzed. The dominant resonant frequency range of each analyzed rotation component is derived, and then, the sum of frequency amplitude in said frequency range can be obtained. This sum is regarded as the fault feature vectors. Finally, the fault feature vectors are input to the least square support vectors machine, and the faults of wind turbine main bearing then can be diagnosed. The experiment results show that the proposed method can diagnose failures of wind turbine bearings quickly and more accurately.

J	Pan, ZH; Wu, JN; Yan, SZ; Gu, YX				Pan, Zehao; Wu, Jianing; Yan, Shaoze; Gu, Yongxia			Feature generation method for fault diagnosis of closed cable loop used in deployable space structures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						Closed cable loop; deployable space structures; feature generation; failure diagnosis	TREE ANALYSIS; RELIABILITY	In order to diagnose the fault of closed cable loop in deployable space structures, a method of feature generation from deployment angle is proposed. Existing reliability analysis of deployable space structure is usually based on estimated probability or expert knowledge, which are inaccurate and will attenuate the credibility of analysis result. In order to ground the knowledge of the reliability of state-of-the-art closed cable loop on engineering practices, we studied an approach that can identify the features of the data transmitted from spacecraft and automatically diagnose the faults in closed cable loop. The primary feature was identified as higher angle discrepancy in synchronized angles when faults in closed cable loop occur. To reduce the probability of erroneous diagnosis, the loss of velocity concordance in synchronized angles is used jointly with the primary feature. The mathematical expressions of the two features are specified as average difference of angular displacement and Gini concordance of angular velocity. The classifier of normal and faulty closed cable loop is generated by support vector machine, whose training data are produced via simulation or experiments. Case study of a three-panel solar array adopts the method to generate features from simulation result, which serves as the training data for support vector machine. The trained classifier is further applied in the diagnosis of angular signals from an experimental setup and the results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we propose a criterion to evaluate features effectiveness by class separability that is defined on cosine similarity in the kernel space of the Gaussian radial basis function. We develop a feature selection algorithm accordingly using the proposed criterion together with sequential backward selection and a feature re-ranking mechanism. We then employ the proposed feature selection algorithm to determine fault-sensitive features and select them for fault level diagnosis of planetary gearboxes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the feature size and improve accuracy of fault level diagnosis simultaneously.

In this paper, a novel DDoS attack, Cloud-Droplet-Freezing (CDF) attack, is described according to the characteristics of cloud computing cluster. Our experiments show that such attack is able to congest internal network communication of cloud server cluster, whilst consume resources of physical server. Base on the analysis of CDF attack, we highlight the method of evaluating potential threats hidden behind the normal VM migration and analyze the flaws of existing intrusion detection systems/prevention system for defensing the CDF attack.

Spectral Analysis Using a Hall Effect Sensor for Diagnosing Broken Bars in Large Induction Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Broken rotor bars; fault diagnosis; Hall effect devices; large induction motors; protection; spectral analysis	FAILURES	This paper presents the use of an invasive method specially applied for broken rotor bars diagnosis in large induction machines, considering the frequency domain analysis of the magnetic flux density variation in a low-cost Hall effect sensor. The proposed method is based on the Fast Fourier transform, or spectral analysis of the resultant magnetic flux density, to contribute to a crack and bar breaks diagnosis on large squirrel cage motors. More particularly, this paper considers the use of a method capable of overcoming some drawbacks from traditional diagnostic techniques, such as motor current signature analysis during operation at very low slip. The results from the computational simulation and some experimental tests are presented and could be considered for rotor failure diagnostics in induction motors.

MicroRNA (miRNA), regulating gene expression by translational repression or degradation of messenger RNA, is believed to be important for cancer diagnosis and prognosis serving as a reliable molecular biomarker. In recent years, there have been many attempts for miRNA detection using electrochemical genesensors. In this work, we first addressed the progress in designing of miRNA detection strategies based on the difference in the structure of RNA and DNA. This work should be valuable for the design of new types of miRNA genesensors.

It is important to assess the performance degradation of bearings for realizing proactive maintenance and near-zero downtime. In this paper, a methodology based on the zero crossing characteristic features and a coupled hidden Markov model is introduced for estimating bearing performance degradation. Zero crossing features are time domain representations of the vibration signature in the spectrum domain. They discover the change of bearing performance. When zero crossing features are extracted, a coupled hidden Markov model is employed to assess the performance degradation quantitatively. Results from a bearing accelerated life experiment validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Identification of patients who are at high risk for recurrence may provide more efficacious screening and detection of tumor recurrence. The aim of this study was to develop recurrence predictive models for HCC patients who received radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment. Methods: From January 2007 to December 2009, 83 newly diagnosed HCC patients receiving RFA as their first treatment were enrolled. Five feature selection methods including genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, random forests (RF) and hybrid methods(GA+RF and SA+RF) were utilized for selecting an important subset of features from a total of 16 clinical features. These feature selection methods were combined with support vector machine (SVM) for developing predictive models with better performance. Five-fold cross-validation was used to train and test SVM models. Results: The developed SVM-based predictive models with hybrid feature selection methods and 5-fold cross-validation had averages of the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and area under the ROC curve as 67%, 86%, 82%, 69%, 90%, and 0.69, respectively. Conclusions: The SVM derived predictive model can provide suggestive high-risk recurrent patients, who should be closely followed up after complete RFA treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Hong, S; Zhou, Z; Zio, E; Wang, WB				Hong, Sheng; Zhou, Zheng; Zio, Enrico; Wang, Wenbin			An adaptive method for health trend prediction of rotating bearings	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Rotating bearing degradation; Adaptive prediction; Empirical mode decomposition; Self-organizing map; Confidence value	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS; RELIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	Rotating bearing degradation is a physical process that typically evolves in stages characterized by different speeds of evolution of the characteristic health indicators. Therefore, it is opportune to apply different predictive models in the different stages, with the aim of balancing accuracy and calculation complexity in light of the varying needs and constraints of the different stages. This paper proposes a condition-based adaptive trend prediction method for rotating bearings. The empirical mode decomposition-self-organizing map (EMD-SOM) method is applied to analyze vibration signals and calculate a confidence value (CV) on the bearing health state. Four different degradation stages, normal, slight degradation, severe degradation and failure, are identified by using the CV value and CV change rate. At each stage, we develop a different prediction strategy tailored to the specific degradation profile. In operation, upon recognition of the stage, the corresponding prognostics models are selected to estimate the health trend. A case study on datasets from 17 test bearings demonstrates and validates the feasibility of the proposed method. The experiment results show that the adaptive prediction method is accurate and reduces computational complexity, which can be important for online applications, especially in case of limited computing resources.

J	Lall, P; Lowe, R				Lall, Pradeep; Lowe, Ryan			Comparison of Prognostic Health Management Algorithms for Assessment of Electronic Interconnect Reliability Under Vibration	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING			English	Article							RESISTANCE SPECTROSCOPY	This paper compares three prognostic algorithms applied to the same data recorded during the failure of a solder joint in ball grid array component attached to a printed circuit board. The objective is to expand on the relative strengths and weaknesses of each proposed algorithm. Emphasis will be placed on highlighting differences in underlying assumptions required for each algorithm, details of remaining useful life calculations, and methods of uncertainty quantification. Metrics tailored specifically for prognostic health monitoring (PHM) are presented to characterize the performance of predictions. The relative merits of PHM algorithms based on a Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, and a particle filter all demonstrated on the same data set will be discussed. The paper concludes by discussing which algorithm performs best given the information available about the system being monitored.

J	Mortada, MA; Yacout, S; Lakis, A				Mortada, Mohamad-Ali; Yacout, Soumaya; Lakis, Aouni			Fault diagnosis in power transformers using multi-class logical analysis of data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Logical analysis of data; Multi-class decision model; Fault diagnosis; Mixed 0-1 integer and linear programming; Condition based maintenance	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; LOCALIZED DEFECTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM; MACHINE; SCHEME; TIME	This paper presents the implementation of a novel multi-class diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of faults based on an approach called logical analysis of data (LAD). LAD is a datamining, artificial intelligence approach that is based on pattern recognition. In the context of condition based maintenance (CBM), historical data containing condition indices and the state of the machine are the inputs to LAD. After training and testing phases, LAD generates patterns that characterize the faulty states according to the type of fault, and differentiate between these states and the normal state. These patterns are found by solving a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem. They are then used to detect and to identify a future unknown state of equipment. The diagnostic technique has already been tested on several known machine learning datasets. The results proved that the performance of this technique is comparable to other conventional approaches, such as neural network and support vector machine, with the added advantage of the clear interpretability of the generated patterns, which are rules characterizing the faults' types. To demonstrate its merit in fault diagnosis, the technique is used in the detection and identification of faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis data. The paper reaches the conclusion that the multi-class LAD based fault detection and identification is a promising diagnostic approach in CBM.

EEMD is applied to preprocess the nonstationary vibration signals and get the feature space. GMM is utilized to approximate the density distribution of the lower-dimensional feature space processed by principal component analysis (PCA). The confidence value (CV) is calculated based on the overlap between the distribution of the baseline feature space and that of the testing feature space to indicate the performance of the bearing. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Wang, XS; Huang, F; Cheng, YH				Wang, Xuesong; Huang, Fei; Cheng, Yuhu			Super-parameter selection for Gaussian-Kernel SVM based on outlier-resisting	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Support vector machine; Super-parameter selection; Outlier-resisting; Classification accuracy; Computational complexity	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM; MODEL	The learning ability and generalizing performance of the support vector machine (SVM) mainly relies on the reasonable selection of super-parameters. When the scale of the training sample set is large and the parameter space is huge, the existing popular super-parameter selection methods are impractical due to high computational complexity. In this paper, a novel super-parameter selection method for SVM with a Gaussian kernel is proposed, which can be divided into the following two stages. The first one is choosing the kernel parameter to ensure a sufficiently large number of potential support vectors retained in the training sample set. The second one is screening out outliers from the training sample set by assigning a special value to the penalty factor, and training out the optimal penalty factor from the remained training sample set without outliers. The whole process of super-parameter selection only needs two train-validate cycles. Therefore, the computational complexity of our method is low. The comparative experimental results concerning 8 benchmark datasets show that our method possesses high classification accuracy and desirable training time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rolling bearings constitute a vital part in many rotational machines and the vibration generated by a faulty bearing easily affects the neighboring components. Continuous monitoring, fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance, is a crucial task to reduce the degree of damage and stopping time for a rotating machine. Analysis of fault-related vibration signal is a usual method for accurate diagnosis. Among the resonant demodulation techniques, a well-known resolution often used for fault diagnosis is envelope analysis. But, usually this method may not be adequate enough to indicate satisfactory results. It may require some auxiliary additional techniques. This study suggests some methods to extract features using envelope analysis accompanied by Hilbert Transform and Fast Fourier Transform. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) based fault estimation algorithm was verified with experimental tests and promising results. Every test was initiated with a reference ANN architecture to avoid inappropriate classification during the evaluation of fitness value. Later, ANN model was modified using a genetic algorithm providing, an optimal skillful fast-reacting network architecture with improved classification results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, many fault detection methods based on spectral characteristic of vibration signals have been published. However, some faults cannot be effectively recognized just with spectral features for condition process monitoring of HGU. Thus, this study presents a novel fault detection model based on kernel independent component analysis and principal component analysis (KICA-PCA) monitoring model for condition process of HGU. Each of the condition processes is equivalent to a multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM). KICA-PCA model of the specific MSPM is trained by normal condition process data at first. Then, confidence limits of two monitoring indices (Hotelling's T-2 statistic and SPE statistic) of the trained KICA-PCA model are used to monitor the same condition process and detect fault online. Moreover, the proposed monitoring model is applied to a real condition process of HGU. Compared to ICA-PCA and PCA monitoring model, the proposed model has superior performance in fault detection.

The integrated use of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principal component analysis (PCA) and Savitzky-Golay (S-G) adaptive filtering are applied to extract noise from underlying measurements. Through analysis of the resulting noise, along with the use of a developed power index, it is shown that transient measurements associated with system load or demand changes, for instance, can be effectively discriminated from those that are characteristic of emerging faults - the former being a primary contributor to generating 'false alerts' using more traditional techniques that are only robust when used with steady-state measurements. Comparative studies show the benefits of the hybrid technique compared to the more usual use of EMD and PCA alone. Three operational conditions are identifiable from the resulting noise analysis viz. normal behaviour, transient operation, and characteristics of emerging machine faults. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using two experimental case studies (bearing wear and burner faults) on sub-15 MW IGTs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transducer invariant multi-class fault classification in a rotor-bearing system using support vector machines	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bearing; Unbalance; Fault classification; Speed; Vibration	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; FEATURE-SELECTION; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; ROLLER BEARING; DIAGNOSIS; RECOGNITION; ENSEMBLE; SCHEME; MODEL	Faults in a rotor-bearing system due to bearings and unbalance have been classified using support vector machines (SVMs). Vibration signals on a rotor-bearing system were measured simultaneously at five different rotating speeds using seven transducers. The most sensitive feature of the vibration signals has been determined using compensation distance evaluation technique. Multi-class SVMs classification algorithm was then implemented for classification of the faults by considering SVMs created by the possible combinations of the most two sensitive features for each type of fault. By using optimal SVM parameters, the effective location of transducer among seven transducers for best classification of the faults has been investigated and found that any transducer provides a classification of 75% or better and this classification rate increases when more transducers are considered. This paper provides a robust SVM based technique using only time domain data without any additional preprocessing for classifying bearing and unbalance faults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The performance analysis of Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Backpropagation Network classifiers has been carried out using the database of dissolved gases collected from Punjab State Electricity Board, Patiala, India. Features from the preprocessed data have been extracted using dimensionality reduction technique, i.e., principal component analysis. The selected features were used as inputs to the Backpropagation Network and PNN classifiers. A comparative study of the two intelligent classifiers has been carried out, which reveals that PNN classifier outperforms the Backpropagation Network classifier.

J	Chou, JS; Pham, AD				Chou, Jui-Sheng; Anh-Duc Pham			Hybrid computational model for predicting bridge scour depth near piers and abutments	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Bridge foundation; Scour depth; Support vector regression; Genetic algorithm; Data mining; Optimization; Artificial intelligence	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; REGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY	Efficient bridge design and maintenance requires a clear understanding of channel bottom scouring near piers and abutment foundations. Bridge scour, a dynamic phenomenon that varies according to numerous factors (e.g., water depth, flow angle and strength, pier and abutment shape and width, material properties of the sediment), is a major cause of bridge failure and is critical to the total construction and maintenance costs of bridge building. Accurately estimating the equilibrium depths of local scouring near piers and abutments is vital for bridge design and management. Therefore, an efficient technique that can be used to enhance the estimation capability, safety, and cost reduction when designing and managing bridge projects is required. This study investigated the potential use of genetic algorithm (GA)-based support vector regression (SVR) model to predict bridge scour depth near piers and abutments. An SVR model developed by using MATLAB (R) was optimized using a GA, maximizing generalization performance. Data collected from the literature were used to evaluate the bridge scour depth prediction accuracy of the hybrid model. To demonstrate the capability of the computational model, the GA-SVR modeling results were compared with those obtained using numeric predictive models (i.e., classification and regression tree, chi-squared automatic interaction detector, multiple regression, artificial neural network, and ensemble models) and empirical methods. The proposed hybrid model achieved error rates that were 81.3% to 96.4% more accurate than those obtained using other methods. The GA-SVR model effectively outperformed existing methods and can be used by civil engineers to efficiently design safer and more cost-effective bridge substructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Vascular homeostasis and the concept of mechanobiological stability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Growth; Remodeling; Lyapunov; Aneurysm; Mechanobiology; Arteries	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; ARTERIES; MODEL	Vascular mechanics has been studied in depth since the early 1970s mainly following classical concepts from continuum mechanics. Yet, an important distinction of blood vessels, in contrast to typical engineering materials, is the continuous degradation and deposition of material in these living tissues. In this paper we examine mechanical consequences of such mass turnover. Motivated by Lyapunov's stability theory, we introduce the new concepts of mechanobiological equilibrium and stability and demonstrate that blood vessels can maintain their structure and function under physiological conditions only if new material is deposited at a certain prestress and the vessels are both mechanically and mechanobiologically stable. Moreover, we introduce the concept of mechanobiological adaptivity as a third corner stone to understand vascular behavior on a continuum level. We demonstrate that adaptivity represents a key difference between the stability of mechanobiological and typical human-made systems. Based on these ideas, We suggest a change of paradigm that can be illustrated by considering a common arterial pathology. We suggest that aneurysms can be interpreted as mechanobiological instabilities and that predictions of their rupture risk should not only consider the maximal diameter or wall stress, but also the mechanobiological stability. A mathematical analysis of the impact of the different model parameters on the so-called mechanobiological stability margin, a single scalar used to characterize mechanobiological stability, reveals that this stability increases with the characteristic time constant of mass turnover, material stiffness, and capacity for stress-dependent changes in mass production. As each of these parameters may be modified by appropriate drugs, the theory developed in this paper may guide both prognosis and the development of new therapies for arterial pathologies such as aneurysms.

Faults diagnosis with the earlier CS relied solely on the amplitudes of several harmonics of the machine speed, owing to the loss of phase information leading to its computation. The proposed improved CS applies the concept of cross power spectrum density for computing a poly-Coherent Composite Spectrum (pCCS) of a machine, which retains amplitude and phase information at all measurement locations. The present study compares the proposed pCCS method with the earlier CS method for faults diagnosis in rotating machines, using experimental data from a rotating rig. Results and observations show that the proposed pCCS offered a much better representation of the machines dynamics when compared to the earlier CS method and hence better fault diagnosis.

J	Amarnath, M; Krishna, IRP				Amarnath, M.; Krishna, I. R. Praveen			Local fault detection in helical gears via vibration and acoustic signals using EMD based statistical parameter analysis	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Vibrations; Acoustics; Intrinsic mode function; Kurtosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; SPECTRUM; WAVELET	Gear is a vital transmission element, finding numerous applications in small, medium and large machinery. Excessive loads, speeds and improper operating conditions may cause defects on their bearing surfaces, thereby triggering abnormal vibrations in whole machine structures. This paper describes the implementation of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method for monitoring simulated faults using vibration and acoustic signals in a two stage helical gearbox. By using EMD method, a complicated signal can be decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal. Vibration and acoustic signals are decomposed to extract higher order statistical parameters. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of EMD based statistical parameters to diagnose severity of local faults on helical gear tooth. Kurtosis values from EMD and that obtained from vibration and acoustic signals are compared to demonstrate the superiority of EMD based technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xi, ZM; Jing, R; Wang, PF; Hu, C				Xi, Zhimin; Jing, Rong; Wang, Pingfeng; Hu, Chao			A copula-based sampling method for data-driven prognostics	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Prognostics and health management (PHM); Data-driven prognostics; Remaining useful life; COPULA; Reliability	MAINTENANCE OPTIMIZATION; HEALTH MANAGEMENT; MODELS; ELECTRONICS; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; ENSEMBLE; SYSTEMS; TESTS	This paper develops a Copula-based sampling method for data-driven prognostics. The method essentially consists of an offline training process and an online prediction process: (i) the offline training process builds a statistical relationship between the failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels on the basis of off-line training data sets; and (ii) the online prediction process identifies probable failure times for online testing units based on the statistical model constructed in the offline process and the online testing data. Our contributions in this paper are three-fold, namely the definition of a generic health index system to quantify the health degradation of an engineering system, the construction of a Copula-based statistical model to learn the statistical relationship between the failure time and the time realizations at specified degradation levels, and the development of a simulation-based approach for the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL). Two engineering case studies, namely the electric cooling fan health prognostics and the 2008 IEEE PHM challenge problem, are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
