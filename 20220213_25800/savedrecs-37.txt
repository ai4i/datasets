System for core fault detection of AC electric machines, based on magnetic field scanning	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		diagnostic of electric machines; core lamination inspection; magnetic field measurement; eddy currents; induction machines; turbogenerators		A new method of detecting insulation faults in cores of AC machines is outlined. The method involves the measurements of the magnetic field near the surface of the core, using a number of parallel electronic field meters. It is demonstrated that the new method does not share the disadvantages of other methods as it does not require a high current source and long operation time compared with the thermal method. Besides, it offers a better resolution than the ELCID method. A dedicated computer program is used to measure and visualize results, which can be displayed in the form similar to those obtained from a thermal camera. The method is applicable both to synchronous generators and induction machines.

A Fault-Tolerant Power Conversion Topology for PMSG based Wind Power Systems	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		Wind power generation; vector control; fault tolerance; cooperative systems; permanent magnet machines	ENERGY SYSTEM; DRIVE; COMPENSATION; RELIABILITY; DIAGNOSIS; FAILURE; SCHEME	This work aims to investigate a novel fault tolerant topology for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based Wind Power Systems (WPS), where the static power converter consists of two three-phase inverters connected in back to back configuration. The first inverter is used to control the PMSG while the other one is used to deliver power to the grid through an output filter and a line frequency transformer. Essentially, the fault tolerance is achieved by performing a cooperative control strategy when a faulty condition occurs in one of the two drives. Whenever a fault occurs in one of these two parts, the faulty elements are isolated, the faulty part is controlled in open phase mode and the resulting current flowing out the neutral point is redirected to the healthy part which is so exploited as a feedback current path. The proposed Fault Tolerant WPS (FTWPS) requires very limited modifications to the vector control performed in the PMSG as well as to the active and reactive power control implemented in the grid side, by keeping similar performance with respect to the healthy system. The theoretical analysis is supported by experimental tests, validating the effectiveness of the system configuration.

The aim of this study was to predict the fatigue strength of power modules under acceleration loading. We analyzed this fatigue strength using finite element analysis and predetermined fatigue lifetime equations. The failure materials of the power modules that we took into consideration are the main terminals and bonding wires. The results show that the fatigue strength of power modules is 286 G at 33,000 cycles and a factor limiting fatigue strength is the fatigue of the main terminals. We also carried out an experimental fatigue test to confirm that power modules withstand 286-G loading with 33,000 cycles and the power modules show no deterioration after 33,000 cycles.

The sensor performance is assessed in a series of experiments on a laboratory test rig comprising a 30kW induction machine operating in healthy conditions and with electrical or mechanical fault. Vibration measurements are processed and analyzed in the frequency domain for fault feature extraction. The fibre optic sensor effectiveness in measurement of wide band fault signatures in the vibration signal is compared with that of a commercial piezoelectric based solution. The potential and limitations of the investigated FBG accelerometer design are evaluated for use in condition monitoring applications.	[Vilchis-Rodriguez, D. S.; Djurovic, S.; Kung, P.; Comanici, M.

Broken Rotor Bar Detection in VSD-fed Induction Motors at Startup by High-Resolution Spectral Analysis	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Induction motors; Multiple signal classification; Spectral analysis; Variable speed drives	FAULT; DIAGNOSIS	The fault detection in an induction motor (IM) operated by a variable speed drive (VSD) is an actual industrial need as most of the line-fed machines are replaced by a VSD, due to their improved speed regulation and fast dynamic response. However, undesired harmonics are always present when the IM is fed through a VSD. Under this operating condition, most developed techniques are unable to detect faults in the IM. This paper presents a technique based on the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method, and it is applied to a VSD-fed IM during the startup transient; in order to verify the capability of the method to identify one broken rotor bar. From the experimental results, the proposed method is proven to be sensitive enough to detect one broken rotor bar, enabling a reliable diagnosis under different fundamental supply frequencies and load conditions.

Broken rotor bars, mixed eccentricity and interturn short circuit faults are considered in the paper. A combined time-frequency distribution and particle filtering post processing approach is used in the work for PSH tracking even for the case of severe pulsating load operation. The proposed fault indicator provides values that are comparable with the traditional one for stationary operation. The results show that the energy in the PSH reflects the overall state of the machine under this kind of operation. Furthermore, its changing pattern is studied as a mean to discriminate between different faults.

These two faults deform the magnetic field in motors, which generates additional magnetic forces in the air gap. As the result, the motor structure vibrates more, compared to the normal operation. For the purpose of fault detection, as the main subject of this paper, a 3-D model was developed in COMSOL Multiphysics. Thereafter, the radial and tangential forces (the main causes of vibration in electrical machines) were introduced to the model as boundary loads on the stator teeth. Frequency response analysis was then performed to collect acceleration data from the frame surface for each operating conditions. Finally, the simulation results illustrated that vibration is a beneficial signature for fault detection in electrical machines.	[Far, M.

Insulation monitoring of three phase inverter-fed ac machines based on two current sensors only	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		AC motor drives; Insulation monitoring; Fault detection; Induction machines; Insulation degradation; Switching transients	SYSTEMS	The demand of monitoring systems to prevent a breakdown of electrical machines is continuously increasing. Regarding economic issues, usage of system resources and additional components to establish monitoring is restricted. With the method proposed, the evaluation of the stator insulation condition of all three phases is possible using only the two current sensors already available in modern drive systems. The analyses of the transient part of the current response to voltage step excitation give evidence of a possible change in the insulation system. The degradation of the insulation health state is linked with a change in its capacitance, which in turn influences the electrical high frequency properties of the machine and as a consequence the transient part of the current signal resulting from a voltage step. To enable the monitoring of the phase with the missing sensor, a simple summation of all measured currents does not deliver enough accuracy for insulation monitoring. The non-measured phase however, can still be monitored by a special excitation sequence and signal processing without significant deterioration of sensitivity compared to the results if a sensor is available. Further, the influence of temperature and moisture on the proposed method is analyzed.	[Zoeller, C.; Wolbank, Th.

New On-line Excitation-System Ground-Fault Location Method Tested in a 106 MVA Synchronous Generator	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		Fault Location; Power system protection; Hydroelectric power generation; Generators; Rotors	MOTOR-DRIVES; DIAGNOSIS	In this paper, a novel excitation-system ground-fault location method is described and tested in a 106 MVA synchronous machine. In this unit, numerous rotor ground-fault trips took place always about an hour after the synchronization to the network. However, when the field winding insulation was checked after the trips, there was no failure. The data indicated that the faults in the rotor were caused by centrifugal forces and temperature. Unexpectedly, by applying this new method, the failure was located in a cable between the excitation transformer and the automatic voltage regulator. In addition, several intentional ground faults were performed along the field winding with different fault resistance values, in order to test the accuracy of this method to locate defects in rotor windings of large generators. Therefore, this new on-line rotor ground-fault detection algorithm is tested in high-power synchronous generators with satisfactory results.	[Blanquez, F. R.; Platero, C.

Oscillating Circuit Design for Inter-Turn Fault Diagnostic in Low-Voltage Induction Motor	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, VDI, Power Engn Soc		Induction machine; motor diagnostics; stator winding; oscillating wave; turn insulation failure	MACHINES	Turn fault caused by winding insulation deterioration is the most frequently fault occurring in induction motor. In several cases, induction motor that gets inter-turn fault with a small value has same current waveform as a nomal condition. Therefore, the inter-turn fault in induction motor can't be only identified by monitoring the motor current. In this paper, a new method to overcome that issue is proposed. The idea utilizes an oscillating wave to detect small number of inter-turn fault. The oscillating wave is produced using the Cockcroft-Walton Multiplier circuit and some additonal circuits that is more economical. This paper presents experimental test on several inter-turn fault conditions to confirm the effectiveness of this method. Moreover, Error Area Ratio (EAR) is also used to further emphasize the advantage of the method. The results show that the proposed method is more sensitive and has better precision to identify small number of inter-turn fault.	[Negara, I. M. Y.; Sakti, P.; Fahmi, D.; Asfani, D.

Furthermore, the flexible power flow control among the four dc-sources can be usefully exploited in electric vehicles fed by separate battery packs. In this paper, the behavior of a quadruple three-phase induction motor drive under an unbalance of the stator phases due to high resistance connections is analyzed. In particular, a control scheme that can detect the stator resistance dissymmetry and ensure an undisturbed behavior of the motor drive, is presented. The effectiveness of the presented control scheme is verified by means of numerical simulations.

The frequency response of the stray electromagnetic field from several combination of machines is measured through low frequency antennas and signal analyzer. The proper algorithms are developed for the identification of the components, as well as the detection of some faults and failures. These algorithms are designed based on the active performance of the components including induction, DC and synchronous machines and converter. More than 150 tests of various combinations of the components and their conditions are implemented to fulfill this identification. The results show that the propose technique enables reliable monitoring of the components. Since there is no need to dismantle the components to detect the faults in this method, it can be considered nondestructive for the extreme environments. This method can be used for the applications in which it's impossible to access the parameters of the components for online monitoring.	[Barzegaran, M. R.; Mohammed, O.

The model of deep Boltzmann machine has been successfully applied to unsupervised learning for single modality (e.g., text, images, video or audio). In this work, we focus on the model for multiple input modalities and apply it to fault diagnosis. At present, most work on fault diagnosis uses structured data and accuracy needs improving. For images, most work stays on the stage of manual analyses and has low level of intelligence. Moreover, the sources of data are multiple and its architecture should be scalable since data comes from many platforms and the type of platforms will keep increasing. In this case, existing approaches cannot solve the above problems. Hence comprehensive analysis of images and structured data using deep learning is proposed. Its goal is to extract a unified representation for both images and structured data with massive attributes. In the phase of feature learning, deep restricted Boltzmann machine auto-encoder is used. Through unsupervised learning, more abstract features are extracted and some useless information is removed, which can achieve layered and precise representation. In the phase of supervised training, linear classifier is employed. Extensive experiments on power transformers and circuit breakers show that the proposed model with two modalities based on deep learning theory has higher accuracy than the previous approaches with supervised learning or just one modality.

The existence of even tiny defects on the mating surfaces of the bearing components can lead to failure through passage of time. Their failure leads to economical and personal losses. The vibration monitoring technique is mostly used in the industries for health monitoring of bearings. Significant studies are available in open literature for vibration analysis of healthy and defective rolling elements bearings. Various researchers have studied the vibrations generated by bearings through theoretical model and experimentations. The researchers have developed the dynamic model of shaft bearing systems for the theoretical studies. This paper reviews different dynamic models for rolling bearing in presence and absence of local and distributed defects. Moreover, the techniques used for the improvement of fault detection have also been summarized. The signal processing techniques like wavelet transform, high frequency resonance technique (HFRT), envelope analysis and cyclic autocorrelation have improved the fault detection.

Effective signal processing techniques are in urgent demands to extract the fault features contained in the collected vibration signals. In this paper, a new sparsity-assisted feature extraction method is proposed for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. It is implemented using the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) with overlapping group shrinkage (OGS). The TQWT, for which the Q-factor is easily adjustable, is adopted as an effective tool to sparsely decompose vibration signals. Meanwhile, the OGS, which based on the minimization of a convex cost function incorporating a mixed norm, is employed to eliminate the irrelevant noise. The purpose of the proposed method is to extract useful features from observed signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by extracting fault features from an engineering application case.

The present experiment proposed in this paper teaches how a bearings fault in the system is monitored based on the vibration analysis. Bearing failures have incredible effect on industry and economy. Bearing disappointment is frequently ascribed to be one of the significant reasons for breakdown in mechanical pivoting machines work at low and high velocity. Bearing vibration can be useful in the detection of various faults and also helps in processing of effects of the defects present in the different components of the bearing. The vibrations created by a solitary point abandon on different parts of the bearing under steady spiral burden are anticipated by utilizing a hypothetical model. The model incorporates variety in the reaction because of the impact of bearing measurements, turning recurrence dispersion of burden.	[Behera, Dipti Prakash; Naikan, Vallayil N.

C	Crabb, C			IEEE	Crabb, Charles			The Use of Data Signatures in Condition Based Maintenance Plus	2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2014	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper examines a CBM+ capability for medium power diesel generators by showing the results of an analysis of data that was collected from sensors that were placed on various components on a 30 kW generator; the paper focuses on fuel flow sensors that are sampled at a high rate. Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) contributes to optimal supply chain management of parts on a system platform by providing a prognosis of their remaining useful life (RUL). A data stream from sensors that are placed on a system to measure failure characteristics of its critical components is analyzed to develop a prognosis of system health. To that end, this paper demonstrates that detailed measurement at high sampling rates of physical effects of a component produces a predictive and reductive data signature of the performance of the component. Signatures evolve in time and a dynamical metric is proposed that evolves to produce a prognostic assessment of the condition of a component. Thus, prognostic assessments are done not only from time-series data but also the time-varying spectral analysis of the data. This means that a prognostic result is reached more quickly by using dynamic data signatures than it is from a time-series trend analysis.

Model-based prognostics emphasizes the importance of a model that describes the nominal and faulty behavior of a system, and how faulty behavior progresses in time, causing the end of useful life of the system. We describe the construction of a testbed consisting of a pneumatic valve that allows the injection of faulty behavior and controllable fault progression. The valve opens discretely, and is controlled through a solenoid valve. Controllable leaks of pneumatic gas in the testbed are introduced through proportional valves, allowing the testing and validation of prognostics algorithms for pneumatic valves. A new valve prognostics approach is developed that estimates fault progression and predicts remaining life based only on valve timing measurements. Simulation experiments demonstrate and validate the approach.

C	Fink, W; Popov, A; Hess, A			IEEE	Fink, Wolfgang; Popov, Alexandre; Hess, Andrew			Planning a Pilot Project on the ISS for Crew Health Management & Maintenance Beyond LEO	2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2014	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Long duration missions present numerous risks to crew health and performance. The international space community is actively studying these effects and possible mitigation techniques, but much work remains to be done. As such the space community and space agencies are increasingly cooperating to enable timely answers in support of exploration mission needs. Crew health and performance are critical to successful human exploration. Long-duration missions bring numerous risks that must be understood and mitigated in order to keep astronauts healthy, rather than treat a diagnosed health disorder. Crewed missions venturing beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) will require technology solutions for crew health care to address physiological, psychological, performance, and other needs in-situ, e.g., self-sufficiency, as an emergency or quick-return option will not be feasible. Therefore, onboard capabilities that would allow for early self-diagnosis of impending health issues, and autonomous identification of proper responses on negative trends to keep astronauts healthy are critical. With the absence of real-time medical ground support, personal health-tracking tools for health monitoring, health risk assessment and management are required for any crew member to predict her/his future health condition if no preventive measures are taken. This paper suggests a concept employing technologies from Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), namely real-time health monitoring and condition-based health maintenance in terms of predictive diagnostics. The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent platform and currently the only "test bed" on which to prepare for future manned exploration missions. Examples of present, i.e., currently deployed, and planned/envisioned future health management & maintenance technologies on the ISS are presented. However, the exploration beyond low-Earth orbit will require a new generation of capabilities and systems, which build on existing capabilities and incorporate technologies yet to be developed.

A model-based prognosis approach is employed to assess the remaining useful life (RUL) of the ball-grid-array (BGA) solder joint interconnections. The approach deals with the interaction (coupling) of the "fast" PCB vibration model and the "slow" low cycle fatigue damage model of BGA solder joint interconnections. The final goal is to predict the dynamic response of the board and the RUL of the solder joint material of the BGA interconnections. As the complete knowledge of these interconnected models are typically not available, a two-stage filtering process is used to estimate the fast and slow dynamics involved. The RUL of the BGA solder joint interconnections is then estimated based on the identified models.

Fusing an Ensemble of Diverse Prognostic Life Predictions	2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2014	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Prognosis refers to the production of bounded estimates for the remaining useful life (RUL) of a component or system. Robust prognosis within well defined uncertainty bounds promises the ability to lower system sustainment costs and improve maintenance decision making. In ideal scenarios, the degradation of many assets is predictable from measurements taken during operation. These measurements, accompanied by appropriate knowledge, have been successfully used with various prognostic trending and prediction techniques to estimate the remaining useful life. However, there are scenarios where changes in operating environment or emerging fault modes can alter the degradation path an asset takes and thus invalidate previous predictions. One approach to overcoming these challenges is to develop prognostic techniques sensitive to change, however this sensitivity must be traded for robustness to imperfect degradation measurements. As an alternative, we develop multiple predictors, each with differing properties so that multiple estimates can be made based on different possible scenarios. A data fusion architecture is presented that combines multiple prognostic techniques weighted by their individual prediction uncertainty for the remaining useful life of an asset. The architecture is based on the concept of an ensemble Kalman Filter with an adaptive error co-variance parameter. The parameter is updated in real-time with the prediction variances produced by the set of prognostic predictions. Using real civil aerospace data, the technique is demonstrated to provide an amalgamated estimate of RUL to a fleet management operator. The developed architecture provides improved decision support to fleet maintainers in comparison to existing single prognostic technique methods.

Aerospace Optoelectronics Reliability: Application of Multi-Parametric BAZ Model	2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2014	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				The attributes and challenges of the PDfR concept and the role of its major constituents - failure oriented accelerated testing (FOAT) and physically meaningful predictive modeling (PM) - are addressed, advanced and discussed in detail, with an emphasis on the application of the recently suggested powerful and flexible Boltzmann-Arrhenius-Zhurkov (BAZ) model, and particularly on its multi-parametric version. The BAZ model can be effectively used to analyze and design an opto-electronic (OE) device or a system with the predicted, quantified, assured, and, if appropriate and cost-effective, even maintained probability of failure (PoF) in the field. This could be done, e.g., by employing prognostics-and-health monitoring (PHM) methods and techniques. It is shown that an approach that could be used to assess the accuracy of and update, using the performance-in-the field data, the information of the BAZ model could be based on the recognition that the probability of nonfailure itself could be viewed and treated as a random variable. With four characteristics of such a random variable, namely, minimum probability P-min = 0, maximum probability P-max = I, mean value of the probability < p > and variance Dp, the principle of approach) suggests that the beta-distribution should be taken as an appropriate probability distribution for the probability of non-failure of the product. Thus, the statistical validation and significance of the suggested multi-parametric BAZ model can be assessed on the basis of the well-known beta-distribution. The probability density function of the beta-distributed probability of nonfailure is skewed in the direction of high probabilities that makes physical sense for reliable OE products. The numerical example is carried out for an OE system subjected to the combined action of the ionizing radiation and elevated voltage, and the measured leakage current is viewed and used as a suitable characteristic of the degree of the OE system degradation. In addition, it is shown, also by numerical examples in the Appendix, how the beta-distribution can be used to update the operational reliability, i.e., to establish the actual probability of nonfailure of the product from the detected (observed) operational failures, if any. It is concluded that the next generation of the qualification testing (QT) specifications and practices for aerospace OE could be viewed and conducted as a "quasi- FOAT," a sort-of the "initial stage of FOAT" that adequately replicates the initial non-destructive, yet fullscale, stage of the comprehensive previously conducted FOAT.

Current/Pressure Transducer Application of Model-Based Prognostics using Steady State Conditions	2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2014	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Prognostics is the process of predicting a system's future states, health degradation/wear, and remaining useful life (RUL). This information plays an important role in preventing failure, reducing downtime, scheduling maintenance, and improving system utility. Prognostics relies heavily on wear estimation. In some components, the sensors used to estimate wear may not be fast enough to capture brief transient states that are indicative of wear. For this reason it is beneficial to be capable of detecting and estimating the extent of component wear using steady-state measurements. This paper details a method for estimating component wear using steady-state measurements, describes how this is used to predict future states, and presents a case study of a current/pressure (lIP) Transducer. lIP Transducer nominal and off-nominal behaviors are characterized using a physics-based model, and validated against expected and observed component behavior. This model is used to map observed steady-state responses to corresponding fault parameter values in the form of a lookup table. This method was chosen because of its fast, efficient nature, and its ability to be applied to both linear and non-linear systems. Using measurements of the steady state output, and the lookup table, wear is estimated. A regression is used to estimate the wear propagation parameter and characterize the damage progression function, which are used to predict future states and the remaining useful life of the system.

Previous approaches have investigated augmenting applications with additional logic to detect and correct errors efficiently. In this paper, we investigate the impact of different algorithmic designs on error resilience and propose an approach for algorithm selection for a class of equations, i.e. partial differential equations (PDEs), that are at the core of many scientific computing applications, which drive HPC systems. Many different schemes have been devised for the approximation of PDE systems, each with different accuracy, stability, and performance properties. In this paper, there are two primary questions that we address: (1) Does numerical stability translate to error resilience? and (2) How do we design schemes to improve error resilience? If an algorithm's error resilience is correlated with its numerical stability properties, this may allow us to design more resilient applications by leveraging well-established information on numerical stability. Even with a clear translation of numerical stability to error resilience properties, the question of designing these algorithms still remains however, due to the variety of implementations, schemes, and largely input specific nature of the design. In this paper, we propose one approach for automated design using machine-learning. We observe that intelligent selection of the algorithm or a given problem, improves robustness by 20%-50%, on average, over the traditional selection of algorithms, without the addition of any other detection/correction logic.

These motors are exposed to a variety of undesirable conditions and situations such as maloperations due to which it may to go into a failure period. The failure if not detected at its early stages, can result in a total loss of the machine itself, in addition to a likely costly downtime of the whole plant sometimes may even result in the loss of lives. In this paper, a method based on PVA for detection of induction motor faults is presented. Using suggested method it is also possible to discriminate the type of fault by pattern recognition. This paper also focuses on the detection of the mixed faults in squirrel induction motors. In order to evaluate the ability of the method several simulation results are performed. The simulated results suggest that this method is effective and accurate and can be widely used in the induction motor fault diagnosis.

Hence, demodulation of the stator currents is of high interest for induction machines faults detection and diagnosis. The demodulation techniques can be classified into mono-dimensional and multi-dimensional approaches. The mono-dimensional techniques include the synchronous demodulator, the Hilbert transform, the Teager energy operator and other approaches. The multi-dimensional approaches include the Concordia transform and the Principal Component Analysis. Once the demodulation has been performed, demodulated signals are further processed in order to measure failure severity.

C	Harmouche, J; Delpha, C; Diallo, D			IEEE	Harmouche, Jinane; Delpha, Claude; Diallo, Demba			Linear Discriminant Analysis for the Discrimination of Faults in Bearing Balls by using Spectral Features	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREEN ENERGY	International Conference on Green Energy		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Green Energy (ICGE)	MAR 25-27, 2014	Sfax, TUNISIA				ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; VIBRATION	Informative features having important discriminatory power, also called high-level features, for classification of bearings faults can be automatically extracted from the spectrum of the vibration signal envelope without the a prior knowledge of the characteristic bearing frequencies. It was shown in a previous work that the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied on a specific spectral matrix based on these spectral features, allows discriminating accurately between different faults conditions of bearings. Healthy and faulty bearings with faults on the outer-race, the inner-race and the balls are separated into distinct classes irrespective of the system operating point. The classification does not need any complex classifier like neural networks or support vector machines. There are still some difficulties, however, to discriminate between different levels of severity related to the faults in the bearing balls. The present work uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to improve the classification of faults on balls according to their severity level, while only relying on the information carried out by the already used spectral features. Experimental results show that the LDA, besides its simplicity, extracts from the spectral features new variables having more discriminatory power than the principal components. The accuracy of the discrimination into the PCA and LDA spaces is evaluated using Bhattacharyya distance, a well-known measure of class separability. The linear discriminant axes allow for a good discrimination between different sizes of faults in bearing balls. The obtained results validate the contribution of the LDA space to the diagnosis of faults in bearings elements based on the proposed spectral features.

This truth can occur even with new loads because of inherent manufacturing imperfections. In the majority of circumstances, the load torque varies according to the machine rotor position and these variations, which are not related to the motor health condition, involve an amplitude modulation of the machine stator current at rotational frequency. Thus, harmonics caused by an eventual mechanical unbalance can be overlapped and the user can not distinguish a normal operating condition from a failure mode. Since an induction machine becomes sufficiently loaded, classical diagnosis technique based on the spectral analysis of the stator phase current becomes insufficient to monitor such fault incidence; in this paper we suggest an alternative diagnosis practice based on the analysis of the complex cepstrum. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Some gear failure may lead to fatal damage of the entire system, or even huge losses in industrial production. Early detection of gear damage is crucial to prevent the machine system from malfunction. This paper provides an intelligent diagnosis method for gear damage based on techniques of empirical mode decomposition and support vector machines. By the data processing of empirical mode decomposition, the original signal are decomposed into a finite set of intrinsic mode functions with frequency bands ranging from high to low. The characteristic energy ratios of intrinsic mode functions are acquired as representative parameters of the signal Furthermore, statistical parameters of standard deviation, root mean square value, kurtosis and skewness are extracted from the original signal Characteristic energy ratios and statistical parameters are combined as failure feature vectors to be input to the support vector machines classifiers for gear damage diagnosis. The validity of the presented method is confirmed by the application of monitoring gear conditions during the cyclic fatigue test. The vibration accelerations of gear box are acquired to illustrate the progression of pitting damage. Most of the gear conditions are identified, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Such smart systems consist of standard IC packaging, sensors and actuators. It is required that such systems will survive about 15 years of usage. To assure correct functionality prognostic and health monitoring (PHM) methods can be used. The potential benefits from implementation of these methods include among others reduction of maintenance costs and early warning of possible failure. For automotive industry, for which typical load history is not sufficiently known, this seems to be suitable approach. In today's reliability models some assumptions about the typical load history have to be made, which leads to inaccurate estimations on the remaining useful life. Though, in PHM approach one wants to make a prognosis of a failure so that maintenance can be done at the appropriate time. In this paper, the acquisition unit for in-situ measurements of internal stresses in a novel smart system module is developed. It allows recording the stresses from multiple piezoresistive sensors, at different locations on a surface of a chip, at the same time. As the measurements, that are planned, will be conducted when the smart system is assembled in the engine compartement, it is required that the acquisition unit is portable and immune to harsh conditions. The results of the measurements will be used to monitor the evolution of stress magnitudes in real work conditions.

The power line acts as a good conducting environment for signals to travel through the power network. In effect, this influences other motors with noisy signals that may indicate a fault condition. Further complexity arises when signals are generated by motors with different power ratings, a different slip speed and more than one source of fault signals. This sort of complexity and mixing among signals from multiple sources makes them difficult to measure and precisely correlate to a given machine or fault. In this research, a power network model for induction motors is presented. This model accommodates the signal attenuation factor when it is disseminated along the bus. It also allows for system configuration of motor characteristics and fault injection. It is expected that this simulation model will facilitate the environment for testing sensor networks and data fusion approaches that facilitates better intelligence for fault identification and localization.

There are several methods to detect electrical and mechanical faults in an asynchronous motor; fast Fourier transform, short-time Fourier transform, and wavelet transform are the most popular ones. A major deficiency that most of these solutions face is not being able to detect low energy faults, such as mechanical bearing faults. The new solution proposed in this paper focuses on detection and prediction of low energy faults applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT); the output signal is passed through high pass and low pass filters and coefficients are derived consequently. The method offered by the authors of this paper includes deriving frequency spectrum of each level of discretization. Especially in high decomposition levels, inner race bearing faults can be detected earlier by monitoring frequency spectrum of high levels in DWT.

The efficiency and reliability of the technique being utilized depend profoundly on measurement accuracy and analysis. Frequency analysis is commonly used in the interpretation of measurements for condition monitoring purposes. This paper presents a study of techniques in frequency analysis in condition monitoring of electrical rotating machines. Different performance characteristics of various spectral estimation techniques are compared for application in incipient fault diagnosis. The study includes an evaluation of a Bayesian spectral estimation method together with more conventional practices such as the standard periodogram, Welch and Music methods. The investigation uses an example of shaft voltage based condition monitoring in machines for a specific case of eccentricity. Results of the study indicate that the Bayesian method, although unconventional in fault diagnostics, is exceptionally robust and exhibits qualities well-suited to the application.

Solutions require the application with new and innovative technologies to efficiently achieve the desirable functional capabilities. The benefits of Virtual Engineering environments are becoming noticeable at product and process development level but its visualisation has not been applied much at a shop-floor level. Using an automation toolset utilising a component based approach, this paper introduces a Web-based 3D fault diagnosis and its visualisation in a shop-floor that delivers better perception and understanding to engineers, and even provides convenient shop floor accessibility to machine information anytime and anywhere. In particular, this work has implemented 3D fault visualisation using an X3DOM model and technology. It improves the accessibility of 3D visualisation without the need for specific visualisation software and can be deployed on both PC-based hardware and mobile devices.

It has promising application prospect in such area as grid energy storage systems, electrical vehicles etc. In this paper, by analysing the lithium-ion battery information, the most influencing factors of lifetime are collected. Based on this, a novel system is proposed to predict the battery capacity loss using a model based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) method by an iterative technique. Unlike static models the proposed system is designed to overcome the problem of data sparseness at the beginning in application. It implements a reliable forecast of the battery life by using newly gained data iteratively, which increases the prediction accuracy noticeably. Experiments prove that the solution can predict battery life with high precision, and the prediction results meet the accuracy and stability requirements of practical application.

At the grand scale of cloud computing, it is clear that soft error induced failures will occur far more frequently, but it is unclear as to how to effectively apply current error detection and fault tolerance techniques in scale. In this paper, we focus on energy-aware fault tolerant scheduling in public, multi-user cloud systems, and explore the three-way tradeoff between reliability (in terms of soft error resiliency), performance and energy. Through a systematically optimized resource allocation, error detection approach selection, virtual machine placement, spatial/temporal redundancy augmentation and task scheduling process, the cloud service provider can achieve high error coverage and fault tolerance confidence while minimizing global energy costs under user deadline constraints. Our scheduling algorithm includes a static scheduling phase that operates on task graph based workload inputs prior to execution, and a light-weight dynamic scheduler that migrates tasks during execution in case of excessive re-executions. All schedules are evaluated on a runtime simulation engine that (1) mimics the performance fluctuations in cloud systems, and (2) supports the injection of arbitrary fault patterns. Compared to current virtual machine or task replication techniques, we are able to reduce overall application failure rates by over 50% with approximately 76% total energy overhead.

The use of machine learning and data mining techniques has revolutionized the whole process of breast cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis. Breast tumors are divided in to two types; malignant and benign. In this paper we propose how to distinguish the type of breast cancer by creating a Fuzzy system (FS). To detect the type of breast censer we use a chaotic hierarchical cluster-based multispecies particle swarm optimization (CHCMSPSO) to optimization a FS indeed. The objective of this paper is to learn Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type fuzzy rules with high accuracy. In addition to this, we will introduce chaos into the HCMSPSO in order to further enhance its global search ability. In the paper, eleven chaotic maps are used in the intelligent diagnosis system. The accuracy rate of distinguishing between benign and malignant censer is above 90 percent. However, among the chaotic maps, the Sinusoidal chaotic map provides us with the accuracy rate 99 percent because it coordinates with the problems conditions. This simulation is performed on UCI-Breast Censer data-base.

A mechanic structure (as an experimental prototype where faults can be inserted) called Rotating System has been used. The vibration standard of the Rotating System, called "The Spectral Signature", has been obtained. The changes in the vibration standard have been analyzed and used as parameters for detecting incipient failures, as well as their condition evolution, allowing predictive monitoring and planning of maintenance. The faults analyzed in this work are caused due to insertion of asymmetric masses for unbalancing in the axle wheel. The system for diagnosing Fuzzy System was calibrated to detect and diagnose the conditions: normal, incipient failure, maintenance, and danger, using linguistic variables. The frequency of rotation and the amplitudes of vibration of the axle wheel are considered in each situation as parameters for analysis, diagnostic, for the decision by the Expert System based on Fuzzy rules. The results confirm that the proposed method is useful for detecting incipient failures, monitoring the evolution of severity and offering grants for planning and decision making about maintenance or prevention of rotating machines.

On Undecidability Aspects of Resilient Computations and Implications to Exascale	EURO-PAR 2014: PARALLEL PROCESSING WORKSHOPS, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	20th Euro-Par International Workshops	AUG 25-26, 2014	Porto, PORTUGAL			Exascale systems; resilient computations; undecidability; uncomputability		Future Exascale computing systems with a large number of processors, memory elements and interconnection links, are expected to experience multiple, complex faults, which affect both applications and operating-runtime systems. A variety of algorithms, frameworks and tools are being proposed to realize and/or verify the resilience properties of computations that guarantee correct results on failure-prone computing systems. We analytically show that certain resilient computation problems in presence of general classes of faults are undecidable, that is, no algorithms exist for solving them. We first show that the membership verification in a generic set of resilient computations is undecidable. We describe classes of faults that can create infinite loops or non-halting computations, whose detection in general is undecidable. We then show certain resilient computation problems to be undecidable by using reductions from the loop detection and halting problems under two formulations, namely, an abstract programming language and Turing machines, respectively. These two reductions highlight different failure effects: the former represents program and data corruption, and the latter illustrates incorrect program execution. These results call for broad-based, well-characterized resilience approaches that complement purely computational solutions using methods such as hardware monitors, co-designs, and system-and application-specific diagnosis codes.

Building on chain replication, BChain achieves high throughput and low latency under high client load. At the core of BChain is an efficient Byzantine failure detection mechanism called re-chaining, where faulty replicas are placed out of harm's way at the end of the chain, until they can be replaced. Our experimental evaluation confirms our performance expectations for both fault-free and failure scenarios. We also use BChain to implement an NFS service, and show that its performance overhead, with and without failures, is low, both compared to unreplicated NFS and other BFT implementations.

The behavior of WRIM in winding asymmetrical fault condition is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink software using modified qd equations in stationary reference frame. With the aid of simulation results, variations of electromagnetic torque, rotor speed and stator and rotor currents have been investigated under healthy and faulty conditions. It is shown that in winding asymmetrical fault conditions, the time and size of primary and steady state fluctuations in torque and rotor speed curves change and additional oscillations in steady state is observed. In the stator and rotor current curves, steady state time, sub transient oscillations and maximum phase current in steady state and transient as well as harmonic components change. According to the results, the total harmonic distortion (THD) index in rotor winding asymmetrical fault is affected more than in stator winding fault.

Unbalanced Magnetic Force Mitigation and Torque Ripple Minimization in Eccentric SRMs	2014 5TH POWER ELECTRONICS, DRIVE SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE (PEDSTC)	Power Electronics Drive Systems and Technologies Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	5th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems & Technologies Conference (PEDSTC)	FEB 05-06, 2014	Tehran, IRAN	IEEE, IEEE Iran Sect, ICE, Power Elect Soc Iran, Iranian Assoc Elect Elect Engineers, JDEVS		Eccentricity Compensation; Fault Control; Unbalanced Magnetic Force; Torque Ripple; Finite Element Analysis; Switched Reluctance Machines	SWITCHED-RELUCTANCE MACHINES; STATIC ECCENTRICITY; MOTORS; DIAGNOSIS; FAULTS	In this paper a comprehensive method is introduced to redress Eccentricity Faults consequences. Two main effects of EFs include considerable increase in Unbalanced Magnetic Force (UMF) and torque ripple. Dependeney of UMF and torque ripple on EF level is shown and the possibility of compensating them via controlling currents in facing poles is proved. These objectives are aecomplished through a novel converter which controls currents in poles of every phase such that one pole is responsible for nullifying UMF and the facing pole is in charge of torque ripple minimizing. The control algorithm is analyzed in details and through Finite Element Method (FEM) and MATLAB/Simulink is implemented on a 6/4 Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM). Suggested method is designed such that there is no need to detect EF direction and type which makes it cost effective and practical for a wide range of SRMs and applications.	[Tavakoli, M.

In this case the demagnetization fault detection in a permanentmagnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is investigated in this paper as a common fault. Demagnetization can be complete, or partial, on a certain region of the pole. Also it can be in form of symmetric or asymmetric. In this base, this paper presents a fault detection survey of PMSM under different types of demagnetization states. Finite element method (FEM) used for simulation and consideration of different fault states under fault mentioned.	[Moosavi, S.

Inter-turn short-circuit faults are often critical and must be detected earlier with a good precision in order to inform a supervisor of the existence of a system failure to limit the risks incurred by the material and human located around the machine in fault. Using winding function approach for modeling the machine, two models of inter-turn short-circuit are selected: the first model isolates the turns short-circuited to form a new coil and the faulty coil has a new number of turns minus the number of turns short-circuited. In this faulty coil appears a current called circulating current. The second model has a same aspect of the first model but in this time, the point of contact of the interturn short-circuited is modelised by a resistance. In order to ensure the performance of the used methods, a validation using another model, electric circuits magnetically coupled followed by experimental validation is effectuated. The obtained results validate the proposed techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.	[Razafimahefa, D.

It is urgently needed for identifying novel biomarkers with increased sensitivity and specificity for early detection and personalised therapeutic intervention. Microarray profiling offered significant advances in molecular classification but sample scarcity and cohort heterogeneity remains challenging areas. Here, we investigated diagnostics signatures derived from human triplenegative tissue. We applied REMARK criteria for the selection of relevant studies and compared the signatures gene lists directly as well as assessed their classification performance in predicting diagnosis using leave-one-out cross-validation. The crossvalidation results shows excellent classification accuracy ratios using all data sets. A subset signature (17-gene) extracted from the convergence of eligible signatures have also achieved excellent classification accuracy of 89.37% across all data sets. We also applied gene ontology functional enrichment analysis to extract potentially biological process, pathways and network involved in TNBC disease progression. Through functional analysis, we recognized that these independent signatures have displayed commonalities in functional pathways of cell signaling, which play important role in the development and progression of TNBC. We have also identified five unique TNBC pathways genes (SYNCRIP, NFIB, RGS4, UGCG, LOX and NNMT), which could be important for therapeutic interventions as indicated by their close association with known drivers of TNBC and previously published experimental studies.

The proposed scheme structures the inverse dynamics of the controlled system offline. This is done using a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) network that based on the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering technique. Then the proposed network is updated online to determine the appropriate control action. A linear feedback compensator is added to ensure the closed loop stability. Simulation results of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Poor-quality signal may cause misinterpretation of monitoring system, and even lead to the false alarms or failure of detection. To improve the quality of the signal and enhance the accuracy of the fault monitoring system, a novel automatic tracking filter for data acquisition based on FPGA was developed. This newly developed filter can adjust to its real-time cut-off frequency relying on the detected rotational speed. Moreover, the introduction of the Ping-Pong operation realized the non-disturbance shifting of output data. The results obtained from the simulated and pragmatic experiments revealed that this filter could achieve automatic tracking for rotational speed and ameliorate the quality of sampling signal utilized in fault diagnosis.

The degradation data is taken from electrical treeing experiments on 25 epoxy resin samples. Breakdown occurs in all tests within 2.5 hours. Partial discharge (PD) data from 18 samples are used as training data for prognostic modeling and 7 for model validation. The degradation parameter used in this model is the voltage difference between consecutive PD pulses, which decreases prior to breakdown. Every training sample shows a decreasing exponential trend when plotting the root mean squared (RMS) of the voltage difference for 5 minute batches of data. An average model from the training data is developed to determine the RMS voltage difference during breakdown. This breakdown indicator is verified over three time horizons of 25, 50 and 75 minutes. Results show the best estimation of TTF for 50 minutes of data, with error within quantified bounds. This suggests the framework is a promising approach to estimating insulation TTF.	[Aziz, N.

Prognostic modeling of transformer aging using Bayesian particle filtering	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL INSULATION AND DIELECTRIC PHENOMENA (CEIDP)	Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena Annual Report		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena (CEIDP)	OCT 19-22, 2014	Des Moines, IA	IEEE				The goal of condition monitoring is to accurately assess the current health of an asset, in order to generate a prognosis, i.e. predict its remaining useful life. In the absence of a fault which causes premature failure, transformer degradation is linked to paper aging. Research and experience have resulted in models of paper aging where hotspot temperature is the key driver. However, these deterministic equations give a false sense of certainty about remaining insulation life. This paper demonstrates the use of Bayesian particle filtering for transformer life prognostics. This technique allows quantification of the uncertainties surrounding aspects such as the initial degree of polymerization of the paper, the relationship between hotspot temperature and measurands, and the accuracy of measurements. A case study from an in-service 180 MVA transformer is used to illustrate its potential.

The authors have proposed a simple method for diagnosing the fault probabilistically by considering distributions of features, i.e. magnitude and phase of load current. Laboratory experiments proved that the method was promising. In order to enhance accuracy of diagnosis, especially in the case of a slight insulation failure such as one turn-to-turn short circuit, this paper proposes a method with the aid of Support Vector Machine using the features. Effectiveness of the new method is evaluated compared with the probabilistic one.

The fail safe operation of a safety critical system like battery operated car or any other lifesaving systems are heavily depend upon earlier prediction of battery life. SOC or State-of-Charge estimation is one of the well-known method to predict the runtime of a battery. Various approaches are adapted by automotive society to correctly predict the runtime or the SOC of a battery like Kalman filter, UKF and many others. This paper proposes a new approach, the method of regression to predict the future power demand of a car while running on the road. The aim is to identify that, the battery will support the run of the car in next 10 seconds or not. The runtime prediction of a battery, not only depends upon the starting SOC but also depends upon other factors like battery health and road profile imposed. To overcome this type of difficulties the self-corrective regression model is proposed and implemented. Experiments performed on different road profiles, validate demanded power by the car in up-coming 10 seconds of its run. The major problem of SoC estimation is to determine initial SoC of a battery. Extensive experiments needed to calculate the initial SoC and which may also vary with the life of the battery. The novelty of this work shows, the method to predict the future power demand by updating its model parameters and without any initial SoC calculation. Model parameters are updated by the introducing new current and voltage sample in the model.

The approach is based on the Extended Kalman Filter that uses the extended model of an electrical induction machine (IM) under healthy conditions. The extended model includes additional states (disturbances) that allow discrepancies between the model and the real system to be detected. It is demonstrated through simulation that the method is able to identify anomalies when unmodelled dynamics are induced. Subsequently, the values of the estimated disturbances may be used as inputs to a condition monitoring system in order to detect machine faults, helping to reduce the rate of spurious stops and false alarms, therefore improving the overall process efficiency.

The capabilities of sensing the physical variables over the rotor are quite promising. A 7.5 kW 4 salient-pole synchronous machine with configurable fault scenarios is available for this research. The measurements in the rotor are taken through two sets of 25 slip-rings expressly mounted for this purpose. The sensors installed are four thermocouples, one on each pole; the shaft voltage is measured referred to the ground. The last capability of this system is to measure the current flowing over the damping cage bars. Having more reliable and precise condition monitoring systems will make it possible to define the assessment of the machine with more accuracy. Consequently, making this information available for the operation and maintenance scheduling of industrial plants will lead to more efficient processes through improved operation schemes according to the actual status of the system.

In this article, we described the principle of the sensor and made an experimental analysis. The analysis results showed that the sensitivity and linearity of the sensor were -1.5pm/um and 4.11% respectively within a measuring range of 2-2.6mm. When the sensor was used to monitor the vibration of the rotating shaft, the vibration signals and the critical speed measured were the same as that obtained from the eddy current sensors. This indicated that the sensor could be effectively used for non-contact measurement of vibration of rotating shaft, and fault monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machinery.

The proposed method is applied to fault detection of diesel valve train. Firstly, numerical simulation results verify that the model parameters (v,s) influence on OC-SVM is integrated. Secondly, the largest AUC value of ROC curve analysis is selected as the evaluation criteria, and Gaussian bandwidth coefficient s and control parameter v are optimized by the use of adaptive genetic algorithm synchronously. Finally, genetic optimization OC-SVM model is applied to fault diagnosis of diesel valve train. The results show that OC-SVM model with genetic optimization is easier to obtain good performance than OC-SVM model with artificial specified parameters.

Although it was first formulated more than 45 years ago, it has kept on attracting a lot of research efforts motivated towards better formulation of its theoretical basis and optimization of its settings. The central idea is that an incipient fault will produce a series of resonant responses which, although repetitive, are not necessarily periodic due to random phasing of their high frequency components. Computing the envelope is a mechanism to suppress phase fluctuations and to evidence periodicity in the energy flow of the signal. As a consequence, the envelope spectrum displays a spectrum of lines, standing as the characteristic signature of the fault. One everlasting difficulty of the envelope spectrum, however, is to select the frequency band where to demodulate the signal before enveloping. The exercise is often found as delicate to practice as it is critical to the success of the method. The spectral kurtosis and its several variants are one attempt to solve the problem by searching for that frequency band which maximizes the kurtosis, i.e. where the impulsive faults is supposed to have the best signal-to-noise ratio. This might be justified by conceiving the kurtosis as the variance of the envelope, that is as a measure of the fluctuations of the energy flow. Another solution that has been investigated in the literature is to find that frequency band which returns the envelope spectrum closest to a spectrum of lines. Interestingly, the first class of solution exploits the non-linearity of the signal, whereas the second one exploits its non-stationary (cyclostationary) behavior. It is also noteworthy that the two solutions are dual of each other, since a spectrum of lines is like a series of (narrow) transients in the frequency domain. Yet, it happens that none of them is perfect: the spectral kurtosis easily tends to get maximized by a single impulse (e.g. impulsive noise) and the "discreteness" of the envelope spectrum by a pure sine, which in both cases happens to be far from the expected series of transients. It is shown in this contribution that signals that most resembles a series of transients in both the time and frequency domains satisfy an entropic uncertainty principle. Based on this finding, an improved criterion is proposed to select the optimal frequency band that can best extract a series of repetitive transients. The superiority of the latter the other aforementioned techniques is illustrated on simulated signals.

Gaussian Processes are powerful nonparametric models that can be used for advanced nonlinear regression. On the other hand, autoregressive models have been examined extensively for fault detection on mechanical systems. However, when a mechanical system behaves nonlinearly in its baseline condition, a linear autoregressive model might not be able to distinguish between a baseline system response and a response from the system with damage. This paper is intended as a brief introduction to both data-driven damage detection and Gaussian Processes, and concludes with an example damage detection application to a simulated signal as well as a short review of Gaussian Processes for time series models.

Microphone-based solutions offer limited performance due to the presence of high levels of background noise in most industrial measurement scenarios. Furthermore, the use of accelerometers is not viable for applications where it is not possible to attach a sensor to the object's surface. Laser vibrometry or other alternative non-contact measurement methods are not recommended when an affordable, flexible solution is required. In contrast, acoustic particle velocity sensors offer key advantages in such scenarios. They provide a better signal to noise ratio when the measurements are performed close to the radiating surface, due to the vector nature of particle velocity, intrinsic dependency upon surface displacement and sensor directivity. The background noise contribution can be minimized by measuring as close as possible to the target sound source. In such cases, the measured acoustic particle velocity becomes proportional to the surface vibration. This paper introduces the use of particle velocity transducers for fault detection moving and rotating parts in a noisy environment. The detection algorithm relies on the assumption that a high proportion of faults are impulsive sounds or clicks. An algorithm based on the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Kurtosis features extracted from the vibration signal, for detection and classification of the impulsive noise, is proposed. The classification is performed using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and assumes that the vibration signal can be masked by cyclostationary noise. In addition, autoregressive models are used to increase overall performance. The experimental results obtained show that the detection system can successfully operate under weak signal to noise ratios and in the presence of background noise. This provides key evidence for the potential of particle velocity-based solutions for fault detection in end of line control applications.	[Pousa, G. Carrillo; Korbasiewicz, M.; Comesana, D.

Diagnostic of rolling element bearing in low speed regime using the instantaneous angular speed and cyclostationary tools	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2014) AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			ROTATING MACHINE; TRANSMISSION; VIBRATION	Diagnostic of rolling element bearings at low speed presents a particular challenge. The most used technique, vibration analysis, is not able to diagnosis these components below a certain speed and the appropriate technique; acoustic emission is expensive and needs a huge storage memory and dedicated algorithms. In this work, it is proposed to use the instantaneous angular speed (IAS). The IAS method has shown the effectiveness in diagnosis the bearings in the variable regime and high speed regime, but it is the first time used for to bearings diagnosis at low speed regime. The measurement of the IAS needs an optical encoder mounting on the revolution shaft and a data acquisition system. For the method validation, a test rig was used to generate IAS signals in low speed (5-100 rpm). Two bearings were used (double row SKF 1206 ETN9 and simple row SKF 6026) and several kinds of faults were created with different sizes (localized inner fault, localized outer fault and rolling element localized faults). The IAS signal is cyclostationary since it is angularly sampled. Therefore, the cyclostationary model is valid and the cyclostationary tools can be used for the condition monitoring (CM). The cyclostationarity at first order shows periodicity and it is uncorrelated with defect presence, whereas the synchronous variance, the second-order cyclostationarity, is correlated with defect. The spectral correlation density (SCD) is efficient for the fault detection but it is not practical for the industrial condition monitoring. For that, an indicator based on the DSC is proposed. The results show a clear distinction between the faulty bearing and the free fault bearing in a low speed regime even if the fault size is small. The influence of the machine parameters (load, fault size) and data acquisition (optical encoder resolution) is shown.	[Sghir, K. Ait; Cousinard, O.; Bolaers, F.; Dron, J.

Dynamic pattern recognition method for bearing monitoring	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2014) AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a diagnosis method based on current measurement and pattern recognition analysis. This method is used to diagnose and monitor bearings in real time. The aim is uncover the intern condition of the turning machine and automatically define its operating conditions (faulty or not). The proposed method key idea is employing a dynamic classification method that will introduces a new dimension (time) into the analysis, which will allow real-time detection of the fault and better visibility of the evolution of the system's operating condition revealed by the motion and the temporal evolution of dynamic classes formed by the extracted fault indicators from the vibratory signals. This approach is based on three steps: extraction, selection and dynamic classification. In the extraction stage; the characteristic parameters of the bearing degradation state will be calculated using traditional techniques and recent signal processing techniques. While in the selection stage; a choice of the most relevant parameters will be made using a variant of the principal component analysis (Kernel Principal Component Analysis). Finally, in the dynamic classification; the surveillance of the movement and changes of the clusters will be used to reveal the changing of the system' operating condition. These three steps are performed upon the arrival of each new recorded signal extracted from an experimental bench which was used to confirm the validity of this method.

Towards an automatic diagnostics system for gearboxes based on vibration measurements	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2014) AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; MACHINE	On-line condition monitoring systems for gearboxes that can efficiently generate a diagnostic conclusion without manual interpretation of measurement data by an expert have long been desired by industries. It is in hope that such an automatic diagnostic system can reduce the total cost for implementing a Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) strategy, that has been proven in modern industries as an effective maintenance strategy, on machines/systems equipped with gearboxes. Nowadays, a number of commercial systems that can serve as automatic diagnostic systems for gearboxes have been made available on the market. However, these commercial solutions are in general closed black box, i.e. they are not open to allow gradual improvements for specific applications. This suggests that there is still a constant awareness from industrial users to build their own (automatic) diagnostic system for improved diagnostics. To fill this substantial gap, this paper aims at providing a framework for developing a gearbox diagnostic system with the following properties: (1) automatic generation of the diagnostic conclusion (2) scalable solution where the diagnostic system can be easily extended with other faults or applied to different gearbox configurations, (3) effective to detect frequent fault in gearboxes, and (4) robust in a large variety of operational conditions.

Multi fault diagnosis based on loading matrix and score matrix of principal component analysis for a centrifugal pump	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2014) AND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)	SEP 15-17, 2014	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn				Centrifugal pumps are one of the rotating machines that are widely used in various industries such as oil and gas, petrochemical, water treatment, power generation, agriculture, and fertilizers. During its operation, it can experience failures which can potentially cause disruption of production processes. Early detection of faults in centrifugal pumps can reduce energy consumption, service and maintenance costs, increase reliability, life-cycle and safety, and therefore significantly reduce through-life-time costs. Application of statistical features combined with principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the techniques that can be used to monitor machine condition. PCA is a widely used procedure which reduces the dimension of an original dataset into lower dimension by converting original possibly correlated variables into new set of uncorrelated variables. In this paper a method based on loading matrix and score matrix of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is proposed to build a framework for multi fault diagnosis for a centrifugal pump. The PCA diagnosis model was developed by using historical normal condition, and further fault detection was determined by Hotellings T2 statistic, while fault location was obtained through the combination of loadings and scores of principal components. In this study, normal and faulty conditions of a centrifugal pump were obtained from a Spectra Quest Machinery Fault Simulator and four common fault modes were investigated, impeller fault, blockage, cavitation and bearing fault. The combination of faults were also used, including impeller fault-blockage, impeller fault-cavitation, impeller fault-bearing fault, and impeller fault-cavitation-bearing fault. Vibration signals were measured using two accelerometers mounted on the radial direction of the volute case and the bearing housing respectively. The centrifugal pump was run at the speed of 2095 rpm and 2400 rpm, and acceleration vibration data was collected at a sampling rate of 48192 Hz with sampling duration of 1 second. Five statistical features (kurtosis, RMS, skewness, variance and entropy) were extracted from vibration time waveforms which were previously divided into frequency bands or octaves. The time waveform was firstly transformed to the frequency domain via the FFT and was then divided into octave bands. The frequency separation was based on the impeller shaft speed, which was chosen to be the central frequency for the second octave band, and the central frequencies of the other octave bands corresponded to the shaft speed harmonics. Secondly, the frequency domain data was then transformed back to the time domain (via IFFT) providing many segments corresponding to each of the octave bands. The PCA model for normal condition was then developed based on statistical features extracted from each time waveform segment. The new data set from the faulty condition was tested using the PCA model. The fault detection was achieved through comparing the T2 statistic for each measurement to the T2 control limit. Once the fault had been detected, the next important step was to diagnose the location of the fault which was obtained by analysing the loadings and scores matrices on the first of several principal components. Furthermore, investigations were conducted for all of the time waveform segments for the various fault combinations and by comparison, the most important features for fault diagnosis were obtained.

Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for reducing mortality rates and improving prognosis of patients. Recently, 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) has gained increasing attentions for reducing subjectivity, operator-dependence, and providing 3D context of the whole breast. In this work, we propose a breast mass detection algorithm improving voxel-based detection results by incorporating 3D region-based features and multi-view information in 3D ABUS images. Based on the candidate mass regions produced by voxel-based method, our proposed approach further improves the detection results with three major steps: 1) 3D mass segmentation in geodesic active contours framework with edge points obtained from directional searching; 2) region-based single-view and multi-view feature extraction; 3) support vector machine (SVM) classification to discriminate candidate regions as breast masses or normal background tissues. 22 patients including 51 3D ABUS volumes with 44 breast masses were used for evaluation. The proposed approach reached sensitivities of 95%, 90%, and 70% with averaged 4.3, 3.8, and 1.6 false positives per volume, respectively. The results also indicate that the multi-view information plays an important role in false positive reduction in 3D breast mass detection.

Novel Prediction of Anticancer Drug Chemosensitivity in Cancer Cell Lines: Evidence of Moderation by microRNA Expressions	2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014	Chicago, IL	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc			PANEL; PHARMACOGENOMICS; PHARMACOLOGY; PROFILES	The objectives of this study are (1) to develop a novel "moderation" model of drug chemosensitivity and (2) to investigate if miRNA expression moderates the relationship between gene expression and drug chemosensitivity, specifically for HSP90 inhibitors applied to human cancer cell lines. A moderation model integrating the interaction between miRNA and gene expressions was developed to examine if miRNA expression affects the strength of the relationship between gene expression and chemosensitivity. Comprehensive datasets on miRNA expressions, gene expressions, and drug chemosensitivities were obtained from National Cancer Institute's NCI-60 cell lines including nine different cancer types. A workflow including steps of selecting genes, miRNAs, and compounds, correlating gene expression with chemosensitivity, and performing multivariate analysis was utilized to test the proposed model. The proposed moderation model identified 12 significantly-moderating miRNAs: miR-15b*, miR-16-2*, miR-9, miR-126*, miR-129*, miR-138, miR-519e*, miR-624*, miR-26b, miR-30e*, miR-32, and miR-196a, as well as two genes ERCC2 and SF3B1 which affect chemosensitivities of Tanespimycin and Alvespimycin-both HSP90 inhibitors. A bootstrap resampling of 2,500 times validates the significance of all 12 identified miRNAs. The results confirm that certain miRNA and gene expressions interact to produce an effect on drug response. The lack of correlation between miRNA and gene expression themselves suggests that miRNA transmits its effect through translation inhibition/control rather than mRNA degradation. The results suggest that miRNAs could serve not only as prognostic biomarkers for cancer treatment outcome but also as interventional agents to modulate desired chemosensitivity.

The online monitoring of induction motors is becoming increasingly important. The main difficulty in this task is the lack of an accurate analytical model to describe a faulty motor. Faults and failures of induction machines can lead to excessive downtimes and generate large losses in terms of maintenance and lost revenues, and this motivates the examination of on-line condition monitoring. The major difficulty is the lack of an accurate model that describes a fault motor. Moreover, experienced engineers are often required to interpret measurement data that are frequently inconclusive. A fuzzy logic approach may help to diagnose induction motor faults. In fact, fuzzy logic is reminiscent of human thinking processes and natural language enabling decisions to be made based on vague information.	[Khireddine, M.

The adaptive feature extraction scheme consists of an adaptive signal resampling algorithm, a frequency tracker, and a feature generation algorithm for effective extraction of the features of gearbox faults from the stator current signal of the AC electric machine connected to the gearbox. The multiclass SVM classifier is designed to identify different faults in the gearbox according to the fault features extracted. The PSO algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameter setting of the SVM classifier to obtain the best classification accuracy. The proposed method is testified on a drivetrain gearbox connected with a permanent-magnet synchronous machine with three different faults. Experimental results show that the faults can be effectively classified by the proposed method.

The electric drive system, which is a key subsystem in electric vehicles, requires a reliable and robust diagnosis system to detect various faults that may occur during operation. This paper proposes a diagnostic strategy based on structural analysis for an electric vehicle driven by a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). Structural analysis analyzes the structural model represented by Incidence Matrix of a system, using graphical tools to find the analytic redundancy of the model where it is possible to generate residuals. Structural analysis is useful for pre-analysis of fault detectablity and isolability properties without accurate knowledge of system parameters. This paper shows that by properly selecting sequential residual generators, structural analysis approach is effective to identify and isolate multiple sensor faults in the PMSM drive system.

Evaluating the Viability of Application-Driven Cooperative CPU/GPU Fault Detection	EURO-PAR 2013: PARALLEL PROCESSING WORKSHOPS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Workshop on Parallel Processing (Euro-Par)	AUG 26-27, 2013	Aachen, GERMANY			fault detection; heterogeneous computing		Trends in high performance computing are bringing increased heterogeneity among the computational resources within a single machine. The heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms, however, exacerbate resilience problems faced by current large-scale systems. How to design efficient resilience strategies is critical for the wider adoption of heterogeneous platforms for future exascale systems. The conventional resilience strategy for GPU brings significant performance and power overhead, because they employ a one-size-fits-all approach to enforce uniform data protection. In addition, the isolation between CPU and GPU protection loses potential optimization opportunities provided by the heterogeneous CPU/GPU platforms. In this paper, we explore the viability of using an application-driven CPU/GPU cooperative method to detect faults occurred on GPU global memory. By selectively protecting application-critical data and leveraging time and space redundancy in CPU to detect faults, we bring only 2.2% performance overhead while capturing more than 90% errors that cause incorrect application results.

Real-time fault diagnosis has grabbed attention of researchers in looking for a better approach to overcome current limitation. The parameters of health condition in machinery could be monitored thus faults could be detected and diagnosed by using signal analysis approach. Since some fault signals are non-stationary or time dependent in nature, therefore time-frequency signal analysis is crucial for machinery fault diagnosis. Common time-frequency signal analysis methods are such as short time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelets analysis, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), etc. This review provides a summary of the basic principle of signal analysis, the most recent researches, and some advantages and limitations associated to each types of timefrequency signal analysis method.

However, actual application of wavelet analysis for machinery fault diagnosis in the field is still relatively rare. This is partly due to the fact that visual interpretation of wavelet results is often difficult and very challenging. This paper investigates an effective method to present wavelet analysis results in order to simplify the interpretation of wavelet analysis result for machinery faults diagnosis. Analysis of residual wavelet scalogram was proposed in this study as a mean to display and extract key faults signatures from raw sensor signals. Simulated signals were generated to test the feasibility of the proposed method. Test results showed that the proposed wavelet method provides a simple and more effective way to diagnose machinery faults.	[Hee, Lim Meng; Hui, K.

The genetic algorithm was applied to automate the process. A total of 15 fault cases based on practical observation of the machine faults was considered. Vibration data for the various fault cases were collected and processed using the time-frequency analysis, namely the short time Fourier transform (STFT), the smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD), and the reassigned smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (RSPWVD), due to the non-stationary vibration characteristics of the system analyzed. The fault features for the formidable amount of time-frequency data were extracted first and fed into an artificial neural network for fault classification.

In the strategy, parity space is directly identified from normal process data without modeling. With the identified parity space, a group residuals can be generated and evaluated to achieve fault detection.

The controlled asynchronous machine has input/state type where the present state is given as the output value. We consider a kind of intermittent faults that cause unauthorized state transitions to the machine, and that persist for finite time after the initial occurrence. Not only does the machine's stable reachability decrease as a result of the fault occurrence, but also immediate state recovery is made impossible. We examine the existence condition and design algorithm for a corrective controller that tolerates the adverse effect of intermittent faults with degraded performance, that is, the closed-loop system regains the normal behavior within a bounded delay. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the proposed fault tolerant control methodology.

The life of rotating machines are mainly depended on the working condition of the bearings. Detecting the health of the bearing has an important role in predective maintenance system. Bearing failures leads to safety issues and it negatively affect the working environment, in terms of machine down times, interruption of production, leading to higher manufacturing costs. The vibration signals siganture generated from a rolling element bearing delivers huge amounts of information about its structural dynamics and working conditions. The basic principle behind the vibration analysis is, the fact that any defect in a bearing gives rise to some vibration. This vibration consists of certain frequencies depending on the nature and location of the defect. The important measurement parameters of vibration are displacement, velocity and acceleration. On the basis of vibration analysis it is possible to detect and locate even very small bearing faults like false brinelling, minute wear marks etc. The vibration signal from a good bearing is compared with the vibration signal from a faulty bearing, the vibration signature generated from a defective bearing differs from the normal state vibration signature and it is determined through the shape of time domain signal peaks, the randomness of peak position and also through frequency domain characteristics.

As any other machine, due to the mechanical and electrical stresses, induction motor is also subjected to various types of failures. Among these, after bearing faults, stator faults are found to be the most frequent faults in induction motor. Interturn short circuit(ITSC) faults constitute a large percent of all electrical faults and it is theroot cause of all other stator faults. So continuous monitoring of ITSC fault is necessary as rewinding the motor is usually preferred than replacing it. Several techniques have been developed for the detection of stator short circuit faults. But they have limitations due to the dependence onload variation, machine inherent asymmetry and unbalanced supply voltage. Amongthese a more reliable and simple method for practical implementation is found to bethe symmetrical component method. Negative sequence current method insensitive tosupply voltage unbalance is discussed here. Simulation study is carried out for differentvoltage unbalance. An experimental setup to model stator fault is developed. Also, ahardware setup is developed for on-line fault detection of induction motor.

Microarray data generated from oncological studies typically contain thousands of expression values with few cases. Traditional regression and classification methods require first reducing the number of dimensions via statistical or heuristic methods. Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a dimensionality reduction method that builds a least squares regression model in a reduced dimensional space. It is well known that Support Vector Machines (SVM) outperform least squares regression models. In this study, we replace the PLS least squares model with a SVM model in the PLS reduced dimensional space. To verify our method, we build upon our previous work with a publicly available data set from the Gene Expression Omnibus database containing gene expression levels, clinical data, and survival times for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. Using 5-fold cross validation, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, we show a comparison of classifier performance between the traditional PLS model and the PLS/SVM hybrid. Our results show that replacing least squares regression with SVM, we increase the quality of the model as measured by the area under the ROC curve. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Most often, machines suffer from non uniform axial air gap eccentricity. In this paper, a study conducted on a three phase squirrel cage induction motor suffering from inclined mixed air gap eccentricity is presented and a new parameter is introduced to detect the inclined eccentricity fault. Experiments were conducted on 3 phase squirrel cage induction motor to show the impact of inclined mixed air gap eccentricity on dq components of stator currents. To validate the experimental results, mathematical expressions and modeling and simulation results are presented. The paper concludes with a note that an eccentricity detection unit with dq components of stator currents in synchronous reference frame as detection parameters can be embedded in the controller circuit to monitor the health of the machine.

It saves equipment by limiting current, voltage and power variations due to faults. One essential component of protective relaying is symmetrical component analysis. This monitors the positive and negative sequence components of voltages and currents. These components are also important for condition monitoring of rotating electrical machines. It is shown in this paper that these components can easily be obtained from the double sided spectrum analysis of the complex valued signals. Apart from the standard fast Fourier transform (FFT), advanced techniques such as Park's vector analysis and residual estimation can also be used in the detection of faults. Thus an on-line, real-time instrument that displays these quantities would be very useful. In this paper, the development of such an instrument is presented. It can monitor sequence quantities and locate various characteristic fault frequencies and signature patterns in single and three phase machines. It also has a user friendly interface that is based on MATLAB1. The instrument was successfully tested on three-phase synchronous and induction machines. The performance is demonstrated by detecting eccentricity faults in salient pole synchronous machines. As commercially available spectrum analyzers cannot yet provide this level of functionality, this is a very useful instrument for practicing power engineers.

Diagnoses of Internal Faults of Three Phase Squirrel Cage Induction Motor - A Review	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN ENERGY CONVERSION TECHNOLOGIES (ICAECT): INTELLIGENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT: TECHNOLOGIES AND CHALLENGES			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Energy Conversion Technologies (ICAECT) - Intelligent Energy Management - Technologies and Challenges	JAN 23-25, 2014	Manipal Univ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Manipal, INDIA	IEEE, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, Schneider Elect, Manipal Univ	Manipal Univ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn	Motor current signature analysis (MCSA); condition monitoring; induction motor; fault diagnoses; broken bar; air gap eccentricity; stator inter-turn faults	ECCENTRICITY FAULTS; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; BROKEN BAR; MACHINES; SIGNAL; VIBRATION; STRATEGY	Three phase squirrel cage induction motors are the most popular motors in industries. Electrical, magnetic, mechanical, thermal and environmental stresses during operating conditions lead to internal faults in it. There are no reliable non-invasive tools available for early diagnoses of internal faults. Hence, these internal faults are likely to be left undetected in its early stage, leading to unscheduled maintenance, process shutdown and huge financial loss in industries. Early detection of faults helps to save resources by avoiding process shutdown/repair of machines. Hence, there is a need for a reliable non-invasive condition monitoring system for three phase squirrel cage induction motors. Condition monitoring involves non-invasive acquisition of signals, processing, fault signature extraction, decision making on the presence and type of faults. This paper reviews the current trends in internal fault diagnosis of induction machines and identifies future research options. A statistical analysis of the results of motor current signatures obtained from a motor with rotor bar faults is done to study the relative effect of fault severity and load variation on the current signature.

It should also foresee potentially harmful, slight defects in the system, before they lead to system downtime. Very often the focus of the CM is in short term performance. For example, a neural network-based CM solutions require an extensive data collection and teaching phase. A model-based CM on the other hand an accurate model of the process which is tuned into a known operation points. However, it is typical that the operation conditions change. As a result, the process models become outdated and cause-action definitions do not apply to the changed situation. Therefore, a new model structure, Multi-Variable Histogram (MVH), for CM purposes is introduced. The MVH model is statistical nonlinear model of variable relations. The model is based on schematics where the system operation point changes are taken into account. The system input variables, as explanatory variables, define the operation point for the variable being observed. When the effects of the system input variables excluding faults are taken into account, faults can be seen as operation point changes. MVH model based CM solution includes the key elements of a long-term manageable CM solution. Furthermore, the experimental tests are carried-out with a variable displacement axial piston pump to verify the performance of the solution.

To overcome this, a health monitoring of the system components is desirable but not yet available. In this paper; a method is presented that allows a model-based development of such a capability. This method uses physics-based models of system components in order to derive their behavior at considered fault modes with several extents. The gained knowledge is transferred into a model of the entire hydraulic system. This model is used to determine the fault effects on the system states in order to find candidate positions for sensors. The method allows finding an optimal set of sensors that enables the detection and isolation of system component faults. The system model is used further for the creation of a simplified steady-state nominal model, which is required for feature generation. On the basis of these features, support vector machines are trained for fault detection and isolation as well as the diagnosis of the actual fault extent. The developed health monitoring functions are validated on a test rig.

Multi-fault classification capability of the SVM is suitably demonstrated that is based on the selection of SVM parameters. Different optimization methods (i.e., the grid-search method (GSM), the genetic algorithm (GA) and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABCA)) have been performed for optimizing the SVM parameters. Four fault conditions have been considered including the no defect case. Time domain vibration signals were obtained from the gearbox casing operated in a suitable speed range. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and wavelet packet transform (WPT) are extracted from time domain signals. A set of statistical features are extracted from the wavelet transform. The classification ability is noted and compared against predictions when purely time domain data is used, and it shows an excellent prediction performance.	[Bordoloi, D.

On-line fault detection and isolation methods have been developed for automated processes. These methods include data mining methodologies, artificial intelligence methodologies or combinations of the two. Data Mining is the statistical approach of extracting knowledge from data. Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. Activities in AI include searching, recognizing patterns and making logical inferences. This paper focuses on the various techniques used for Fault Diagnostics and Prognostics in Industry application domains.

They strive to optimize all systems involved in their organizations in order to outperform on all the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Maintenance as a system plays also a key role in order to reach the KPI needed for equipment reliability and availability. To this end, also maintenance strategies have evolved from standard cyclic maintenance to more advanced approaches like Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and, as a further evolution, Predictive Maintenance (PdM) approach. Even if lot of work has been done regarding these methodologies applied on machines or industrial plants, due to the need of increasing their efficiency and productivity, the same care is not applied to other critical devices, not strictly part of single machines, like those related to power distribution. In the case of Low Voltage Circuit Breakers (LVCB), in particular for critical applications, conservative approaches are usually applied. That implies a scheduled replacement of devices could occur with a significant Remaining-Useful-Life (RUL). This paper aims to test different approaches to PdM in this class of devices, in order to evaluate, in a practical way, the performance of different types of features extraction algorithms, suitable for the development of a prognostic system, in a real industrial application. More in detail, the paper will compare three types of promising algorithms: a custom Dynamic Time Warping, an Empirical Mode Decomposition combined with Sampled Entropy and a lightweight analysis based on Fast Fourier Transform.

Typical sources of this data include hundreds of sensors mounted at the industrial machinery measuring qualities such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and many more. However, sensors are complex technical devices, which means that they can fail and their readings may contain noise or imprecise values. Such low quality data makes it hard to solve the original task of assessing system and process status. We present an approach which brings together several well-known techniques from computer science and statistics and enhances monitoring of technical systems by improving results of detection and correction of data quality issues in sensor data. The application domain and the dependencies between its objects are represented as a knowledge-based model, while statistics identifies data anomalies, such as outlying or missing values, in sensor measurement data. Combining information from the knowledge-based model and statistical computations allows to validate and improve data analysis results. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a real-world industrial use case from the power generation domain. Our evaluation shows that the combined solution improves precision indexes while maintaining high accuracy and recall values.

As to slewing bearing, vibration signals are usually non-stationary and with strong white noise, which makes it very difficult to extract useful information from the signals. Therefore, an Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition - Principle Component Analysis (EEMD PCA) based method was proposed to denoise the vibration signals and performance degradation model was established by PCA. To verify the proposed method, an experiment was conducted and the life cycle vibration signals were acquired. After denoising, performance degradation model was established to explain the denoising performance. Results show that the proposed method acquired a better denoising performance than EEMD-MSPCA, which provides a potential for further research.

Different classifiers (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, or classification trees) have been investigated in the last decade. The results achieved so far are sometimes contrasting and do not show a clear winner. In this paper we present an empirical study aiming at statistically analyzing the equivalence of different defect predictors. We also propose a combined approach, coined as CODEP (COmbined DEfect Predictor), that employs the classification provided by different machine learning techniques to improve the detection of defect-prone entities. The study was conducted on 10 open source software systems and in the context of cross-project defect prediction, that represents one of the main challenges in the defect prediction field. The statistical analysis of the results indicates that the investigated classifiers are not equivalent and they can complement each other. This is also confirmed by the superior prediction accuracy achieved by CODEP when compared to stand-alone defect predictors.

In the back-to-back converter, the failure in switching devices may occur either in a machine side converter (MSC) or in a grid side converter (GSC), which decreases the generator output power and degrades the stability in wind power generation system. To detect such a fault, the second-order harmonic components of the q-axis current are monitored in the MSC as well as in the GSC. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, the comparative simulation results are presented.

However, for some capital and high reliability equipment, it is very difficult to acquire some run-to-failure data. In this case, the fault diagnosis and prognosis become very hard. In order to address this issue, continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM) is used to track the degradation process in this paper. With the degradation, the log-likelihood which is the output of CHMM will decrease gradually. Therefore, this indicator can be used to evaluate the health condition of monitored equipment.

Fault Diagnosis of Reciprocating Compressors Using Revelance Vector Machines with A Genetic Algorithm Based on Vibration Data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION AND COMPUTING (ICAC'14)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)	SEP 12-13, 2014	Cranfield Univ, Cranfield, ENGLAND	Chinese Automat & Comp Soc, IEEE, Control Syst Soc United Kingdom, Republ Ireland Chapter, Hefei Univ	Cranfield Univ	Reciprocating Compressor; Relevance Vector Machine; Fault Diagnosis; Genatic Algorithms; multiclass multi-kernel relevance vector machine		This paper focuses on the development of an advanced fault classifier for monitoring reciprocating compressors (RC) based on vibration signals. Many feature parameters can be used for fault diagnosis, here the classifier is developed based on a relevance vector machine (RVM) which is optimized with genetic algorithms (GA) so determining a more effective subset of the parameters. Both a one-against-one scheme based RVM and a multiclass multi-kernel relevance vector machine (mRVM) have been evaluated to identify a more effective method for implementing the multiclass fault classification for the compressor. The accuracy of both techniques is discussed correspondingly to determine an optimal fault classifier which can correlate with the physical mechanisms underlying the features. The results show that the models perform well, the classification accuracy rate being up to 97% for both algorithms.	[Ahmed, M.; Smith, A.; Gu, F.; Ball, A.

With this information, operators are able to make maintenance-related decisions, thus effectively streamlining operational and mission-level activities. Experimentation on testbeds representative of critical systems is very useful for the maturation of prognostics technology; precise emulation of actual fault conditions on such a testbed further validates these technologies. In this paper we present the development of a pneumatic valve testbed, initial experimental results and progress towards the maturation and validation of component-level prognostic methods in the context of cryogenic refueling operations. The pneumatic valve testbed allows for the injection of time-varying leaks with specified damage progression profiles in order to emulate common valve faults. The pneumatic valve testbed also contains a battery used to power some pneumatic components, enabling the study of the effects of battery degradation on the operation of the valves.

A Hybrid Optimization Technique for Fault Classification in Power Transformer Using Dissolved Gas Analysis	ADVANCEMENTS IN AUTOMATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advancements in Automation and Control (ICAAC)	APR 11-12, 2014	Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Transformer Fault Analysis; Improved Particle Swarm Optimization; Hybrid Optimization; Dissolved Gas Analysis; Support Vector Machine	DIAGNOSIS; BOOTSTRAP; NETWORKS	To allow utilities to fulfill self-imposed and regulative performance targets the demand for new optimized tools and techniques to Estimate the performance of modern Transformers has increased. The modern power transformers has subjected to different types of faults, which affect the continuity of power supply which in turn causes serious economic losses. To avoid the interruption of power supply, various fault diagnosis approaches are adopted to detect faults in the power transformer and has to eliminate the impacts of the faults at the initial stage. Among the fault diagnosis methods, the hybrid technique of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm is simple conceptually derived and its implementation process is faster with better scaling properties for complex problems with non linearity and load variations but performance factor related to accuracy has a declined value in case of correlations implicit. In order to obtain better fault diagnosis to improve the service of the power transformer, SVM is optimized with Improved PSO technique to achieve high interpretation accuracy for Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) of power transformer through the extracting positive features from both the techniques. Primary SVM is applied to establish classification features for faults in the transformer through DGA. The features are applied as input data to Autonomous optimized Technique for faults analysis. The proposed methodology obtains the DGA data set from diagnostic gas in oil of 500 KV main transformers of Pingguo Substation in South China Electric Power Company. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB software with an Intel core 3 processor with speed of 3 GHZ and 4 GB RAM PC. The result obtained by Autonomous optimized Technique (IPSO-SVM) is compared against PSO-SVM to estimate theperformance of the classifiers in terms of execution time and quality of classification for precision. The test results indicate that the Autonomous optimization of IPSO-SVM approach has significantly improved the classification accuracy and computational time for power transformer fault classification.

J	Saavedra, H; Riba, JR; Romeral, L				Saavedra, Harold; Riba, Jordi-Roger; Romeral, Luis			Detection of Inter-turn Faults in Five-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING			English	Article						permanent magnet motors; fault diagnosis; fault detection; fault tolerance; harmonic analysis	INDUCTION MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; DRIVES; PMSMS	Five-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) have inherent fault-tolerant capabilities. This paper analyzes the detection of inter-turn short circuit faults in five-phase PMSMs in their early stage, i.e. with only one turn in short circuit by means of the analysis of the stator currents and the zero-sequence voltage component (ZSVC) spectra. For this purpose, a parametric model of five-phase PMSMs which accounts for the effects of inter-turn short circuits is developed to determine the most suitable harmonic frequencies to be analyzed to detect such faults. The amplitudes of these fault harmonic are analyzed in detail by means of finite-elements method (FEM) simulations, which corroborate the predictions of the parametric model. A low-speed five-phase PMSM for in-wheel applications is studied and modeled. This paper shows that the ZSVC-based method provides better sensitivity to diagnose inter-turn faults in the analyzed low-speed application. Results presented under a wide speed range and different load levels show that it is feasible to diagnose such faults in their early stage, thus allowing applying a post-fault strategy to minimize their effects while ensuring a safe operation.

In this technique, the existing method of SVM was modified by introducing Haar wavelet function as kernel for mapping input data into feature space. The developed method was experimentally evaluated by vibration data measured from test rig machinery fault simulator (MFS). There were four conditions of gears namely normal, worn, teeth defect and one missing-teeth which has been experimented. Statistical features were then calculated from vibration signals and they were employed as input data for training WSVM. Fault diagnostics of bevel gear was performed by executing classification task in trained WSVM. The accuracy of fault diagnostics were evaluated by testing procedure through vibration data acquired from test rig. The results show that the proposed system gives plausible performance in fault diagnostics based on experimental work.

First, the C-OACMF was used to filter out background noise signals and extract the characteristic signal of observation signals, then using the simulated annealing genetic algorithm of fuzzy C-average clustering algorithm estimates the mixing matrix, the linear programming is finally used to estimate the source signals.

Vibration signal analysis is one of the most widely applied methods for bearing problem diagnosis, for its effectiveness and easy manipulation. Time-frequency analysis has received considerable interest in the field of bearing fault detection over the past few decades. A key element of this procedure is extracting informative features from the TFRs. In this report, we have developed a method based on cloud point dispersion parameter. The essence of the feature extraction is to project from faulty machine to a low size signal time-frequency representation (TFR), which is deliberately designed for maximizing the separability between classes, a distinct TFR is designed for each class. The feature vectors size is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization method (PSO). This approach is validated on an academic case and then tested on real data taken from the PRONOSTIA experimental platform.

Early detection of gear damage is crucial to prevent the machine system from malfunction. This paper proposes a method for detection of damaged tooth based on support vector machines. Statistical parameters of standard deviation, root mean square value, maximum value and mean value are extracted from the vibration signal as representative features of tooth conditions to be input to the support vector machine classifier. The validity of the presented method is confirmed by the application of detecting early damaged tooth during the cyclic fatigue test. The vibration acceleration on gear box is acquired as original data. Furthermore, the signal of each gear tooth is separately extracted from the signal for a further analysis. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The development of crack changes dynamic behavior of rotor system. It decreases the strength of object or material. Timely detection of a shaft crack by efficient condition monitoring system would avoid severe damage and expensive repairs due to failure of rotating machinery as well as assure the safety of personnel. The shaft crack is one of the most serious faults in high speed rotating machinery. It is important to detect them before they reach the critical size and cause total failure of the shaft. Hence attention to the study of rotating shaft with crack is required. This paper gives the general introduction to the vibration analysis method for crack detection with experimental set up. From software analysis it has shown that due to crack shaft gives different deformation values for different natural frequencies.	[Waikar, Hemant G.; Katekar, S.

Most often, however, there are no known equations describing behaviors of the system in the function of dynamic evolution time, which accounts for the need to apply new tools to examine the dynamic state. There is, therefore, the requirement to experimentally verify analytical technical models as the proper one is a model which is verified in practice. An experiment is, therefore, often only an inspiration for further researches leading to the optimization of the construction. In this work presented are chosen problems of machines' technical state diagnosis with the use of identification and technical diagnostics methods. Relations between methods of dynamic state evaluation and methods of technical state evaluation were indicated. Example modal analysis results illustrate the complexity of projecting dynamic state researches into diagnostic researches of machine state evaluation.

Guided waves (GWs), such as Lamb waves, provide the capability to monitor large plate-like aerospace structures with limited actuators and sensors and are sensitive to small scale damage; however due to the complex nature of GWs, accurate and efficient computation tools are necessary to investigate the mechanisms responsible for dispersion, coupling, and interaction with damage. In this paper, the local interaction simulation approach (LISA) coupled with the sharp interface model (SIM) solution methodology is used to solve the fully coupled electro-magneto-mechanical elastodynamic equations for the piezoelectric and piezomagnetic actuation and sensing of GWs in fiber reinforced composite material systems. The final framework provides the full three-dimensional displacement as well as electrical and magnetic potential fields for arbitrary plate and transducer geometries and excitation waveform and frequency. The model is validated experimentally and proven computationally efficient for a laminated composite plate. Studies are performed with surface bonded piezoelectric and embedded piezomagnetic sensors to gain insight into the physics of experimental techniques used for SHM. The symmetric collocation of piezoelectric actuators is modeled to demonstrate mode suppression in laminated composites for the purpose of damage detection. The effect of delamination and damage (i.e., matrix cracking) on the GW propagation is demonstrated and quantified. The developed model provides a valuable tool for the improvement of SHM techniques due to its proven accuracy and computational efficiency.

Aiming at this phenomena, Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technology is introduced to improve the reliability and availability of numerical control equipment. Before using this technology, Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) should be firstly made for all the subsystems of numerical control equipment. FMECA is indispensable before PHM, and its purpose is to identify the key subsystems which are suitable for using PHM technology, find out the failure mechanisms of this subsystems, and provide references for building failure mechanism models and defining conditional parameters being monitored. Then a PHM system of numerical control equipment is designed. In this system, every conditional parameter of key subsystems is monitored by various sensors according to its respective failure mechanisms. A method based on multi - sensor data fusion is built to process information from sensors. The method uses the neural network algorithm. Applying the method can analyze the operation condition of numerical control equipment, and then prognoses its performance degradation, life evaluation, machining accuracy, and reliability. All the results can supply helpful evidence for making maintenance policy. Finally, key issues of implementing PHM theology in numerical control equipment are cited with the goal of better practical uses.

C	Li, ZC		Xu, D		Li, Zhichun			New Detection Method for Gear Faults Based on Kernel Independent Component Analysis and BP Neural Network	MANUFACTURING AND APPLIED RESEARCH	Advanced Materials Research		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Manufacturing (Manufacturing)	FEB 09-10, 2014	Singapore, SINGAPORE			BP neural network; Fault diagnosis; Gears; ICA	DIAGNOSIS	Gearboxes are widely used in various kinds of applications. The normal operation of the gears contributes important roles on the machine performance. Due to harsh environment the rolling bearings are prone to failures. Hence, it is essential to detect the gear faults. However, the vibration signals of the gearbox are often contaminated, leading to deterioration of the fault diagnosis performance. To address this issue, a new approach is proposed based on the kernel independent component analysis (KICA) and BP neural network (BPNN). The KICA was used to extract sensitive signals to eliminate noise signals. Then a BPNN was adopted to detect the gear fault. To improve the fault identification, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) was adopted to optimize the BP parameters. Experiment tests using the gearbox fault simulator have been implemented. The test results show that the noise signals have been eliminated by the KICA and the GA-BPNN can detect the gear fault accurately. Moreover, through comparison with other existing methods, the proposed KICA-GA-BPNN produced the best detection rate of 93.7%.

By analyzing the SR characteristic of the impact signal based on sliding windows, SR can improve the signal to noise ratio and is suitable for early fault detection of rotating machinery.

The objective is the detection of cutting tool breakage using the cyclostationary tools. Initially, we will show that the vibration signals captured from the milling operation are cyclostationary. The proposed cyclostationary methods are the first and second order synchronous statistics and the spectral correlation. A test rig, composed of a milling machine (cutter with 5 teeth) and a workpiece, is used to extract the vibration signals that are angular sampled in the free fault case and one broken tooth case. This test rig is instrumented with three accelerometers, installed in the three directions, and an optical encoder that allows the angular sampling. Then we will see that the angular sampling of the signals captured from a milling operation is essential to preserve the cyclostationary properties destroyed, in the case of the temporal sampling, by speed fluctuations. The proposed method capacity to detect the broken tooth is shown. The synchronous statistics of order 1 and order 2 detect the broken tooth presence and its emplacement. The spectral correlation analysis distinguishes the broken tooth presence, but is not practical for the diagnosis. For that, an indicator based on the spectral correlation is proposed.

J	Kerroumi, S; Chiementin, X; Rasolofondraibe, L				Kerroumi, Sanaa; Chiementin, Xavier; Rasolofondraibe, Lanto			Online classification for spalling detection and vibratory behavior monitoring	MECHANICS & INDUSTRY			English	Article						Online classification; bearings; wavelet analysis; Kernel principal components analysis; spectral kurtosis	WAVELET TRANSFORM; BEARING; DIAGNOSTICS	Vibration analysis is the most widely used tool in industrial application for machine's health condition assessment. Bearings, however, are very sensitive and require special attention. Vibration analysis employs various signal processing methods such as spectral analysis, time-scale, time frequency analysis, etc. these methods are used to analyze bearings' vibratory behavior by monitoring the evolution of statistical indicators. However, diagnosing the bearing depending on traditional features only isn't sufficient to assure effective or reliable assessment of the component' health condition. This paper proposes a multi-features online dynamic classification as a new method for fault detection and health condition monitoring for bearings; this technique uses multiple features, including traditional features extracted from the raw signal, two special features extracted by wavelet analysis, the spectral kurtosis, coupled with a nonlinear principal component analysis and a dynamic classification to capitalize on the hidden information in the time evolution of the features. Through this article, we introduce different measures and techniques used to characterize the health state of rolling, then we deploy a methodology using dynamic classification to detect early defect. To ensure an almost continuous surveillance, this methodology is based on a real-time analysis, and uses specific statistical indicators adapted to the experimental bench. Then, the monitoring of the degradation is achieved through the resulting class of the state of degradation. New parameters such as the speed of the class, the position of the class, the shape of the class will be discussed to inform the state of damage. The suggested methodology is validated by analyzing several fatigue tests from a fatigue bench bearing thrust ball referenced SNR51207.

This paper presents a new approach to testing Web services based on Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM). Web Services Description Language (WSDL) file alone does not provide dynamic behavior information. This problem can be overcome by appending the formal model of EFSM to standard WSDL, we can generate a set of test cases which has a better test coverage than other methods. Moreover, a procedure for deriving an EFSM model from WSDL specification is provided to help a service provider augment, the EFSM model describing dynamic behaviors of the Web service. To show the efficacy of our approach, we applied our approach to Parlay-X Web services. In this way, we can test Web services with greater confidence in potential fault detection.

The method consists of three stages. First, due to the fact that it is hard to obtain sufficient fault samples in practice, different features are extracted as many as possible to acquire more fault characteristic information. Second, the original feature set is compressed with PCA from 43 to 4 dimensions. Finally, the compressed feature set is fed into SVM classifier to identify the fault patterns of the rolling element bearings. For comparison, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) is also utilized to solve the same problem.

The real vibration signals are nonlinear, non-stationary and time-varying signals mixed with many other factors. It is very useful for fault diagnosis to extract fault features by using time-frequency analysis techniques. Recent researches of time-frequency analysis methods including Short Time Fourier Transform, Wavelet Transform, Wigner-Ville Distribution, Hilbert-Huang Transform, Local Mean Decomposition, and Local Characteristic-scale Decomposition are introduced. The theories, properties, physical significance and applications, advantages and disadvantages of these methods are analyzed and compared. It is pointed that algorithms improvement and combined applications of time-frequency analysis methods should be researched in the future.

Broken Bar Detection on Squirrel Cage Induction Motors With MCSA and EMD	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (I2MTC) PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference (I2MTC)	MAY 12-15, 2014	Montevideo, URUGUAY	IEEE, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc		Squirrel Cage Motor; Broken Bar; EMD; MCSA	DIAGNOSIS; FAULTS	Induction motors are an ubiquitous machine. In industrial settings, online monitoring of motors' health status in order to schedule maintenance operations with the goal of damage prevention has become an essential necessity. Broken rotor bar is one of the most common failures in the rotor of a squirrel cage motor. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has become a popular method for its detection due to its high reliability. Recent works perform MCSA with a combination of different signal processing techniques to identify the presence of broken bars. In this work, MCSA is done with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) from which a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) is obtained. The extracted features of the arithmetical sum of the obtained IMFs form the basis of the proposed classification criteria. Unlike other works, the only employed signal processing technique in our methodology is EMD. Experimental results using our method show high accuracy in the detection of one broken rotor bar.

Diagnosis of Stator High-Resistance Connections in Wound Rotor Induction Machines for WECS	2014 IEEE 23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE)	Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	JUN 01-04, 2014	Istanbul, TURKEY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Bogazici Univ		Wound-Rotor Induction Machine; stator faultvarying conditions; Diagnosis; signal processing	TURN FAULTS	Design of modern Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) must take into account two crucial aspects: efficient control strategies and reliable monitoring and diagnosis techniques. Wind turbine generators based on Wound Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM) is actually the preferred technology mainly because of the lower rating of the power converter connected to the rotor side. With the association of a back-to back converter on the rotor side a Stator-Flux-Oriented-Control (SFOC) system can be used to obtain a decoupled control of the active and reactive power on the stator side with high efficiency. Faults detection at incipient stage in this power-generation system is mandatory to prevent unscheduled downtimes.

The switched reluctance drive is known to be fault tolerant, but it is not fault free. Fault diagnosis of SRM in the critical applications is often a difficult and daunting task. Thus, finding efficient and reliable fault diagnostics methods especially for SR machines is extremely important. This paper focuses on the development, and application of modern statistical classifier method, namely Hidden Markov Model (HMM) associated with a smoothed ambiguity plane Time-Frequency Representation (RTF) for the diagnosis based classification of electrical faults in this particular machine. The RTF-HMM Technique is composed of two steps: the Feature Extraction step based on the smoothed ambiguity plane designed for maximizing the separability between classes using Fisher's discriminant ratio and Hidden Markov Model algorithm applied for the classification step. The algorithm of each step is well developed. Classifier development and training data is carried out by the HMM using a set of fault scenarios, between healthy, single and combined faults, in terms of torque at different load level in order to deduce the fault severity. Parameter training of Hidden Markov Models generally need huge a mounts of historical data. Experimental results proves that the use of RTF-HMM based approaches is a suitable strategy for the automatic classification of new sample independent from de type of fault signal.

In this paper, fault diagnosis and classification based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) is done in two stages. In the first stage, a filter is designed to remove irrelevant fault components (such as noise) of current signals. The coefficients of the filter are obtained by least square (LS) algorithm. Then by extracting suitable time domain features from filter's output, a neural network is trained for fault classification. The output vector of this network is represented in one of four categories that includes healthy mode, a 5 mm crack on a bar, one broken bar, and two broken bar modes. An optimum structure of the neural network is obtained via particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.

The main objective of prognostics is to provide an estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a degrading component/ system, i.e. to predict the time after which a component/system will no longer be able to meet its operating requirements. This RUL prediction is a challenging task that requires special attention when modeling the prognostics approach. In this paper, we proposes a RUL prediction approach based on Instance Based Learning (IBL) with an emphasis on the retrieval step of the latter. The method is divided into two steps: an offline and an online step. The purpose of the offline phase is to learn a model that represents the degradation behavior of a critical component using a history of run-to-failure data. This modeling step enables us to construct a library of health indicators (HI's) from run-to-failure data which are then used online to estimate the RUL of components at an early stage of life, by comparing their HI's to the ones of the library built in the offline phase. Our approach makes use of a new similarity measure between HIs. The proposed approach was tested on real turbofan data set and showed good performance compared to other existing approaches.

However, such vibration based techniques are difficult to implement in planetary gearboxes due to the complex nature of measured vibration spectrum. Motor current signal analysis (MCSA) provides an alternative and non-intrusive way to detect mechanical faults through electrical signatures. However, literature still lacks reported investigation to monitor a planetary gearbox in an electro-mechanical drive-train using MCSA. A successful practical implementation of MCSA to planetary gearboxes is challenging because of the harmonics present in the measured current signal that arises from: 1) the structural properties of the electrical machines, and 2) the errors in manufacturing and assembly of large number of gears. This paper proposes a novel fault detection method that extends the resonance demodulation technique from vibration analysis to MCSA for detection of the gear faults where the measured stator current signal may contain high background noise. The capability of this approach is demonstrated through simulation. A nonlinear multi-DOF lumped parameter model is developed for an electro-mechanical drive-train consisting of a driving motor connected through a back-to-back planetary gearbox to a load generator. Afterwards, a seeded gear tooth fault is introduced in this electro-mechanical model to investigate its effect on the stator current. Simulation results result in a higher fault indicator under faulty gear conditions which demonstrate the feasibility of using resonance demodulation based MCSA for monitoring of mechanical faults such as those arising from gearboxes.

In the strategy, the feature extraction method Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is used firstly to extract the features from individual cell voltages. After that, the classification method Spherical-Shaped Multiple-class Support Vector Machine (SSM-SVM) is used to classify the extracted features to various classes related to health states. The potential novel failure mode can be detected in the procedure. Experiments on a 40-cell stack are dedicated to verify the approach.

Multisensor data are collected using a state-of-the-art testing platform to induce faults on BLDCMs with time varying conditions. Due to the high number of features and sensor channels available, determining the right data to identify faults can be a daunting task to achieve. A series of gears and bearings are tested. An algorithm using adaptive selection of features is proposed to improve fault detection. A benchmark data set is built containing multi-sensing data for different fault scenarios for BLDCMs with time varying conditions. The algorithm presented in this work is applied on measurements data to be included in the data set.

One of the key solutions is to enable the intelligent models with learning ability. Neither supervised nor unsupervised methods can well handle it. In this paper, we proposed a fuzzy based semi-supervised method to not only make the best of the known knowledge but also category the unknown status in a reasonable way. A roller bearing test validates the proposed method for the purpose of both diagnosis and performance evaluation.

Fault diagnosis may be interpreted as a classification problem; therefore artificial intelligence-based classifiers can be efficiently used to classify normal and faulty machine conditions. K-means clustering is one of the methods applied for this purpose. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method is proposed by applying Genetic Algorithm (GA) to overcome the drawback of K-means which it may be get stuck in local optima. For this purpose, the best solution of GA is chosen to be the initial point for K-means clustering. The proposed method is used in fault diagnosis of the scaled rotor-bearing system experimentally. Then the result of hybrid GA-K-means clustering is compared with classic K-means clustering.	[Ettefagh, M. M.; Asr, M.

In the majority of fall events external support is imperative in order to avoid major consequences. Therefore, the ability to automatically detect these fall events could help reducing the response time and significantly improve the prognosis of fall victims. This paper presents a unobtrusive smartphone based fall detection system that uses a combination of information derived from machine learning classification applied in a state machine algorithm. The data from the smartphone built-in accelerometer is continuously screened when the phone is in the user's belt or pocket. Upon the detection of a fall event, the user location is tracked and SMS and email notifications are sent to a set of contacts. The accuracy of the fall detection algorithm here proposed is near 97.5% for both the pocket and belt usage. In conclusion, the proposed solution can reliably detect fall events without disturbing the users with excessive false alarms, presenting also the advantage of not changing the user's routines, since no additional external sensors are required.

The evaluation of the insulation condition is possible with the current sensor signals only. The analyses of the transient part of the current response give evidence if a change in the insulation system occurred. The degradation of the insulation state is noticeable through a capacitive change, which influences the high frequency behavior of the machine and as a consequence the transient part of the current signal. The proposed method is capable to detect insulation degradation through analyzing the transient current response of the sensors already used for the control of the machine. Additionally, the profitable capital expenditure demands the design with minimal number of components. To reduce the costs only two current sensors are available. The non-measured transient phase current response can be reconstructed by a special excitation sequence and signal processing without significant deterioration of sensitivity.

The Use of a Modified Prony's Method to Track the Broken Rotor Bars Characteristic Frequencies and Amplitudes, in Three-Phase Induction Motors	2014 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POWER ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL DRIVES, AUTOMATION AND MOTION (SPEEDAM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion (SPEEDAM)	JUN 18-20, 2014	ITALY	IEEE		Prony's method; Filtering; MCSA; Frequency resolution	PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; FAULT-DETECTION; MACHINES; SYSTEMS	The knowledge of the broken rotor bars characteristic frequencies and amplitudes has a great importance for all related diagnostic methods. The monitoring of motor faults requires a high resolution spectrum to separate different frequency components. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) has been widely used to achieve these requirements. However, DFT can give meaningful information only for stationary harmonics which cannot be guaranteed in real cases. In addition, a long data sequence is necessary for DFT to get high frequency resolution. Nevertheless, the signals are time-varying, and the steady-state conditions can be lost for a long time acquisition. As a solution for these problems, this paper proposes an efficient time-domain technique based on a modified Prony's method for the estimation of the frequencies/amplitudes of broken rotor bar faults. Using this technique, the stator current is divided into short overlapped time windows, and each one is analyzed by the Least Squares Prony's method. The proposed technique provides a linear-time frequency/amplitude representation with high frequency resolution and adjustable time resolution. It is shown that this technique allows tracking the frequencies and amplitudes of the sidebands around the fundamental frequency component with a very high accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental tests.	[Sahraoui, M.] Univ Biskra, LGEB, Biskra, Algeria; [Cardoso, A. J.

Search Coil Systems for Early Fault Detection in Wind Turbine Generators	2014 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POWER ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL DRIVES, AUTOMATION AND MOTION (SPEEDAM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion (SPEEDAM)	JUN 18-20, 2014	ITALY	IEEE				The important types of faults and damages in electrical machines directly lead to characteristic changes in the magnetic air-gap field. These changes can be used to detect a fault by search coils placed in the stator slots based on the voltage induced in them to identify the type of fault in dependence of the frequency. Search coil systems are especially suitable for the detection of interturn faults and eccentricities, since these faults have no or little influence on the quantities at the terminals of a machine and are therefore not easy to be detected from the outside. This paper describes two different search coil systems for early fault detection of wind turbine generators. Therefore the design criteria of search coils systems for synchronous generators are presented and based on this the special challenges of search coil systems for multi-pole synchronous generators are deduced. As alternative to search coils systems to be placed in stator slots a rotor-fixed search coil system is designed.

This force is known as unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP). This force leads to further increase the eccentricity and may severely reduce the performance of the machine, producing acoustic noise, vibration, excessive wear of bearing, rotor and stator rubbing. This paper presents a universal online method for diagnosing eccentricity in Axial Flux Permanent Magnet (AFPM) Machine. It is based on measuring the induced voltages of three search coils positioned above the coils of three phases as a suitable criterion for fault detection. Using this number of search coils enables not only the Static Eccentricity Factor (SEF) but also the minimum air-gap position to be estimated. The Three-Dimensional Finite-element Method (3D-FEM) was used to accurately analyze the machine and to validate the method. This study indicates that the induced voltages of the search coils suggest an online method for indirectly measuring eccentricity during machine operation.

Wind turbine generators based on Wound Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM) is actually the preferred technology considering the above purposes. With the association of a back-to back converter on the rotor side a Stator-Flux-Oriented-Control (SFOC) system can be used to obtain e decoupled control of the active and reactive power on the stator side. This kind of control system is widely used for its efficiency and because of the lower rating of the power converter connected to the rotor side. Recently, by using the converter modulating voltages, efficient techniques have been developed for steady-state and transient operating conditions. Also a virtual platform structure to pass from wired systems to wireless systems with the possibility of remote monitoring has been presented.

Preventive maintenance of electrical machine systems plays a very important role in the industrial life. This requires monitoring their operations on-line which can detect a fault as it occurs and diagnosing the malfunction of a faulty component. In this paper, we present a fault diagnosis method for robotic systems. First, the fault monitoring is designed to enable the system to detect a fault occurrence based on the residual generator and parameter convergence. Subsequently, the fault isolation algorithm is designed based on known fault types.

One recent approach to monitoring is latent fault detection, an adaptive statistical framework for scale-out, load-balanced systems. By periodically measuring hundreds of performance metrics and looking for outlier machines, it attempts to detect subtle problems such as misconfigurations, bugs, and malfunctioning hardware, before they manifest as machine failures. Previous work on a large, real-world Web service has shown that many failures are indeed preceded by such latent faults. Latent fault detection is an offline framework with large bandwidth and processing requirements. Each machine must send all its measurements to a centralized location, which is prohibitive in some settings and requires data-parallel processing infrastructure. In this work we adapt the latent fault detector to provide an online, communication-and computation-reduced version. We utilize stream processing techniques to trade accuracy for communication and computation. We first describe a novel communication-efficient online distributed variance monitoring algorithm that provides a continuous estimate of the global variance within guaranteed approximation bounds. Using the variance monitor, we provide an online distributed outlier detection framework for non-stationary multivariate time series common in scale-out systems. The adapted framework reduces data size and central processing cost by processing the data in situ, making it usable in wider settings. Like the original framework, our adaptation admits different comparison functions, supports non-stationary data, and provides statistical guarantees on the rate of false positives. Simulations on logs from a production system show that we are able to reduce bandwidth by an order of magnitude, with below 1% error compared to the original algorithm.

It has been used in many studies for tumor classification and of identification of marker genes associated with cancer. However, this technique often suffers the 'curse of dimensionality'. A general approach to overcome this setback is to perform feature selection technique prior to classification. Biomarkers have long been used for the prognosis and diagnosis of different types of diseases. The need for new and more specific biomarkers for leukemia arises. In this study gene selection was approached first using gene filtering by determining the expressions inter-quartile ranges (IQR) of the genes and determining whether or not they are differentially expressed across the different sample types by using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA). Filtered genes were then subjected to k-means clustering algorithm to identify candidate genes that can be used to discriminate the four main types of leukemia (ALL, AML, CLL, CML) and non-leukemia (NoL) bone marrow samples. The selected genes were then used to build classification models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning algorithms. Forty samples were used to build the models and 20 samples were used to assess the models performance. A minimum of 6 genes was found to be needed to correctly classify all samples in the training dataset into the five categories and to classify the samples in the validation dataset with high accuracy.

However, machine learning needs to be optimised according to the target, e.g. a plant operating condition diagnosis. Thus, we propose a method that selects process signals to optimise the performance of a diagnostic machine for a plant using factor analysis and decision-tree analysis. A feature of our optimisation method is that it accounts for combinations of process signals. Further, an advantage of our method is that the time to create an optimised diagnostic machine is short. The diagnostic machines need to be updated in a limited period, e.g. plant equipment repair, which changes regular process values. Another advantage is that our method can be applied to various learning machines to improve performance. This advantage allows the designer of the diagnostic system to use the best machine-learning method on each diagnostic machine. This paper reports our methodology, our proposed method, and the experimental results where a diagnostic machine was improved by 5.3% to 98.8% from 93.5% abnormality detection accuracy when our method which implemented a support vector machine was applied to the diagnostic machine to detect the blockage of a pipe in the desulfurisation process in a chemical plant simulator.

In that sense, representation methods based on time series decomposition and similarity measures are combined to select representative features with physical interpretability. In this work, we introduce two similarity measures based on the cross-power spectral density to select representative intrinsic mode functions (IMF) that characterize the time series. The IMFs are obtained by Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition because it deals with non-stationary dynamics present into time series. The proposed similarity measures are an extension of the correlation coefficient and are validate using vibration signals acquired in a test rig under three different machine states (undamaged, unbalance and misalignment). Results show that the proposed measures improve the interpretability in terms of association between an IMF and a fault state, preserving a high classification rate.

The conventional vibration techniques currently being used in the industry are however not able to effectively identify nonlinear or complex signals due to, for example, rotor-to-stator rub. This paper reports on the application of the largest Lyapunov Exponent lambda(1) to diagnose the severity of rotor-to-stator rub in rotating machinery. The method of time delay was employed to reconstruct the vibration signal obtained from numerical simulation of a Jeffcott rotor subjected to rotor-to-stator rub. Numerical results show clear correlation between the increase of rub severity with the invariant quantity lambda(1) investigated in this work. Two different algorithms for the computation of lambda(1) were employed in this research, namely the Wolf algorithm and the Rosenstein algorithm.

In particular it is interested in performing fault detection and isolation (FDI) of incipient faults affecting the measurements of the three-phase signals (currents) in a controlled DFIG and PMSG. Although different authors have dealt with FDI for sensors in induction machines and in DFIGs, most of them rely on the machine model with constant parameters. However, the parameter uncertainties due to changes in the operating conditions will produce degradation in the performance of such FDI systems. The robust techniques to detect faults are exist but there is a need of extra sensor. This paper proposed a systematic methodology for the design of sensor FDI systems with the following characteristics: i) capable of detecting and isolating incipient additive (bias) faults, ii) robust against changes in the references/disturbances affecting the controlled DFIG and PMSG as well as modeling/parametric uncertainties, iii) residual generation system based on a multi-observer strategy to enhance the isolation process, The designed sensor FDI systems have been validated using measured voltages, as well as simulated data from a controlled DFIG. First the state space models of DFIG and PMSM explained followed by kalman filter introduction and current sensor fault detection using a bank of kalman filter named dedicated Observer Scheme and generalized Observer scheme to detect simultaneous and multiple faults was theorized and simulated using MATLAB simulation tool. The simulation results were summarized with and without Sensor fault. (C) 2014 R. Saravanakumar. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithms to obtain the proposed entropy-based parameters are described and test data is used in order to assess their sensitivity. A vibration test bench is used for measuring the levels of vibration while artificially inducing damage. The deviation of the two entropy-based parameters is compared in two states of the vibration test bench: not damaged and damaged. At the end of the study, their sensitivity is compared to Shannon Entropic Index.

Multi-domain System Models Integration for Faults Detection in Induction Motor Drives	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRO/INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (EIT)	International Conference on Electro Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology (EIT)	JUN 05-07, 2014	Milwaukee, WI	IEEE		PWM inverter; induction motor; FEA co-simulation; faults detection; engineering education		The power electronic converters, electric machines, and mechanical loads are key parts of the electric drives systems, and these components are usually modeled and analyzed using specific simulation tools. The overall performances of the electric drives are influenced by system's interconnected components. One solution, to investigate the interaction between different parts of these multi-domain systems, is to integrate them into only one simulation environment. This paper presents the development of two integrated models of a three-phase induction motor (IM) drive: one, based on d-q machine model using MATLAB/Simulink-Simscape, the second being based on finite element analysis (FEA) motor model using ANSYS Simplorer/Maxwell software. The goal is to analyze the system models capabilities to simulate the faults detection caused by failures of different drive's components. The motor current signature analysis is used, in this paper, for monitoring the operation of the IM fed through a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) power inverter. Finally, two case studies are presented, one illustrating the effects of a faulty device of the PWM inverter, and the second case demonstrating the influence of the IM's stator fault. Another objective of this study is to provide users a convenient way of instruction in the area of faults detection and power quality of alternating current (ac) machines and drives.

Although such multivariate methods can capture complex relationships in the data, traditional approaches provide irregular (l(2) penalty) or scattered (l(1) penalty) predictive pattern with a very limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes any combination of l(1), l(2), and TV penalties while preserving the exact l(1) penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or penalties. The algorithm is applied on a classification problem on the ADNI dataset. We observe that the TV penalty does not necessarily improve the prediction but provides a major breakthrough in terms of support recovery of the predictive brain regions.

Firstly, statistic filter is used to extract the feature signals of pump faults from the measured vibration signals across an optimum frequency region, and nondimensional symptom parameters (NSPs) are defined to represent the feature signals for distinguishing fault types. Secondly, the optimal classification hyperplane for distinguishing two states is obtained by SVM and NSPs, and its function is defined as synthetic symptom parameter (SSP) in order to increase the diagnosis' sensitivity. Finally, the possibility functions of the SSP are used to construct a sequential fuzzy diagnosis for fault detection and fault-type identification by possibility theory and DST. The proposed method has been applied to detect the faults of the centrifugal pump, and the efficiency of the method has been verified using practical examples.

A test is set-up with two different sensors, MEMS and PVDF-Foil based. Experimental data is presented and a test to detect undamaged and damaged bearings has been performed. The MEMS sensor shows a good performance with clear indication of failure frequencies. The PVDF Foil in this configuration also shows the ability to detect the difference, but the natural properties leading to mechanical amplification of bearing vibrations are limiting the performances for weak mechanical failures. Monitoring algorithms are employed under standard conditions: RMS value of the signal, Kurtosis, Power spectrum density and Envelope analysis.

Faults are usually classified in two groups as mechanical and electrical faults. Bearing failures that consists more than half of mechanical faults can be recognized by applying high magnitude, short-time frequency bursts to supply sources. Methods like (short-time) Fourier, (continuous-discrete) Wavelet, and Park transforms are among the most common strategies for fault detection. The deficit that these methods usually face is usually related to the fact that either these methods cannot derive non-stationary behavior of fault; whereas most of bearing faults are non-stationary and low energy signals. In the proposed method, a new approach has been offered that consists of decomposing the frequency spectrum of output stator current signal into several levels. Considering this matter that faults have non-certain behavior, it seems necessary to model this non-deterministic behavior. Monte-Carlo model is a strong approach toward deterministic modeling. In this paper, the fault probabilistic behavior has been modeled using this approach.

These instances are based upon a prognosis of the remaining useful lifetime of the components investigated but their usability is limited because of insufficient failure time data. Therefore the paper at hand deals with the integration of expert knowledge into lifetime estimation methods to enhance the prediction result. A model has been developed and simulated. Furthermore a parameter study analyzes the model's effectiveness, which produces promising results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a state-based prognostic method using state duration information to predict the fatigue life or fatigue crack growth in structures. The process of implementing the proposed prognostics algorithm consists of the following two stages: The first stage is identifying the health state of the system, while the second stage is calculating the expected RUL. The presented prognostic method is applied on the Virkler fatigue crack growth dataset and results show that the method efficiently predicts the remaining useful life of aluminium test specimens under constant amplitude fatigue load cycles.

The approach adopted here is based on conversion of the traditionally adopted logic hardware design into generic look-up table (LUT) format. Instead of relying upon bespoke hardware mitigation strategies such as triple modular redundancy, our approach relies upon well-established data error detection and correction (EDC) codes that are ideally suited to protecting LUTs. This 'memory-mapping' of logic brings self-healing capabilities that can be applied to a wide variety of FSMs. We illustrate our method by mapping a generic automotive used fuel pump controller (FPC) design to LUT format. Built-in repair is and fault monitoring are both considered to be extremely important embedded control applications and we therefore discuss significant benefits that can be brought by incorporating self-healing capability to the underlying hardware. We demonstrate the design principles of our approach verify the state-based behavior of the resulting FSM. We further discuss the how content addressable memory (CAM) can be used to achieve efficient address mapping. In order to protect against address errors occurring at the input, a two-stage LUT implementation is used that removes errors occurring in the input data stream as well as protection of the state mapping itself (C) 2014 Published by Elsever B.V.

They usually get access to information and knowledge by using information systems (nondestructive testing (NDT) or condition monitoring.), local databases, e-resources or traditional print media. Basically it can be assumed that, the amount of available information affects the quality of maintenance decision making and acting positively. Machine health information retrieval is the application of information retrieval concepts and techniques to the operation and maintenance domain. Retrieving Contextual information, describing the operational conditions for the machine, is a subarea of information retrieval that incorporates context features in the search process towards its improvement.. Both areas have been gaining interest from the research community in order to perform more accurate prognostics according to specific scenarios and happening circumstances. Context is a broad term and in this paper the operational conditions and the way the machine has been used is seen as the context and is represented by operational data collected over time. This paper intends to investigate the effects of the interaction of context features on machine tools health information. This interaction between context and health assessment is bidirectional in the sense that health information seeking behavior can also be used to predict context features that can be used, without disturbing the operational environment and creating production disruptions. The extraction of multiple features from multiple sensors, already deployed in this type of machinery, may constitute snapshots of the current health of certain machine components. The mutation status (the way they have changed) of these snapshots, hereafter called Fingerprints, has been proposed as prognostic marker in machine tools problems. Of them, in this work so far only the spindle fingerprint mutation has been validated independently as prognostic for overall survival and survival after relapse, while the prognostic value of rest of components mutation is still under validation. In this scenario, the prognostic value of spindle fingerprint mutations can be investigated in various contexts defined by stratifications of the machine population.

This method is achieved by optimizing an objective function that includes two steps. First, this objective function works well in denoising where signals need to be reconstructed. Second, another objective function is added to the sparse coding framework, the discrimination power of the Fisher discriminative methods with the reconstruction property, and the sparsity of the sparse representation that can deal with the fault signal which is corrupted. Finally, the feature is extracted. In rolling bearing fault classification experiments, the new method improves the accuracy of classification.

TES improves support services by providing prognosis of run-to-failure and time-to-failure on-demand data for better decision making. The concept of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is utilised to predict life-span of components (of a service system) with the purpose of minimising catastrophic failure events in both manufacturing and service sectors. The purpose of this paper is to identify failure mechanisms and emphasise the failure events prediction approaches that can effectively reduce uncertainties. It will demonstrate the classification of techniques used in RUL prediction for optimisation of products' future use based on current products in-service with regards to predictability, availability and reliability. It presents a mapping of degradation mechanisms against techniques for knowledge acquisition with the objective of presenting to designers and manufacturers ways to improve the life-span of components.

It is difficult to carry out the multiple incipient faults prognosis for the CCBII braking system using the traditional faults prognosis techniques. In this article, a model-based fault prognosis approach is used for CCBII braking system with multiple incipient faults. Firstly, the models of the working modes are established, the latest concept of Augmented Global Analytical Redundancy Relations (AGARRs) is used to consider parametric and nonparametric incipient fault prediction. Before the faults are detected, mode tracking is realized by comparing Mode-change Signature Matrix (MCSM) with the coherence vector. Once the mode tracking fails, the fault hypothesis set, including suspected faults and suspected mode change, is established correspondingly. The degradation behavior of incipient fault is unknown in advanced and the unknown degradation characteristics of each incipient fault can be predicted with some matching dynamic models. Furthermore, the degradation models and incipient faults are identified using a mixed differential evolution (MDE) algorithm. The real-time online faults prognosis of CCBII braking system is realized. Finally, simulation tests validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

The reliability of an induction motor is of great Importance in industrial as well as commercial, aerospace and military applications. in This paper two kinds of induction motor faults, stator short circuit and broken rotor bar fault, are investigated. The model used is the one developed by [14]. The proposed strategy consists in developing an observer based on mu analysis Control theory, characterized by robustness against model mismatches and disturbances, followed by a sliding mode estimator. The performance index, the parameter that permit to differentiate between faults and disturbances or noise, for the mu observer followed by the sliding mode estimator is amplitude and frequency. Simulations with nonlinear Machine model were carried out which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, mu analysis observer and sliding estimator exhibited robustness against unmodeled dynamics simulated by multiplicative uncertainty and significant rejection of disturbances and noise-effects attenuation which make the proposed strategy adequately close to the conditions of the real physical system.

J	Milosevic, M; Jankovic, D; Peulic, A				Milosevic, Marina; Jankovic, Dragan; Peulic, Aleksandar			Segmentation for the enhancement of microcalcifications in digital mammograms	TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE			English	Article						Mammography; microcalcifications detection; Discrete Wavelet Transformation; Sobel operator; cross-validation	CLUSTERED MICROCALCIFICATIONS; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION	Microcalcification clusters appear as groups of small, bright particles with arbitrary shapes on mammographic images. They are the earliest sign of breast carcinomas and their detection is the key for improving breast cancer prognosis. But due to the low contrast of microcalcifications and same properties as noise, it is difficult to detect microcalcification. This work is devoted to developing a system for the detection of microcalcification in digital mammograms. After removing noise from mammogram using the Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), we first selected the region of interest (ROI) in order to demarcate the breast region on a mammogram. Segmenting region of interest represents one of the most important stages of mammogram processing procedure. The proposed segmentation method is based on a filtering using the Sobel filter. This process will identify the significant pixels, that belong to edges of microcalcifications. Microcalcifications were detected by increasing the contrast of the images obtained by applying Sobel operator. In order to confirm the effectiveness of this microcalcification segmentation method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighborhood (k-NN) algorithm are employed for the classification task using cross-validation technique.

The sensor performance is assessed in a series of experiments on a laboratory test rig comprising a 30kW induction machine operating under steady state and variable speed regimes. Vibration measurements are investigated in the frequency domain for generator fault specific electromagnetically induced vibration components. The fiber optic sensor effectiveness in detection of wide band spectral effects (<1kHz) in the vibration signal is compared with that of a commercial piezoelectric based solution. The potential and limitations of the prototype wide band FBG accelerometer are evaluated for use in vibration monitoring applications.

These bolted joint, especially in important places, are main object of maintenance inspection. Maintenance inspection with human-involvement is desired to be improved owing to time-consuming, labor-intensive and high-cost. By remote and full automation monitoring of the bolt loosening, constantly monitoring of bolted joint is achieved. In order to detect loosening of bolted joints without human-involvement, applying a structural health monitoring technique and smart structures/materials concept is the key objective. In this study, a new method of bolt loosening detection by adopting a smart washer has been proposed, and the basic detection principle was discussed with numerical analysis about frequency equation of the system, was confirmed experimentally. The smart washer used in this study is in cantilever type with piezoelectric material, which adds the washer the self-sensing and actuation function. The principle used to detect the loosening of the bolts is a method of a bolt loosening detection noted that the natural frequency of a smart washer system is decreasing by the change of the bolt tightening axial tension. The feature of this proposed method is achieving to identify the natural frequency at current condition on demand by adopting the self-sensing and actuation function and system identification algorithm for varying the natural frequency depending the bolt tightening axial tension. A novel bolt loosening detection method by adopting adaptive observer is proposed in this paper. The numerical simulations are performed to verify the possibility of the adaptive observer-based loosening detection. Improvement of the detection accuracy for a bolt loosening is confirmed by adopting initial parameter and variable adaptive gain by numerical simulation.

The current spectrum of a three phases and single phase induction motor and also of a DC motor, are analyzed in order to achieve information for the detection of different faults. In order to perform the diagnosis we analyzed signals of current from the ampere sensor. The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to the signals acquired. We observe significant current spectrum differences between healthy motors and motors with faults. The high-frequency spectral analysis of current provides a method to detect bearing faults, broken rotor bars faults and commutator short circuit and presence of a displaced permanent magnet out of poles in polar axe. The system developed is scalable to different power ratings and it has been successfully tested with data from 0.75kW three phases induction motor, 0.65kW single phase induction motor and DC motor with permanent magnet.

This paper presents a novel scheme for the protection of power transformers utilizing Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) and Smooth Supported Vector Machine (SSVM). Some important characteristics of differential currents are extracted based on MRA. The combination of MRA and SSVM is proposed as an effective and fast technique for discrimination of the faulted and unfaulted conditions. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to obtain optimal values of adjustable parameters of the applied classifier. The efficacy of the proposed scheme has been tested using numerous inrush and internal fault currents. The results confirm that the combined MRA-SSVM scheme yields high detection accuracy even in the noisy conditions.

The use of Mahalanobis Spaces (MS) allows the algorithm to identify characteristics of sensor signals to identify behaviors in machines. MTS is extremely powerful with the caveat that the correct variables are selected to form the MS. In this research work, 56 sensors monitor various aspects of the vehicles. Typically, using the MTS process, identification of useful variables is preceded by validation of the measurements scale. However, the MTS approach doesn't directly include any mitigating steps should the measurement scale not be validated. Existing work has performed outlier removal in construction of the MS, which can lead to better validation. In our approach, we modify the outlier removal process with more liberal definitions of outliers to better identify variables' impact prior to identification of useful variables. This subtle change substantially lowered the false positive rate due to the fact that additional variables were retained. Traditional MTS approaches identify useful variables only to the extent they provide usefulness in identifying the positive (abnormal) condition. The impact of removing false negatives is not included. Initial results show our approach can reduce false positive values while still maintaining complete fault identification for this vehicle data set.

Finite element model based on a real machine is constructed, propagation of broken rotor bar fault and its influence on the magnetic flux density distribution of the machine cage is observed. As the propagation of the fault will result in total breakdown of the induction machine rotor, if the fault is not detected and solved, necessity of condition monitoring is pointed out. Analysis of the fault and its affect to the magnetic field in the rotor cage as well as changes in the phase voltage spectrum are presented.

Risk identification of agricultural drought for sustainable Agroecosystems	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							VEGETATION INDEX; TEMPERATURE	Drought is considered as one of the major natural hazards with a significant impact on agriculture, environment, society and economy. Droughts affect sustainability of agriculture and may result in environmental degradation of a region, which is one of the factors contributing to the vulnerability of agriculture. This paper addresses agrometeorological or agricultural drought within the risk management framework. Risk management consists of risk assessment, as well as a feedback on the adopted risk reduction measures. And risk assessment comprises three distinct steps, namely risk identification, risk estimation and risk evaluation. This paper deals with risk identification of agricultural drought, which involves drought quantification and monitoring, as well as statistical inference. For the quantitative assessment of agricultural drought, as well as the computation of spatiotemporal features, one of the most reliable and widely used indices is applied, namely the vegetation health index (VHI). The computation of VHI is based on satellite data of temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The spatiotemporal features of drought, which are extracted from VHI, are areal extent, onset and end time, duration and severity. In this paper, a 20-year (1981-2001) time series of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/advanced very high resolution radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) satellite data is used, where monthly images of VHI are extracted. Application is implemented in Thessaly, which is the major agricultural drought-prone region of Greece, characterized by vulnerable agriculture. The results show that agricultural drought appears every year during the warm season in the region. The severity of drought is increasing from mild to extreme throughout the warm season, with peaks appearing in the summer. Similarly, the areal extent of drought is also increasing during the warm season, whereas the number of extreme drought pixels is much less than those of mild to moderate drought throughout the warm season. Finally, the areas with diachronic drought persistence can be located. Drought early warning is developed using empirical functional relationships of severity and areal extent. In particular, two second-order polynomials are fitted, one for low and the other for high severity drought classes, respectively. The two fitted curves offer a forecasting tool on a monthly basis from May to October. The results of this drought risk identification effort are considered quite satisfactory offering a prognostic potential. The adopted remote-sensing data and methods have proven very effective in delineating spatial variability and features in drought quantification and monitoring.	[Dalezios, N.

However, the problem of enormous parameters and multiple faults makes a challenge to the satellite fault diagnosis. The interactions between parameters and misclassifications from multiple faults will increase the false alarm rate and the false negative rate. On the other hand, for each satellite fault, there is not enough fault data for training. To most of the classification algorithms, it will degrade the performance of model. In this paper, we proposed an improving SVM based on a hybrid voting mechanism (HVM-SVM) to deal with the problem of enormous parameters, multiple faults, and small samples. Many experimental results show that the accuracy of fault diagnosis using HVM-SVM is improved.

We used the NCI-60 panel, which consists of nine different cancer types, as the platform to train our model. Important radiation therapy (RT) related genes were selected by significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). Orthogonal latent variables (LVs) were then extracted by the partial least squares (PLS) method as the new compressive input variables. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) regression model was trained with these LVs to predict the SF2 (the surviving fraction of cells after a radiation dose of 2Gy gamma-ray) values of the cell lines. Comparison with the published results showed significant improvement of the new method in various ways: (a) reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) of the radiation sensitivity prediction model from 0.20 to 0.011; and (b) improving prediction accuracy from 62% to 91%. To test the predictive performance of the gene signature, three different types of cancer patient datasets were used. Survival analysis across these different types of cancer patients strongly confirmed the clinical potential utility of the signature genes as a general prognosis platform. The gene regulatory network analysis identified six hub genes that are involved in canonical cancer pathways.

Among these disturbances, voltage sag, due to its irrecoverable economic effects on industries, is particularly important. In this paper, the detection and classification of voltage sag sources containing motor starting, short circuit, transformer energizing, and the reacceleration of motors after fault clearance using the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and support vector machine (SVM) are studied. A voltage sag waveform includes several oscillating modes; for separating these oscillating modes, which are called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), empirical mode decomposition is used. Next, by applying the HHT to these IMFs, some required features of each IMF are extracted. Finally, these features are given to the SVM for classification. The results of this classification method as compared with other methods show the high efficiency of the proposed method.

It is employed to update the nonlinear prediction model for forecasting system states. In this work, we applied PF techniques to Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) prognostics for estimating remaining useful cycle to effectively perform APU health management. After introducing the PF-based prognostic method and algorithms, the paper presents the implementation for APU Starter prognostics along with the experimental results. The results demonstrated that the developed PF-based method is useful for estimating remaining useful cycle for a given failure of a component or a subsystem.

Scheduled stoppages for preventive maintenance are effective, since qualified personnel and replacement parts are available and ready. On the other hand, shutting down a turbo machine ceases petroleum production. Not rarely, maintenance people conclude the machine could have worked much longer. Monitoring the machines' behaviors to predict the best time to stop has been an industry trend. Failure prognosis has been performed using statistical methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems and Expert Systems. This study presents the results obtained by developing an expert system based on case-based reasoning for turbomachinery failure prognostics.

First, the optimal parameters of LSSVM are obtained by GA with global search capability and the diagnosis model of the optimized LSSVM is established, then the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is introduced to decompose the fault signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF), and finally we will extract the approximate entropy of each IMF as the fault feature which will be applied to test the performance of the diagnosis model. Simulation results have proved that the proposed diagnosis method is feasible to recognize each fault and has achieved higher precision.

Considering UAV as a mission critical system, it is expected and required to accomplish its operational objectives with minimal unscheduled interruptions. So that, it does make sense for UAV to take advantage of those techniques as enablers for the readiness of multi-UAV. The main goal of this paper is to apply information from a PHM system to support decision making through an IVHM framework. PHM system information, in this case, comprises UAV remaining useful life (RUL) estimations. UAV RUL is computed by means of a fault tree analysis that it is fed by a distribution function from a probability density function relating time and failure probability for each UAV critical components. The IVHM framework, in this case, it is the task assignment based on UAV health condition (RUL information) using the Receding Horizon Task Assignment (RHTA) algorithm. The study case was developed considering a team of electrical small UAVs and pitch control system was chosen as the critical system.

As a consequence, there is increasing pressure to develop comprehensive post-silicon test and debug tools that can be used to identify design bugs and improve modeling of complex electrical nonidealities observed in silicon. Often, it is not known a-priori what these bugs are and how they can be modeled, significantly complicating the debug process. In this research, a new atomic model learning approach is proposed that uses supervised learning techniques to diagnose design bugs and learn unknown module-level behaviors. Nonideality modeling artifacts called model atoms are inserted into different nodes of the design signal flow paths to learn unknown behaviors along those paths. Under the assumption that the design bug is localized, it is shown that the source of the bug can be identified with high resolution even when the nature of the bug is unknown. The method has been applied to a conventional wireless as well as a polar radio transmitter and key results that demonstrate usefulness and feasibility of the proposed approach are presented.

The proposed technique is experimentally validated. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach is based on a combined use of frequency sliding and wavelet transform analysis, to isolate the contribution of the rotor fault components issued from vibration signals in a single frequency band. Findings - The proposed technique is reliable for tracking the rotor fault components over time-frequency domain. The quantitative analysis results based on this technique are the proof of its robustness. Research limitations/implications - The validity of the proposed diagnosis approach is not limited to the analysis under steady-state operating conditions, but also for time-varying conditions where rotor fault components are spread in a wide frequency range. Practical implications - The developed approach is best suited for automotive or high power traction systems, in which safe-operating and availability are mandatory. Originality/value - The paper presents a diagnosis technique for rotor broken bar in double cage induction motor base on advanced use of wavelet transform which allows the extraction of the most relevant rotor fault component issued from axial vibration signal and clamping it in a single frequency bandwidth, avoiding confusions with other components and false interpretations.

In this paper, a new spacecraft software system reliability definition is given and a new reliability prognostics-oriented life cycle integrated system health management for a spacecraft software system is focused on. Adaptive genetic algorithms are then combined with a support vector machine to build an adaptive genetic algorithm support vector machine reliability prediction model. This model attempts to overcome the genetic algorithm weaknesses, such as the local minima and premature convergence problems, and solves the parameter selection difficulties often encountered in a support vector machine. After construction, the proposed adaptive genetic algorithm support vector machine model is employed to predict the reliability of a spacecraft software system. Finally, a numerical example is given to show how the proposed approach has a superior prediction performance compared to a standard support vector machine and artificial neural network.

So the fault often occurs in these two parts. In this article, we adopt FAM (Fuzzy Associative Memory) neural network to realize compressor fault diagnosis. This model implements intelligent fault diagnosis and self-learning of the knowledge database. Thus it significantly improves the accuracy and scalability of fault diagnosis system of the reciprocating compressor. The system has been adopted in experiment. In addition, the fault diagnosis system is based on Visual Studio 2008.

Processing technical polymers like PA, ABS or PBT possible influences are residual moisture conditions of the material or minor variations of raw material charges. Small changes in the material properties are difficult to detect at first quality controls and can be within the property tolerances. But even these small differences cause defects. The effects range from viscosity variations to varied crystalline properties. The influence of material properties on the processing have to be detected inline and combined with material analysis to a quality prognosis. The equipped sensors at injection molding machines enable an adequate process performance. The recently available solutions for power consumption monitoring enhance the available process control opportunities. Because of the high process speed of injection molding machines, the required sampling rate has to be minimal 500 Hz. A setup of high bandwidth data processing linked to the machine control enables precise characterization of the production. Identified index numbers, energetic data and characteristic development of measured process figures enable a high resolution detection of material induced variations. This prognosis enables inline classification of the produced parts and a compensation by correlating quality requirements with adjusted filling and packing parameters.

The main neural network structures used as neural controllers are presented and classified into two groups: off-line and on-line trained controllers. From the point of view of drive system uncertainties, caused by simplifying assumptions under mathematical model formulation, errors in drive parameters identification and changes of the models and their parameters under different operation conditions, on-line adaptive neural controllers are proposed. Various neural structures and their on-line training methods are discussed. The chosen neurocontrollers were verified in simulation and experimental tests for converter-fed drives with rigid and resilient mechanical connections between the driving motor and loading machine.

Piezoelectric film AE sensor has a potential to monitor the growth of fatigue crack, which can be used for fatigue remaining useful life prognosis. Piezoelectric film AE sensor using flexible piezoelectric paint conforms well to curved surface because of its flexibility - making it very promising for use on tubular steel structures, for which conventional sensors are ill equipped to do. This study explores the use of piezoelectric paint film AE sensor for continuous monitoring of fatigue crack growth in welded tubular joints.

In this study, the efficiency of two data-driven techniques, Moving Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) and Robust Regression Analysis (RRA), are investigated for fault detection in mechanical components of a movable bridge. These two algorithms are improved and modified in order to be effective for long term monitoring of mechanical components. Another unique aspect of this study is that some of the critical and common damages are induced on machinery components in real life and the data are collected under both baseline and damage conditions. The simulated damage scenarios include extracting oil from gearbox as well as removing bolts from rack and pinion. The damage detectability of MPCA and RRA are tested with the data from a real-life structure. As a result, the outcomes of this study revealed that the modified MPCA and modified RRA algorithms are both effective for fault detection and diagnosis of changes in mechanical components of the movable bridge.

J	Wang, WB				Wang, Wenbin			A scheduling model for systems with task and health dependent remaining useful life prognostics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						scheduling; maintenance; remaining useful life; prognostics; inspection	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; SINGLE-MACHINE; PROCESSING TIMES	When we schedule a system to perform a task, a factor that should be taken into account is the remaining useful life prognostics of the system. This prognostics of the system may depend not only on the health state of the system, but also on the characteristics of the task to be performed. Assuming such prognostics is available at the time of system scheduling, the problem is to find a method to schedule the system, which can improve the expected profit rate. Two system life models were proposed for the case considered in this paper. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, a global optimal policy is hard to find, we proposed an approach based on the approximated expected profit rate to schedule the systems. The approach is validated through simulations compared with a number of other task scheduling rules to show the advantage of the proposed approach. We also find the optimal global stationary result by exhaustive search of small scheduling problems of few systems and tasks to compare with the proposed approximate one. Further numerical analyses are presented to demonstrate the process of determining a decision variable and the sensitivity analysis in terms of a cost parameter.

J	Aydin, I; Karakose, M; Akin, E				Aydin, Ilhan; Karakose, Mehmet; Akin, Erhan			A New Contactless Fault Diagnosis Approach for Pantograph-Catenary System Using Pattern Recognition and Image Processing Methods	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING			English	Article						Pantograph; catenary; arcing faults; edge detection; Hough transform; fault diagnosis; railways	ELECTRIFIED RAILWAYS-MECHANISM; VISION	Comfort and safety of railway transport has become more important as train speeds continue to increase. In electrified railways, the electrical current of the train is produced by the sliding contact between the pantograph and catenary. The quality of the current depends on the reliability of contact between the pantograph and catenary. So, pantograph inspection is very important task in electrified railways and it is periodically made for preventing dangerous situations. This inspection is operated manually by taking the pantograph to the service for visual anomalies. However, this monitoring is impractical because of time consuming and slowness, as locomotive remains disabled. An innovative method based on image processing and pattern recognition is proposed in this paper for online monitoring of the catenary-pantograph interaction. The images are acquired from a digital line-scan camera. Data are simultaneously processed according to edge detection and Hough transform, and then the obtained features are provided to a D-Markov based state machine, and the pantograph related faults, such as overheating of the pantograph strip, bursts of arcing, and irregular positioning of the contact line are diagnosed. The proposed method is verified by real faulty and healthy pantograph videos.

They are key factors for implementing fault diagnosis and prognosis. This has driven the need in research for extracting good features. This paper used a new method, Narrowband Interference Cancellation, to suppress the narrow band component and enhance the impulsive component enabling the gear fault detection easier. This method can improve the signal to noise ratio of impulse train associated with the gear fault frequency. A run-to-failure test is used to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. Based on the time synchronous signal of high speed shaft, Sideband Index is extracted from the signals processed by Narrowband Interference Cancellation. This feature has good degradation trend than traditional Sideband Index extracted from the time synchronous average signal directly. Comparison of features based on different extraction process proves the effectiveness of developed method.

This means, that the machine will understand the two faults in the same way which makes the SRM faults detection and diagnosis a more challenging task. This paper presents a diagnosis method based on pattern recognition analysis to detect and to classify automatically the electrical faults, short-and open-circuit under any level of load of the studied system: redundant three-phase power converter fed 6/4 SRM. The phases making a pattern recognition diagnosis of SRM, the training and the decision. The training phase consists in determining the pattern vector and the optimal kernels design (the separating classes) by Time-Frequency Representation (TFR). The training data is carried out using a set of fault scenarios, between healthy, single and combined faults, in terms of torque measurement at different load level, in order to deduce the fault severity. The second phase, consists in associating an unknown pattern with one of the defined classes, according to the "k-nearest neighbors" (knn) decision rule, associated with Kalman estimator to tracking of various operating modes and to predict the evolution of the call out of the knowledge database for a given operating mode in order to realize a preventive maintenance. The experimental results prove the efficiency of pattern recognition methods in condition monitoring of reluctance machine.

J	Bustillo, A; Rodriguez, JJ				Bustillo, Andres; Rodriguez, Juan J.			Online breakage detection of multitooth tools using classifier ensembles for imbalanced data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article						industrial applications; breakage detection; multitooth tools; classifier ensembles; imbalanced data	FAULT-DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE	Cutting tool breakage detection is an important task, due to its economic impact on mass production lines in the automobile industry. This task presents a central limitation: real data-sets are extremely imbalanced because breakage occurs in very few cases compared with normal operation of the cutting process. In this paper, we present an analysis of different data-mining techniques applied to the detection of insert breakage in multitooth tools. The analysis applies only one experimental variable: the electrical power consumption of the tool drive. This restriction profiles real industrial conditions more accurately than other physical variables, such as acoustic or vibration signals, which are not so easily measured. Many efforts have been made to design a method that is able to identify breakages with a high degree of reliability within a short period of time. The solution is based on classifier ensembles for imbalanced data-sets. Classifier ensembles are combinations of classifiers, which in many situations are more accurate than individual classifiers. Six different base classifiers are tested: Decision Trees, Rules, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbour, Multilayer Perceptrons and Logistic Regression. Three different balancing strategies are tested with each of the classifier ensembles and compared to their performance with the original data-set: Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), undersampling and a combination of SMOTE and undersampling. To identify the most suitable data-mining solution, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) graph and Recall-precision graph are generated and discussed. The performance of logistic regression ensembles on the balanced data-set using the combination of SMOTE and undersampling turned out to be the most suitable technique. Finally a comparison using industrial performance measures is presented, which concludes that this technique is also more suited to this industrial problem than the other techniques presented in the bibliography.

J	Sun, H; Li, K; Wang, HQ; Chen, P; Cao, Y				Sun, Hao; Li, Ke; Wang, Huaqing; Chen, Peng; Cao, Yi			Intelligent Mechanical Fault Diagnosis Based on Multiwavelet Adaptive Threshold Denoising and MPSO	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; WAVELET; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	The condition diagnosis of rotating machinery depends largely on the feature analysis of vibration signals measured for the condition diagnosis. However, the signals measured from rotating machinery usually are nonstationary and nonlinear and contain noise. The useful fault features are hidden in the heavy background noise. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on multiwavelet adaptive threshold denoising and mutation particle swarm optimization (MPSO) is proposed. Geronimo, Hardin, and Massopust (GHM) multiwavelet is employed for extracting weak fault features under background noise, and the method of adaptively selecting appropriate threshold for multiwavelet with energy ratio of multiwavelet coefficient is presented. The six nondimensional symptom parameters (SPs) in the frequency domain are defined to reflect the features of the vibration signals measured in each state. Detection index (DI) using statistical theory has been also defined to evaluate the sensitiveness of SP for condition diagnosis. MPSO algorithm with adaptive inertia weight adjustment and particle mutation is proposed for condition identification. MPSO algorithm effectively solves local optimum and premature convergence problems of conventional particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. It can provide a more accurate estimate on fault diagnosis. Practical examples of fault diagnosis for rolling element bearings are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The parameters, used in the empirical model which is based on the capacity fade trends of Li-ion batteries, are identified dependent on the tracking ability of PF. AFSA-PF aims to improve the performance of the basic PF. By driving the prior particles to the domain with high likelihood, AFSA-PF allows global optimization, prevents particle degeneracy, thereby improving particle distribution and increasing prediction accuracy and algorithm convergence. Data provided by NASA are used to verify this approach and compare it with basic PF and regularized PF. AFSA-PF is shown to be more accurate and precise.

Firstly, based on the analysis of the structure and performance of modified duffing oscillator, the end of transitional slope from chaotic area to large-scale cycle area is selected as the optimal critical threshold of duffing oscillator by bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponent. Secondly, the phase transformation duffing oscillator from chaos to intermittent chaos is sensitive to the signals, whose frequency difference is quite weak from the reference signal. The spectrums of the largest Lyapunov exponents and bifurcation diagrams of the duffing oscillator are utilized to analyze the variance in different parameters of frequency. Finally, this paper is to analyze the characteristics of both single fractal (box-counting dimension) and multifractal and make a comparison between them. Multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis is applied to detect extra frequency component of current signal.

Currently, routine maintenance at water treatment works are informed by an assessment of component condition based on time-based inspections. We propose a method for using performance data gathered by the utility for legislative purposes to inform maintenance decision-making. This model framework is grounded in the theory and methods of stochastic processes and elicitation of expert judgment, but aligned with the practicalities of the industrial decision-making context. After describing the asset to be modelled, the data available and the principles of the Hidden Markov Model developed, we illustrate an application to three water treatment works. The credibility of the modelling assumptions to accommodate the limitations of the real data are discussed.

A prognostic algorithm based on probabilistic graphical models for a periodically observable system	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE HORIZON			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Delft Univ Technol, Dutch Soc Risk Management & Reliabil Anal, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				In most industrial fields, the optimization of maintenance policies has become a key issue. To address this problem, predictive maintenance seems to be one of the most effective known approaches. It consists of driving the maintenance process anticipating the evolution of the system state. A prediction process, called "prognostic" could also be introduced and it lays on the online estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) have been proved as relevant to perform reliability analysis as they can easily represent complex systems behaviors. Based on this formalism, Graphical Duration Models (GDM) were developed by R. Donat (2009) to set all kind of sojourn time distributions for each state of the system. Unlike to some Markovian modelling that imposes exponential behavior, this approach could better model the exact degradation dynamic of real industrial systems (F. V. Jensen 2007) (J. Pearl 1985). In our study, where time and states spaces are discretized, a single component degradation whom process is assumed to be monotone increasing, is considered. The real state of the system is unknown but periodically observed by monitoring devices, characterized by their good detections rates, false alarms rates and non detection rates (summarized in a confusion matrix as a conditional probability table of the considered DBN). This paper introduces an online RUL estimation algorithm based on the use of graphical duration models. The objective is both to evaluate the RUL and to adjust it, in real time, when a new observation is available. Then, the algorithm is applied to a testcase to evaluate the quality of the RUL estimations. This paper will also provide comparative results in respect of the considered degradation model (Markovian approach vs GDM). Finally, these RUL computations, and the associated estimations of the future system behavior, might be subsequently used to optimize the maintenance strategy and the diagnosis schedule.

Data mining presents an opportunity to increase significantly the rate at which the volume of data can be turned into useful information. This paper presents an architecture designed to gather data generated in industrial units on their maintenance activities, and to forecast future failures based on data analysis. Rapid Miner is used to apply different data mining prediction algorithms to maintenance data and compare their accuracy in the discovery of patterns and predictions. The tool is integrated with an online system which collects data using automatic agents and presents all the results to the maintenance teams. The purpose of the prediction algorithms is to forecast future values based on present records, in order to estimate the possibility of a machine breakdown and therefore to support maintenance teams in planning appropriate maintenance interventions.

To cope with this, new maintenance policies like condition monitoring and prognostics are developed to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components. However, decision making based on these predictions is still an under-explored area of maintenance management. Furthermore, maintenance relies on the availability of spare parts in order to reduce failure downtime and costs. Accurate predictions of component failure times can be used to improve both maintenance and inventory decisions. During the past decades, several joint maintenance and inventory optimization systems have been studied in literature. Compared to the separate optimization of both models, these publications reported a remarkable improvement on total cost due to joint optimization. However, the inclusion of RUL in joint maintenance and inventory models for multi-component systems has not been considered before. The objective of this paper is to quantify the added value of predictive information (RUL) in joint maintenance and inventory decision making for multi-component systems considering different levels of inter-component dependence (i.e. economic, structural and stochastic). A dynamic predictive maintenance policy is developed, which optimizes both maintenance and inventory parameters while minimizing the long-term average maintenance and inventory cost per unit time.

It provides an insight into the problematic of using housekeeping information for prognosis and health monitoring. This challenge is particularly relevant in the spatial domain as it relates to operations, service removal with de-orbiting with respect to the LOS (Law on Space Operations) or the kick-off of new programs. In addition to the decision-making aspect, it relates to the diagnosis (identification of the state of the system) and prognosis (future degradation assessment and residual lifetime).

This activity becomes complex when dealing with large systems which are composed of multiple systems, subsystems and components of different technologies, different usages, etc. In order to ease diagnosis activities, this paper proposes to use a fleet-wide approach based on ontologies in order to capitalize knowledge and data to help decision makers to identify the causes of abnormal operations. In that sense, taking advantage of a fleet dimension implies to provide engineers more knowledge as well as relevant synthesis of information about the system behaviour. This paper presents a case-study concerning the occurrence of an abnormal situation for fuel engines in the marine domain to illustrate how an ontology fleet-wide software application integrated in the KASEM e-maintenance platform facilitates diagnosis activities.

These rules can be used to further understand degradation phenomena and also provide transparency and trust for any underlying prognostic technique employed. A case study is presented on a wind turbine gearbox, utilising historical supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data in conjunction with a physics of failure model. Training is performed without failure data, with the technique accurately identifying gearbox degradation and providing prognostic signatures up to 5 months before catastrophic failure occurred. A robust derivation of the Mahalanobis distance is employed to perform outlier analysis in the bivariate domain, enabling the rapid labelling of historical SCADA data on independent wind turbines. Following this, the RIPPER rule learner was utilised to extract transparent, human-readable rules from the labelled data. A mean classification accuracy of 95.98% of the autonomously derived condition was achieved on three independent test sets, with a mean kappa statistic of 93.96% reported. In total, 12 rules were extracted, with an independent domain expert providing critical analysis, two thirds of the rules were deemed to be intuitive in modelling fundamental degradation behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox.

Parameters selection is very important and decides the fault diagnosis precision. In order to overcome the blindness of man-made choice of the parameters in least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and improve the accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis, a method based on LSSVM trained by genetic algorithm was proposed. This method searches the optimized parameters in LSS'VM by taking advantage of the genetic algorithm's powerful global searching ability. The research is provided using this method on the fault diagnosis of wind turbine gearbox and compared with the diagnostic method of LSSVM. The experimental results show that the method achieves a higher diagnostic accuracy.

J	Fan, QR; Ikejo, K; Nagamura, K; Kawada, M; Hashimoto, M				Fan, Qingrong; Ikejo, Kiyotaka; Nagamura, Kazuteru; Kawada, Masato; Hashimoto, Mitsuo			Application of statistical parameters and discrete wavelet transform to gear damage diagnosis	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Gear; Damage diagnosis; Residual signal; Discrete wavelet transform; Statistical parameters	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MORLET WAVELET	Gear is one of the most commonly used and important components in machine system. Mainly gear failure may cause serious damage of the whole equipment, even huge economic losses. Therefore, it is important to detect the gear damage as early as possible. This paper provides a method of diagnosis and location for gear damage based on statistical approach and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The vibration signals of gear box and bearing box are measured as analytical data. To emphasize the failure features of the measured signal, gear motion residual signal is obtained from the raw signal and provides a better indication of the existence of failures. Additionally, the method of discrete wavelet transform is employed to reduce the noise from the residual signal and decompose the signal into several decomposition levels. Because of the good sensitivity to the altering of vibration signal, statistical parameters such as standard deviation, kurtosis and so on are extracted from the raw signal and the reconstructed signal by DWT as failure features for detecting the gear damage. For a comparison of the raw signal and the reconstructed signal, the variation of statistical parameters among different kinds of test gears is also discussed by the significance test. The validity of the presented method is testified by some experiments under different conditions. Three kinds of gears namely normal gear, spot damaged gear and pitted gear are tested on the power circulating type gear testing machine, and the vibration acceleration on both gear box and bearing box is obtained. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this method on the diagnosis of gear damage.

But the practical signals are easily polluted by noises in their transmission process. The raw signals should be processed to reduce noise and improve the quality before further analyzing. In this paper an improved wavelet threshold denosing method for vibration signal processing is proposed. Firstly, a new threshold is developed based on the VisuShrink threshold. The effect of noise standard deviation and wavelet coefficient is retained, and the correlation of wavelet decomposition scale is considered. Then, a new threshold function is defined. The new algorithm is able to overcome the discontinuity in hard threshold denoising method and reduce the distortion caused by permanent bias of wavelet coefficient in soft threshold denoising method. At last five kinds of threshold principles and three kinds of threshold functions are compared in processing the same signal, which is simulated as the mechanical vibration signal added white noises. The results show that the improved threshold is superior to the traditional threshold principles and the new threshold function is more effective than soft and hard threshold function in improving SNR and decreasing RMSE.

Designing collaborative working laboratory sessions for induction machine fault diagnosis learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						collaborative work; e-learning; electric motors; fault diagnosis; laboratory sessions	WAVELET TRANSFORM	In this paper, two laboratory sessions, specially designed to instruct students on the operational methodology of different induction motors fault diagnosis techniques, are presented and explained. The sessions are taught within the context of a subject dealing with predictive maintenance of electrical installations and machines. During the laboratory sessions, the students apply the different condition monitoring techniques, using special educational laboratory test benches built to this end. These test benches allow the students to easily capture the necessary current signals in motors with rather different constructive characteristics, operating conditions and faults. Next, the students must process the captured signals by using available software programs. While stationary current signals are analyzed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - conventional diagnosis approach - the startup current signals are processed using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) - modern transient-based diagnosis method. The laboratory sessions have been developed from a collaborative perspective, so that the students are encouraged to work in groups in the experimental part with further collective discussion on their diagnostic conclusions, all within an open framework for information sharing.

J	Fan, QR; Ikejo, K; Nagamura, K; Kawada, M; Hashimoto, M				Fan, Qingrong; Ikejo, Kiyotaka; Nagamura, Kazuteru; Kawada, Masato; Hashimoto, Mitsuo			Gear damage diagnosis and classification based on support vector machines	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MECHANICAL DESIGN SYSTEMS AND MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Gear; Damage diagnosis; Failure feature vector; Statistical parameters; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET; MODEL	The operation status of gear device can directly affect the working conditions of the whole machine system. Thus, it is crucial to detect the gear damage as early as possible to prevent the system from malfunction. This paper proposes an intelligent diagnosis method for gear damage using multiple classifiers of support vector machines with extracted failure feature vector. The vibration signal of gear box is employed as the analytical data in this paper. In order to illustrate the representative characters of gear conditions, statistical parameters and characteristic amplitude ratios of frequency bands are extracted from the vibration signals in time-domain and frequency-domain respectively, which are served as failure feature vector for the following diagnosis. Moreover, to reduce the dimensions of the failure feature vector, the technology of principal component analysis is adopted to transform the original failure feature vector into a new smaller set of variables as inputs to classifiers of support vector machines. In order to classify different types of gears, multiple classifiers of support vector machines based on the binary tree are designed. The validity of this approach is investigated by the experiment. Three kinds of gears, namely normal gear, spot damaged gear and pitted gear, are tested on the power circulating type gear testing machine. The vibration accelerations of gear box are measured as original data. Most of the samples are correctly classified by the provided method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on the application of gear damage diagnosis.

Firstly, the gathered vibration signals were decomposed by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain the corresponding intrinsic mode function (IMF). The EMD energy entropy that includes dominant fault information is defined as the characteristic features. However, the extracted features remained high-dimensional, and excessive redundant information still existed. So, the PCA is introduced to extract the characteristic features and reduce the dimension. The characteristic features are input into the MSVM to train and construct the running state identification model; the rotating machinery running state identification is realized. The running states of a bearing normal inner race and several inner races with different degree of fault were recognized; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

This paper propose to use the immune genetic algorithm to adjust the SVMR parameters and use the RMSE of the cross validation as the fitness of IGA. At last, this method was applied to modeling satellite attitude control system to detect the faults of the system. Simulation shows the high fitting precision to the system models which insures the correctness of the fault detection.

Cancer Therapy Prognosis Using Quantitative Ultrasound Spectroscopy and a Kernel-Based Metric	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 16-18, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN, Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		Personalized medicine; quantitative ultrasound; Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC); machine learning; supervised learning; kernel methods; computer aided prognosis; cancer response monitoring	APOPTOSIS; RADIOTHERAPY	In this study, a kernel-based metric based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is proposed in a computer-aided-prognosis system to monitor cancer therapy effects. In order to induce tumour cell death, sarcoma xenograft tumour-bearing mice were injected with microbubbles followed by ultrasound and X-ray radiation therapy successively as a new anti-vascular treatment. High frequency (central frequency 30 MHz) ultrasound imaging was performed before and at different times after treatment and using spectroscopy, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parametric maps were derived from the radiofrequency (RF) signals The intensity histogram of midband fit parametric maps was computed to represent the pre- and post-treatment images. Subsequently, the HSIC-based metric between pre- and post-treatment samples were computed for each animal as a measure of distance between the two distributions. The HSIC-based metrics computes the distance between two distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), meaning that by using a kernel, the input vectors are non-linearly mapped into a different, possibly high dimensional feature space. Computing the population means in this new space, enhanced group separability (compared to, e.g., Euclidean distance in the original feature space) is ideally obtained. The pre- and post-treatment parametric maps for each animal were thus represented by a dissimilarity measure, in which a high value of this metric indicated more treatment effect on the animal It was shown in this research that this metric has a high correlation with cell death and if it was used in supervised learning, a high accuracy classification was obtained using a k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifier.

However, such data appear with a huge number of examples as well as features. Aiming at class-imbalanced problem on big data, a cost-sensitive support vector machine using randomized dual coordinate descent method (CSVM-RDCD) is proposed in this paper. The solution of concerned subproblem at each iteration is derived in closed form and the computational cost is decreased through the accelerating strategy and cheap computation. The four constrained conditions of CSVM-RDCD are derived. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method increases recognition rates of positive class and reduces average misclassification costs on real big class-imbalanced data.

J	Uddin, J; Kang, M; Nguyen, DV; Kim, JM				Uddin, Jia; Kang, Myeongsu; Nguyen, Dinh V.; Kim, Jong-Myon			Reliable Fault Classification of Induction Motors Using Texture Feature Extraction and a Multiclass Support Vector Machine	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS; DECOMPOSITION; METHODOLOGY; TRANSFORM; VIBRATION; ENTROPY	This paper proposes a method for the reliable fault detection and classification of induction motors using two-dimensional (2D) texture features and a multiclass support vector machine (MCSVM). The proposed model first converts time-domain vibration signals to 2D gray images, resulting in texture patterns (or repetitive patterns), and extracts these texture features by generating the dominant neighborhood structure (DNS) map. The principal component analysis (PCA) is then used for the purpose of dimensionality reduction of the high-dimensional feature vector including the extracted texture features due to the fact that the high-dimensional feature vector can degrade classification performance, and this paper configures an effective feature vector including discriminative fault features for diagnosis. Finally, the proposed approach utilizes the one-against-all (OAA) multiclass support vector machines (MCSVMs) to identify induction motor failures. In this study, the Gaussian radial basis function kernel cooperates with OAA MCSVMs to deal with nonlinear fault features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms three state-of-the-art fault diagnosis algorithms in terms of fault classification accuracy, yielding an average classification accuracy of 100% even in noisy environments.

It can provide an early diagnosis of microdamages for preventive protection. MMM is a natural space domain signal which is weak and vulnerable to noise interference. So, it is difficult to achieve effective feature extraction of MMM signal especially under the hostile subsurface environment of high temperature, high pressure, high humidity, and multiple interfering sources. In this paper, a method of median filter preprocessing based on data preprocessing technique is proposed to eliminate the outliers point of MMM. And, based on wavelet transform (WT), the adaptive wavelet denoising method and data smoothing arithmetic are applied in testing the system of MMM. By using data preprocessing technique, the data are reserved and the noises of the signal are reduced. Therefore, the correct localization of SC zone can be achieved. In the meantime, characteristic parameters in new diagnostic approach are put forward to ensure the reliable determination of casing danger level through least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and nonlinear quantitative mapping relationship. The effectiveness and feasibility of this method are verified through experiments.

Progressive faults are usually caused by deterioration of the operating environment or aging and show stochastic properties. Many researchers have reported how to detect faults on the machine body in manufacturing systems. However, little research has been conducted on the process environment which causes progressive faults. To tackle this problem, we explored an adaptive maintenance model to detect progressive faults and repair the process environment on the E-repair location. When a difference of the environmental factor state is detected, it will combine the transcription factor and the state enzyme to locate fault source. Then the comprehensive maintenance program is derived to repair the operating environment while eliminating progressive faults. For the purpose of validation, this model was implemented on the process environment of the air separation plant. And the simulation experiments validated the feasibility and effectiveness of this method.

The improved LDB algorithm, using both the normalized energy difference and the relative entropy as quantification measures, is applied to choose the optimal set of orthogonal subspaces for wavelet packet transform- (WPT-) based signal decomposition. Then two optimal sets of orthogonal subspaces have been obtained and the energy features extracted from those subspaces appearing in both sets will be selected as input to a SVM classifier to diagnose aero-engine faults.

J	He, QB; Ding, XX; Pan, YY				He, Qingbo; Ding, Xiaoxi; Pan, Yuanyuan			Machine Fault Classification Based on Local Discriminant Bases and Locality Preserving Projections	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; DIAGNOSIS; MANIFOLD	Machine fault classification is an important task for intelligent identification of the health patterns for a mechanical system being monitored. Effective feature extraction of vibration data is very critical to reliable classification of machine faults with different types and severities. In this paper, a new method is proposed to acquire the sensitive features through a combination of local discriminant bases (LDB) and locality preserving projections (LPP). In the method, the LDB is employed to select the optimal wavelet packet (WP) nodes that exhibit high discrimination from a redundant WP library of wavelet packet transform (WPT). Considering that the obtained discriminatory features on these selected nodes characterize the class pattern in different sensitivity, the LPP is then applied to address mining inherent class pattern feature embedded in the raw features. The proposed feature extraction method combines the merits of LDB and LPP and extracts the inherent pattern structure embedded in the discriminatory feature values of samples in different classes. Therefore, the proposed feature not only considers the discriminatory features themselves but also considers the dynamic sensitive class pattern structure. The effectiveness of the proposed feature is verified by case studies on vibration data-based classification of bearing fault types and severities.

In this work, the proposed intelligent system was basically created using support vector machine (SVM) due to its excellent performance in classification task. Moreover, SVM was modified by introducing wavelet function as kernel for mapping input data into feature space. Input data were vibration signals acquired from bearings through standard data acquisition process.

However, the existence of strong background noise makes the detection of transients a basis pursuit denoising (BPD) problem, which is hard to be solved in explicit form. With sparse representation theory, this paper proposes a novel method for machinery fault diagnosis by combining the wavelet basis and majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. This method converts transients hidden in the noisy signal into sparse coefficients; thus the transients can be detected sparsely. Simulated study concerning cyclic transient signals with different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) shows that the effectiveness of this method. The comparison in the simulated study shows that the proposed method outperforms the method based on split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) in convergence and detection effect. Application in defective gearbox fault diagnosis shows the fault feature of gearbox can be sparsely and effectively detected. A further comparison between this method and the method based on SALSA shows the superiority of the proposed method in machinery fault diagnosis.

The time course of the DCE images provides measures of the contrast agent uptake kinetics. Also, using pharmacokinetic modelling, one can extract parameters from the DCE-MR images that characterize the tumor vascularization and can be used to detect cancer. A requirement for calculating the pharmacokinetic DCE parameters is estimating the Arterial Input Function (AIF). One needs an accurate segmentation of the cross section of the external femoral artery to obtain the AIF. In this work we report a semi-automatic method for segmentation of the cross section of the femoral artery, using circular Hough transform, in the sequence of DCE images. We also report a machine-learning framework to combine pharmacokinetic parameters with the model-free contrast agent uptake kinetic parameters extracted from the DCE time course into a nine-dimensional feature vector. This combination of features is used with random forest and with support vector machine classification for cancer detection. The MR data is obtained from patients prior to radical prostatectomy. After the surgery, wholemount histopathology analysis is performed and registered to the DCE-MR images as the diagnostic reference. We show that the use of a combination of pharmacokinetic parameters and the model-free empirical parameters extracted from the time course of DCE results in improved cancer detection compared to the use of each group of features separately.

K-SVD is an iterative dimensionality reduction method that optimally reduces the initial feature space by updating the dictionary columns jointly with the sparse representation coefficients. Therefore, by using K-SVD, we not only provide sparse representation of the features and condense the information in a few coefficients but also we reduce the dimensionality. The extracted K-SVD features are evaluated by a machine learning algorithm including a logistic regression classifier for the task of classifying high versus low breast cancer recurrence risk as determined by a validated gene expression assay. The features are evaluated using ROC curve analysis and leave one-out cross validation for different sparse representation and dimensionality reduction numbers. Optimal sparse representation is obtained when the number of dictionary elements is 4 (K=4) and maximum non-zero coefficients is 2 (L=2). We compare K-SVD with ANOVA based feature selection for the same prognostic features. The ROC results show that the AUC of the K-SVD based (K=4, L=2), the ANOVA based, and the original features (i.e., no dimensionality reduction) are 0.78, 0.71. and 0.68, respectively. From the results, it can be inferred that by using sparse representation of the originally extracted multi-parametric, high-dimensional data, we can condense the information on a few coefficients with the highest predictive value. In addition, the dimensionality reduction introduced by K-SVD can prevent models from over-fitting.

Variable Selection and Fault Detection Using a Hybrid Intelligent Water Drop Algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT COMPUTING FOR PROBLEM SOLVING (SOCPROS 2012)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving (SocProS)	DEC 28-30, 2012	JK Lakshmipat Univ, Jaipur, INDIA	JK Lakshmipat Univ, Inst Engn & Technol	JK Lakshmipat Univ	Fault detection; Swarm intelligence; Intelligent water drop optimization; Information gain; Support vector machines		Process fault detection concerns itself with monitoring process variables and identifying when a fault has occurred in the process workflow. Sophisticated learning algorithms may be used to select the relevant process state variables out of a massive search space and can be used to build more efficient and robust fault detection models. In this study, we present a recently proposed swarm intelligence-based hybrid intelligent water drop (IWD) optimization algorithm in combination with support vector machines and an information gain heuristic for selecting a subset of relevant fault indicators. In the process, we demonstrate the successful application and effectiveness of this swarm intelligence-based method to variable selection and fault identification. Moreover, performance testing on standard machine learning benchmark datasets also indicates its viability as a strong candidate for complex classification and prediction tasks.

Ball Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Continuous Wavelet Transforms with Modern Algebraic Function	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT COMPUTING FOR PROBLEM SOLVING (SOCPROS 2012)	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving (SocProS)	DEC 28-30, 2012	JK Lakshmipat Univ, Jaipur, INDIA	JK Lakshmipat Univ, Inst Engn & Technol	JK Lakshmipat Univ	Bearing faults; Norms; CWT		Ball bearing plays a very crucial part of any rotating machineries, and the fault diagnosis in rotating system can be detected at early states when the fault is still small. In this paper, a ball bearing fault is detected by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with modern algebraic function. The reflected vibration signals from ball bearing having single point defect on its inner race, outer race, ball fault, and combination of these faults have been considered for analysis. The features extracted from a non-stationarymulti-component ball bearing signal are very difficult. In this paper, a CWT with selected stretching parameters is used to analyze a signal in time-frequency domain and extract the features from non-stationary multicomponent signals. The algebraic function norms are calculated from the matrix which can be generated with the help of wavelet transforms. The norms lookup table is used as a reference for fault diagnosis. The experimental results show that this method is simple and robust.	[Sharma, R.; Kumar, A.; Kankar, P.

A reliable bearing health condition monitoring system is very useful in industries in early fault detection and to prevent machinery breakdown. This paper is focused on fault diagnosis of ball bearing using adaptive neuro fuzzy classifier (ANFC) and support vector machine (SVM). The vibration signals are captured and analyzed for different types of defects. The specific defects consider as inner race with spall, outer race with spall, and ball with spall. Statistical techniques are applied to calculate the features from the vibration data and comparative experimental study is carried using ANFC and SVM.

Therefore, monitoring these faults is considerably important to improve the quality of the product. In this paper, an investigation is presented to design the condition monitoring system to evaluate the surface roughness of the workpiece under effects of gradual tool wear and different types of the fixturing system. Automated Sensor and Signal Processing Selection (ASPS) approach is implemented and tested to determine the sensitivity of the sensory signals to estimate surface roughness under the variable conditions in comparison to surface roughness measurement device. The results indicate that the system is capable of detection the change and the trend in surface roughness. However, the sensitive features are found to be different based on the change in the fixturing system.

There are spectrum peaks in the lower frequency area of the vibration signals obtained from the monitored compressor set. By observing the frequencies of each shaft of the set, sorting out the feature frequencies which may stimulate probable mal-functions of low frequency vibration, then examining the characteristics of signals' spectrum charts and brushing away the irrelevant causes, it can be confirmed that the lower frequency is the beats-frequency of that set. Through statistical sampling analysis on the data from the monitored set, and making up the statistic of the comprehensive magnitude of the spectrum, the alarm thresholds of general mal-functions can be set up according to the 3 sigma rule. Fatherly, filtering out the part of low frequency from the data and calculating the comprehensive magnitudes of spectrum around the beats-frequency, the alarm thresholds of beats-frequency vibration are determined.

In this pilot study, we determined the metabolic fingerprint of urine samples from women diagnosed with CC and women not diagnosed with CC using LC (Agilent 1290 Infinity LC System) coupled with Q-TOF/MS (Agilent, 6550 iFunnel) and independent variable analysis. Urine fingerprints allowed for the discrimination of women diagnosed with CC from the control subjects. In addition, we identified a set of metabolites with a strong discriminative power, such as 3-methylhistidine, citric acid, cytosine, indoleacetic acid, salicyluric acid, L-methionine, aminomalonic acid, glutaric acid, ursodeoxycholic acid and N-acetylornithine, which are involved in key metabolic pathways such as the citrate cycle, lysine degradation, tryptophan metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, etc. Finally, we provide evidence for the implication of these compounds in metabolic routes that may be associated with the early genesis of CC, which highlights their potential use as prognostic markers for the identification of women at risk of developing CC.

The distribution of remaining useful life can be acquired by dividing each interval into several small parts and assuming the corresponding random variable obeys uniform distribution in the small range. Compared with Monte Carlo method and interval arithmetic, this approach is much more efficient, time-saving and gets more accurate predictions. An experimental investigation of fatigue life prediction of a metallic plate with a central crack is presented to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, to be applicable the approach requires the rotational speed of the machine to be constant, which imposes a limit to several applications. The object of this chapter is to introduce a new class of processes, coined time-angle periodically correlated, which extends second-order cyclostationary processes to varying regimes. Such processes are fully characterized by a time-angle autocorrelation function and its double Fourier transform, the frequency-order spectral correlation. The estimation of the latter quantity is briefly discussed and demonstrated on a real-world vibration signal captured during a run-up.

Several equipments for measurement and processing are available. Most of them offer FFT spectrum as the main tool for analysis, thus allowing the assessment of the stationary part of the signal only. Although this might be sufficient in some cases, it is certainly inappropriated in others. Recent advances in signal processing have opened the possibilities for analyzing a special type of non-stationary signals, called cyclostationary signals. It has also been shown that the behaviour of machines can be highly cyclostationary in some cases. Moreover, being stationarity a special case of cyclostarionarity, the advantages of the cyclostationary approach become evident. Still, even under consideration of these facts, the use of cyclostationarity appears to be still restricted to the scientific community, being its use in the industry far from being a reality. This chapter presents the concept of cyclostationarity, its terminology and its relation with traditional signal processing tools in a descriptive way. Two examples of real data analysis from the cyclostationary viewpoint are also presented.

It can be done in many ways, including model based approaches. One of the most known solutions for constant load/speed operations exploits autoregressive (AR) modeling of the deterministic high energy components that often mask the weak impulsive and stochastic part of the signal. After establishing the model, the residual signal is extracted and further analyzed. In the case presented here, AR modeling is considered inappropriate because of the variation of speed/load conditions. To illustrate importance of the problem and novelty of our approach, a planetary gearbox vibration will be analyzed. The gearbox operates in a bucket wheel excavator (heavy duty mining machine) subjected to cyclic load/speed variation due to the digging/excavating process. Due to periodicity of the excavation process, it seems appropriate to assume a periodic autoregressive (PAR) model for the deterministic high energy components. In the chapter several topics will be discussed: real data inspired motivation for PAR modeling, estimation details, simulations and PAR based inverse filtering for extraction of the informative stochastic part of the signal. Finally, we present some comparison of PAR and AR for modeling the deterministic high energy part.

Specific patterns in DNA copy number variations (CNVs) can be associated with certain disease types and can facilitate prognosis and progress monitoring of the disease. Machine learning techniques have been used to model the problem of tissue typing as a classification problem. Feature selection is an important part of the classification process, because many biological features are not related to the diseases and confuse the classification tasks. Multiple feature selection methods have been proposed in the different domains where classification has been applied. In this work, we will present a new feature selection method based on structured sparsity-inducing norms to identify the informative aCGH biomarkers which can help us classify different disease subtypes. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we experimentally compare it with existing feature selection methods on four publicly available aCGH data sets. In all empirical results, the proposed sparse learning based feature selection method consistently outperforms other related approaches. More important, we carefully investigate the aCGH biomarkers selected by our method, and the biological evidences in literature strongly support our results.

A sensorless rotational speed detection method and an improved dynamic structural neural network are used. Moreover, to increase the convergence speed of training, a terminal attractor method and a hybrid discriminant analysis are also adopted. The proposed method can be employed to detect the rotary frequencies of motors with varying speeds and can enhance the discrimination of motor faults. To conduct the experiments, this study used wireless sensor nodes to transmit vibration data and employed MATLAB to write codes for functional modules, including the signal processing, sensorless rotational speed estimation, neural network, and stochastic process control chart. Additionally, Visual Basic software was used to create an integrated human-machine interface. The experimental results regarding the test of equipment faults indicated that the proposed novel diagnostic system can effectively estimate rotational speeds and provide superior ability of motor fault discrimination with fast training convergence.

First, the ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) of time-varying parameter is adopted to extend signals, and thus the extended data can be smoothly connected with the original signal at the end. Second, the extended signals are processed with cosine window, so that the extended errors will exert no impact on the existing data. Finally, the signals processed as above mentioned will be decomposed with EMD to confine the end effect to the ends of the signal. The simulation and fault signal analysis prove that the proposed method can effectively reduce the impact of the end effect and be applied in rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

This kind of change of technical condition produce local disturbance according to temporal (local) change of stiffness of kinematic pair (tooth-tooth contact, rolling element-outer/inner race etc). In many practical, i.e. industrial cases, vibration signature of such change is weak in sense of produced energy, so consequently, completely masked by other vibration sources in machine. The general concept of signal processing for local damage detection is to use so called signal enhancement, i.e. a kind of tool that may improve signal to noise ratio. One may find many approaches used in the literature. Most of them use signal filtering (classical, adaptive and optimal filters), decomposition (wavelets) or extraction (blind source separation). Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is one of such techniques that can be used with signal decomposition problem. In this paper, EMD will be used for vibration signal decomposition in order to extract information about local perturbation of arm (carrier) in planetary gearbox used in heavy mining machine, i.e. bucket wheel excavator. As a result of application of EMD, one may obtain several time series with different properties of sub-signal. Due to predefined task, namely local disturbance detection, several criteria have been investigated in order to select the most informative empirical mode. First criterion was kurtosis calculated for every mode with very simple decision rule (max kurtosis is the best). It was found that such approach is not optimal due to some random impulses that are not related to damage. To improve results, it is proposed to combine envelope spectrum and kurtosis. If envelope spectrum contains family of components related to arm (carrier) shaft frequency and signal is spiky (kurtosis is high) result of EMD for given mode is optimal in sense of carried information. However, in this approach decision was made based on visual inspection of the envelope spectra of each mode, which is non-effective way. Finally two parameters have been proposed: 1) Pearson correlation coefficient of an empirical mode and the empirically determined local mean of original signal; 2) a relative power of an empirical mode.

C	Bartelmus, W		Uhl, T		Bartelmus, Walter			New focus on gearbox condition monitoring for failure prevention technology	SMART DIAGNOSTICS V	Key Engineering Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Congress of Technical Diagnostics	SEP 03-05, 2012	Krakow, POLAND	Famur, EC Test Syst, EC Syst		gearbox; condition monitoring; failure; proactive; prevention; scenario		Condition monitoring is a tool for detection of faults and failure prevention. Fault and failure are regarded as inevitable during the machine operation as the process of wear and the process of degradation. The question is, if one can influence the wear and degradation process,using condition monitoring. The paper will present technology which demonstrates that the use of the proper method can influence the wear and machine degradation process, using proper condition monitoring techniques and knowing scenarios of wear and degradation process. In the discussion presented in the paper as a prerequisite has been taken that machinery works in severe dusty environment and varying operation conditions. It has been pointed that degradation process is not just simply development of one fault. Most research for developing technology for condition monitoring is concentrated on one fault development. If one considers condition monitoring for a crack and brakeage of a tooth in gearbox, one should take in consideration that tooth crack and brakeage is the result of several events, like rolling elements bearing frictional wear, which cause secondary misalignment of shaft and gears. The frictional wear is caused by dust particles which get into oil from the environment in which a gearbox is operating. To avoid an influence of contaminated oil, contamination proactive technology should be used for the assessment of the degree of contamination and the decision on oil purification or change should be taken. The whole process connected with a gearbox condition change (wear and degradation process) shall be described in the paper. The oil purification or its replacement extends the live of gearboxes but long live of a gearbox, even with very little contamination causes some frictional wear of bearings and finally secondary misalignment. To avoid further development of degradation process proper technology should be used. There is a need to measure the degree of misalignment and make decision on bearings replacement, in order to avoid further gearbox degradation, like teeth scuffing which may leads to crack initiation.

However, in some cases, especially in heavy industrial machinery, it is difficult to detect damage because of the poor signal-to-noise ratio of the measured vibration. Therefore it is necessary to use unconventional advanced techniques to enhance the signal. In this paper, a novel approach based on parametric time-frequency analysis and further processing for: i) time-varying spectral content modelling, ii) the identification of informative frequency bands by statistical analysis, iii) local damage detection and iv) cycle identification via cepstral analysis, is presented. The proposed procedure is validated using real vibration data from bearings and gearboxes. It is worth noting that this methodology can be also successfully used in time-varying speed conditions (with limited fluctuation).

If not detected on time, they may result in severe dysfunction of the kinematic chain or even in catastrophic breakdown of the whole mechanism. Vibration based methods dedicated to gears monitoring are widely studied and applied techniques, that in majority rely on comparison of some spectral features. In this paper, however, the method based on fractal theory and wavelet decomposition is studied for possible application to gears diagnostics. The discussed technique may serve as a tool for signal contraction and/or signals comparison according to frequency content. Presented results are based on experimental data recorded from gradually deteriorated gearbox and gear with mechanically introduced local fault.

J	Li, Z; Zhang, YF				Li, Zhen; Zhang, Yunfeng			Extreme value theory-based structural health prognosis method using reduced sensor data	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						extreme value theory; monotonicity; prognosis; sensor; structural health monitoring	PERFORMANCE PREDICTION; GENERAL-APPROACH; STEEL BRIDGES; CORROSION; CONCRETE; RELIABILITY; DAMAGE; TAIL; REINFORCEMENT; INSPECTIONS	This paper presents an extreme value theory (EVT)-based structural health prognosis method that can be used for estimating the quantile values of remaining useful life (RUL) of monitored structure with reduced sensor data. Massive sensor data generated from online structural health monitoring system can be utilised to provide more refined prognosis results such as statistical distribution of RULs. By using the moment estimator from EVT, only a small portion of the full sensor data-set is actually used for estimating the quantile values of the RUL. This can considerably cut the computing time required for structural health prognosis. As a requirement for implementing the EVT-based prognosis, monotonicity relation between damage index (either measured or derived from sensor data) and RUL values has to be satisfied though. Common prognosis problems in civil engineering include fatigue cracking in steel structures and steel rebar corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. To illustrate the EVT-based prognosis, the monotonicity condition is shown for the selected degradation models in two case studies involving fatigue life estimation and pitting corrosion life of steel reinforcing rebar, respectively. The results show that EVT-based structural health prognosis method is computationally efficient without loss of much accuracy.

J	Zhang, SH; Li, WH				Zhang, Shaohui; Li, Weihua			Bearing Condition Recognition and Degradation Assessment under Varying Running Conditions Using NPE and SOM	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROJECTION; DIAGNOSIS	Manifold learning methods have been widely used in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, the results reported in these studies focus on the machine faults under stable loading and rotational speeds, which cannot interpret the practical machine running. Rotating machine is always running under variable speeds and loading, which makes the vibration signal more complicated. To address such concern, the NPE (neighborhood preserving embedding) is applied for bearing fault classification. Compared with other algorithms (PCA, LPP, LDA, and ISOP), the NPE performs well in feature extraction. Since the traditional time domain signal denoising is time consuming and memory consuming, we denoise the signal features directly in feature space. Furthermore, NPE and SOM (self-organizing map) are combined to assess the bearing degradation performance. Simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	He, QB; Wang, XX; Zhou, Q				He, Qingbo; Wang, Xiangxiang; Zhou, Qiang			Vibration Sensor Data Denoising Using a Time-Frequency Manifold for Machinery Fault Diagnosis	SENSORS			English	Article						vibration sensor; data denoising; time-frequency manifold; machinery fault diagnosis; bearing	WAVELET	Vibration sensor data from a mechanical system are often associated with important measurement information useful for machinery fault diagnosis. However, in practice the existence of background noise makes it difficult to identify the fault signature from the sensing data. This paper introduces the time-frequency manifold (TFM) concept into sensor data denoising and proposes a novel denoising method for reliable machinery fault diagnosis. The TFM signature reflects the intrinsic time-frequency structure of a non-stationary signal. The proposed method intends to realize data denoising by synthesizing the TFM using time-frequency synthesis and phase space reconstruction (PSR) synthesis. Due to the merits of the TFM in noise suppression and resolution enhancement, the denoised signal would have satisfactory denoising effects, as well as inherent time-frequency structure keeping. Moreover, this paper presents a clustering-based statistical parameter to evaluate the proposed method, and also presents a new diagnostic approach, called frequency probability time series (FPTS) spectral analysis, to show its effectiveness in fault diagnosis. The proposed TFM-based data denoising method has been employed to deal with a set of vibration sensor data from defective bearings, and the results verify that for machinery fault diagnosis the method is superior to two traditional denoising methods.

A One-Versus-All Class Binarization Strategy for Bearing Diagnostics of Concurrent Defects	SENSORS			English	Article						bearing; multiple defects; fault diagnostics; class binarization; support vector machine (SVM); decision tree	ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARINGS; FAULT FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DECISION TREE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; LIFE PREDICTION; VIBRATION; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; CHALLENGES	In bearing diagnostics using a data-driven modeling approach, a concern is the need for data from all possible scenarios to build a practical model for all operating conditions. This paper is a study on bearing diagnostics with the concurrent occurrence of multiple defect types. The authors are not aware of any work in the literature that studies this practical problem. A strategy based on one-versus-all (OVA) class binarization is proposed to improve fault diagnostics accuracy while reducing the number of scenarios for data collection, by predicting concurrent defects from training data of normal and single defects. The proposed OVA diagnostic approach is evaluated with empirical analysis using support vector machine (SVM) and C4.5 decision tree, two popular classification algorithms frequently applied to system health diagnostics and prognostics. Statistical features are extracted from the time domain and the frequency domain. Prediction performance of the proposed strategy is compared with that of a simple multi-class classification, as well as that of random guess and worst-case classification. We have verified the potential of the proposed OVA diagnostic strategy in performance improvements for single-defect diagnosis and predictions of BPFO plus BPFI concurrent defects using two laboratory-collected vibration data sets.

Scheduled maintenance is undertaken during preprogrammed inspections. Maintenance operations try to minimize the risk of deterioration based on a priori knowledge of failure mechanisms and their timing. However, in complex systems it is not always possible to schedule maintenance actions to mitigate all undesired effects, and SMART systems, which monitor selected parameters, propose actions to correct any deviation in normal behavior. Maintenance decisions must be made on the basis of accepted risk. Performed or not performed scheduled tasks as well as deferred corrective actions can have positive or negative consequences for the company, technicians and machines. These three risks should be properly assessed and prioritized as a function of the goals to be achieved. This paper focuses on how best practices in risk assessment for human safety can be successfully transferred to risk assessment for asset integrity.

This manuscript develops and improvement of a technique showed in [1] of automated diagnosis of bearings through vibration signals, using the coefficients of the Multirresolution Analysis (MRA) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network (NN). Data were obtained from a quasi-real industrial machine, where bearings were supporting axial and radial loads while rotating at different speeds. This technique offered very good results when diagnosing healthy and faulty bearings, nevertheless the reliability decreased when distinguishing between different kinds of failures. The novel technique showed in the present work, increases the success rates obtained using the same data: not only allows detecting early faults but also their location with high accuracy. The methodology exposed in this work is based on the use of the relative energy of the Wavelet Packets Transform (WPT), and NN, concretely, the RBF.

A relevant aspect in the process of machinery noise control is the proper identification of noise sources. Microphone-array-based methods are known as alternatives for noise source identification in machines. In this work, the "Beamforming" technique is used to visualize the directionality pattern of the noise emitted by a rotating machine and a study is presented to compare the performance of machine condition detection using different architectures of classifiers based on Artificial Neural Networks. Sound maps from a rotating machine are used as inputs to classifiers for two-class (normal or fault) recognition. The classifier is trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions and is tested using the remaining data set. The procedure is illustrated using data from experimental sound maps of a rotating machine. The effectiveness of the classifiers and the network training is improved through the use of the Karhunen-Loeve transform on the sound map data.	[Pacheco, Walace de Souza; Pinto, Fernando A. N.

This chapter however exposes the future potentials of the use of the higher order spectra (HOS) i.e., the bispectrum and the trispectrum for rotating machines faults diagnosis (FD). The aim of this is to achieve a significant reduction in the number of vibration transducers required at each bearing pedestal, without necessarily compromising valuable information required for the diagnosis. Four cases (healthy, shaft misalignment, cracked shaft and shaft rub) were simulated on an experimental rig with two rigidly coupled shafts supported by four ball bearings. Only four accelerometers (one at each bearing pedestal) were used for this study. The HOS results were compared for the different conditions of the rig. The observations and findings are presented in the chapter.

In this paper we propose a new approach estimating bearing RUL based on features describing the statistical complexity of the envelope of the generated vibrations and a set of Gaussian process (GP) models. The proposed approach is shown to be sensitive to incipient condition deterioration which allows timely and sufficiently accurate estimates of the RUL. The proposed approach was evaluated on the data set comprising of 17 bearing runs with natural fault evolution.

Application to Wind Turbine Planetary Gearbox	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	2013	Ferrara, ITALY			Wind turbines; Vibration analysis; Non-stationary operation; Planetary gearbox		Wind turbine condition monitoring is essential task in the process of maintaining machine operation at the optimal level. It is related to ensuring the profitability of investment and the provision of security in the environment of the turbine. However, operational conditions of turbine associated with non-stationary nature of the stimulus which is the wind, impede the correct diagnosis of the machine. In addition, a multitude of parameters adversely affects the clarity of predictions and setting alarm thresholds. In the article, the authors evaluate the impact of generator output power and rotational speed on selected vibration-based feature value. The study was performed for wind turbine planetary gearbox during fault development of the ring. It was possible due to historical data consisting peak-to-peak (P2P) values together with corresponding values of rotational speed and generator output power. For the purpose of the experiment the method that bases on calculation of arithmetic mean of the data in the segments corresponding to the chosen ranges of both rotational speed and generator output power is presented. Results are given in the form of three-dimensional charts, which allow assessing the impact of parameters on the studied feature. The paper shows that for machinery operating under varying regime proposed representation might serve as a valuable method for fault detection. Additionally, authors highlight the importance of analysis of vibration-based features as a function of two variables (rotational speed and power/load).

Gearbox faults are one of the major reasons for breakdown of industrial machinery. Therefore, gearbox diagnosing is one of the most important topics in machine condition monitoring. A number of signal processing techniques are described for the vibrodiagnostics of gearboxes, but there are also different limitations for vibration based gear diagnostic methods. For some specific requirements (e.g. time-triggered signal acquisition), not all of described techniques can be always applied in industrial reality. This paper introduces a novel, easy to use method of gearbox health vibromonitoring based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and a time-domain analysis of vibration signal parts. Six sets of data collected from gearboxes are used to validate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the gear tooth defect can be detected and evaluated at an early stage of development when both Empirical Mode Decomposition and statistical analysis technique are used.

It is based on a vibration time series analysis. A pure vibration signal is decomposed via the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and new time series for each frequency bin are processed using novel approach called local maxima method. We search for local maxima because they appear in the signal if local damage in bearings or gearbox exists. Due to random character of obtained time series, each maximum occurrence must be checked for its significance. If there are time points for which the average number of local maxima is significantly higher than for the others, then the machine is suspected of being damaged. For healthy condition machinery, the vector of average number of maxima for each time point should not have outliers. The main attention is concentrated on the proper choice of required local maxima significance. The method is illustrated by analysis of very noisy both real and simulated signals. Also possible generalizations of this method are presented.

Influence of Stopping Criterion for Sifting Process of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on Roller Bearing Fault Diagnosis	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	2013	Ferrara, ITALY			Empirical mode decomposition; Support vector machine; Roller bearing fault diagnosis; Sifting process		Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a self-adaptive data driven technique for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary signals and decompose them into some elementary Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Although EMD method has been applied in various applications successfully, this method has some drawbacks, i.e. lack of a mathematical base, no robust stopping criterion for sifting process, mode mixing and border effect problem. Under the practical point of view, the most relevant is possibly the sifting stop criterion. Although sifting as many times as possible is needed to decompose the signal, too many sifting steps will reduce the physical meaning of IMFs. To preserve the natural amplitude variations of the oscillations, sifting must be limited to as few steps as possible. The proposed criteria so far are: Cauchy-type convergence, three-threshold, energy difference tracking, resolution factor, bandwidths, and orthogonality criterion. There is not a thorough study yet regarding the fault diagnosis application, to determine the effects of stopping criteria on the fault detection performance. In this chapter, the influence of different criteria to this purpose is investigated.

Condition Monitoring Under Non-Stationary Operating Conditions using Time-Frequency Representation-Based Dynamic Features	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	2013	Ferrara, ITALY			Condition monitoring; Dynamic features; Non-stationary; Vibration signals; One-class classification	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Condition monitoring is useful to describe the machine state under current operating regimes, especially, when non-stationary operating conditions appears. Nevertheless, in actual applications the faulty data are not always available. This paper proposes a novel methodology for condition monitoring using dynamic features and one-class classifiers. The dynamic features set comprises the spectral sub-band centroids and linear frequency cepstral coefficients computed from time-frequency representations. A one-class classification stage is carried out to validate the performance of the dynamic features and commonly used statistical features as descriptors of the machine state. Proposed methodology is evaluated by using a test rig, which is composed by outliers (unbalance and misalignment) and target objects (undamaged state). The data set is obtained under variable speed conditions including start-up and coast-down. The attained results outperform other state-of-the-art extracted parameters and the methodology is robust to large speed fluctuations in the machine.

Based on statistical analysis of scalar indicator resulting from the TSA method (Time Synchronous Averaging), this technique will be dedicated to condition monitoring of machines. In addition, spectral analysis, using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm of the stator- current signature MCSA (Motor Current Signature Analysis), determines their frequency composition, and therefore, allows finding the spectral lines associated to the fault. This work highlights our first results related to the comparison of the spectral representation of the stator current and that of the residual current obtained by the TSA method. We proved the effectiveness of these techniques by simulation and experimental tests made on a wound rotor induction machine. The fault rotor is taken into account by an additional resistance of one of the rotor phases. The results of simulations and experiments underline the practical utility of this method.

These information can then be used to improve numerical models in order to monitor the operating and structural conditions of the system. This is a critical aspect both for condition monitoring and maintenance of large wind turbines, particularly in the off-shore sector where operation and maintenance represent a high percentage of total costs. Although OMA is widely applied, the wind turbine case still remains an open issue. Numerical aeroelastic models could be used, once they have been validated, to introduce virtual damages to the structures in order to analyze the generated data. Results from such models can then be used as baseline to monitor the operating and structural condition of the machine.

Moreover, for samples with discordant distributing complexities, the selection of reasonable parameters is even impossible. To alleviate this problem we introduce the method of flexible support vector regression (F-SVR), which is especially suited for modelling complicated sample distributions, as it is free from parameters selection. Reasonable parameters for F-SVR are automatically generated given a sample distribution. Lastly, we apply this method in the analysis of the fault isolation of high frequency power supplies, where satisfactory results have been obtained.

DEGENERATED HUMAN INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS CONTAIN AUTOANTIBODIES AGAINST EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEINS	EUROPEAN CELLS & MATERIALS			English	Article						Intervertebral disc; nucleus pulposus; annulus fibrosus; extracellular matrix	LOW-BACK-PAIN; NUCLEUS-PULPOSUS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; CYTOKINE EXPRESSION; II COLLAGEN; AGGRECAN; ANTIBODIES; CARTILAGE; IDENTIFICATION; DEGRADATION	Degeneration of intervertebral discs (IVDs) is associated with back pain and elevated levels of inflammatory cells. It has been hypothesised that discogenic pain is a direct result of vascular and neural ingrowth along annulus fissures, which may expose the avascular nucleus pulposus (NP) to the systemic circulation and induce an autoimmune reaction. In this study, we confirmed our previous observation of antibodies in human degenerated and posttraumatic IVDs cultured in vitro. We hypothesised that the presence of antibodies was due to an autoimmune reaction against specific proteins of the disc. Furthermore we identified antigens which possibly trigger an autoimmune response in degenerative disc diseases. We demonstrated that degenerated and post-traumatic IVDs contain IgG antibodies against typical extracellular proteins of the disc, particularly proteins of the NP. We identified IgGs against collagen type II and aggrecan, confirming an autoimmune reaction against the normally immune privileged NP. We also found specific IgGs against collagens types I and V, but not against collagen type III. In conclusion, this study confirmed the association between disc degeneration and autoimmunity, and may open the avenue for future studies on developing prognostic, diagnostic and therapymonitoring markers for degenerative disc diseases.

The extreme learningmachine (ELM) is a new single hidden layer feedforward neural network method aiming at improving the training speed. Nowadays ELM algorithm has received wide application with its good generalization performance under fast learning speed. However, there are still several problems needed to be solved in ELM. In this paper, a new improved ELM algorithm named R-ELM is proposed to handle the multicollinear problem appearing in calculation of the ELM algorithm. The proposed algorithm is employed in bearing fault detection using stator current monitoring. Simulative results show that R-ELM algorithm has better stability and generalization performance compared with the original ELM and the other neural network methods.

Fault detection of washing machine with discrete wavelet methods	MECHANIKA			English	Article						vibration; washing machine; discrete wavelet analysis; data analysis	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; MOTORS	In the last decade, a new mathematical method has allowed scientists and engineers to view the details of time varying and transient phenomena that are not possible through conventional tools. This invention, called wavelet transform, has created revolutionary changes in the areas of signal processing, and image compression. In this study, both properly working and fault washing machine is distinguished by using discrete wavelet analysis and statistical analysis. The result of statistical analysis to distinguish the properties of both machines has been quite successful. Based on the analysis, particular energy levels are important to distinguish the machines. All the dynamics and control of electrical machines and analysis is necessary for effective control. In the study vibration dynamics of the washing machine was analyzed.	[Akinci, T.

The CBM and dispatch process of aircraft fleet is analyzed first, and the alternative strategy sets for single aircraft are given. Then, the optimization problem of fleet CBM with lower maintenance cost and dispatch risk is translated to the combinatorial optimization problem of single aircraft strategy. Remain useful life (RUL) distribution of the key line replaceable Module (LRM) has been transformed into the failure probability of the aircraft and the fleet health status matrix is established. And the calculation method of the costs and risks for mission based on health status matrix and maintenance matrix is given. Further, an optimization method for fleet dispatch and CBM under acceptable risk is proposed based on an improved genetic algorithm. Finally, a fleet of 10 aircrafts is studied to verify the proposed method. The results shows that it could realize optimization and control of the aircraft fleet oriented to mission success.

This paper presents a methodology of fault diagnosis in rotating machinery using multisensor information fusion that all the features are calculated using vibration data in time domain to constitute fusional vector and the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. The effectiveness of the presented methodology is tested by three case studies: diagnostic of faulty gear, rolling bearing, and identification of rotor crack. For each case study, the sensibilities of the features are analyzed. The results indicate that the peak factor is the most sensitive feature in the twelve time-domain features for identifying gear defect, and the mean, amplitude square, root mean square, root amplitude, and standard deviation are all sensitive for identifying gear, rolling bearing, and rotor crack defect comparatively.

Since vibrations can often lead to accidental embroidery machine shutdowns, and can cause thread breaking and needle damage, measures must be taken to remove or reduce them. To this end, for diagnosing the causes for Happy embroidery machine halts, vibration measurements were taken in each measuring point, by installing vibration sensors on the three directions of the cartesian coordinate system: axial, horizontal, vertical. The data collected from the embroidery machine focused on the following vibration characteristics: velocity, displacement and acceleration. After the data was collected and transferred to the computer running the Data Explorer application, fault diagnosis and analysis were done.

In this paper, a combined measure of the original Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is provided to carry out the fault classification, and compare its result with what is based on SVM-RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) method. RFE is used for feature extraction, and PCA is utilized to project the original data onto a lower dimensional space. PCA T-2, SPE statistics, and original SVM are proposed to detect the faults. Some common faults of the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) are analyzed in terms of the practical system and reflections of the dataset. PCA-SVM and SVM-RFE can effectively detect and diagnose these common faults. In RFE algorithm, all variables are decreasingly ordered according to their contributions. The classification accuracy rate is improved by choosing a reasonable number of features.

This paper proposed a novel method based on the support vector machine (SVM) and the Markov model to achieve this goal. Firstly, the features are extracted by time and time-frequency domain methods. However, the extracted original features are still with high dimensional and include superfluous information, and the nonlinear multifeatures fusion technique LTSA is used to merge the features and reduces the dimension. Then, based on the extracted features, the SVM model is used to predict the bearings degradation process, and the CAO method is used to determine the embedding dimension of the SVM model. After the bearing degradation process is predicted by SVM model, the Markov model is used to improve the prediction accuracy. The proposed method was validated by two bearing run-to-failure experiments, and the results proved the effectiveness of the methodology.

J	Zheng, JD; Cheng, JS; Yang, Y				Zheng, Jinde; Cheng, Junsheng; Yang, Yu			Multiscale Permutation Entropy Based Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; CORRELATION DIMENSION; HILBERT SPECTRUM; MACHINE; EMD	A new rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach based on multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), Laplacian score (LS), and support vector machines (SVMs) is proposed in this paper. Permutation entropy (PE) was recently proposed and defined to measure the randomicity and detect dynamical changes of time series. However, for the complexity of mechanical systems, the randomicity and dynamic changes of the vibration signal will exist in different scales. Thus, the definition of MPE is introduced and employed to extract the nonlinear fault characteristics from the bearing vibration signal in different scales. Besides, the SVM is utilized to accomplish the fault feature classification to fulfill diagnostic procedure automatically. Meanwhile, in order to avoid a high dimension of features, the Laplacian score (LS) is used to refine the feature vector by ranking the features according to their importance and correlations with the main fault information. Finally, the rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on MPE, LS, and SVM is proposed and applied to the experimental data. The experimental data analysis results indicate that the proposed method could identify the fault categories effectively.

J	Ao, H; Cheng, JS; Li, KL; Truong, TK				HungLinh Ao; Cheng, Junsheng; Li, Kenli; Tung Khac Truong			A Roller Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Based on LCD Energy Entropy and ACROA-SVM	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUPPORT; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; FREQUENCIES; MACHINES; SPECTRUM; EMD	This study investigates a novel method for roller bearing fault diagnosis based on local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) energy entropy, together with a support vector machine designed using an Artificial Chemical Reaction Optimisation Algorithm, referred to as an ACROA-SVM. First, the original acceleration vibration signals are decomposed into intrinsic scale components (ISCs). Second, the concept of LCD energy entropy is introduced. Third, the energy features extracted from a number of ISCs that contain the most dominant fault information serve as input vectors for the support vector machine classifier. Finally, the ACROA-SVM classifier is proposed to recognize the faulty roller bearing pattern. The analysis of roller bearing signals with inner-race and outer-race faults shows that the diagnostic approach based on the ACROA-SVM and using LCD to extract the energy levels of the various frequency bands as features can identify roller bearing fault patterns accurately and effectively. The proposed method is superior to approaches based on Empirical Mode Decomposition method and requires less time.

J	Shi, KJ; Liu, SL; Zhang, HL; Wang, B				Shi, Kunju; Liu, Shulin; Zhang, Hongli; Wang, Bo			Kernel Local Linear Discriminate Method for Dimensionality Reduction and Its Application in Machinery Fault Diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Dimensionality reduction is a crucial task in machinery fault diagnosis. Recently, as a popular dimensional reduction technology, manifold learning has been successfully used in many fields. However, most of these technologies are not suitable for the task, because they are unsupervised in nature and fail to discover the discriminate structure in the data. To overcome these weaknesses, kernel local linear discriminate (KLLD) algorithm is proposed. KLLD algorithmis a novel algorithm which combines the advantage of neighborhood preserving projections (NPP), Floyd, maximum margin criterion (MMC), and kernel trick. KLLD has four advantages. First of all, KLLD is a supervised dimension reduction method that can overcome the out-of-sample problems. Secondly, short-circuit problem can be avoided. Thirdly, KLLD algorithm can use between-class scatter matrix and inner-class scatter matrix more efficiently. Lastly, kernel trick is included in KLLD algorithm to find more precise solution. The main feature of the proposed method is that it attempts to both preserve the intrinsic neighborhood geometry of the increased data and exact the discriminate information. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the new method. The results show that KLLD has more benefits than traditional methods.

Consequently, condition monitoring of such subsystems could increase reliability of machines that are carrying out field operations. Recently, research has focused on the implementation of vibration signals analysis for health status diagnosis in bearings systems considering the use of acceleration measurements. Informative features sensitive to specific bearing faults and fault locations were constructed by using advanced signal processing techniques which enable the accurate discrimination of faults based on their location. In this paper, the architecture of a diagnostic system for extended faults in bearings based on neural networks is presented. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) with Bayesian automatic relevance determination has been applied in the classification of accelerometer data. New features like the line integral and feature based sensor fusion are introduced which enhance the fault identification performance. Vibration feature selection based on Bayesian automatic relevance determination is introduced for finding better feature combinations.

Mark			Application of coupled electro-thermal and physics-of-failure-based analysis to the design of accelerated life tests for power modules	MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY			English	Article							HEALTH MANAGEMENT; RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT; OPERATING-CONDITIONS; ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS; PROGNOSTICS	In the reliability theme a central activity is to investigate, characterize and understand the contributory wear-out and overstress mechanisms to meet through-life reliability targets. For power modules, it is critical to understand the response of typical wear-out mechanisms, for example wire-bond lifting and solder degradation, to in-service environmental and load-induced thermal cycling. This paper presents the use of a reduced-order thermal model coupled with physics-of-failure-based life models to quantify the wear-out rates and life consumption for the dominant failure mechanisms under prospective in-service and qualification test conditions. When applied in the design of accelerated life and qualification tests it can be used to design tests that separate the failure mechanisms (e.g. wire-bond and substrate-solder) and provide predictions of conditions that yield a minimum elapsed test time. The combined approach provides a useful tool for reliability assessment and estimation of remaining useful life which can be used at the design stage or in-service. An example case study shows that it is possible to determine the actual power cycling frequency for which failure occurs in the shortest elapsed time. The results demonstrate that bond-wire degradation is the dominant failure mechanism for all power cycling conditions whereas substrate-solder failure dominates for externally applied (ambient or passive) thermal cycling.

The sensor system consists mainly of an eccentric sleeve rotating with the shaft on which the angular speed to be measured, and an eddy current displacement sensor to obtain the profile of the sleeve for AS calculation. When the shaft rotates at constant speed the profile will be a pure sinusoidal trace. However, the profile will be a phase modulated signal when the shaft speed is varied. By applying a demodulating procedure, the AS can be obtained in a straightforward manner. The sensor system was validated experimentally based on a gearbox test rig and the result shows that the AS obtained are consistent with that obtained by a conventional encoder. However, the new sensor gives very smooth and stable traces of the AS, demonstrating its higher accuracy and reliability in obtaining the AS of the low speed operations with speed-up and down transients. In addition, the experiment also shows that it is easy and cost-effective to be realised in different applications such as condition monitoring and process control. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

The wavelet packet is employed to decompose the vibration signal to obtain the energy ratio in each frequency band. Taking energy ratios as feature vectors, the pattern recognition results are obtained by the SVC. The rolling bearing and gear fault diagnostic results of the typical experimental platform show that the present approach is robust to noise and has higher classification accuracy and, thus, provides a better way to diagnose mechanical faults under the condition of small fault samples.

A comprehensive power loss evaluation for Switched Reluctance Motor in presence of rotor asymmetry rotation: Theory, numerical analysis and experiments	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Power losses; Efficiency Evaluation; Faulty conditions; Reluctance machines	FINITE-ELEMENT; ECCENTRICITY FAULT; INDUCTION-MOTORS; FIELD ANALYSIS; TORQUE RIPPLE; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; MINIMIZATION; CONTROLLER; SIGNATURE	In this paper, the effect of different rotor asymmetry rotation faults on the power loss variations in Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) is studied deeply. To fulfill this objective, SRM's core losses including hysteresis and eddy current losses accompanied with its copper losses are firstly introduced theoretically in detail. Then a 6 by 4 SRM is simulated and motor profiles as well as power losses factors are measured in presence of three common eccentricity faults namely as; static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and mixed eccentricity (ME) faults. The numerical analysis and simulations are done by the three-dimensional Time-Step Finite Element Method (3D-TSFEM). In next step, a similar test rig is designed and built for experimental measurements and confirmations. It was realized that, these types of eccentricity faults directly affect the power loss value and can enhance it abundantly. In other word, the more severity in fault levels conclude the more reduction in output power and the more increment in power losses that can be used as diagnosis index. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chen, B; Yan, ZL; Chen, W				Chen, Bin; Yan, Zhaoli; Chen, Wei			Defect Detection for Wheel-Bearings with Time-Spectral Kurtosis and Entropy	ENTROPY			English	Article						wheel-bearing; defective frequency; spectral kurtosis; time-spectral kurtosis; feature extraction	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; DECISION TREE; VIBRATION; ENVELOPE; IDENTIFICATION; TOOL	Wheel-bearings easily acquire defects due to their high-speed operating conditions and constant metal-metal contact, so defect detection is of great importance for railroad safety. The conventional spectral kurtosis (SK) technique provides an optimal bandwidth for envelope demodulation. However, this technique may cause false detections when processing real vibration signals for wheel-bearings, because of sparse interference impulses. In this paper, a novel defect detection method with entropy, time-spectral kurtosis (TSK) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. In this method, the possible outliers in the short time Fourier transform (STFT) amplitude series are first estimated and preprocessed with information entropy. Then the method extends the SK technique to the time-domain, and extracts defective frequencies from reconstructed vibration signals by TSK filtering. Finally, the multi-class SVM was applied to classify bearing defects. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using real wheel-bearing vibration signals. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a better performance in defect frequency detection and classification than the conventional SK-based envelope demodulation.

Now more emphasis has been laid on the accuracy of electronic system fault diagnosis. Based on the characteristics of the electronic system fault diagnosis, we design a multi-classification SVMs model to attain better fault diagnosis accuracy, which utilizes multi-kernel function consisting of several basis kernel functions to enhance the interpretability of the classification model. In order to optimize the performance of multi-classification SVMs with multi-kernel, we improve the Chaos Particles swarm Optimization (CPSO) algorithm to achieve the optimum parameters of SVMs and the multi-kernel function. For the improved CPSO algorithm, a modified Tent Map chaotic sequence is used to strengthen the search diversity, and an effective method is embedded to the stander PSO algorithm which can ensure to avoid premature stagnation and obtain the global optimization values. The fault diagnosis simulation results of an electronic system show the proposed optimization scheme is a feasible and effective method and it can significantly improve the fault diagnosis accuracy of the multi-kernel SVM.

Comparison of Minimum Detectable Crack Size in a Geared System From Three Different Vibration Transducer Types	EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Gear Fault Detection; Laser Vibrometer; Accelerometer; Microphone; Transducer Comparison	ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; WAVELET; VIBROMETRY; EXTRACTION	Acoustic and vibration signals contain distinctive patterns useful for detecting defects in machinery. A number of signal processing strategies have been proposed for detecting and quantifying incipient defects in gears. Nonintrusive measurement techniques like those based on laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) and microphones need to be studied in order to help users in selecting the appropriate transducer according to the application. This article presents an experimental design to determine, as a novel contribution, the minimum detectable crack size in a geared system comparing three different transducers: a microphone, an accelerometer, and an LDV. The comparison intends to discriminate the three transducers with respect to its early detection capability. Experiments were conducted in a closed loop torque test rig for several torque levels and speeds. Experimental factorial design was used to determine the main effects and their interactions in the detection process. The well-known Hilbert and wavelet transforms have been used as signal processing technique. Their advantages in the detection of incipient defects are highlighted in this article. The results indicate that the acoustic signal stands out as the method that first detects an incipient progressive crack in gears (it detected 1.3-mm-long cracks), although, as a drawback, the results obtained using the microphone signal are more sensitive to speed and torque. The second place was for LDV with 1.8-mm crack detection, and the third place for the accelerometer with 2.3-mm crack detection.	[Moreno, R.; Chicharro, J.

Classification of Induction Machine Faults using Time Frequency Representation and Particle Swarm Optimization	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Induction machine diagnosis; Ambiguity plane; Classification-optimal TFR; Time-frequency; Fisher's discriminated ratio; Artificial neural network ANN; PSO	DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a new method of classification of the induction machine faults using Time Frequency Representation, Particle Swarm Optimization and artificial neural network. The essence of the feature extraction is to project from faulty machine to a low size signal time-frequency representation (TFR), which is deliberately designed for maximizing the separability between classes, a distinct TFR is designed for each class. The feature vectors size is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization method (PSO). The classifier is designed using an artificial neural network. This method allows an accurate classification independently of load level. The introduction of the PSO in the classification procedure has given good results using the reduced size of the feature vectors obtained by the optimization process. These results are validated on a 5.5-kW induction motor test bench.

J	Chen, JL; Zuo, MJ; Zi, YY; He, ZJ				Chen, Jinglong; Zuo, Ming J.; Zi, Yanyang; He, Zhengjia			Construction of customized redundant multiwavelet via increasing multiplicity for fault detection of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Customized redundant multiwavelet; Increasing multiplicity; Envelope spectrum entropy; Fault detection	APPROXIMATION ORDER; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; WAVELETS; DESIGN; TRANSFORMS	Fault detection from the vibration measurement data of rotating machinery is significant for avoiding serious accidents. However, non-stationary vibration signal with a large amount of noise makes this task challenging. Multiwavelet not only owns the advantage on multi-resolution analysis but also can offer multiple wavelet basis functions. So it has the possibility of detecting various fault features preferably. However, the fixed basis functions which are not related to the given signal may lower the accuracy of fault detection. Moreover, another major intrinsic deficiency of multiwavelet lies in its critically sampled filter-bank, which causes shift-variance and is harmful to extract the feature of periodical impulses. To overcome these deficiencies, a new method called customized redundant multiwavelet (CRM) is constructed via increasing multiplicity (IM). IM is a simple method to design a series of changeable multiwavelet which are available for the subsequent optimization process. By the rule of the envelope spectrum entropy minimum principle, optimal multiwavelet is searched for. Based on the customized multiwavelet filters, the filters of CRM can be calculated by inserting zeros. The proposed method is applied to analyze the simulation, gearbox and rolling element bearing vibration signals. Compared with some other conventional methods, the results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses robust performance in detecting fault features of rotating machinery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lu, C; Tao, LF; Fan, HZ				Lu, Chen; Tao, Laifa; Fan, Huanzhen			An intelligent approach to machine component health prognostics by utilizing only truncated histories	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Health prognostics; Truncated histories; Survival probability; Life prediction		Numerous techniques and methods have been proposed to reduce the production downtime, spare-part inventory, maintenance cost, and safety hazards of machineries and equipment. Prognostics are regarded as a significant and promising tool for achieving these benefits for machine maintenance. However, prognostic models, particularly probabilistic-based methods, require a large number of failure instances. In practice, engineering assets are rarely being permitted to run to failure. Many studies have reported valuable models and methods that engage in maximizing both truncated and failure data. However, limited studies have focused on cases where only truncated data are available, which is common in machine condition monitoring. Therefore, this study develops an intelligent machine component prognostics system by utilizing only truncated histories. First, the truncated Minimum Quantization Error (MQE) histories were obtained by Self-organizing Map network after feature extraction. The chaos-based parallel multilayer perceptron network and polynomial fitting for residual errors were adopted to generate the predicted MQEs and failure times following the truncation times. The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was trained with inputs both from the truncated MQE histories and from the predicted MQEs. The target vectors of survival probabilities were estimated by intelligent product limit estimator using the truncation times and generated failure times. After validation, the FFNN was applied to predict the machine component health of individual units. To validate the proposed method, two cases were considered by using the degradation data generated by bearing testing rig. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising intelligent prognostics approach for machine component health. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A relationship was established between the main electrical faults (inter-turn short circuits and unbalanced voltage supplies) and the signals of magnetic flux and vibration, in order to identify the characteristic frequencies of those faults. The experimental results showed the efficiency of the conjugation of these techniques for detection, diagnosis and monitoring tasks.

However, early stage defect of rotating machineries is difficult to identify because their incipient energy is interfered with background noises. Multiwavelet is a powerful tool used to conduct non-stationary fault feature extraction. However, the existing predetermined multiwavelet bases are independent of the dynamic response signals. In this paper, a constructing technique of vibration data-driven maximal-overlap adaptive multiwavelet (MOAMW) is proposed for enhancing the extracting performance of fault symptom. It is able to derive an optimal multiwavelet basis that best matches the critical non-stationary and transient fault signatures via genetic algorithm. In this technique, two-scale similarity transform (TST) and symmetric lifting (SymLift) scheme are combined to gain high designing freedom for matching the critical faulty vibration contents in vibration signals based on the maximal fitness objective. TST and SymLift can add modifications to the initial multiwavelet by changing the approximation order and vanishing moment of multiwavelet, respectively. Moreover, the beneficial feature of the MOAWM lies in that the maximal-overlap filterbank structure can enhance the periodic and transient characteristics of the sensor signals and preserve the time and frequency analyzing resolution during the decomposition process. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated via a numerical simulation as well as a rolling element bearing with an outer race scrape and a gearbox with rub fault.

J	Moroni, G; Petro, S				Moroni, Giovanni; Petro, Stefano			Optimal inspection strategy planning for geometric tolerance verification	PRECISION ENGINEERING-JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETIES FOR PRECISION ENGINEERING AND NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Geometric inspection; Geometric deviation; Uncertainty; Sampling strategy; Inspection cost model	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SENSOR OPTIMIZATION; SAMPLING STRATEGY; FEATURES; SYSTEMS; ERROR	Two features characterize a good inspection system: it is accurate, and compared to the manufacturing cost, it is not expensive. Unfortunately, few measuring systems posses both these characteristics, i.e. low uncertainty comes with a cost. But also high uncertainty comes with a cost, because measuring systems with high uncertainty tend to generate more inspection errors, which come with a cost. In the case of geometric inspection, the geometric deviation is evaluated from a cloud of points sampled on a part. Therefore, not only the measuring device has to be selected, but also the sampling strategy has to be planned, i.e. the sampling point cloud size and where points should be located on the feature to inspect have to be decided. When the measuring device is already available, as it often happens in geometric measurement, where most instruments are flexible, an unwise strategy planning can be the largest uncertainty contributor. In this work, a model for the evaluation of the overall inspection cost is proposed. The optimization of the model can lead to an optimal inspection strategy in economic sense. However, the model itself is based on uncertainty evaluation, in order to assess the impact of measurement error on inspection cost. Therefore, two methodologies for evaluating the uncertainty will be proposed. These methodologies will be focused on the evaluation of the contribution of the sampling strategy to the uncertainty. Finally, few case studies dealing with the inspection planning for a Coordinate Measuring Machine will be proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is used for signal processing and standard statistical feature extraction process. Feature reduction is a method used to deselect the irrelevant features acquired from the large dataset. Recent survey shows feature reduction is used widely in the field of machine learning to discover the knowledge with reduced features. Rough set is hybridized with particle swarm optimization (PSO), an population based stochastic optimization technique, to reduce the features. The efficiency of classification algorithm is compared based on their classification accuracy before and after feature reduction. Four states of bearing health conditions such as normal, defective inner race, defective outer race and defective ball conditions are simulated and used in this proposed work. (C) 2014 The Authors.

More advancement in its design and operation leads to increase in industrial applications. The failure in any of the components of gearbox can lead to production loss and increase maintenance cost. The component failure has to be detected earlier to avoid unexpected breakdown. Vibration measurements are used to monitor the condition of the machine for predictive maintenance and to predict the gearbox faults successfully. This paper addresses the use of vibration signal for automated fault diagnosis of gearbox. In the experimental studies, good gears and face wear gears are used to collect vibration signals for good and faulty conditions of the gearbox. Each gear is tested with two different speeds and loading conditions. The statistical features are extracted from the acquired vibration signals. The extracted features are given as an input to the support vector machine (SVM) for fault identification. The Performance of the fault identification system using vibration signals are discussed and compared. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is in contrast to FFT which can only resolve a signal in frequency domain. Additionally, Wavelet Transform has been widely employed by electrical machines researchers for fault diagnosis and prognosis especially as means to extract features for classification purposes. The problem though with both machine learning algorithms and Wavelet Transform is that they require extensive computational resources which are not available in environs where electrical machines are most often placed. Additionally, these environments are plagued by noise which considerably affects the quality of input signal i.e., current. Other issues related to on-board system is the associated cost of diagnosis hardware. Concretely, the algorithm for Wavelet Analysis of a signal should be capable of producing reasonable results using cost effective hardware which comes with the compromise of lesser resolution, limited memory and low power consumption. In this proposed work, implementation scheme of Wavelet Transform on low cost PSoC3 hardware is presented which tightly integrates the FPGA blocks and DSP processor on the chip with microcontroller core to yield a fast and robust hardware accelerated mechanism to compute Wavelet Transform, Wavelet thresholding for denoising and classification.

A technique (Advanced Transient Current Signature Analysis, ATCSA) based on the analysis of the stator transient current is assessed and compared to the widely spread Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) technology. ATCSA relies on the application of advanced signal processing tools that enable to track the signatures created by the fault components across the transient. These 'transient signatures' lead to a reliable understanding of the machine condition and provide much more information than a single frequency peak in a FFT spectrum. The new method has proven to be valid to avoid false positives provided by the classical MCSA, such as those occurring under presence of oscillating load torques or cooling axial ducts. The work verifies the industrial applicability of the approach and its reliability in cases where the classical MCSA leads to false indications. The verification is performed on High Voltage induction motors operating in a petrochemical plant in Korea as well as on a water intake facility at the same country. Some of the motors had actual broken rotor bar faults and false positive fault indications	[Antonino-Daviu, Jose A.] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Elect Engn, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Lee, Sang Bin] Korea Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Wiedenbrug, Ernesto] Eta Sci Inc, Ft Collins, CO USA		Antonino-Daviu, JA (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Elect Engn, E-46071 Valencia, Spain.	joanda@die.upv.es; sangbinlee@korea.ac.kr; wiedenbrug@gmail.com					Antonino-Daviu JA, 2006, IEEE T IND APPL, V42, P990, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2006.876082; Bellini A, 2001, IEEE T IND APPL, V37, P1248, DOI 10.1109/28.952499; Lee S, 2013, IEEE T IND APPL, V49, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2013.2259132; Park J, 2010, IEEE ENER CONV, P2493, DOI 10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617950; Riera-Guasp M, 2008, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V55, P4167, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2008.2004378; Thomson WT, 2001, IEEE IND APPL MAG, V7, P26, DOI 10.1109/2943.930988; Yang C., IEEE T IND IN PRESS; Zhang PJ, 2011, IEEE T IND APPL, V47, P34, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2010.2090839	8	4	4	1	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2166-949X			PETROL CHEM INDUST			2014													8	Engineering, Chemical; Engineering, Petroleum	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BD4QG	WOS:000361010000016					2022-02-14

However, it is well known that many of the variables are mutually dependent in process systems. This paper proposes a new monitoring method based on independent component analysis (ICA) - sparse autoencoder. The independent information component can be extracted by ICA through higher-order statistics. Moreover, the inherent nonlinear characteristics in the residual model of ICA can be handled by a deep architecture constructed with sparse autoencoder. To overcome the problem of local minima in the optimization of sparse autoencoder, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is used to pre-train the net, and the parameters in the sparse autoencoder is updated by Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS). Monitoring statistic is developed and its confidence limit is computed by kernel density estimation. A case study of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process indicates that the proposed fault detection method is more efficient.

The IMS provide autonomously (or semi-autonomously) diagnoses, prognostics and health assessment of components. In these systems, factors such as data acquisition and visualization from equipments are very important. In this context, this study has used a Cyber-Physical Systems (or CPS) approach to consider the various aspects present into a maintenance environment. The CPS is a new paradigm that seeks to combine and coordinate physical and computational elements. In this paper, we propose a 2D/3D visualization tool for cyber-physical maintenance environments.

In this work, a model-based remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method is developed for induction motor with stator winding short circuit fault. The induction motor model with stator winding short circuit fault is introduced based on reference frame transformation theory. The winding short circuit fault is characterized by the fraction of short turns and the fault loop resistance. In this paper, the motor life is defined as the stator winding insulation life due to thermal stresses because from a thermal point of view, the stator winding insulation is the weakest part of induction motors. A particle filter method is used to realize unknown parameter estimation and RUL prediction. Simulation results are provided to validate the proposed method.

Thus, a critical task is to detect and isolate faults, as fast as possible, and restore optimal operating conditions in the shortest time. In this paper, a machine learning of graphical models approach is proposed for fault diagnosis of wind turbines, in particular pitch system. The role of the latter is to adjust the blade pitch angle by rotating it according to the current wind speed in order to optimize the wind turbine power production. This is achieved by a controller based on blade pitch angles measured by two redundant sensors in each blade. Without the sensor accuracy reading, the controller can be misled and fail to achieve the optimal control strategy according to the current operation conditions. In addition, pitch angle sensors complete failure can lead to dangerous actions of the controller; while fixed or drifted bias of sensor measurements may decrease the controllers efficiency. To better control and overcome these challenges, we propose a methodology that is based on Gaussian acyclic graphical models and the lasso estimate. The methodology has shown the ability to model, and diagnose faults that occur in the pitch system in wind turbines during its normal run and could lead to a fast recovery to the optimal operating conditions.

Motor parameters are not needed except for the number of rotor bars. At the same time, the reference speed and the load level do not significantly affect the diagnosis results.

In this paper, the electromagnetic stiffness is proposed. The slipping surface technique is cited. The submersible motors with inclined rotor is applied, and the influence of eccentricity rotor on electromagnetic stiffness is calculated theoretically and compared by finite element simulation, based on which the calculation modeling of electromagnetic stiffness is built. Furthermore the distribution of magnetic field energy as well as electromagnetic stiffness along the machine axis, in the submersible motors with inclined rotor, is obtained. The variation of magnetic field energy with eccentricity angle reflecting eccentricity level, and the relationship between electromagnetic stiffness and inclined angle alpha, are obtained respectively. Finally the reliability of model by comparing the simulation results with numerical analysis is presented. The investigation in this paper supports references in the eccentricity fault diagnosis for submersible motors and theoretical basis for study of rotor dynamics.

The measurement head comprises several integrated Hall sensors. Some of the disadvantages of other methods can be thus eliminated. The method does not require a high source current and long operation time, as it is in thermal method and it offers a better resolution than the ELCID method. A dedicated computer program is used for measurement and for visualization of results which could be similar to those obtaining from the thermal camera. The method is well applicable when handling synchronous generators and induction machines. The paper summarizes the field calculation data obtained by the FEM simulations.

The techniques used in each of these two stages are selected using performances criteria related to the goal of each stage. On the contrary, this paper presents a coupled approach to the design of the diagnostic system, by performing a comparative study to determine which combination of automated expert system and diagnostic techniques is the optimal one to detect faults of induction machines. This combined system can outperform traditional designs of diagnostic systems with two independent stages. The result of this study proves than a combination of SVM classifier with a method of obtaining fault features through the AC module of the analytical signal, generated with a Hilbert transform using a Welch transform is the best combination, providing a very high ratio of success about 98%.

Motor current signature analysis is a modern approach to diagnose faults of induction motors. The approach has some shortcomings that limit the accuracy of diagnosis. It is very vulnerable to the environmental noise, voltage harmonics, and operation of non-linear equipment. Particularly operation of other similar motors nearby may result in wrong warnings being signaled. As a result interpreting current signals usually requires extra calculation and considerations. This paper investigates the significance of propagated fault signatures through distributed power systems. The aim is to explain and quantify the different observations of fault signals and hence diagnoses machine faults with a higher accuracy. A systematic approach has been employed to estimate the influence of fault signals in the currents of neighboring electrical motors. Further analysis in attenuation of electrical signals leads to a graphical framework that evaluates propagation of fault signals in power networks. In order to implement the concept of distributed diagnosis, fault indices and propagation charts, have been employed. The solution then has been evaluated using a scaled down simulation model.

Particularly, rotor speed oscillation, neglected by many previous researches, is underlined which can largely change the fault characteristics in torque, speed and stator currents. Next, a faulty model is established in Ansoft Maxwell 2D software using finite element analysis method. Comparing the simulation results of a fixed-speed model with the ones at a changeable speed, the effects of speed oscillation is evidenced. In the end, a few more simulations are carried out to study the fault characteristics under different fault degrees. As expected, fault characteristics become more obvious with the increase of adjacent broken number. Furthermore, several new characteristics such as the reduction of average rotor speed are found in the simulation results, which can be seen as new bases for fault diagnosis.

Only one-step ahead forecasting of machine condition is considered because of the poor performance of multi-step ahead forecasting. To find effective method for non-stationary long-term machine condition prognostics, this paper firstly reviews multi-step ahead forecasting strategies followed with a comparison of different multi-step ahead forecasting strategies using support vector regression (SVR) and least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) in two datasets, and then develops an recursive multi-step LSSVR (MSLSSVR) model by introducing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to realize machine condition prognostics. EMD is used to get more stationary signals instead of the non-stationary original signal, and MSLSSVR is constructed to make multi-step prediction with decomposed signals individually. All predicted values are combined eventually to get the future trajectory of condition indicator. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is validated in the TE process. The experimental result shows that the proposed EMD-MSLSSVR model can forecast the failure status in advance, and the performance is satisfied.

However, hypervisor failure induced by soft errors will most likely affect multiple, if not all, VMs on a single physical host. Existing fault detection techniques are not well equipped to handle such hypervisor failures. In this paper, we propose a new soft error detection framework, Xentry (a sentry on soft error for Xen), that focuses on limiting error propagation within and from the hypervisor. In particular, we have designed a VM transition detection technique to identify incorrect control flow before VM execution resumes, and a runtime detection technique to shorten detection latency. This framework requires no hardware modification and has been implemented in the Xen hypervisor. The experiment results show that Xentry incurs very small performance overhead and detects over 99% of the injected faults.	[Xu, Xin; Chiang, Ron C.; Huang, H.

Proper FDCA enhance the machine's operational life, efficiency and reducing catastrophic failure. This paper describes a realistic FDCA method for three phase induction motors (IMs) using readily available data. External faults experienced by IM are monitored by proximal support vector machine (PSVM) and compared its performance with standard support vector machine and artificial neural network which revealed that PSVM algorithm is quite faster in investigations leading to reduction in computational load. RMS value of 3-phase voltages and currents are utilized as input variable in PSVM model to identify six types of external faults experienced by IM and normal operating (NF) condition. Testing analysis of 160 samples has been carried out to represent the robustness of the investigated seven status conditions for wide changes in operating and loading condition perturbation.

Vibration signals are almost always non-stationary since bearings are inherently dynamic (e.g., speed and load condition change over time). By using EMD, the complicated non-stationary vibration signal is decomposed into a number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal. Bi-spectrum, a third-order statistic, helps to identify phase coupling effects, the bi-spectrum is theoretically zero for Gaussian noise and it's flat for non-Gaussian white noise, consequently the bi-spectrum analysis is insensitive to random noise, which are useful for detecting faults in induction machines. Utilizing the advantages of EMD and bi-spectrum, this article proposes a joint method for detecting such faults, called bi-spectrum based EMD (BSEMD). First, original vibration signals collected from accelerometers are decomposed by EMD and a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is produced. Then, the IMF signals are analyzed via bi-spectrum to detect outer race bearing defects. The procedure is illustrated with the experimental bearing vibration data. The experimental results show that BSEMD techniques can effectively diagnosis bearing failures.

Fast processors, better RAM, better OS functionality and better storage options have given Smartphones and Tablets the capability to perform most functions for which previously a larger computing device was used. In this paper, we discuss about an application for performing Condition Based Monitoring (CBM) meant for Industrial Machines developed on two platforms namely Windows Mobile OS and Windows Tablet OS (Windows 8 Pro). The challenges faced in each platform and how they were encountered for making this into a successful app on Windows based smartphone & tablet for industrial use, have been thoroughly discussed in this paper. The application uses acoustic recordings and data mining techniques to distinguish between healthy and faulty states of a machine. The developed smartphone application was trained successfully on a reciprocating type air compressor for distinguishing Leakage Inlet Valve fault from Healthy state and was able to accurately detect the fault.

Their ability to include system model parameters as part of the system state vector is among one of the key factors for their use in prognostics. Estimation of system parameters along with the states produces an updated model that can be used for long-term prediction. This paper presents a novel method for uncertainty management in long-term prediction using particle filters. In our proposed approach, the observation prediction concept is applied in order to extend the system observation profiles (as time series) for future. Next, particles are propagated to future time instants according to the resampling algorithm instead of considering constant weights for their propagation in the prediction step. The uncertainty in the long-term prediction of system states and parameters are managed by utilizing fixed-lag dynamic linear models. The observation prediction is achieved along with an outer adjustment loop to change the observation injection window adaptively based on the Mahalanobis distance criteria. The proposed approach is applied to predict the health of a gas turbine system that is affected by the degradation in the system health parameters.

Impact of Wavelets and Filter on Vibration-based Mechanical Rub Detection using Neural Networks	2014 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)	DEC 11-13, 2014	Pune, INDIA	YASHADA, MDC, IEEE Pune Sect, IEEE		Condition Monitoring; Mechanical Rub; Wavelet; RBF Neural Network; Filters	FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	The Discrete Wavelet Transform has been widely used as a mathematical tool for vibration signal analyses in Condition Monitoring Systems for the past couple of decades. But like any transformation, an effective analysis is largely dependent on the noise characteristics associated with the acquired signal, which inevitably degrades its performance. A quantitative evaluation of the impact of both filtering regimen and wavelet family on vibration analysis is presented in this paper. The classification error associated with the training of a Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network is used to quantify the performance of different filtering routines and wavelet families. Faults associated with mechanical rubbing have been considered in the present research and the results indicate that a generous performance enhancement, reaching as high as 28 percent is possible when an effective filter-wavelet combination is used leading to a more reliable detection of mechanical rubbing faults in rotating machinery.

While most of the focus in the challenge was on applying sophisticated machine learning algorithms, little attention was paid to the preprocessing performed on the data a priori. We compare four standard pre-processing methods with a novel Box-Cox outlier rejection technique and analyze their effect on machine learning classifiers for predicting the mortality of ICU patients. The best machine learning model utilized the proposed preprocessing method and achieved an AUROC of 0.848. In general, the AUROC of models using our novel preprocessing method increased, and this increase was as much as 0.02 in some cases. Furthermore, the use of preprocessing improved the performance of regression models to a higher level than that of non-linear techniques such as random forests. We demonstrate that proper preprocessing of the data prior to use in a prognostic model can significantly improve performance. This improvement can be even greater than that provided by more complex non-linear machine learning algorithms.	[Johnson, Alistair E.

The phase angles, reported by the PMUs at the generator buses are used for estimating the MLE of the system. The sign and the magnitude of the MLE serve as indicators to the stability of the system. The method utilized for estimation of the MLE is independent of the system model and is solely based on the measurement data of the system states, which can be obtained from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). Different combination of fault duration and location are simulated to analyze the system stability using MLE on 3 machine 9 bus system and 10 machine New England (NE) 39 bus system.

Because of their good performance and their mathematical foundations, SVMs are gaining popularity in solving various diagnosis problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach using a SVMs to solve the the systemlevel fault diagnosis problem under the generalized comparison model (GCM). The GCM assumes that a set of tasks is assigned to pairs of nodes and their outcomes are compared by neighboring nodes. Given that comparisons are performed by the nodes themselves, faulty nodes can incorrectly claim that fault-free nodes are faulty or that faulty ones are faultfree. The collections of all matches and mismatches, i. e., the comparison outcomes, among the nodes are used to identify the set of permanently faulty nodes. First, we show how SVMs can be adapted to the GCM-based diagnosis problem. Then, from the results of an extensive simulation study we show that the new diagnosis approach succeeded in identifying all faulty nodes in in the faults situations considered under tdiagnosable systems. The simulations demonstrate that the SVM-based diagnosis approach remarkably identified all faulty nodes, with a diagnosis correctness of 100% and with very low diagnosis latencies, providing hence an effective solution to the system-level self-diagnosis problem.

In this paper, a novel prediction method for analog circuits is proposed. In this method, time domain output waveforms in initial state and components degradation state are extracted at first; then white noise estimation is conducted to estimate the change between waveforms according to principles of noise estimation based on Kalman filter so as to obtain more reasonable fault indicators from more complete information; thereafter, a novel degradation tendency model of analog circuits is constructed according to newly obtained fault indicators, model adaption is conducted to the new model through particle filter, and prognostic method is conducted to remaining useful performance of analog circuits. Finally, experimental verification is conducted to the above conclusion.

A new teaching tool for fault detection in the induction machine	2014 IEEE 23RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE)	Proceedings of the IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	JUN 01-04, 2014	Istanbul, TURKEY	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Bogazici Univ		fault diagnosis; education; induction machine	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; REMOTE LABORATORIES; DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; EDUCATION	The study of fault detection and diagnosis of electrical machines is nowadays a very important issue, particularly regarding induction machines. However giving students or engineers practical experience in this field requires a large investment from teaching institutions. This paper presents an experimental system used to provide students or engineers with some practical experience in induction machine's fault detection. The major advantage of the described tool is that it can work with a standard healthy induction machine. This system is based on only one machine that will be operated under faulty operation modes, allowing testing several fault types, such as stator winding faults, bearing faults or broken bars. A human machine interface with several options is also presented. This interface allows not only controlling the induction machine but also to perform some learning exercises as well providing documentation about the induction machine and fault detection procedures.

However, the previous data-driven approaches mostly focused on sample fitting or next-step prediction without adequate evaluation on their long-term predictive capability. This paper investigates three multi-step-ahead prediction strategies for data-driven software reliability models and compares their predictive performance on failure count data and time between failure data. Then, the model with the outstanding strategy on each data type is compared with conventional software reliability growth models. We found that the Recursive strategy gives better prediction for fault count data, while no strategy is superior to the others for time between failure data. Such data-driven approach with the best input domain showed performance as good as the best one among the software reliability growth models in long-term prediction. These results indicate the applicability of data-driven methods even in long-term prediction and help reliability practitioners to identify an appropriate multi-step prediction strategy for software reliability.

Excessive motor vibration is one of the serious problems related with this type of drive. The aim of this presentation is a comprehensive analysis of the origin of vibration in induction motors operating with VFD. This presentation is based on the author's many years of experience in the field of electrical machinery vibration diagnostics. Case histories from VSC's field service files covering assorted industries represent typical vibration problems of induction motors operating with VFD. Among them are: a resonance condition on the equipment at a certain operating speed, motor bearing deterioration due to high frequency current impulses coming through the motor shaft and bearings and voltage and current distortion, resulting in motor casing vibration, shaft torsional vibration and speed pulsation. Practical recommendations to prevent excessive vibration on the motor operating with VFD are also presented.

The most general approach, called Byzantine fault tolerance, can mask arbitrary failures. Yet it is often considered too costly to deploy in practice, and many solutions are not resilient to performance attacks. To address this concern we leverage two key technologies already widely deployed in cloud computing infrastructures: replicated state machines and intrusion detection systems. First, we have designed a general framework for constructing Byzantine failure detectors based on an intrusion detection system. Based on such a failure detector, we have designed and built a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol, which has costs comparable to crash-resilient protocols like Paxos. More importantly, our protocol is particularly robust against several key attacks such as flooding attacks, timing attacks, and fairness attacks, that are typically not handled well by Byzantine fault masking procedures.

Accelerated tests were performed on connectors for future development of a reliability model. Thousands of hours of damp heat and atmospheric corrosion tests found BOS connectors to be resilient to corrosion-related degradation. A procedure was also developed to evaluate new and aged connectors for arc fault risk. The measurements show that arc fault risk is dependent on a combination of materials composition as well as design geometry. Thermal measurements as well as optical emission spectroscopy were also performed to further characterize the arc plasma. Together, the degradation model, arc fault risk assessment technique, and characterization methods can provide operators of photovoltaic installations information necessary to develop a data-driven plan for BOS connector maintenance as well as identify opportunities for arc fault prognostics.

The incipient faults are monitored by conventional and artificial intelligence (AI) based models. In this paper, the Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) has been utilized to identify the incipient type of faults in an oil-immersed power transformer. Its performance is compared with traditional IEC/IEEE and AI methods (i.e. ANN and SVM). The juxtaposition of fault classification of ANN and SVM method notify that proposed approach is much swiftly. Simultaneous identification of oil immersed power transformer incipient faults has never been identified formerly by using Multi-PSVM. The desired test analysis of experimental data from working transformers in the Northern Power Grid of India has been executed to present the robustness of evaluated incipient faults for large variation in loading and operational conditions perturbations.

The FW-PHM Suite is a set of web-based diagnostic and prognostic tools and databases that serves as an integrated health monitoring architecture. The FW-PHM Suite has four main modules: (1) Diagnostic Advisor, (2) Asset Fault Signature Database, (3) Remaining Useful Life Advisor, and (4) Remaining Useful Life Database. This paper focuses on development of asset fault signatures to assess the health status of generator step-up generators and emergency diesel generators in nuclear power plants. Asset fault signatures describe distinctive features based on technical examinations that can be used to detect a specific fault type. At the most basic level, fault signatures are comprised of an asset type, a fault type, and a set of one or more fault features (symptoms) that are indicative of the specified fault. The Asset Fault Signature Database is populated with asset fault signatures via a content development exercise that is based on the results of intensive technical research and on the knowledge and experience of technical experts. The developed fault signatures capture this knowledge and implement it in a standardized approach, thereby streamlining the diagnostic and prognostic process. This will support the automation of proactive online monitoring techniques in nuclear power plants to diagnose incipient faults, perform proactive maintenance, and estimate the remaining useful life of assets.

The algorithm utilizes the asset's state history to learn a prognostic model from data. The prognostic model comprises an ensemble of Auto-Regressive (AR) models, together with a state-of-the-art classifier. The AR part of the algorithm is used to predict the system's state evolution. The classifier discriminates between healthy and faulty operation, given the asset's current state. The predicted state, as computed by the AR model, is fed to the classifier. The first time when the predicted state is classified as faulty is returned as the RUL of the system. The resulting prognostic algorithm was tested on the CMAPSS dataset as provided from NASA Ames Research Center. Cases of unknown future input trajectory as well as cases with multiple faults have been investigated.

A robust derivative of the Mahalanobis distance is employed to accurately and precisely encapsulate varying fault behaviours, which can then be exploited for the purposes of fault detection and identification. Domain knowledge in the form of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) can be incorporated into the model, to determine potential failure modes. Seeded fault data was employed to derive the shape and location estimates to enable the use of a multivariate distance function. To reduce the computational complexity whilst simultaneously increasing sensitivity to the faults, the high frequency (48KHz) accelerometer data was pre-processed into a 4-tuple consisting of the Skewness, Kurtosis, Root mean square (RMS) and Shannon Entropy. This 4-tuple is shown to encapsulate and discriminate all fault modes identified through the FMEA, whilst reducing the data to 1Hz, allowing for the both exact, and meta-heuristic algorithms to be employed for robust analysis. Sensitivity to minimal fault development is demonstrated, with the technique accurately identifying 0.007 '' diameter inner race, outer race and roller element faults which had been seeded to the bearing through electro-discharge machining. To demonstrate the practicalities of the approach, the trained system is employed for analysis of an independent dataset, collected under different conditions. The technique is shown to accurately detect and identify the relevant fault mode pre-emptively, before catastrophic failure occurred, with 28.6% of bearing life remaining.

Especially, PF can provide uncertainty representation and management on estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of components and systems. However, particle degeneracy phenomenon limits its performance and application in most of the situations. Therefore, several re-sampling algorithms are proposed to alleviate this problem. Thus, different re-sampling algorithms should be focused and studied for the adaptability and applicability in RUL estimation. This work aims to compare the capabilities of different re-sampling algorithms and evaluate the performance in lithium-ion battery RUL prediction. Four re-sampling algorithms including multinomial re-sampling, residual re-sampling stratified re-sampling and systematic re-sampling are involved and analyzed. Actual battery test data sets from NASA PCoE are used to conduct experiments for evaluation and comparison. Moreover, some quantitative analysis metrics are applied to compare the results of battery RUL estimation.

The purpose is to provide a production scheduling that maximizes the production horizon. The use of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results in the form of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) allows to adapt the schedule to the wear and tear of equipment. This work comes within the scope of Prognostics Decision Making (DM). Each considered machine is supposed to be able to provide several throughputs corresponding to different operating conditions. The key point is to select the appropriate profile for each machine during the whole useful life of the platform. Many heuristics are proposed to cope with this decision problem and are compared through simulation results. Simulations assess the efficiency of these heuristics. Distance to the theoretical maximal value comes close to 10% for the most efficient ones. A repair module performing a revision of the schedules provided by the heuristics is moreover proposed to enhance the results. First results are promising.

To ensure Li-ion batteries in these devices operate reliably, it is important to be able to assess the capacity of Li-ion battery and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) throughout the whole life-time. This paper presents an integrated method for the capacity estimation and RUL prediction of Li-ion battery used in implantable medical devices. A state projection scheme from the author's previous study is used for the capacity estimation. Then, based on the capacity estimates, the Gauss-Hermite particle filter technique is used to project the capacity fade to the end-of-service (EOS) value (or the failure limit) for the RUL prediction. Results of 10 years' continuous cycling test on Li-ion prismatic cells in the lab suggest that the proposed method achieves good accuracy in the capacity estimation and captures the uncertainty in the RUL prediction.

Even if this technology is close to being competitive, it still suffers from too short life duration. As a consequence, prognostic seems to be a great solution to anticipate PEMFC stacks degradation. However, a PEMFC implies multiphysics and multiscale phenomena making the construction of an aging model only based on physics very complex. One solution consists in using a hybrid approach for prognostics combining the use of models and available data. Among these hybrid approaches, particle filtering methods seem to be really appropriate as they offer the possibility to compute models with time varying parameters and to update them all along the prognostics process. But to be efficient, not only should the prognostics system take into account the aging of the stack but also external events influencing this aging. Indeed, some acquisition techniques introduce disturbances in the fuel cell behavior and a voltage recovery can be observed at the end of the characterization process. This paper proposes to tackle this problem. First, PEMFC fuel cells and their complexities are introduced. Then, the impact of characterization of the fuel cell behavior is described. Empirical models are built and introduced in both learning and prediction phases of the prognostics model by combining three particle filters. The new prognostic framework is used to perform remaining useful life estimates and the whole proposition is illustrated with a long term experiment data set of a PEMFC in constant load solicitation and stable operating conditions. Estimates can be given with an error less than 5% for life durations of more than 1000 hours. Finally, the results are compared to a previous work to show that introducing a disturbance modeling can dramatically reduce the uncertainty coming with the predictions.

A degenerated equivalent circuit model and hybrid prediction for state-of-health (SOH) of PEM fuel cell	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Annual International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 22-25, 2014	Spokane, WA	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE		Fuel cell; state-of-health (SOH) prediction; EIS spectra; equivalent circuit model; voltage prediction	PERFORMANCE; PROGNOSTICS; DURABILITY	The 2014 IEEE PHM data challenge problem deals with the state-of-health (SOH) of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) given two degradation data sets: (i) a reference data set (FC1) operated under constant current is fully given until 991 h and (ii) a test data set (FC2) operated under rippled current is partially given until 550h. The proposed research aims at predicting the SOH (or EIS spectra) of PEM fuel cell after 550h for FC2. First, a full scale equivalent circuit model (ECM) with 10 parameters is developed to describe the electrochemical physics of PEMFC more realistically. The model reduction is suggested because of limited data. Since some parameters remain nearly unchanged due to irrelevance to degradation, it is reasonable to use the degenerated 4-parameter ECM while fixing the other parameters at their means. Despite the model reduction, the degradation pattern is clearly observed through the degenerated 4-parameter ECM. Then the coefficients of the four parameters are estimated by building linear regression models between the parameters and voltage. Since the voltage change after 550h is not provided for FC2, the voltage degradation model is developed by modeling both reversible and irreversible degradation processes. This research also proposes a hybrid prognostic approach to the SOH (or EIS spectra) prediction. The voltage degradation model and the degenerated 4-parameter ECM are first developed based on the observation of the physical phenomenon. They are then trained for the purpose of the SOH prediction with the training EIS data sets (FC1 and FC2). It is demonstrated that this hybrid SOH prediction offers highly accurate prediction of the SOH (or EIS spectra) at t = 666, 830, and 1016h. Moreover, possible error sources are also discussed to further improve the prediction accuracy in future.

Though a lot of work is currently being conducted to develop PHM systems for fuel cells, various challenges have been encountered including the self-healing effect after characterization as well as accelerated degradation due to dynamic loading, all which make RUL predictions a difficult task. In this study, a prognostic approach based on adaptive particle filter algorithm is proposed. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the introduction of a self-healing factor after each characterization and the adaption of the degradation model parameters to fit to the changing degradation trend. An ensemble of five different state models based on weighted mean is then developed. The results show that the method is effective in estimating the remaining useful life of PEM fuel cells, with majority of the predictions falling within 5% error. The method was employed in the IEEE 2014 PHM Data Challenge and led to our team emerging the winner of the RUL category of the challenge.

Thus arise the need for proper online tool condition monitoring methods, in order to minimize error and waste of work-material. In this study, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Bayes classifier are used to develop such a system for automatic drilling operations with the help of vibration signals. The performances of models generated by these classifiers are compared with each other in order to establish the best method. As the vibration signals were acquired under different drilling parameters, this study also tries to understand the events in drilling process that help in ease of fault classification. Three different kinds of wears were studied and later compared to understand the degree or magnitude of effect of wears on the drilling process and signals.

With the time the cutting tool wear out and affects the surface quality. Hence it is very important to monitor the condition of the cutting tool to avoid the production of substandard parts. In this work the face milling cutter is made to interact with hardened steel components to manufacture the required surfaces with a specified amount of stock removal. The cutting conditions are selected and machining is done till the tool reaches its critical flank wear value. The captured surface images are analyzed using the statistical and spectral texture analysis methods. The flank wear of the cutting insert is measured at frequent intervals. The evaluated texture features are correlated with the flank wear using the multivariate correlation methods. The significant features are selected based on the correlation value and its mutual correlation value with other features. The selected texture features are plotted against machining time or the number of components. The developed regression model based on the selected parameters and the time is used to predict the flank wear.	[Kumar, K.

The increase in the gold price has motivated the industry search for alternative to the gold wire used in wire bonding and the transition to copper wire bonding technology. Potential advantages of transition to Cu-Al wire bond system includes low cost of copper wire, lower thermal resistivity, lower electrical resistivity, higher deformation strength, damage during ultrasonic squeeze, and stability compared to gold wire. However, the transition to the copper wire brings along some trade-offs including poor corrosion resistance, narrow process window, higher hardness, and potential for cratering. Formation of excessive Cu-Al intermetallics may increase electrical resistance and reduce the mechanical bonding strength. Current state-of-art for studying the Cu-Al system focuses on accumulation of statistically significant number of failures under accelerated testing. In this paper, a new approach has been developed to identify the occurrence of impending apparently-random defect fall-outs and pre-mature failures observed in the Cu-Al wirebond system. The use of intermetallic thickness, composition and corrosion as a leading indicator of failure for assessment of remaining useful life for Cu-al wirebond interconnects has been studied under exposure to high temperature and temperature-humidity. Damage in wire bonds has been studied using x-ray Micro-CT. Microstructure evolution was studied under isothermal aging conditions of 150 degrees C, 175 degrees C, and 200 degrees C till failure. Activation energy was calculated using growth rate of intermetallic at different temperatures. Effect of temperature and humidity on Cu-Al wirebond system was studied using Parr Bomb technique at different elevated temperature and humidity conditions (110 degrees C/100% RH, 120 degrees C/100% RH, 130 degrees C/100% RH) and failure mechanism was developed. The present methodology uses evolution of the IMC thickness, composition in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to identify accrued damage in wire bond subjected to thermal aging.

Progress Towards Prognostic Health Management of Passive Components in Advanced Small Modular Reactors	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Annual International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 22-25, 2014	Spokane, WA	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE		Small Modular Reactors; passive components; prognostics; particle filter; thermal creep	BARKHAUSEN NOISE; DAMAGE; FATIGUE; WAVES; POWER; NDE	Sustainable nuclear power to promote energy security and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are two key national energy priorities. The development of deployable small modular reactors (SMRs) is expected to support these objectives by developing technologies that improve the reliability, sustain safety, and improve affordability of new reactors. Advanced SMRs (AdvSMRs) refer to a specific class of SMRs and are based on modularization of advanced reactor concepts. Prognostic health management (PHM) systems can benefit both the safety and economics of deploying AdvSMRs and can play an essential role in managing the inspection and maintenance of passive components in AdvSMR systems. This paper describes progress on development of an experimental setup for testing and validation of PHM systems for AdvSMR passive components. The experimental set-up for validation of prognostic algorithms is focused on thermal creep degradation as the prototypic degradation mechanism. The test bed enables accelerated thermal creep aging of materials relevant to AdvSMRs along with multiple nondestructive evaluation (NDE) measurements for assessment of thermal creep damage. NDE techniques include eddy current, magnetic Barkhausen noise (MBN), and linear and non-linear ultrasonic measurements. Details of the test-bed design as well as initial measurements results for specimens at different levels of thermal creep damage are presented.	[Meyer, R. M.; Ramuhalli, P.; Hirt, E. H.; Pardini, A.

Integrated Bayesian Framework for Remaining Useful Life Prediction	2014 IEEE CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (PHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Annual International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)	JUN 22-25, 2014	Spokane, WA	IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE				In this paper, a data-driven method for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is presented. The method learns the relation between acquired sensor data and end of life time (EOL) to predict the RUL. The proposed method extracts monotonic trends from offline sensor signals, which are used to build reference models. From online signals the method represents the uncertainty about the current status, using discrete Bayesian filter. Finally, the method predicts RUL of the monitored component using integrated method based on K-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using two real data sets from NASA Ames prognostics data repository. The results show that the algorithm obtain good results for both application.

One of the main tasks of the Prognostics and Health Management is the Failure Prognostics, specifically to provide predictive information regarding Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of device using prognostic systems. But sometimes it is necessary to get inflexible answer for closed type question: Is current device within critical zone or not? In other words, is RUL of device less than pre-defined Critical Value or not? To solve this problem, two approaches may be considered: Regression Approach: to predict RUL value and compare results with critical value Classification Approach: to recognize directly entering the critical zone In general, Classification Approach is more preferred for recognition tasks, but some aspects of the approach prevent to get an evident answer. Two models, based on modifications of the SVM method- SVC (Support Vector Classification) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) are proposed for consideration. Suggested methodology and algorithms were verified on the NASA Aircraft Engine database (http: //ti. arc. nas a. govitech/dashipcoe/prognostic-datarepository/). Numerical examples, based on this database, have been also considered.

Operating condition is used to describe the state or environment of a system. This approach is suit for the dataset that contains sensor measurements and operational settings. Predicting RUL contains two stages: modeling stage using the training dataset and predicting stage using the result of modeling and testing dataset. This approach can increase available information in modeling stage and simulate the actual work situation of the test unit in the predicting stage. The performance of this approach was tested by the dataset from 2008 PHM Data Challenge Competition where sensor measurements and operational settings were provided. The task of the competition was to estimate the RUL of an unspecified system. The results showed that this prognostic method could get accurate predictions in most situations and had a good rank in all competition results.

In many applications unsupervised learning techniques are preferred in fault detection due to the lack of training data. Unsupervised learning techniques such as k-means clustering are most widely used in machinery health monitoring. These methods face two challenges: firstly, they cannot cluster non-convex data, which may have arbitrary shape; secondly, no rule has been established for these techniques to find a fault threshold. This paper introduces a fault detection methodology based on density clustering to address these challenges. This methodology assumes that data from healthy bearings is located in regions with a high density and data from faulty bearings is located in low density regions. By finding boundaries of these regions, which may be non-convex, data from faulty bearings can be identified. In this paper the value of the density for healthy bearings and faulty bearings is evaluated. The rate of change of the density from healthy to faulty is identified as a fault threshold. The methodology is validated by experimental data. This methodology can be applied to applications where faulty data are too difficult or costly to acquire. Also it can be used in applications where fault thresholds are difficult to determine.

The effectiveness of the technique for rotating machine fault diagnostics has been widely recognized. However, the use of the order tracking to non-rotating mechanism has not yet been exploited. The applications of order tracking logic to non-rotating mechanisms may greatly enhance the diagnostic abilities. In this paper, the fundamental rationale of order tracking analysis is commented and its suitability of the order tracking rationale to non-rotating mechanism is explored in an experimental cantilever beam setup. The comparisons between proposed signal processing method to traditional time and frequency methods are discussed. An improved prospective to understand non-rotating mechanism is proposed with the help of order tracking basics.

However, most of the prognostic methods of power converters are focus on the critical components of the converters. Furthermore, the methods seldom consider the effect of changes in operating conditions (e.g. power supply and load). In order to address these problems, an innovative system-level fault characteristic parameter (FCP) represents the degradation status of the entire converter is extracted, and a prognostic method of DC-DC converters based on the degradation trend prediction of the FCP is proposed. Firstly, the effect of component-level degradation on the overall performance of the DC-DC converters is studied. Then, a performance parameter of DC-DC converters which is sensitive to the degradation of all critical components is chosen, and a least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model is used to convert the performance parameter to the FCP under predetermined normal condition to eliminate the influence of changes in operating conditions. Finally, the trend prediction of the FCP is performed based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) to realize the prognosis of DC-DC converters. A Boost converter is taken as an illustrative example. Results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

A mathematical model used in the presented method was developed using winding function approach to provide indication references for induction motor parameters under load variation. The model shows a strong relationship between broken rotor bar fault and stator current. The method is based on analysis of stator current using discrete wavelet transform. To verify the proposed method a squirrel cage induction motor with 1, 2 and 3 broken bars at no-load, half-and full-load conditions was investigated. Obtained experimental results confirmed the validity of the proposed approach.

In regard with this, diagnosis schemes based on physical magnitudes acquisition, features calculation, features reduction and classification are being applied. However, in this paper, in order to enhance the condition monitoring capabilities, a forecasting approach is proposed, in which not only the current status of the system under monitoring in identified, diagnosis, but also the future condition is assessed, prognosis. The novelties of the proposed methodology are based on a distributed features forecasting approach by means of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system models.

Interestingly, the application of the conventional Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) leads to very uncertain diagnostics. This is attributed to the fact that the motors operate under variable load conditions; this makes the application of MCSA difficult. This problem is overcome by using a recent approach (Advanced Transient Current Signature Analysis) that is based on the advanced startup current analysis to further track rotor-fault-related harmonics in the resulting time-frequency maps. The interesting results included in the paper prove that, while MCSA leads to contradictory diagnostics for some of the motors, the new approach leads to very reliable patterns that are not affected by the machine's operation regime.

Evaluation of the Influence of Rotor Magnetic Anisotropy on Condition Monitoring of 2 Pole Induction Motors	2014 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 14-18, 2014	Pittsburgh, PA	IEEE Power Electron And Ind Applicat Societies, IEEE Advancing Technol for Humanity, IEEE Power Elect Society, IAS IEEE Industry Applications Society			BAR; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES	Non grain-oriented silicon steel laminations used in electric machines show a small degree of non-ideal magnetic anisotropy, which is introduced during the rolling process. If the rotor laminations are punched and stacked in a uniform direction, magnetic asymmetry is present in the rotor core. In this paper, it is shown that rotor core anisotropy can produce twice slipfrequency, 2sf(s), modulation that can be misinterpreted as rotor faults in 2 pole induction motors when performing motor current signature analysis (MCSA). Unnecessary motor inspection due to false rotor fault alarms is a common on-going problem in the field, and it is shown for the first time in this work that rotor anisotropy is a root cause of false MCSA alarms in 2 pole induction motors. The influence of rotor core anisotropy is analyzed in detail, and it is shown that 2sf(s) components produced by the rotor fault and rotor anisotropy interact, making reliable fault detection difficult with MCSA. It is also shown that off-line testing is currently the only available means of detecting the fault, and on-line monitoring of the space harmonics-induced current components is proposed as a viable solution for providing reliable rotor fault detection for 2 pole motors with rotor anisotropy. The analysis and conclusions presented in this paper are verified through testing on custom built lab motors and on 3.3 kV motors.

In low power motors, the insulation degradations are principally due to the steep voltage variations caused by the voltage source converters (VSCs) that drive the machines. In the last years, the possibility to employ coaxial cables in the stator windings has been explored in order to enhance the capacity of the motors to withstand the great values of dv/dt that are achieved by the no-Si based power devices. In this paper a new method to detect the presence of incipient faults in PMSM with coaxial insulated winding is presented and compared with a previous solution. The different methods were extensively evaluated, by means simulations and experimental results, to determine their feasibility to be employed as on-line condition monitoring systems.

Knowledge of the nonlinear voltage-current characteristic of each inverter device is used to achieve these improvements. Three contributions are made in this paper to the field of inverter condition monitoring by using the characterization technique: use of the inverter device characteristics to improve a classifier-based diagnostic technique, direct use of the device characteristics for diagnosis, and improving the calculation of remaining useful life with the device characteristics. The diagnostic method improvements are verified experimentally by adding resistances to create an artificial fault. Thermal and electrical simulations are used to demonstrate the improvements made to the prognostic method.

The currents are analyzed using the well-known Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) producing a two-dimensional time-frequency representation. This representation contains information regarding the presence of a characteristic transient component but requires further processing before it can be fed into a standard classification algorithm. In this work, this part is performed using the two dimensional extension of Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) that can deal with the two dimensional representation of STFT. The results (with both simulated and experimental data) suggest that the method can be used for the automatic detection of broken bars and even for determining the fault severity. Moreover, its low computational burden makes it ideal for its future use in online, unsupervised systems, as well as in portable condition monitoring devices	[Georgoulas, George; Karvelis, Petros; Stylios, Chysostomos D.] TEI Epirus, Dept Comp Engn, Lab Knowledge & Intelligent Comp, Artas 47100, Kostakioi, Greece; [Tsoumas, Ioannis P.] Siemens Ind Sector Drive Technol, Larges Drives R&D Dept, Nurnberg, Germany; [Alfonso Antonino-Daviu, Jose; Climente-Alarcon, Vicente] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Ingn Energet, Valencia, Spain		Georgoulas, G (corresponding author), TEI Epirus, Dept Comp Engn, Lab Knowledge & Intelligent Comp, Artas 47100, Kostakioi, Greece.	georgoul@kic.teiep.gr; pkarvelis@kic.teiep.gr; stylios@teiep.gr; ytsoumas@ieee.com; joanda@die.upv.es; viclial@ieee.org	Stylios, Chrysostomos/AAQ-6446-2020; Stylios, Chrysostomos/A-4029-2010; Karvelis, Petros/ABG-9977-2021; Tsoumas, Ioannis/T-9135-2019	Stylios, Chrysostomos/0000-0002-2888-6515; Karvelis, Petros/0000-0002-0483-4868; Tsoumas, Ioannis/0000-0003-1176-2564; ANTONINO-DAVIU, JOSE ALFONSO/0000-0003-1898-2228; Climente-Alarcon, Vicente/0000-0002-1273-8454			Antonino-Daviu J, 2013, IEEE T IND INFORM, V9, P100, DOI 10.1109/TII.2012.2198659; Antonino-Daviu JA, 2006, IEEE T IND APPL, V42, P990, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2006.876082; Chen JS, 2010, IMAGE VISION COMPUT, V28, P343, DOI 10.1016/j.imavis.2009.06.004; Duda RO, 2002, PATTERN CLASSIFICATI; Faiz J., 2012, P IEEE INT C POW EL, P1; Filippetti F, 2000, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V47, P994, DOI 10.1109/41.873207; Georgoulas G, 2014, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V61, P4937, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2013.2284143; Japkowicz N, 2011, EVALUATING LEARNING; Jolliffe I, 2011, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT; Karvelis P, 2013, IEEE IND ELEC, P5526, DOI 10.1109/IECON.2013.6700038; Keogh E, 2001, SIGMOD REC, V30, P151, DOI 10.1145/376284.375680; Kia S.

However, PMSMs are not immune to electrical faults, which requires an efficient and reliable condition monitoring method to avoid downtime or even catastrophic failures. This paper introduces a novel diagnostic method for PMSM stator winding short-circuit faults, which are of the most common type of faults that could occur in PMSMs. The implementation of this new diagnostic method is based on pattern identification of the loci of the machine's current space vectors. This method is computationally efficient and does not require voltage or position sensors. Experimental verification shows that such a method can detect the short-circuit fault at an incipient stage better than other existing diagnostic methods.

An adaptive feature extraction algorithm is employed to effectively extract the features of gearbox faults from the stator current signal of an AC machine connected to the gearbox. The multiclass GA-SVM classifier is used to identify the faults in the gearbox according to the fault features extracted. A GA is designed to find the optimal parameters of the SVM to obtain the best classification accuracy. The proposed hybrid classifier is validated on a gearbox connected with a permanent-magnet synchronous machine with three different faults. Experimental results show that the multiple types of gearbox faults can be effectively identified and classified by the proposed hybrid classifier with better accuracy than the traditional SVM classifier.

The M2M communication enables two M2M devices in proximity of each other to establish a direct local link and bypass the base station. Machine-to-machine communication can be applied to various important fields, such as military applications, public safety, environmental monitoring, commercial and social networking, and health and medical monitoring, ect. Hence the networks must exclude the faulty devices or faulty sensors to ensure the network Quality of Service (QoS). Fault detection is highly preferred on machine-to-machine communication networks. Device fault can be divided into two types: hard fault and soft fault. We will give a mechanism with capability to detect and distinguish soft fault devices. The simulation results indicate when a large number of machine-to-machine devices under a machine-to-machine communication network, the false alarm rate of the soft fault detection mechanism is close to 0% and the detection accuracy of it is close to 100%	[Shih, Yuan-Kang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Intel NTU Connected Context Comp Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wei, Hung-Yu] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan		Wei, HY (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.	ykshih@ntu.edu.tw; hywei@ntu.edu.tw					BARSI F, 1976, IEEE T COMPUT, V25, P585; Chao SL, 2013, IEEE COMMUN LETT, V17, P2300, DOI 10.1109/LCOMM.2013.101713.131839; Chen JQ, 2006, 2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION ACQUISITION, VOLS 1 AND 2, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, P65, DOI 10.1109/ICIA.2006.305813; Cheng MY, 2012, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V50, P38, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2012.6211484; Doppler K, 2009, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V47, P42, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2009.5350367; ELHADEF M, 2006, P 9 ACM INT S MOD AN, P165; GUO S, 2009, P 7 ACM C EMB NETW S, P253, DOI DOI 10.1145/1644038.1644064; Hao RX, 2013, IEEE T COMPUT, V62, P827, DOI 10.1109/TC.2012.15; Hsieh SY, 2013, IEEE T COMPUT, V62, P839, DOI 10.1109/TC.2012.18; Jiang P, 2009, SENSORS-BASEL, V9, P1282, DOI 10.3390/s90201282; Koushanfar F., 2003, P IEEE SENS, V2, P22; Lin CK, 2013, IEEE T RELIAB, V62, P800, DOI 10.1109/TR.2013.2285031; Mahapatro A, 2013, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V15, P2000, DOI 10.1109/SURV.2013.030713.00062; Mehlfuhrer C, 2011, EURASIP J ADV SIG PR, DOI 10.1186/1687-6180-2011-29; Miao X., 2011, P 30 IEEE INT C COMP, P1548; Ramanathan N., 2005, P 3 INT C EMB NETW S, P255, DOI DOI 10.1145/1098918.1098946; Study on LTE Device to Device Proximity Services, 2014, 36843 3GPP TR; Wu D, 2014, IEEE T VEH TECHNOL, V63, P2093, DOI 10.1109/TVT.2014.2311580; Yaacoub E., 2012, 2012 IEEE GLOB WORKS	19	2	2	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4799-5967-9				2014							340	343		10.1109/iThings.2014.63			4	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BF3JG	WOS:000380548400054					2022-02-14

These pipelines are often subject to failures like erosion, sabotage and theft, causing high financial, environmental and health risks. Therefore, detecting leakages, estimating its size and location is very important. Current pipeline monitoring systems needs to be more automated, efficient and accurate methods for continuous inspection/reporting about faults. For this purpose, several pattern recognition and data mining techniques have been brought into the research community. In light of the issues of low efficiency and high false alarm rates in traditional pipeline condition monitoring, in this paper, we have used negative pressure wave (NPW) coupled with intelligent machine learning techniques integrated in distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) to identify specific events beased on raw data gathered by individual sensor nodes. This collaborative approach reduces communication overhead to minimum by processing raw data on sensor nodes directly and reporting the detected events only. We apply the methods of support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in multidimensional feature space. The suggested technique is validated using a serial publication of experimentation on a field deployed test bed, with regard to performance of detection of leakages in pipelines.

The monitoring stage in the area of failure detection and isolation aims to classify and arrange the failure sources. In case of BLDC machines, one of the most important methods for failure detection and diagnosis starts with the analysis of the variations of the machine estimated parameters. The paper focuses on the implementation details of failure detection and diagnosis based on continuous time parameters estimation of BLDC motor mathematical model. Continuous time parameters are directly related to the physical characterizations of BLDC Motor. The parameters are estimated by the well-known prediction error methods devised for dynamic system identification. By changing the process coefficients and by applying statistical decision methods, failure detection occurs. The case of frequency domain identification in fail detection is also covered on a real CNC machine. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with the particular case of Goertzel algorithms is implemented for fault detection purposes. Unlike existing work and results in the fault detection area, the failure can be detected among time-varying process parameters.	[Dobra, P.; Dobra, M.; Moga, D.; Sita, V.

Terabytes of data is generated on a daily basis during similar to 500 steps in semiconductor chip processing. During this complex manufacturing process, equipment downtime may cause a significant loss of productivity and profit. In this paper, we are going to explore the predictive analytical algorithms and big data techniques in helping to achieve near-zero equipment downtime in the fabrication unit and to improve OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), which is a key machine manufacturing productivity metric.

Predictive analytics (using advanced machine learning) is particularly valuable in manufacturing, as it leads to production improvement with respect to the cost, quantity, quality and sustainability of manufactured products by anticipating changes to the manufacturing system states. Many small and medium manufacturers do not have the infrastructure, technical capability or financial means to take advantage of predictive analytics. A domain-specific language and framework for performing predictive analytics for manufacturing and production frameworks can counter this deficiency. In this paper, we survey some of the applications of predictive analytics in manufacturing and we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed. Then, we propose a core set of abstractions and a domain-specific framework for applying predictive analytics on manufacturing applications. Such a framework will allow manufacturers to take advantage of predictive analytics to improve their production.

Although a PDAC patient who is diagnosed at an early stage would have a substantial increase in chance of survival, the survival rate is poor because there is no efficient non-invasive diagnostic test in the early stage. In this study, we developed an efficient prediction models to detect PDAC in its early stages. Our prediction models use both mRNA and miRNA expression data from 104 PDAC tissues and 17 normal pancreatic tissues using microarray technology. After quality control, we built prediction models based on support vector machine (SVM) from mRNA and miRNA expressions for detecting early PDAC. To prevent over-fitting effect, we conducted leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and 5-fold cross validation (CV). For independent validation of prediction models, we performed evaluation on independent datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). After the validation, we identified 28 single markers and 231 combinations of markers with powerful prediction performance. In addition, the marker candidates are annotated with cancer pathways using gene ontology analysis. Our prediction models for PDAC may have potential for early diagnosis of PDAC.

Currently, physicians commonly use histological grade, which is determined by pathologists via performing a semi-quantitative analysis of three histological and cytological features on Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) stained histopathological images, to assess the prognosis of a breast cancer patient and the treatment option. In order to efficiently and objectively make full use of the underlying invaluable information in HE stained histopathological images, this work proposes a computational method to extract the potential morphological information as features to establish an classification model for the prognosis of cancer. Firstly, we propose a method based on the pixel-wise support vector machine (SVM) classifier for segmenting tumor nests-stroma and a method based on the marker-controlled watershed for segmenting cell nucleus, then we subclassify all image objects and extract a rich set of predefined quantitative morphological features. Secondly, a classification model based on these measurements is used to predict the binary patients' outcome of 8-year disease free survival (8-DFS). Finally, the predict model is tested on two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method, providing valuable and reasonable prognosis information for breast cancer.

The advancement of resilience technologies greatly depends on a deeper understanding of faults arising from hardware and software components. This understanding has the potential to help us build better fault tolerance technologies. For instance, it has been proved that combining checkpointing and failure prediction leads to longer checkpoint intervals, which in turn leads to fewer total checkpoints. In this paper we present a new approach for fault detection based on the Void Search (VS) algorithm. VS is used primarily in astrophysics for finding areas of space that have a very low density of galaxies. We evaluate our algorithm using real environmental logs from Mira Blue Gene/Q supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory. Our experiments show that our approach can detect almost all faults (i.e., sensitivity close to 1) with a low false positive rate (i.e., specificity values above 0.7). We also compare our algorithm with a number of existing detection algorithms, and find that ours outperforms all of them.

The best subset contains the minimum number of dimensions retaining a suitably high accuracy on classifier in representing the original features. The objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the number of input features thus to identify the key features and eliminating irrelevant features with no predictive information using clustering technique, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and rough set. This paper deals with two partition based clustering algorithm in data mining namely K-Means and Fuzzy C Means (FCM). These two algorithms are implemented for original data set without considering the class labels and further rough set theory implemented on the partitioned data set to generate feature subset after removing the outlier by using KNN. Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets derived from UCI machine learning database are used for the purpose of testing the proposed hybrid method. The results show that the hybrid method is able to produce more accurate diagnosis and prognosis results than the full input model with respect to the classification accuracy.

There are many functions that can be carried out by industrial robots, and they represent the basic building blocks of the production sector. The ability to continuously monitor the status and condition of robots has become an important research issue in recent years and is now receiving considerable attention. Many types of signals can be used for the detection of faults in industrial robots, such as vibrations and acoustic emissions. However, the most important thing is how these signals are processed in appropriate ways in order to extract the most salient features related to specific robot faults. Thus, signal processing step plays a significant role in the fault detection process for any machine and especially for industrial robots. Therefore, the wavelet transform has been utilized in this research for the detection of faults in an industrial robot. In order to build an accurate fault detection system a number of parameters in the wavelet analysis need to be adjusted carefully. The main focus of this research is to discuss the appropriate selection of these parameters, and then to build a fault detection system for the robot based on LabView programming.

Given massive amount of data collected from electronic wayside detectors, railcar failure prediction has recently attracted great attention in order to reduce rolling stock inspection and maintenance costs and improve railway safety. In this work, we present a methodology to predict the failure times of railcar wheels and trucks, by fusing sensor signals from three types of wayside detectors, including Wheel Impact Load Detector (WILD), Machine Vision (MV) systems, and Optical Geometry Detectors (OGD). In data preprocessing, missing values are handled by missForest, a Random Forest based nonparametric missing value imputation algorithm, and a variety of new features are generated to capture the signal characteristics. Several state-of-the-art regression models are built and compared to predict the lifetime of railcar wheels and trucks in a US national railway network.

And the backlash is one of the results of the feed-axis wear. Therefore, a novel kind of on-line feed-axis wear condition monitoring methods is proposed, which uses the backlash for estimating the status of the wear. Firstly, the on-line sensorless and rapid estimating principles of the feed-axis backlash are profoundly investigated. And the measuring method of translational and rotary axis backlash is respectively suggested. Secondly, to estimating the wear comprehensively, the testing route planning algorithms with circular-test and triangle-curve-test array are studied. Finally, the mathematical models have been established between the feed-axis wear condition and the backlash. The results of the experiment show it is feasible and effective to use the backlash for estimating feed-axis wear condition, which lays the foundation for its on-line condition monitoring and fault diagnoses.

Finally, the pressure sensor is analyzed, the results indicates that, it is effective to diagnose the fault state of sensor, and the data recovery is achieved using this method. It promoted the reliability of sensor.

Even though the induction machine is very reliable, many failures can occur due to their non-ideal operating conditions. Literature survey reveals that stator faults occupy a prominent place among the reasons for such failures. In particular, an undetected stator inter-turn fault may progressively lead to a permanent damage of the machine. Hence, early detection of stator inter-turn faults is essential for preventing damage to the adjacent coils and the core of the stator. Also, detection of stator inter-turn faults in the presence of supply unbalance is another challenging task. This paper proposes a new adaptive approach based on wavelet multi-resolution analysis for detecting and identifying the stator inter-turn faults. A fault index is defined based on the slope of detail coefficients to compare with an adaptive threshold for setting the flags. A fault is detected when the flag count reaches 6 over a moving window of 10 samples. Severity of the fault is identified by defining a sensitivity index based on the three phase energies of 4th level approximate coefficients. The proposed method is verified by using experimental data considering supply unbalance as well. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Devi, N.

To reduce the emission impact on environment, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations requires the on-board diagnostics (OBD) method to set a flag (fault code) once the catalyst reaches its threshold. In this work, we propose a support vector machine based non-intrusive classification method to diagnose the catalyst as it ages. To further improve the model robustness and to reduce the size of support vectors, multiple clustering algorithms were evaluated. The model was tested on multiple catalyst systems under various operating conditions and good results were observed.

Blue Gene/Q is the third generation of IBM's massively parallel, energy efficient Blue Gene series of supercomputers. In the experiments, we found 69 code fails. Out of these, 26 code fails are relevant for the calculation of the mean-time-between-failures (MTBF) for a 20 PetaFLOP, 96 rack system running a comparable workload mix. The expected MTBF for check-stops due to cosmic radiation and alpha particles from chip packaging materials is calculated to be 51 days for sea-level at New York City running the application mix studied. If the most vulnerable application is run exclusively, the projected MTBF is 35 days. These are outstanding results for a machine of this magnitude. The beaming experiment and projected MTBF validate the necessity to include autonomous hardware detection and recovery at the cost of design effort, silicon area and power.

Reasoning techniques increase the accuracy of functional-fault diagnosis based on the history of successfully repaired boards. However, depending on the complexity of the product, it usually takes several months to accumulate an adequate database for training a reasoning-based diagnosis system. During the initial product ramp-up phase, reasoning-based diagnosis is not feasible for yield learning, since the required database is not available due to lack of volume. We propose a knowledge-discovery method and a knowledge-transfer method for facilitating board-level functional fault diagnosis. First, an analysis technique based on machine learning is used to discover knowledge from syndromes, which can be used for training a diagnosis engine. Second, knowledge from diagnosis engines used for earlier-generation products can be automatically transferred through root-cause mapping and syndrome mapping based on keywords and board-structure similarities. Two complex boards in volume production and with a mature diagnosis system, and three new boards in the ramp-up phase, are used to validate the proposed knowledge-discovery and knowledge-transfer approach in terms of the diagnosis accuracy obtained using the new diagnosis systems.

Hence we propose an on-line stator winding inter-turn fault detection approach based on electromagnetic field signature. Search coil technique will be used to capture the main flux that pass through stator tooth. The magnetic flux distribution is obtained by an electromagnetic field model. This fault detection scheme is suitable for non-stationary operating electrical machine system. A permanent magnet synchronous machine will be used as the candidate machine in this study. Finite element method simulations are used to validate this proposed on-line detection scheme.	[Zhang, M. Q.; Tseng, K.

In this paper, a methodology has been developed for detecting HIF in distribution feeders. The method uses multi-resolution analysis with the help of Discrete Wavelet Transform to extract features of currents to be monitored on a feeder. These features are then used to train a Support Vector Machine for classification, i.e., to differentiate between HIF and switching events. Test results based on data obtained simulations on a prototype feeder show that the method is effective in identifying HIFs.

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of applying wavelet packet transform based on the sideband components, (1 2ks)fs., for broken rotor fault detection in induction machines. The wavelet-based method decomposes stator current signal into effective wavelet coefficients. It is shown that the root mean square (RMS) value of wavelet packet coefficients in special frequency bands collectively establishes a feature index. Once the broken rotor bar occurs, this index value increases to distinguish healthy and faulty mode of induction motor as well as fault severity. Additionally, we investigate the left sideband around the fundamental frequency (50Hz), (1 - 2s) f(s), which specifically represents the stator current spectrum of the machine when a rotor bar breakage takes place. An induction motor with one and two bar breakage at 35%, 50% and 80% of full load are investigated. The experimental tests indicate good reliability of different frequency resolution for same frequency component.

Alarm prediction in industrial machines using autoregressive LS-SVM models	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING (CIDM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM)	DEC 09-12, 2014	Orlando, FL	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			PROCESS FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS	In industrial machines different alarms are embedded in machines controllers. They make use of sensors and machine states to indicate to end-users various information (e.g. diagnostics or need of maintenance) or to put machines in a specific mode (e.g. shut-down when thermal protection is activated). More specifically, the alarms are often triggered based on comparing sensors data to a threshold defined in the controllers software. In batch production machines, triggering an alarm (e.g. thermal protection) in the middle of a batch production is crucial for the quality of the produced batch and results into a high production loss. This situation can be avoided if the settings of the production machine (e.g. production speed) is adjusted accordingly based on the temperature monitoring. Therefore, predicting a temperature alarm and adjusting the production speed to avoid triggering the alarm seems logical. In this paper we show the effectiveness of Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVMs) in predicting the evolution of the temperature in a steel production machine and, as a consequence, possible alarms due to overheating. Firstly, in an offline fashion, we develop a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model, where a systematic model selection procedure allows to carefully tune the model parameters. Afterwards, the NAR model is used online to forecast the future temperature trend. Finally, a classifier which uses as input the outcomes of the NAR model allows to foresee future alarms.

Automatic Text Categorization Using a System of High-Precision and High-Recall Models	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING (CIDM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM)	DEC 09-12, 2014	Orlando, FL	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc				This paper presents an automatic text document categorization system, HPHR. HPHR contains high precision, high recall and noise-filtered text categorization models. The text categorization models are generated through a suite of machine learning algorithms, a fast clustering algorithm that efficiently and effectively group documents into subcategories, and a text category generation algorithm that automatically generates text subcategories that represent high precision, high recall and noise-filtered text categorization models from a given set of training documents. The HPHR system was evaluated on documents drawn from two different applications, vehicle fault diagnostic documents, which are in a form of unstructured and verbatim text descriptions, and Reuters corpus. The performance of the proposed system, HPHR, on both document collections showed superiority over the systems commonly used in text document categorization.

Performance Comparison of classifiers in the detection of Short Circuit Incipient Fault in a Three-Phase Induction Motor	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS (CIES)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence	DEC 09-12, 2014	Orlando, FL	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		SVM; LSSVM; MLP; ELM; MLM; Fault Detection; Three-phase Induction Motor		This paper aims at the detection of short-circuit incipient fault condition in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor fed by a sinusoidal PWM converter. In order to detect this fault, different operation conditions are applied to an induction motor, and each sample of the real data set is taken from the line currents of the PWM converter aforementioned. For feature extraction, the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is used. The detection of this fault is treated as a classification problem, therefore different supervised algorithms of machine learning are used so as to solve it: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support-Vector Machine (SVM), Least-Squares Support-Vector Machine (LSSVM), and the Minimal Learning Machine (MLM). These classifiers are tested and the results are compared with other works with the same data set. In near future, an embedded system can be equipped with these algorithms.	[Coelho, D.

A three-layered control approach is proposed, building on the pre-existing low-level regulatory layer. A middle-level controller handles reversible degradation phenomena before they cause lasting damage, inducing temporary deviations from the steady state to recover from e.g. catalyst contamination or electrode flooding. A high-level optimising controller sets the nominal operating conditions to maximise a specific objective function, based on prognostics and health management, in which the lifetime of the stack is of pivotal importance.

Thus, the increasing energy cost in operational costs demands effective tools to identify energy efficiency indicators (EEIs) and predict the evolution of energy efficiency performance (EEP). The energy efficiency (EE) improvement of any segment in the communication networks (CNs) can help lower energy cost and protect environment of network operators. The spread of users in overall areas results in the increasing number of base stations (BSs), which are main components of CN. As a supporting function of management tools, predicting EEP is a requested function of energy management system (EMS) by network operators. In this context, this paper presents the demand of EMS for integrating prediction of EEP deterioration. In addition, the energy efficiency function block to modelling the BSs with numerous of indicators is proposed. By prognostic approaches (PA) and suitable aggregation methods, network operators can handle their situations. An EEP degradation demonstration has been conducted by using PA and EE model of BS. An additional benefit can also be seen as increasing reliability of energy backup units in various scenarios of power source disturbance. Finally, the requirement of sensor networks in acquiring technical data of BS deterioration states is mentioned.

Minor faults or defects of these equipments can lead to ravaging effects. In this paper is proposed a diagnosis method based on the analytic model which investigates the output waveforms of a three-phase rectifier supplying a variable DC drive for two types of possible faults of the switches: interrupted and short circuit. For identifying the defective components, the waveforms corresponding for different faults are stored in an information database in order to be compared with the ones corresponding to normal operation.

An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) consists of multiple life saving machines which are continuously recording vital organs of patients and generating vast data at very high frequency. A context aware based real time monitoring system is extremely useful in the modern era of bio-medical engineering which could able to help medical expertise for efficient decision making. Considering multiple vital factors in a real-life scenario an intelligent decision support system could be developed and work more efficiently if associated with Pervasive Data Mining techniques. The approach presented in this research work illustrates the Pervasive Data Mining for Intensive care unit which utilizes "Adaptive Direct Acyclic Graph based Support Vector Machine" (ADAGSVM) to classify the health conditions of elderly patients. An Adult Prognostic Index (API) scoring system has been utilized which could be calculated on the basis of six important vital signs. Based on the value of Adult Prognostic Index, clinical rules may be identified to initiate alarms for monitoring of patient health conditions.

A diagnostic method is developed by building an analytical model of the stator winding. Degradation is simulated by altering the permittivity and conductivity of the insulation in a finite element model simulation and changing the analytical model accordingly. The diagnostic method is performed with an oscilloscope and other common hardware. A prognostic method is introduced which is used to predict the remaining useful life of the insulation based on fitting insulation current measurements to an exponential decay model. The diagnostic method is verified with the analytical model for multiple levels of degradation and experimentally for the healthy case. The prognostic method is verified with simulated degradation data.

Further we show how patterns in the bi-spectrum are useful for identifying the frequency (or bi-frequency) components involved in the non-linear interaction. The bi-spectrum, a third-order spectrum, has properties that lend themselves to the measurement of nonlinearities in systems. The properties of interest are insensitivity to Gaussian noise and ability to detect quadratic phase coupling. This paper considers the properties of a bi-spectrum estimate when applied to a system with quadratic nonlinearity excited by the superposition of harmonics in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. This is compared, using signal-to-noise ratios, to the power spectrum. Numerical examples were included to verify the results. The study aims to expand the domain of induction machines faults diagnosis. Therefore, to verify the theoretical development, an experimental test bed has been used in a steady-state condition.

Increasing size and capacity of power systems have rendered them more complex which in turn has led to reduced reliability of such systems. Power distribution systems are always prone to faults. Faults in power systems are generally due to short circuits, lightning etc. Fast and proper restorations of outages are crucial to improve system reliability. For quick and adequate recovery actions such as the determination of the propriety of carrying out forced line charging and the necessity of network switching, and an efficient patrolling, understanding the cause of a fault in an electric power system in the system operation is essential. Moreover, unknown faults may add to unnecessary costs if effective restorations and identifications can't be done quickly. So, identification of a fault on a transmission line needs to be correct and rapid. However, recognition of the causes of distribution faults accurately generally lack in expert personnel. Also the knowledge about the nature of these faults is not easily transferable from person to person. So, effective means of fault identification needs to be encouraged. In this paper, some of the unconventional approaches for condition monitoring of power systems comprising of wavelet transform, along with the application of soft computing techniques like artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector machines, genetic algorithm and hybrid combinations based on these have been studied.

In this strategy, the output voltage of CHMLIS, which is preprocessed through the fast Fourier transform (FFT), is used to identify the type and location of occurring fault through a SVM model. Then RPCA is utilized to reduce input sample's dimension. A lower dimensional input sample will reduce the time necessary to train the SVM model, and the reduced noise may improve the mapping performance. Compared with other traditional fault diagnosis methods, the proposed strategy has much higher computing efficiency and diagnosis accuracy in fault diagnosis. Simulation results and experimental results have validated the RPCA-SVM fault diagnosis strategy in CHMLIS.

In this manuscript a density based clustering algorithm is proposed to effectively cluster binary datasets. The proposed algorithm automatically determines the number of clusters based upon the density of data present in a region. The number of clusters evolve during the clustering process due to merging of several smaller clusters. Simulation studies were carried out on two synthetic datasets and it is observed that the proposed algorithm can effectively clusters both correlated and random binary datasets.

This problem motivates the need for a fault tolerance mechanism in such systems. Hence, we focus on distributed algorithmic review that make the task of failure detection and repair much easier. Our paper highlights this approach. Indeed, it focuses on the problem of reliable duplication mechanism on grid environments. As a first task, we define a new group communication system extending the FSR protocol which is developed by the INRIA/EPFL. Because of his interesting results in a cluster of homogenous machines, this work consists on adapting this system to the grid environments. Whereas, the following part of our paper, shows architecture of a fault-tolerant distributed system. This work is interesting for building fault-tolerant systems distributed at the Grid scale. Indeed, FSRG shows interesting results in terms of bandwidth and latency, not far from cluster results.

It consists of two major parts: vibration signal feature extraction and condition classification for the extracted features. In this paper, Alpha-stable distribution was introduced for feature extraction from faulty bearing vibration signals. After extracting feature vectors by Alpha-stable distribution parameters, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to automate the fault diagnosis procedure. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method is a very powerful algorithm for bearing fault diagnosis and has much better performance.

Different machine applications have different normal behavior patterns and safety standards thus require adjustable and adaptive anomaly detection techniques. In this paper an autonomous behavior modeling approach for anomaly detection has been presented. In this approach time segmented vibration signals from the machines are transformed into spectral contents. After normalization, these frequency domain contents are divided into weighted frequency bins and then Gaussian models are achieved for these frequency bins over the entire training set. Using summation rule on the outputs of Gaussian models a single indicative measure of the machine health: normality score is obtained. The sensitivity of the normality score and anomaly detector towards potential anomalous signals can be controlled by using different number of bins and weights. Suitable parameters values, number of bins and weights profile, for anomaly detector model are selected autonomously using minimum value of the cost function. The increase of normality score of this model above a certain threshold is considered an alarm indicating anomalous behavior. Thus the proposed method enables us to achieve autonomously a suitable anomaly detection model with suitable parameters with controlled sensitivity during the test phase.

It appears that no single technique is able to easily handle all types of faults from previous research works, because different diagnostic technique is used to diagnose different types of faults. This paper also describes the possibility of unifying diagnosis techniques in such a way that faults are easily traced or detected on-line. Often faults are analysed only after the occurrence and the origin of the fault could be far remote from the manifestation. The description in the paper begins to work towards a unified fault diagnostic system suitable for on-line early detection long before their manifestation. Towards this end the origin and manifestation of various faults in electrical machines are critically examined in the review.	[Imoru, O.; Jimoh, A.

Analysis Of Acoustic Signals From Rotating Machines For Wear Detection	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT TRENDS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICRTIT)	International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology	APR 10-12, 2014	Chennai, INDIA			Automated Condition Monitoring; REBs; Remaining Useful Life		Automated Condition Monitoring (ACM) of rotating machines is necessary to avoid sudden machine breakdown due to wear and tear of Rolling Element Bearings (REBs). Hence, detecting faults in REBs well before machine outage is important. The aim of the proposed system is to develop a prototype to detect mechanical wear, by capturing acoustic signals with frequencies between 20 Hz to 20 kHz, from the machine under test, using non-contact electret microphone sensor. The frequency spectra of the acoustic signal from a healthy bearing is compared with the acquired acoustic signal. This system aids in scheduled replacement of faulty parts, thereby reducing the machine downtime, increasing reliability and customer satisfaction, but the results do not infer on the severity of the fault present in the REBs. The system also helps in predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the machine under consideration.

Bearings are most symptomatic components of mechanical faults occurring in SCIM as they are held accountable for 40-50 % of all the motor malfunctions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an imperative spectrum estimation technique, comprehensively used with Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). However FFT does not endow with substantial outcome when frequency resolution is considered. Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) can be used to analyze any signal for obtaining better resolution. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) gives out better idea about the variation in specific frequency band all through the bearing fault(s). In this paper, for minimalism and fast analysis, signal energy is calculated. The stator current data is acquired by creating different fault cases on a 3-phase, 1.5kW, 4P, and 1440 RPM induction motor. The variation in the energy of healthy and energy of faulty condition(s) bestow with a better idea pertaining to fault detection and classification. Actual data analysis divulges that FFT is not suitable for practical circumstances. After analyzing different cases of bearing fault, it can evidently be concluded that DWT has an edge over FFT. Some attributes regarding bearing fault classification are also obtained.

As the traditional algorithms exist the problems of complex calculation and large energy consumption, a method for fault diagnosis of nodes in WSN based on rough set theory (RS) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed in this paper. In this paper, we collect various kinds of fault symptoms and integrate them first and then diagnose the fault nodes through rough set theory (RS) and support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, the rough set theory is used to reduce the attributes of sampling data in order to select the decision-making attributes for constituting a new simple dataset. Then we use the new simple dataset to train the SVM. And finally classify failure modes of WSN through the trained SVM model. The result shows with RS-SVM the diagnosis time is only 0.16s and the diagnosis accuracy is up to 95%. The algorithm in this paper makes full use of RS and SVM and the result shows the effectiveness of the algorithm in fault diagnosis of WSN, and also shows it can improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault diagnosis.

On-sensor data processing is used to reduce the amount of information that needs to be transmitted, thus saving communications energy. Based on a condition monitoring interval of 3 seconds, and using 2 AAA batteries for power, the system lifetime is measured for four different operating modes. For raw data transmission to the coordinator, the system lifetime is 106 hours. If feature extraction is done on the sensor node, this is extended to 152 hours. If fault diagnosis is done on the node, the lifetime is 153 hours. If fault diagnosis is conducted every 3 seconds but results are only sent under fault conditions, or once per hour as a health check, then lifetime is dramatically increased to 1764 hours.

However, the introduction of a large number of PV units could have a negative impact on the distributed PV grid-connected power generation systems, such as polluting the grid, and causing grid instability, even resulting in the voltage collapse if the relevant stability and control issues are not properly considered. This paper proposes a two-level control strategy, that is, the upper level is cooperative control and the lower level is dynamic matrix control (DMC). The proposed control strategy not only makes all the distributed PV units converge and operate at the same ratio of the available power, but also regulates the total power output of all the PV units to ensure the stability of the distributed power generation systems. Simulation results on the 4-machine 14-bus distributed power generation test system are provided to verify the validness and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

A Framework of Design Weakness Detection through Machine Health Monitoring for the Evolutionary Design Optimization of Multi-domain Systems	2014 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE & EDUCATION (ICCSE 2014)	International Conference on Computer Science & Education		English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE)	AUG 22-24, 2014	Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, Univ British Columbia, Dept Mech Engn, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Vancouver Sect, Natl Res Council Comp Educ Coll & Univ	Univ British Columbia	Multi-domain systems; machine health monitoring; evolutionary design optimization; design weakness detection	FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSTICS	Design of a multi-domain engineering system can be complicated due to its complex structure and dynamic coupling between domains. Ideally, designing a multi-domain system should be done in an integrated and concurrent manner, where dynamic interactions between domains in the entire system have to be considered simultaneously, throughout the design process. In recent years, researchers have made some progress in the integrated and optimal design of multi-domain systems. Dynamic modeling tools such as Bond Graphs and Linear Graphs have been considered for modeling multi-domain systems, which can facilitate the design process. In the process of design optimization, a rather challenging task is to concurrently satisfy multiple design objectives. Methods of evolutionary computing, genetic programing in particular, have received much attention in recent years for application in design optimization. These methods can be extended to evolutionary optimization, which may involve complex and non-analytic objective functions and a variety of design specifications. More recently, machine health monitoring system (MHMS) has been considered for integration into the scheme of design evolution even though no concrete developments have made in this regard. In this paper, a framework of design weakness detection through machine health monitoring for evolutionary design optimization of multi-domain system is proposed. MHMS is integrated with evolutionary design optimization to make the overall process of design evolution more effective and feasible from the practical point of view. Information form MHMS is utilized to detect the "sites" or "candidates" of design weakness, which will involve computation of a new measure that can reflect the quality of the current design. These candidates of design weakness are then provided to the process of evolutionary design optimization. On subsequent analysis, design improvements would be made only if these candidates were found to be related to design weaknesses. Otherwise, the monitoring process will continue.

A novel method of shaft orbit identification based on low-level image feature representation and classification is proposed. The main characteristic is that the vibrations of the shaft in terms of displacements are used to draw points in an image panel at a fixed scale, resulting in the shaft orbit image set. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is then used as the low-level local shape descriptor. Accordingly, a given shaft orbit image can be represented by a plenty of HOG local descriptors which are further aggregated into a feature vector. The feature vectors associated with class labels are fed to linear classifiers for multiclass classification. To deal with noisy samples robustly and solve the problem that training samples always cannot be separated in original space, kernel-based soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on the challenging data set which is collected from a testing apparatus under different fault settings. It yields a satisfactory recognition rate which is 98.35% on the overall data set.

Bearing failures are actually the most frequent failures in this type of machines. Utilizing electrical signals and eliminating signals such as vibration is essential to reduce the cost of condition monitoring schemes of electrical machines in industry. In this paper, the instantaneous frequency of motor voltage is introduced to monitor bearings condition. By using this signal, for instance, the global kurtosis and crest factor are able to detect bearing defects in time-domain. In this work, envelope analysis of vibration signal is used to verify the existence of bearing defects. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed bearing condition monitoring method.

Bearing is one of the most important components in industries that need to be monitored and the user should predict its RUL. The challenge of this study is to propose a new strategy for RUL feature extraction. The proposed methodology provides better features in term of monotonicity. This specification ensures a better RUL prediction by comparing the test degradation features to the library of instance. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology is very promising for RUL estimation by industry.

The study based on finite element models offers much more information on the phenomena characterizing the operation of electrical machines than the classical analytical models. This explains the increase of the interest for the finite element investigations in electrical machines. Based on finite element models, this paper studies the influence of the stator and the rotor faults on the behavior of the IM. In this work, a simple dynamic model for an IM with inter-turn winding fault and a broken bar fault is presented. This fault model is used to study the IM under various fault conditions and severity. The simulation results are conducted to validate the fault model for different levels of fault severity. The comparison of the results obtained by simulation tests allowed verifying the precision of the proposed FEM model. This paper presents a technical method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of stator current and electromagnetic torque to detect the faults of broken rotor bar. The simulation results obtained show clearly the possibility of extracting signatures to detect and locate faults.

The features for classification are extracted through using statistical parameters combined with energy obtained through the application of Db2-discrete wavelet transform at the fifth level of decomposition. After feature extraction, ICA is employed to select the relevant features. Finally an optimized SVM based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for bearing fault decision. The obtained results proved the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for bearing faults diagnosis.

The different sources of uncertainty and the various uncertainty quantification activities in condition-based prognostics are outlined in detail, and it is demonstrated that the first-order reliability methods (FORM) to quantify the uncertainty in the remaining useful life (RUL) algorithms is a major factor of prognosis frameworks failure because it pushes mathematical foundation to result uncertainty in long term predictions if it is combined with outer feedback correction loops for interpreting uncertainty in online monitoring. Prognostic consists of two important steps. To begin the condition on the sate systems are calculated approximatively by the probability distribution of the damage parameters, then, the rest of the state's systems are presaged until failure, that is why the remaining useful life of the system is the main purpose of extending the remaining useful life of a faulty system.

Then DPCA model is established by many selected IMFs and used to detect rolling bearing's failures. The proposed scheme is verified with experimental data collected from deep groove ball bearing of a 2 hp motor driven mechanical system and the results show that the strategies can detect bearing faults efficiently.

Observer-Based Fault Detection in Induction Machines	3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY ENERGIES AND APPLICATIONS (EFEA 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Environmental Friendly Energies and Applications (EFEA)	NOV 19-21, 2014	Paris, FRANCE	Inst Super Mecanique Paris				In this paper, we present a methodology for the design of the rotor flux observer for induction motors and its applications to fault detection. We start with the well-known alpha-beta model of induction motors. We employ a change of coordinates to transform the fifth order alpha-beta model to a third order model expressed in terms of complex differential equations. After that, an inverse transformation is used to revert back to the original coordinates. Moreover, we use the designed observer in order to detect some faults arising in the induction motor. By doing so, a proper fault monitoring system is realised. We consider mainly the effects of voltage sag, stator inter-turn short-circuit and broken rotor bar faults that usually arise in induction motors. The validity of the proposed approach is verified with results from simulation of the model of the induction motor.	[Masala, J.

The use of conventional NDT will grow in developing countries and in developed countries the challenges will include those associated with maintaining aging infrastructure. For some systems the future will move to structural health monitoring (SHM) and for others into integration of online measurements in manufacturing. Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) is a multi-disciplinary area of endeavor that has its origins in materials science and NDT. It seeks to provide an adequate science base for NDT to become a quantitative science. It was seen to be necessary to better detect, size and type defects, improve the reliability of inspection, and probability of detection (POD). There is particular interest in estimating the potential defects could have on performance or potential for loss of structural integrity, under various loading or stressor conditions, and ultimately implement risk-based reliability assessments. NDE must be seen more as a part of the wide field of engineering, as an interdisciplinary endeavor, that brings together the expertise of materials science and metrology, together with the underlying physics for inspection methods, as well as statistics, computers, robotics and software. The adoption of advanced manufacturing, will require new metrology tools and methods to provide data for assessing new materials including powder metals, as used in additive manufacturing, and various composites. The lessons from the past proceedings of this conference series include that the problems faced today are harder than was expected during the first decade of quantitative NDE research. Even with new types of transducers and much improved A/ D and powerful computers new approaches and more basic measurement physics being understood, new insights are needed to provide the data needed to solve many real-world NDE problems, to understand and measure early degradation and to give the required data for remaining safe life or prognostic prediction.

Due to its excellent performance in generalization, the classification performance of SVM is satisfactory. SVM algorithm combined with kernel function has the nonlinear attribute and can better handle the case where samples and attributes are massive. In addition, with forehand optimizing the parameters using the cross-validation technique, SVM can produce high accuracy in fault detection. Therefore, there is no need to deal with original data or refer to other algorithms, making the classification problem simple to handle. In order to further illustrate the efficiency, an industrial benchmark of Tennessee Eastman (TE) process is utilized with the SVM algorithm and PLS algorithm, respectively. By comparing the indices of detection performance, the SVM technique shows superior fault detection ability to the PLS algorithm.

It has the highest mortality rate of all cancers for women. The prognosis for ovarian cancer patients is poor, particularly about 20% of ovarian cancers are found at an early stage. CA-125 test is used as a tumor marker. A high level of CA-125 could be a sign of ovarian cancer or other conditions. We use a machine learning technique to explore better knowledge and most important factors useful for detecting early-stage ovarian cancer by evaluating the significance of data between the amino acids and the ovarian cancer. Therefore, we propose a Fuzzy Rough with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model to mine suitable rules. In pre-processing stage, we use Fuzzy Rough set theory for feature selection. In post-processing stage, we use SVM to merit of dealing with real and complex data, performing quick learning and having good classification performance.

Degradation Trend Estimation and Prognosis of Large Low Speed Slewing Bearing Lifetime	ADVANCES IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND MATERIALS	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Mechanical Engineering (ICOME 2013)	SEP 19-21, 2013	Mataram, INDONESIA	BKS-TM, PT Graha Elektro Tama, LINTECH, Dinamika Energitama Nusantara, Citilink, PT Pelabuhan Indonesia III PERSERO		Adaptive line enhancer; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Degradation trend; Prognosis; Slewing bearing	DIAGNOSIS	In many applications, degradation of bearing conditions is usually monitored by changes in time-domain features. However, in low speed (< 10 rpm) slewing bearing, these changes are not easily detected because of the low energy and low frequency of the vibration. To overcome this problem, a combined low pass filter (LPF) and adaptive line enhancer (ALE) signal preconditioning method is used. Time-domain features such as root mean square (RMS), skewness and kurtosis are extracted from the output signal of the combined LPF and ALE method. The extracted features show accurate information about the incipient of fault as compared to extracted features from the original vibration signal. This information then triggers the prognostic algorithm to predict the remaining lifetime of the bearing. The algorithm used to determine the trend of the non-stationary data is auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).	[Kosasih, Buyung; Caesarendra, Wahyu; Tieu, Kiet; Moodie, Craig A.

This chapter shows the results of a parametric analysis performed to study the sensitivity of non-linear effects in the oil-film forces to changes of some parameters of the synchronous (1X) filtered orbit of the journal. This study is focused on the influence on non-linear forces caused by changes of the maximum amplitude and circularity of the journal orbit as well as by changes of the inclination angle of the major principal axis of the 1X elliptical orbit. Moreover, also the effects of the shaft rotational speed, bearing load and the average journal position have been taken into account. A procedure to perform this sensitivity analysis for different types of journal bearing is described. Then, the results obtained by the analysis of the behaviour of a two-lobe elliptical oil-film journal bearing are shown and discussed.

Condition Monitoring of Rotating Machines Using Vibration and Bearing Temperature Measurements	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	2013	Ferrara, ITALY			Vibration monitoring; Condition monitoring; Rotating machinery; Fault diagnosis; Principal component analysis	ROTOR	Conventional vibration-based condition monitoring (VCM) of rotating machines with a multiple bearing system, such as Turbo-generator (TG) sets, is data intensive. Since a number of sensors are required at each bearing location, the task of diagnosing faults on such systems may be impossible for even an experienced analyst. Hence, the current study aims to develop a simplified fault diagnosis (FD) method that uses just a single vibration and a single temperature sensor on each bearing. Initial trials on an experimental rotating rig indicate that supplementing vibration data with temperature measurements gave improved FD when compared with FD using vibration data alone. Observations made from the initial trials are presented in this paper.

The noise of vibration signals is canceled by using SF. Similarity factor I-pq is defined to evaluate the filtering performance; the significance level alpha is optimized by genetic algorithms (GA). The optimum symptom parameters in different frequency bands, by which the states of rotating machinery can be sensitively distinguished, are automatically and sequentially selected by ACO based on the Mahalanobis distance between different machine states. Finally, the Mahalanobis distance is used to identify failure types based on the sequential diagnostic method. The new method proposed in this paper has been used to diagnose a centrifugal pump system for faults which often occur in the pump, such as impeller unbalance, shaft misalignment, and cavitation. The verification results of the condition diagnosis for a centrifugal pump show that the new method has good performance.

This led to the development of early fault diagnostic methods. Paper presents early fault diagnostic method of synchronous motor. This method uses acoustic signals generated by synchronous motor. Plan of study of acoustic signal of synchronous motor was proposed. Two conditions of synchronous motor were analyzed. Studies were carried out for methods of data processing: Line Spectral Frequencies and K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with Minkowski distance.

J	Chang, Y; Hao, Y; Li, CW				Chang, Yuan; Hao, Yi; Li, Chunwen			Phase Dependent and Independent Frequency Identification of Weak Signals Based on Duffing Oscillator via Particle Swarm Optimization	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Weak signal detection; Duffing Chaotic Oscillator; Frequency detection; Variance; Particle swarm optimization algorithm	MACHINERY FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CHAOTIC OSCILLATOR	In detecting weak signals based on the Duffing oscillator, it is usually assumed that the frequency is known, which is not always the case. This paper studies the problem of detecting the frequency of the to-be-detected weak signal based on the Duffing oscillator. For this purpose, the variance of the Duffing oscillator's output is exploited, which has the property of multi-extremum single-maximum (MESM) distribution with the frequency of the periodic signal. The impact of signal's phase on the MESM distribution is discussed. When the signal's phase is known, the frequency of the signal can be directly identified as that with the maximal variance, which leads to a nonlinear optimization problem that can be solved by a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. When the phase is unknown, the pi/2-phase-shift method is to be exploited integrated with a PSO algorithm. It is shown that the frequency can be precisely and efficiently identified by this method, whose effectiveness is verified by simulation results in Matlab.

A system for diagnosing DC machines was described. The system performed an analysis of the acoustic signals of DC machine. Researches were conducted for two states of Direct Current machines. The studies were conducted for the algorithms of data processing: Symlet wavelet transform and modified classifier based on words. A pattern creation process has been carried out for the 10 sound samples. An identification process has been carried out for the 40 sound samples. The described implementation of the system may be useful for protecting machines. Moreover, this approach will reduce the cost of maintenance and the number of damaged machines.

The aging datasets of eight cells with identical chemistry were used. The sample entropy of cell voltage sequence under the well-known HPPC (hybrid pulse power characterization) profile is adopted as the input of the health estimator. The calculated sample entropy and capacity of a reference Li-ion cell (randomly selected from the eight cells) at three different ambient temperatures are employed as the training data to establish the model by using the least-squares optimization. The performance and robustness of the estimator are validated by means of the degradation datasets from the other seven cells. The associated results indicate that the proposed health management strategy has an average relative error of about 2%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The engineering equipment gets many components and failure modes, and its failure mechanism is very complicated. Failure of system-level might occur due to failure(s) of any subsystem/component. Thus, the symptom failure of equipment may be caused by multilevel causality of latent failures. This paper proposes a complete corrective maintenance scheme for engineering equipment. Firstly, the FMECA is extended to organize the numerous failure modes. Secondly, the failure propagation model (FPM) is presented to depict the cause-effect relationship between failures. Multiple FPMs will make up the failure propagation graph (FPG). For a specific symptom failure, the FPG is built by iteratively searching the cause failures with FPM. Moreover, when some failure in the FPG is newly ascertained to occur (or not), the FPG needs to be adjusted. The FPG updating process is proposed to accomplish the adjustment of FPG under newly ascertained failure. Then, the probability of the cause failures is calculated by the fault diagnosis process. Thirdly, the conventional corrective maintenance recommends that the failure with the largest probability should be ascertained firstly. However, the proposed approach considers not only the probability but also the failure detectability and severity. The term REN is introduced to measure the risk of the failure. Then, a binary decision tree is trained based on REN reduction to determine the failure ascertainment order. Finally, a case is presented to implement the proposed approach on the ram feed subsystem of a boring machine tool. The result proves the validity and practicability of the proposed method for corrective maintenance of engineering equipment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on the phase modulation theory proposed by Blodt, the form of the stator current is theoretically derived in accordance with the Bessel function and the characteristics of the stator current's sideband frequencies are studied. In order to determine the amplitude characteristics of the sideband frequencies, the test rig which can simulate single-point defect via generating torque vibration is established. The obtained results validate the idea that the amplitude characteristics of the sideband frequencies accord with Bessel function of the first kind. During the experimental verification, the amplitude characteristics of sideband frequencies become obvious and the number of sideband frequencies which can be identified increases when the electrical supply frequency is lower. The results conform to the theoretical features of stator current. Therefore, it is conducive to determine the severity of the fault.

The ruin of the rocks that cover underground excavations gives birth to the subsidence phenomenon, which has a bad influence that can extent on all covering rocks' lengths till the surface, and it manifests on a very long period of time, even after the productive activity stops. The whole mining activity produces, due to its specific, multiple and various negative effects on the environment, exemplified by: modifications on the relief, manifested in the degradation of the landscape and movements of the houses and industrial objectives in the exploitation areas; the degradation of the field through surface's vertical and horizontal movements, provoking possible accidents and so on. In this paper I'll present the current situation on the influence of the underground mining exploitation on the surface fields and constructions, in the conditions of the Jiu Valley mining perimeter. After the data from the measurements has been processed and after the results have been interpreted, by comparing the real submersion, resulted from the measurements, with the values of the influence factors (this has been distinguished through different diagrams, graphics and tables) I proposed and used a prognosis equation of the submersion for a point in the exploitation's influence area. This can be applied for all points of the M.E. Livezeni tracking unit and not only. The study of the underground exploitation's influence on the surface is necessary in order to evidence the movement phenomena and to take the measures for the protection of the surface objectives and the surface itself.

Annual flood sensitivities to El Nino-Southern Oscillation at the global scale	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; INTERDECADAL CHANGES; LA-NINA; ENSO; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; TRENDS; WATER	Floods are amongst the most dangerous natural hazards in terms of economic damage. Whilst a growing number of studies have examined how river floods are influenced by climate change, the role of natural modes of interannual climate variability remains poorly understood. We present the first global assessment of the influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on annual river floods, defined here as the peak daily discharge in a given year. The analysis was carried out by simulating daily gridded discharges using the WaterGAP model (Water - a Global Assessment and Prognosis), and examining statistical relationships between these discharges and ENSO indices. We found that, over the period 1958-2000, ENSO exerted a significant influence on annual floods in river basins covering over a third of the world's land surface, and that its influence on annual floods has been much greater than its influence on average flows. We show that there are more areas in which annual floods intensify with La Nina and decline with El Nino than vice versa. However, we also found that in many regions the strength of the relationships between ENSO and annual floods have been non-stationary, with either strengthening or weakening trends during the study period. We discuss the implications of these findings for science and management. Given the strong relationships between ENSO and annual floods, we suggest that more research is needed to assess relationships between ENSO and flood impacts (e. g. loss of lives or economic damage). Moreover, we suggest that in those regions where useful relationships exist, this information could be combined with ongoing advances in ENSO prediction research, in order to provide year-to-year probabilistic flood risk forecasts.

Detection of broken rotor bars has long been important but difficult job in detection area of incipient motor faults. The need for highly efficient motor control drive systems becomes more and more important. Motors are controlled in closed-loop or open-loop modes of operation. This paper develops a novel approach for fault-detection scheme of broken rotor bar faults for three-phase induction motor using stator current signal. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) combined with Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) has been employed for the analysis of stator current signal. Artificial neural network is then used for pattern recognition of broken rotor bar signature. The proposed algorithm offers high performance in detecting broken rotor bar fault. Both simulation and experimental results show that stator current-based monitoring in conjunction with Winger-Ville distribution based on EMD yields a reliable indicator for detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bar faults using artificial neural network All simulations in this paper are conducted using finite element analysis software. Experimental results validate the simulation and analytical results.	[Refaat, Shady S.; Abu-Rub, Haitham] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Doha, Qatar; [Saad, M. S.] Cairo Univ, Giza, Egypt; [Saad, M.

Analysis is carried out using two different surface mounted PM machines designed for low and high speed applications: a 12 slot, 10 pole machine with concentrated windings for rotorcraft swashplate actuation and a 36-slot 6-pole machine with distributed winding arrangement for an aircraft starter-generator. The impact of the winding arrangement for the low speed machine is investigated with a focus on turn-turn Short-Circuit (SC) faults. Implications of the SC fault and methods to restrain the resulting SC current are discussed. A prognostics method for potential turn-turn SC faults for the high speed application is then investigated. It is shown that potential winding faults can be detected at an early stage of fault inception and thus measures can be taken to limit propagation.
