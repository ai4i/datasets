In real time environment, operating the induction motor at variable speeds is a severe constraint. The electrical and mechanical faults can impose unacceptable conditions and protective devices are therefore provided to quickly disconnect the motor from grid. In order to ensure that electrical machines receive adequate protection, extensive testing is performed to verify the high quality of assembly. Fault diagnosis and testing of induction machine is attempted under various load conditions and verified by using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Back Propagation Neural (BPN) Network is used to calculate the error and correct/regulate the induction motor. This technique has resulted in increased speed and improved fault coverage area of the induction machine.

The analysis is based on structural description of the process. The main physical variables are associated to each subsystem and a relational model linking these variables for all the different functioning modes of the system is determined. In large-scale systems every component must provide a certain function in order to make the overall system working satisfactorily. When a fault or a badly tuned parameter affects a control loop, the required function cannot be fulfilled which may cause a failure. Therefore, some Loop Performance Indexes (LPI) indicating if the control loops operate properly are necessary to evaluate the impact of the failure on the overall process performances represented by a high level index Key Performance Index (KPI). Structural models provide an interesting approach for the analysis of a system and also studying the impact of a fault because they only need a limited knowledge about the behaviour of the system. Generic component models can be used to describe the system architecture. At the first level different statistical tests are applied to the KPI. When a set of LPI or KPI deviate from their nominal or desired values, the elements which are source of an eventual malfunctioning can be searched in the structural graph by searching the nodes predecessors. The selected LPI are tested in their turn by mean of statistical tests. A node is declared to be "faulty" if the value of the corresponding LPI is out of the acceptable (pre defined) limits. The procedure is iterated until the last level of the model is reached. This procedure researches the possible cause of KPI value significant deviation. The procedure was applied on a board machine. In this process, the main KPI is the value of moisture of the board at the end of the production chain. The corresponding structural model which relates the moisture (top node) to the control loops (nodes) has been developed. In order to validate the large-scale capabilities of such approach, the model has been integrated within the PREDICT's SOA(Services Oriented Archiecture) software platform: KASEM (Kowledge and Advanced Services for E-Monitoring). The platform enables to apply the "on-line" statistical test to the KPI and LPIs of the board machine and supports the iterative procedure Indeed, the iterative procedure based on the structural graph was integrated as one of the KASEM diagnostic tools with a dynamic and animated graph and used during the KASEM workflow to solve the problem.

A feasibility study into prognostics for the main bearing of a wind turbine	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL APPLICATIONS (CCA)	IEEE International Conference on Control Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (CCA) Part of 6th IEEE Multi-Conference on Systems and Control (IEEE MSC)	OCT 03-05, 2012	Dubrovnik, CROATIA	IEEE, IEEE Control Syst Soc (CSS), IEEE Conf Control Applicat (CCA), IEEE Int Syposium Intelligent Control (ISIC)			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	Maintenance for wind turbines, particularly offshore turbines, presents a significant cost component to wind farm operators. The main bearing, which supports the low-speed shaft, is one of the major wind turbine system components. Since maintenance is confined to suitable weather windows, which are unpredictable, there is a need for decision support tools to ensure that maintenance is carried out in a timely way, but also at minimum cost and with minimum turbine downtime. This paper presents a methodology for the estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the main bearing for a commercial wind turbine. A residual model is used to highlight potentially faulty behaviour, which is then post processed to provide a suitable signal for extrapolation using particle filters. The RUL is then effectively specified as a probability distribution which narrows as the failure point is approached, providing an estimate of RUL and a confidence measure. Our results suggest that RULs beyond 30 days can be reasonably estimated.	[Butler, Shane; Ringwood, John.

Since model-or data-based diagnosis of all components cannot be achieved online on a large-scale basis, the focus must be narrowed down to the most likely faulty components responsible for abnormal process behavior. One of the key elements here is fault analysis. The paper describes and briefly discusses other development phases, process decomposition and the selection of FDD methods. The paper ends with an FDD case study of a large-scale industrial board machine including a description of the fault analysis and FDD algorithms for the resulting focus areas. Finally, the testing and validation results are presented and discussed.

The proposed method consists of extracting reliable discriminative feature from a steady state one-phase current signal and design of optimal classifier via a support vector machine. The fault related features are extracted from frequency spectra of a modulus of a motor phase current Hilbert transform series. The features are fed to the support vector machine input and the output indicates rotor condition in respect of broken bar appearance independently of a slip value. Tests are conducted on 1.1kW two poles induction machine in an industrial environment. It is shown that proposed method is accurate, fast, reliable, not hardware costly.

As a machine degrades, system outputs deviate from desired outputs, generating residuals defined by the error between sensor measurements and corresponding model simulated signals. Residuals contain valuable information to interpret system states and parameters. A framework for parameter estimation and system identification of non-linear dynamical systems is presented with focus on DC motors and 3-phase induction motors. Tuning combines artificial intelligence techniques like Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling (Hammersley sequencing) and Genetic Algorithm (NSGA II) with an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) that utilizes the system dynamics information via physical models. A tentative Graphical User Interface (GUI) simplified interactions between machine operator and module. Implementation details and results comparing healthy and faulty systems are included.

Special challenges are posed by the fact that such systems operate in uncertain environments, are highly dynamic, and exhibit emergent behaviors that can lead to catastrophic failure. Discrete Time Markov chains (DTMCs) provide important tools for analysis of such systems, because they represent dynamic behavior succinctly, provide a means to measure uncertainty, and can be used to make quantitative measurements of the potential for change to system performance. Moreover, DTMCs can be extended to be time-inhomogeneous, i.e. to represent behavior that varies over long durations. To date, DTMCs have been proposed for tasks such as fault detection and long-term condition equipment monitoring in real-world complex systems. However, the scope of these models has generally been restricted to describing states and state transitions that directly concern fault conditions or states of degradation. Less work has been done on using DTMCs to represent a more complete range of states a system may enter into during normal operation. Of special interest are sequences of states that involve failure scenarios, in which a system evolves from a normal operating state into undesirable state that leads to widespread performance degradation Unfortunately, use of large DTMCs often involves large search spaces, a problem which in part motivates our work. This paper describes progress made on developing an approach for using larger, more detailed DTMC models of operational complex systems to uncover potential failure scenarios. The approach uses a combination of methods to perturb a DTMC, simulate alternative system evolutions, and identify scenarios in which a system proceeds from normal operation to failure. Key to the approach is the use of graph theory techniques to reduce the size of the search space involved in exploring alternative behaviors. We show how graph theory techniques can be used to identify critical state transitions which can be perturbed to simulate performance degradation. Using critical transitions, it is also possible to estimate the rate of performance degradation and to understand how this rate is likely to change in response to increased failure incidence. Examples are provided of the use of this approach on a DTMC of significant size to identify failure scenarios in a distributed resource allocation system.

FAULT DETECTION AND DIAGNOSTICS IN AN OCEAN TURBINE USING VIBRATION ANALYSIS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION - 2010, VOL 8, PTS A AND B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)	NOV 12-18, 2010	Vancouver, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers				This paper describes the approach, procedure and techniques developed to evaluate the health of ocean turbines, based on vibration measurements and analyses. A LabVIEW model for on-line vibration condition monitoring, implemented with advanced diagnostic techniques features, was developed. In order to distinguish between a vibration amplitude change due to a developing fault and that due to a change in operating condition, this program includes the use of an ordering technique in the frequency domain, which relates the vibration to the machine speed. Some experiments were first performed on a commercial fan to illustrate and demonstrate the fault detection capability of the monitoring and diagnostics system. To increase the reliability of the monitoring system, and to demonstrate that it can be used for monitoring a wide range of machines, a second series of vibration data collection and monitoring events was performed on a small boat with different combination (on/off status) of the engine, hydraulic pump, generator and air conditioning. This allowed for the detection of the frequency components associated with each subsystem, alone and together, and enabled the detection of mechanical faults, such as imbalance and misalignment, if they existed. For long term monitoring, the model allow for the automatic storing of raw data either periodically and/or after any deviations from normal conditions, i.e., when alerts are on. This makes it possible to follow the progress (towards an alarm condition) of any faults without saving data continuously. In this way, measurements of unexpected events may be made without the vibration engineer's physical presence, hopefully, early fault detection and diagnosis will avoid catastrophic failure from occurring. This enables the economic and efficient health monitoring of ocean turbines as they become operational.

ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING FAULT DIAGNOSIS USING COMPLEX GAUSSIAN WAVELET	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION - 2010, VOL 8, PTS A AND B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)	NOV 12-18, 2010	Vancouver, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers			CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM	This paper is focused on fault diagnosis of bearings due to localized defects i.e. spall on the bearing components, which is essential to the design of high performance rotor bearing system. The methodology proposed in this paper for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, utilizes autocorrelation of raw vibration signals to reduce the dimension of vibration signals with minimal loss of significant frequency content. Dimension of vibration signal is reduced to 10% with negligible loss of information. To extract most appropriate features from auto-correlated vibration signals and for effective classification of faults, vibration signals are decomposed using complex Gaussian wavelet. Total 150 signals of healthy and defective bearings at rotor speeds 250, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm with three loading conditions are considered. 1-D continuous wavelet coefficients of these samples are calculated at the seventh level of decomposition (27 scales for each sample). Maximum Energy to Shannon Entropy ration criterion is used to determine scale corresponding to characteristic defect frequency. Statistical features are extracted from the wavelet coefficients corresponding to selected scales. Finally, bearing faults are classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The test results show that the SVM can be used efficiently for bearing fault classification. It is also observed that classification accuracy is improved by using autocorrelation.	[Kankar, P.

Chinese medical practitioners diagnose the health status of a patient based on observation of the color, shape, and texture characteristics of the tongue. The condition of the tongue can objectively reflect the presence of certain diseases and aid in the differentiation of syndromes, prognosis of disease and establishment of treatment methods. Tongue shape is a very important feature in tongue diagnosis. A different tongue shape other than ellipse could indicate presence of certain pathologies. In this paper, we propose a novel set of features, based on shape geometry and polynomial equations, for automated recognition and classification of the shape of a tongue image using supervised machine learning techniques. We also present a novel method to correct the orientation/deflection of the tongue based on the symmetry of axis detection method.

Rolling element bearing condition monitoring using acoustic emission technique	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2012) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 17-19, 2012	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Leuven, BELGIUM		KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn		WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATION; DEFECTS; DIAGNOSIS	Acoustic emission (AE) signals generated from defects in rolling element bearings are investigated analytically and experimentally in this paper. Roller element bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has been an increasing demand for effective and reliable health monitoring of these data elements and for finding optimum procedures for the signal processing of the measured data to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient defects in rolling element bearings. This paper describes a novel signal processing algorithm designed to diagnose localized defects on rolling element bearings components which has recently been tested for different operating speeds and loadings. The algorithm is based on optimizing the ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass filter utilizing wavelet packet transforms and envelope detection. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the raw acoustic emission signals under different operating conditions. Also, the effects of defect size, operating speed, and loading conditions on AE burst duration have also been investigated to estimate the fault size on the outer race.	[Hemmati, F.; Gadala, M.

This new type merges together the functions of a motor, a gearbox and a cam into a unique element which is the servomotor. The main advantages are the removal of complex mechanical components like gearboxes and cams which are subjected to wear, need maintenance, etc ... , an improved easiness in the setup changing and an increased acceptable complexity of the motion profile. The main drawback regards the diagnostics activity, e. g. on bearings, where classical methods based on the research of the fault frequencies in the signal spectrum cannot be applied anymore, due to the consistent variability in the speed of the shaft. This paper tackles the bearing diagnostic in servomotors by means of an unsupervised learning approach: the artificial immune system, which has been developed and applied with success in the field of computer security, and - as the name suggests - its aim is to mimic the behavior of the human immune system which is able to recognize health hazards, like virus, even if never seen before.

Experimental characterization of the sliding friction of a degrading wet friction clutch	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2012) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 17-19, 2012	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Leuven, BELGIUM		KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			Wet friction clutches have become widely used in today's transmissions, e. g. automatic transmissions, dual clutch transmissions, etc. It is known that the central role of this particular component is strongly determined by its friction characteristics. While a clutch is in use, degradation inevitably takes place that consequently deteriorates its friction characteristics. However, to the authors knowledge, how the friction characteristics evolve with the clutch degradation progression is not fully understood yet. A profound understanding of the clutch friction characteristics during its lifetime can improve our knowledge, which enable us to model and simulate the dynamic engagement behavior of a clutch with the progression of the degradation. Eventually, the gained knowledge can aid in deriving physical features, which are useful for clutch monitoring, prognostics and adaptive control. This study aims at experimentally investigating the sliding friction characteristics of a wet friction clutch during its lifetime. More precisely, the objective of the study is to understand how the Stribeck and the frictional lag (i.e. sliding hysteresis) parameters evolve as the degradation progresses. For this purpose, a novel test procedure is proposed and the test is carried out on a fully assembled (commercial) clutch using a modified SAE#2 test setup. The clutch consists of a predefined number of commercial friction and separator discs and is lubricated with a commercial automatic transmission fluid (ATF). Furthermore, a systematic methodology for the identification of the Stribeck and the frictional lag parameters is proposed. The experimental results reveal that the identified parameters evolve deterministically during the clutch lifetime.	[Ompusunggu, A.

In this sensor, vibration sensing is carried out by detecting the oscillations of a Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT). The SWCNT is excited when it is subjected to a base motion corresponding to the measured vibration. Acquisition of the sensor signal is performed by a capacitance circuit, using the electric charge generated in the Carbon Nanotube (CNT). A modulation in the charge in the CNT, due to change in the capacitance, leads to a modulation in the CNT's conductance and is used in measuring the input vibration. Vibration properties of the CNTs are obtained by molecular mechanics and finite element analysis where atoms are modeled as particles with an equilibrium distance equal to the bond length, and the bonded interactions of atoms are modeled as flexible beams. Stiffness coefficients of the atomic bonds are modeled using Morse atomic potential. A bridge circuit is utilized in this sensor to compensate for temperature and other environmental effects. When the CNT is in the vicinity of the gate underneath the tube, at a distance in the range of 1 nanometer to 1 micrometer, Casimir pressure, due to quantum fluctuations in the zero point electromagnetic field, can attract the CNT to the gate. This unwanted applied force on the tube may lead to inaccurate measurement of the vibration. In order to study the effect of Casimir pressure on the CNT a simplified model of the Casimir effect, for parallel surfaces, is adopted. This model can assist in achieving better accuracy in vibration measurement, and the sensor can be calibrated accordingly to account for the Casimir attractive force. The paper presents the physical and operational details of the sensor. This device is particularly useful for precise and effective sensing of vibration for machinery and structural condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Meanwhile, an increasing number of researchers and practitioners make an attempt to gain an intelligent diagnoser in a pattern recognition way. A question naturally emerges of how to combine the two techniques to improve the robustness of an on-board diagnostic system. In this context, this paper suggests an integrated approach that combines the unknown input observer (UIO) with the support vector machine (SVM) technique to aircraft engine fault diagnosis. Sensor faults and actuator faults are separately considered. To reduce the effect of engine disturbances on diagnostic performance, we first design a bank of UIOs, each of which is sensitive to all sensor and actuator faults but only one signal. Then, the magnitudes of a set of residuals between the UIO-based estimations and the engine measurements are fed into an SVM classifier to detect and isolate engine faults. Experimental results demonstrate an encouraging potential of the suggested method and that the UIO-oriented approach is superior or competitive to the Kalman-based algorithm.

This effort employed an existing, NASA developed, aircraft engine model. A critical engine actuator within the model was replaced by a dynamic, physics based EMA model that includes: controller, motor, drivetrain and feedback sensor sub-models. The actuator model includes simulation of the electrical, mechanical and thermal response of the system. The resulting platform was used to simulate a range of critical actuator fault conditions including: feedback resolver fault, ball-screw degradation, motor winding short, and LVDT non-linearity. Since the available experimental data from propulsion system EMAs is very limited, this platform provides an ideal opportunity to evaluate and enhance prognostic capability for critical engine applications. The model fault tests were used to demonstrate a prototype prognostics and health management (PHM) system for engine EMAs. First, the system response was used to develop an appropriate mode detection algorithm to identify the ideal system conditions for collection of diagnostic evidence. Then, using the acquired transient and steady-state system response, diagnostic data features were derived from EMA related sensors and engine performance parameters. Using these features as a starting point, a system level reasoner was created using multiple classification techniques including LDA, QDA and SVM. Using model generated data with simulated system variance, it was demonstrated that the reasoner provides excellent fault detection, isolation and severity assessment capability for all considered fault modes. Finally, a suitable actuator life model was developed and a probabilistic prognostic approach was used to determine the remaining useful life of the system.

DEVELOPMENT OF A STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY FOR GAS TURBINE PROGNOSTICS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2011, VOL 4			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo 2011	JUN 06-10, 2011	Vancouver, CANADA	ASME, Int Gas Turbine Inst				In the field of system engineering, the main goal is the prediction of the future health condition of a system and of its components, starting from field measurements taken in the past. This is aimed to optimize both production and maintenance, from both a technical and an economical point of view. In this context, this paper presents a methodology, based on the Monte Carlo statistical method, which aims to determine the future operating state of a gas turbine. The methodology allows the system future availability to be estimated, to support a prognostic process based on past historical data trends. One of the most innovative features is that the prognostic methodology can be applied to both global and local performance parameters, as for instance machine specific fuel consumption and local temperatures. First, the theoretical background for developing the prognostic methodology is outlined. Then, the procedure for implementing the methodology is developed and a simulation model is set up. Finally, different degradation-over-time scenarios for a gas turbine are simulated and a sensitivity analysis on methodology response is carried out, to assess the capability and the reliability of the prognostic methodology. The methodology proves robust and reliable, with a prediction error lower than 2 %, for the availability associated with the next future data trend.

A detection system may also reduce maintenance costs by increasing the time between inspections and reducing the number of spares required. Currently, the only method to monitor engine rotor degradation is through periodic removal of the engine from service, disassembly, and inspection of each rotor. The objective of this study was to propagate a crack in a cyclic engine test and evaluate the ability of an eddy current sensor and Reasoner software system to isolate a crack and predict its remaining useful life. The engine used for these tests was a Spey RB168 Mk 101 engine with titanium blades. Prior to the engine test, low cycle fatigue (LCF) spin-pit testing was carried out on a pre-flawed disk to validate understanding of the disk crack growth and reduce the risk of fracture during engine testing. Time of arrival data was collected using the QinetiQ eddy current sensor based tip timing system, to investigate the blade movement caused by crack growth in the disk A greater understanding of the different types of faults that might exist in a rotor assembly and the ability to differentiate between them using the tip timing system is essential if the true nature of a fault is to be diagnosed and reported. A software Reasoner, using physics-based structural transfer functions to relate blade tip timing measurements to the damage state of the disk, was validated during the spin-pit test and was subsequently used on the cracked disk test at MoD Shoeburyness. The Reasoner provided real-time monitoring of the crack growth and remaining useful life of the component.

EFFECTS OF THE SHAFT NORMAL MODES ON THE MODEL-BASED IDENTIFICATION OF UNBALANCES IN ROTATING MACHINES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2011, VOL 6, PTS A AND B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo 2011	JUN 06-10, 2011	Vancouver, CANADA	ASME, Int Gas Turbine Inst				Model-based methods can be applied to identify the most likely faults that cause the experimental response of a rotating machine. Sometimes, the objective function, to be minimized in the fault identification method, shows multiple sufficiently low values that are associated with different sets of the equivalent excitations by means of which the fault can be modeled. In these cases, the knowledge of the contribution of each normal mode of interest to the vibration predicted at each measurement point can provide useful information to identify the actual fault. In this paper, the capabilities of an original diagnostic strategy that combines the use of common fault identification methods with innovative techniques based on a modal representation of the dynamic behavior of rotating machines is shown. This investigation approach has been successfully validated by means of the analysis of the abnormal vibrations of a large power unit.

The outlier objects can be distinguished from target objects if the information of the target class is available without knowing the outlier class by this algorithm. The machine condition can be monitored only using normal condition signals by applying this method to mechanical condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. It is unnecessary for this method to pre-process the signals to extract their features. The experimental results show that this algorithm has stronger classification ability and higher efficiency than conventional classification method of neural network.

This goal is typically achieved using sensor-based systems that can quickly detect and diagnose machine faults of various types. This paper proposes the use of a video event detection method based on spatiotemporal volumes (STVs) in a fault monitoring application to complement and improve upon existing systems. To detect faults, a set of image sequences are captured using a single web cam from the part dispensing region of an assembly machine testbed. The motion is segmented in each image creating binary frames which are stacked to build a STV. Normal operation of the machine is modeled by building a STV from several training sequences. New STVs are compared to the model and classified as either normal or faulty behaviour based on a calculated similarity measure. Both full-STV and partial-STV matching methods are tested. Test results show that the system is very effective on the data set collected. Recommendations for further exploration of this concept are made that include alternative video event detection techniques and different testbeds.

This could help to improve child mortality rate because 41% of all child death is reported during their neonatal period. Hence, a state of art modern Neonatal Intensive Care Unit is a prime need of any nation in order to improve child health and subsequently for socio economic development of a country like India. A Neonatal Intensive care Unit (NICU) consist multiple life saving machines which are continuously recording vital parameters of neonates and generating vast data at very high frequency. A context aware based timely monitoring of such systems is a crucial task which could able to help medical experts for efficient decision making. Considering multiple vital parameters and taking decision in a real time situation could be more improved by having efficient decision support system based on strong human computer interaction. In this present research work a human computer interface for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit has been proposed which utilizes Support Vector Machine to classify the health condition of neonates. A prognostic Index has been proposed which could be calculated on the basis of seven important vital parameters.

For this purpose sensors gather the physical condition of the machinery. This sensor signals are interpreted by the machineries control system which can trigger a reaction on the fault event. The global propagation of mechanical fault indicators over the casing make vibrational measurements ideal for an obtainment of the whole system. But due to the signal corruption in noisy environment it is a challenging task to process this vibrational data, especially when no explicit. process knowledge is available. The process model free framework presented in this work takes advantage of specific fault signatures like frequency modulation. To identify this modulation a spectral prediction algorithm is proposed. Normalizing the prediction error of each spectral component adjust the algorithm to the machinery casing transfer characteristics. In this way also process noise can be suppressed effectively. These features are used to indicate changes in the process state and faults. In addition to the framework a sample implementation is presented and evaluated on centrifugal compressor and bearing datasets. The results show an advantage in detecting compressor surge or bearing fault in comparison to kurtosis statistics, especially in the case of a high noise level or weak fault signatures.

UIO(Unique Input/Output) and its improved method UIOv are the ones most widely used among them. The disadvantage of UIO is its low fault detection rate, UIOv is proposed to solve this problem. While UIOv possesses a longer test sequence. Several improvements on UIOv sequence generation and their shortages are described in details. In this paper, we suggested a new method which is based on these improvements. Our method takes the general communication protocols into account, a detailed algorithm process and conclusions combined with actual protocol are subsequently presented. Analysis showed that under a constant error detection rate, our method shortens the verification sequence length and the total sequence length effectively, besides, it is more conducive to programming.

A prognostication health management (PHM) methodology has been presented for electronic components subjected to mechanical shock and vibration. The presented methodology is an advancement of the state-of-art, which presently focuses on reactive failure detection and provides limited or no insight into the system reliability and residual life. Previously damage initiation, damage progression, and residual life in the pre-failure space has been correlated with microstructural damage based proxies, feature vectors based on time, spectral and joint time-frequency characteristics of electronics [La112004(a-d), 2005(a-b), 2006(a-f), 2007(a-e), 2008(a-f)]. Precise resistance measurements based on the resistance spectroscopy method have been used to monitor interconnects for damage and prognosticate failure [Lall 20094(a,b), 2010(a,b), Constable 1992, 2001]. In this paper, the effectiveness of the proposed particle filter and resistance spectroscopy based approach in a prognostic health management (PHM) framework has been demonstrated for electronics. The measured state variable has been related to the underlying damage state using non-linear finite element analysis. The particle filter has been used to estimate the state variable, rate of change of the state variable, acceleration of the state variable and construct a feature vector. The estimated state-space parameters have been used to extrapolate the feature vector into the future and predict the time-to-failure at which the feature vector will cross the failure threshold. Remaining useful life has been calculated based on the evolution of the state space feature vector. Standard prognostic health management metrics were used to quantify the performance of the algorithm against the actual remaining useful life. Application to part replacement decisions for ultra-high reliability system has been demonstrated. Using the technique described in the paper the appropriate time to reorder a replacement part could be monitored, and defended statistically. Robustness of the prognostication algorithm has been quantified using standard performance evaluation metrics.

Extrapolation of a degradation model based on particle filtering (PF) approach, which is implemented on state-space model, is a popular method to predict RUL. Taking into account the characteristics of state-space model, the initial setting of process and measurement noise has a great impact on the predicted result. This paper discusses the individual performance of two popular PFs, sequential importance resampling PF and auxiliary PF, when they come to different noise characteristics. Two groups of initial process and measurement noises were set to compare the predicted performance between these two PFs. The prediction of battery RUL was demonstrated in this paper as a case study. The comparative results were used for reference to other-related degradation components or system using PFs-based prediction.	[Xing, Yinjiao; Ma, Eden W.

Their function maybe simple, but the reliability of the solder joints may affect the entire device or system. They are usually the weak links when the electronic products are exposed to a variety of load conditions from their operation and storage, such as temperature cycling, vibration, shock and humidity. One of the most important parameters of solder joints is electrical stability. The resistance or impedance will rise as the fracture spreads through the solder joints. The reliability of solder joints is often determined through continuous DC resistance measurement, but it not very sensitive. In recent years, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) technique has been found to be a better alternative that are required for monitoring the degradation of interconnects. At high frequencies, signal propagation is concentrated at the surface of interconnects, a phenomenon known as the skin effect. Degradation of interconnects, such as cracking of solder joints due to fatigue or shock loading, also usually initiates at the surface and propagates inward. Therefore, even a small crack at the surface of a solder joint may change RF impedance. A physical crack initiated at the surface of the solder joints results in the increase of RF impedance. Thus, the crack length should be correlative with RF impedance or Reflection Coefficient, and the failure time of the solder joint could be estimated in view of electronic theory and the theory of fracture. A mathematic model was proposed to predict the relationship between the time domain reflection coefficient of solder joint and the crack length in it. Impedance-controlled circuit boards on which surface mount components were soldered have been developed. Partially and entirely cracked solder joints were produced for test in advance. The RF impedance was observed to increase in response to partial cracking of the solder joint, while the DC resistance did not indicate any anomalies. The technique of RF impedance analysis shows potential as a prognostic tool that can provide advanced warning of impending failures of solder joint.

These test benches are used within the context of two laboratory sessions of a subject dealing with predictive maintenance of electrical installations and machinery. During the laboratory sessions, the students must proceed to the integral application of the different condition monitoring techniques. The test benches enable a simple capture of the current signals in machines with rather different constructive characteristics as well as operating and fault conditions. Stationary current signals are later analyzed by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-conventional approach-whereas the startup current signals are processed using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-modern transient-based approach. The obtained results serve to show the students the suitability and application scope of each particular technique with regards to the diagnosis of failures in electric induction motors.

Sensitive Interturn Fault Diagnosis in Induction Machine using Vibration Analysis	2012 IEEE FIFTH POWER INDIA CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 5th Power India Conference	DEC 19-22, 2012	Murthal, INDIA	IEEE		Analytical wavelets; fault diagnosis; induction machine; k-nearest neighbor; vibrations		Vibration analysis based interturn fault diagnosis and condition monitoring, using minimum computations is explored in this paper. The voltage imbalance is often confused with turn fault (TF), and has therefore been a challenge to diagnose the fault under varying supply-frequency and load conditions. The application of analytical wavelets in incipient fault diagnosis using vibration analysis, under such grid perturbations is highlighted in this paper. Once the feature extraction is performed using analytical wavelets, it is classified effortlessly using simple algorithm like KNN. The performance metrics brings out the benefit of using an efficient feature extraction for processing machine signatures. The turn fault can be identified at its very inception using this technique under varying conditions.	[Seshadrinath, Jeevanand; Singh, Bhim; Panigrahi, B.

Support Vector Machine based Fault Detection & Classification in Smart Grids	2012 IEEE GLOBECOM WORKSHOPS (GC WKSHPS)	IEEE Globecom Workshops		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)	DEC 03-07, 2012	Anaheim, CA	IEEE		Smart Grid; transmission systems; fault detection and classification; Support Vector Machines		Smart Grids have recently attracted the attention of many profound research groups with their ability to create an automated and distributed energy level delivery. Computational Intelligence (CI) has been incorporated into various aspects of the smart grids, including fault detection and classification, which is a key issue in all the power systems. This paper presents two novel techniques for fault detection and classification in power Transmission Lines (TL). The proposed approaches are based on One-Class Quarter-Sphere Support Vector Machine (QSSVM). The first technique, Temporal-attribute QSSVM (TA-QSSVM), exploits the temporal and attribute correlations of the data measured in a TL for fault detection during the transient stage. The second technique is based on a novel One-Class SVM formulation, named as Attribute-QSSVM (A-QSSVM), that exploits attribute correlations only for automatic fault classification. The results indicate a detection and classification accuracy as high as 99%. Significant reduction (from O(n(4)) to O(n(2))) in computational complexity is achieved as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, which use Multi-Class SVM for fault classification. Moreover, unlike state-of-the-art techniques, both of these techniques are unsupervised and online and can be implemented on the existing monitoring infrastructure for online monitoring, fault detection and classification in power sytems.

REs cause an air-gap flux density amplitude modulation, resulting in four superimposed flux distributions with 2(p +/- 1) poles in 2p-pole SGs, which correspond to four virtual rotors. The armature winding is decomposed through symmetrical components, which define two additional 2(p +/- 1)-pole virtual armatures. Four fault-related 2(p +/- 1) -pole virtual machines are so obtained, whose currents provide a good estimation of REs. Theory and simulations for a six-pole 1950kVA machine are provided in this paper. Simulations of the 1950kVA SG and tests on a four-pole 17kVA SG with regulated eccentric flange provided confirmation of the theoretical work.

The manufacturers and users of the variable speed drive systems are now concerned about the reliable operation of these systems and emphasized to predictive maintenance of the drives. In line-start motors, current signature analysis has been widely used for fault diagnosis. In addition to the mechanical parameters such as speed and noise, other electrical signals including torque, power, and magnetic field have been also considered and their disturbing features upon the characteristics of the above-mentioned quantities have been utilized for fault detection. Keeping in mind that there is much need for further research on the fault diagnosis in the inverter-fed induction motors, an extensive review on this topic is provided in the present article. This review helps to the new comers in the field who arrive to this area with open mind and carry out further research successfully.

This paper presents a technique based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for diagnosis of the rotor fault. According to the application, the speed and the load can change and therefore the amplitudes of the fault signals are modulated. A support vector machine is used in the detection to learn the complex relationship between the various frequency bands of wavelet features to obtain a model which is impervious to such variations. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the ROC graphs indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting the fault.	[Seshadrinath, Jeevanand; Singh, Bhim; Panigrahi, B.

The rolling element bearing includes both ball bearings and roller bearings. Rolling element bearings operate with a rolling action whereas plain bearings operate with a sliding action. In various applications, these bearings are considered as critical mechanical components since defect in these components may lead to malfunction and catastrophic failure in some cases. Vibration analysis is one of the most established methods used to evaluate the condition of bearings in operating machines. In this paper, an abnormal detection structure, in which different types of abnormal detection routines can be applied, is proposed. Bearing fault modes and their effects on the bearing vibration are discussed. In order to achieve this purpose, a feature extraction method is developed to overcome the limitation of time domain features. Experimental data from bearings under different operating conditions are used to verify the proposed method.

FPGA based Signal Prefiltering System for Vibration Analysis of Induction Motor Failure Detection	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, COMMUNICATION, CONTROL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (C3IT-2012)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)	FEB 25-26, 2012	INDIA			FPGA; Vibration Analysis; MUT; EWMA	ANALYZER	Timely diagnosis of faults in industrial equipments is a concern to guarantee the overall production process efficiency. For instance, vibration analysis has been one of the few important approaches for motor failure detection. However, vibration sensory signals are often corrupted with random noise, processing of which leads to inaccurate results. Thus, there is a necessity of low cost instrumentation with proper filtering capabilities for online vibration measurement which can be permanently fixed to the machine under test (MUT) for continuous monitoring and reliable diagnosis. The present work compares three signal averaging based filtering techniques for the purpose of analysis. The filters have been implemented in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) which are characterized by reduced power consumption and high operational speed for real time applications. To test the functionality of the proposed algorithms, case study of an accelerometer data attached to an Induction motor has been taken up and the results have been analyzed.

The instantaneous frequency is introduced here as sinusoidal or periodic frequency is quite ineffective in tracking the fast changing frequency and amplitude during start-up motor transient. Envelope is the argument of the analytic signal obtained from complexing the start-up motor current as the real part and its Hilbert transform as the imaginary part. As the envelope works on narrow band frequencies or mono-component signal, it was analyzed using higher order wavelet at higher wavelet level which belongs to the narrow band harmonics/frequency components. In this method, the traditional difficulties in complete masking of the small amplitude harmonics or frequency components close to fundamental during FFT or problems of selecting mother wavelet(not a known priori) for transient analysis based on periodic frequencies have been overcome. Detail coefficients at higher wavelet level below 50 hz are processed to determine Power Detail Density, defined as PDD and Power Detail Energy, defined as PDE for faulty and healthy motor. PDD and PDE have been used here as fault parameters. The method works with higher detectabiliy and higher resolution. It requires less computational time, less processing power for which it can be utilized simultaneously online as well as offline. The method has been validated in a laboratory prototype.

Because the fault of HTS is always a gradual process, it is very significant to identify the slight fault, which is very important to improve the safety of HTS. Artificial intelligence plays an important role in this field. The HTS monitoring method based on vibration measurement is presented in this paper. Firstly, the posterior probability is obtained by the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Secondly, the risk function is introduced to minimize the average risk of diagnosis. The experiment of the hydraulic pump fault proved the validity of this method.

In this paper, we propose a method to assess the cooling performance degradation and load history of printed circuit boards in electronic equipment by use of a hierarchical Bayes model based on CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) results of thermal stress simulation and experiment data from actual measurements. We applied this method to a notebook PC that can monitor the device load factor and revolution number of cooling fan. It is shown that this method can estimate the temperature and deformation distribution of the printed circuit board from monitoring variables through latent variables such as thermal dissipation of the device and thermal boundary condition by use of the hierarchical Bayes model. And it is confirmed that the statistical load assessment concerning thermal cyclic load and the maximum load distribution can be conducted using the estimated temperature and deformation data. We verified that the cooling performance degradation can be assessed, if the temperature difference per unit thermal value between two suitable points on the printed circuit board can be obtained. Furthermore, we attempted the estimation method based on the hierarchical Bayes model to dynamic load assessment such as cyclic drop impact for PCB. The assessment method for the strain range distribution of the solder joints on the PCB was conducted to lead to the conservative results for reliability design. It is concluded that the proposed method can be effective to assess the field load history and cooling performance degradation.

C	Lall, P; Gupta, P			ASME	Lall, Pradeep; Gupta, Prashant			FAILURE-MODE CLUSTERING FOR ELECTRONICS UNDER SHOCK AND VIBRATION USING NEURAL-NET BASED SELF-ORGANIZED MAPS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2010, VOL 4			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition (IMECE)	NOV 12-18, 2010	Vancouver, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers			FINE-PITCH BGAS; TIME-FREQUENCY; RELIABILITY; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; CSPS	In this paper prognostic framework for electronic systems has been developed with neural network based self organizing maps for clustering of failure modes. The presented approach resides in the pre-failure space with a focus on electronic systems with multiple failure modes. Portable electronic products subjected to transient shock may exhibit multiple failure modes in vicinity of the interconnects. Failure is often diagnosed by loss of functionality using techniques including the built-in self test, which provides limited insight into reliability and remaining useful life. Unsupervised learning of the neural net has been used to train the neural net for identification of individual failure modes. Feature vectors have been developed based on damage pre-cursors from time-spectral measurements. The clustered damage pre-cursors have been correlated with failure modes of the underlying damage. Several chip-scale packages have been studied, with leadfree second-level interconnects including SAC305, SAC405 alloys. Transient strain has been measured during the drop-event using digital image correlation and high-speed cameras operating at 100,000 fps. Continuity has been monitored simultaneously for failure identification. In addition, explicit finite element models have been developed and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, trace fracture, package falloff and solder ball failure. Fault modes predicted by simulation based pre-cursors have been correlated with those from experimental data. Activation of different neurons in the lattice for various failure modes and combinations of failure modes has been demonstrated. Previously the authors have developed techniques based on statistical pattern recognition for leading indication of impending failure and detection of damage initiation and progression [La 11 2006(a), 2007(a), 2008]. Early classification of multiple failure modes in the pre-failure space is new.

Signals measured from a gearbox were compared to corresponding signals from simulations. The gearbox simulation model includes dynamics of input, lay and output shafts, gear bodies, bearings, and kinematics and tribology of gear tooth contacts. These were assembled into a systems model via bond graphs. To make simulations emulate measurements, the model's parameters were "tuned". A direct physical correspondence between parameters and real system elements locates faults. Considered was gear tooth cracking. Faults disturb normal flow of power and signal through a machine. Viewing the gearbox as a communications channel, and applying information theory theorems to the perturbed signals permitted assessment of the gearbox's functional health.

The life-expectancy prediction of a patient is highly significant in decision making for treatments, medications and therapies. This paper addresses the motivation behind the need of hybrid model approach to survival prediction for breast cancer. The conventional approach of survival prediction faces difficulties in handling complex non-linear correlation between the prognostic factors and tumor progression, the censoring issue in medical data and the need to process the growing number of macro-scale and molecular-scale prognostic factors. The issues in breast cancer survivability are discussed with some examples of prominent works from machine learning approaches. Current trends and advancements of hybrid intelligent system are also presented.

Fault tree has been established in this paper by analyzing factors leading reciprocating compressor fault based on the method of fault tree. 21 minimum cut sets leading to reciprocating compressor fault can be gotten through qualitative analyses on this fault tree, the happening probability of the top event can be calculated and the importance of the basic event s can be analyzed through quantitative analysis. The expert inquiry method combined with fuzzy sets theory is adopted to assess the happening probability of the basic events and top events. Reciprocating compressor is extensively used in many petroleum and chemical enterprises for high compression ratio of single stage and high work efficiency. Once the machines are abnormal and fault,it will affect the normal production, bring huge economic loss.Development of reciprocating compressor fault diagnosis, fault elimination can be invisible, the normal operation of the machine can be ensured, economic benefit be improved. ([1]) Application of fuzzy fault tree theory can effectively diagnose reciprocating compressor failure probability, and quickly identify the predisposing factors causing failure.

Application of Wavelet Transform to Discriminate Induction Motor Stator Winding Short Circuit Faults from Incipient Insulation Failures	2012 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POWER AND ENERGY IN NERIST (ICPEN)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Power and Energy in NERIST (lCPEN)	DEC 28-29, 2012	Nirjuli, INDIA	IEEE		Induction Motor; Stator winding fault; incipient insulation failure; Extended Park's Vector Approach; Continuous WaveletTransform	DIAGNOSIS; INTERTURN; MACHINES; TIME	Stator winding insulation faults in induction motor can be classified in two categories namely, direct inter-turn short circuit faults and incipient insulation failures. Both these two types of faults, when involving less number of turns, may remain undetected by normal protection schemes since such minor faults do not hamper normal operation of the motor. However, if these faults are not caught early they can lead to major failures in stator winding. The fault detection problem becomes more complicated when direct inter-turn short circuit faults and incipient insulation failures exhibit similar fault current magnitudes. The present contribution reports experimental results on an induction motor where both these two types of faults have been emulated. Park's Transformation has been used to extract AC components of the Park's Vector Modulus (PVM) of three phase line currents under different operating conditions of the motor. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) has been used to extract several features from the non-stationary AC components of PVM. These features have been used to discriminate stator winding inter-turn faults from equivalent incipient insulation failures.

However, robots in factory should be overseen by human workers in order to check whether task condition is anomaly or not. In order to reduce human cost, anomaly detection for assembly task is important. A task to tighten a screw as one of assembly tasks is focused on. In this paper, we propose a method to generate high confidence area in the map of features based on nonlinear support vector machine with Gaussian kernel. By proposed method, a robot system can reduce occasions to make mistake in recognition of task conditions.

To alleviate this problem, vehicle diagnosis and maintenance systems are increasingly being performed remotely, that is while the vehicle is being driven without need for factory recall and there is strong consumer interest in Remote Diagnosis and Maintenance (RD&M) systems. Such systems are developed with different building blocks/elements and various capabilities. This paper presents a novel automotive RD&M system and prognosis architecture. The elements of the proposed system include vehicles, smart phones, maintenance service centers, vehicle manufacturer, RD&M experts, RD&M service centers, logistics carry centers, and emergency centers. The system promotes the role of smart phones used to run prognosis and diagnosis tools based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) multiple classifiers. During the prognosis phase, the smart phone stores the history of any forecast failures and send them, only if any failure already occurred during the diagnosis, to the RD&M service centre. The later will then forward it to RD&M experts as a real failure data to improve the training data used in prognosis classification and predication of the remaining useful life (RUL). The (LS-SVM) is used widely in prognostics and system health management of spacecraft in-orbit and it is applied to monitor spacecraft's performance, detect faults, identify the root cause of the fault, and predict RUL. The same approach is applied in this paper. Finally, the RD&M software architectures for the vehicle and the smart phone are presented.

In this paper, a machine-learning method Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) is used to automatically detect, isolate, and even forecast the faults, while keeping the reliability and safety of complex system. Each dysfunctional model is completed by GMMs during machine learning, which constitutes the diagnosis system to distinguish and troubleshooting the faults. On the other side, principal component analysis (PCA) is combined with the system to improve the efficiency of GMMs, which can effectively compress the high dimensional data. Except for that, GMMs helps the system to achieve the visualization of dysfunctional models. With this visualization, the prognosis system can surveil the evolution of data and estimate their tendency, which is important to forecast the next condition of the complex system. The diagnosis and prognosis system proposed in this paper has been fully tested by using actual experimental data of aircraft X, which is supplied by Dassault Aviation.

The method relies on knowledge of the typical energy consumption of the described devices using different workloads (the energy signature of the machines). At runtime, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to classify the input energy data into two pattern descriptions, typical of regular workloads expected on the devices. Consecutive mismatches between the output of the SVM and the workloads observed in real time indicate possibility of incipient failure at device level. The method is implemented using Web Services deploying Service Oriented Architecture in a real multirobot factory automation industrial testbed, originally used for assembly of mobile phones.

The two discussed alternatives confront a traditional centralized monitoring approach against a Web Service based approach. Advantages and disadvantages of one choice over the other are considered. Both solutions make possible condition based and predictive maintenance as opposed to cyclic maintenance (the approach utilized before these improvements came into place in the presented industrial setting).

The considered system is cascade composition of two finite state machines and is exposed to transient faults that cause unauthorized state transitions. Using the theory of corrective control for asynchronous sequential machines, the proposed framework yields an output feedback controller that diagnoses and tolerates any transient faults occurring to the system so that the closed-loop system can continue the normal behavior. With no observation module added, the controller can determine which component experiences a transient fault. An illustrative example is provided for sketching the design procedure of the proposed controller.

In this paper, we apply the corrective control scheme to a space-borne dual ring counter subject to Single Event Upset (SEU) faults. By virtue of hardware redundancy lying in the dual ring counter, we design a corrective controller that tolerates any SEU fault that causes unauthorized state transitions. Since the output of the counter is unavailable to the controller, input/output control methodology is required for realizing fault diagnosis and tolerance. As a case study, we implement the proposed controller and a 4-bit dual ring counter in VHDL code, and conduct an experiment on the procedure of fault tolerance under a synthetic fault scenario.

However, releasing poor-quality designs to the market can be dangerous, since a missed deadline in hard real-time systems can be catastrophic. Thus, early detection of potential problems in these systems is mandatory, since it may reduce the risks of fault propagations from early specification to the final code. This paper presents Calau, an environment for modeling and analyzing embedded real-time systems. Calau supports the mapping process of SysML State Machine diagram into a Time Petri Net with Energy consumption in order to analyze timing and energy consumption requirements in the early phases of embedded real-time systems development life cycle. It allows designers who do not have expertise in formal model, to design and analyze embedded system specifications quantitatively and qualitatively. We show the applicability of our tool by detailing an example.

The wavelet is used for analysis in fault detection due to its good filtering characteristics, localized capability and superior de-noising. The FT algorithm is applied to a 1 kW induction motor (IM) to maintain the performance of the machine at an acceptable level. The FTC algorithm has been implemented in a new topology to ensure best performace recovery in case of open and short stator winding faults as well as speed sensor faults. In the worst scenario of operation, a protection stage has been implemented to stop motor operation. Experimental results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the technique for diagnosis and prognosis of stator and speed sensor faults. The Texas Instrument TMS 320F28335 is used for the real-time implementation of the proposed wavelet based prognosis and the FTC of IM drive under different fault situations.

A critical decision, particularly in the context of complex systems, is the number and location of the sensors given a set of technical and non-technical constraints. This paper provides a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) -based sensor placement optimization methodology for power systems' health monitoring. The approach uses the functional topology of the system, physical models of sensor information, and Bayesian inference techniques along with the constraints. Information metric functions are used for optimized sensor placement based on the value of information that each possible "sensor placement scenario" provides. The proposed methodology is designed to answer important questions such as how to infer the health of a system based on limited number of monitoring points at certain subsystems (upward propagation); how to infer the health of a subsystem based on knowledge of the health of the main system (downward propagation); and how to infer the health of a subsystem based on knowledge of the health of other subsystems (distributed propagation). Dynamic BBN is used as the engine of projecting the health of the system.

Incipient Turn Fault Detection and Condition Monitoring of Induction Machine using Analytical Wavelet Transform	2012 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING (IAS)	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society (IAS)	OCT 07-11, 2012	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Discrete wavelet transforms; Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Support vector machines		Diagnosis and monitoring the condition of induction machines is critical for industries. Incipient fault detection has received a lot of attention in recent years. In this paper, a method based on complex wavelets is proposed for incipient fault detection and condition monitoring. A Complex wavelet-Support vector machine (SVM) classifier is developed which takes into account four conditions i.e.: healthy, turn fault (TF) under balanced supply conditions, voltage imbalance and interturn fault with voltage imbalance, both occurring at same time. The performance metrics show the ability of the technique to identify the fault at an early stage and it also provides additional information regarding which of the four conditions is prevailing at a given time. Voltage imbalance and turn fault are often confused. Both affect the performance of the machine and the unbalanced voltage condition considerably reduces the winding insulation life due to overheating. A comparison with standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) shows the effectiveness of the method in providing reliable information under variable supply-frequency conditions.

Analysis of Current Reaction on Inverter-Switching to Detect Changes in Electrical Machine's High-Frequency Behavior	38TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2012)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual Conference on IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON )	OCT 25-28, 2012	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS), Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES)	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS)		STATOR; MOTOR	Adjustable Speed Drives (ASD) are the favorable choice in a fast increasing scope of applications. Although generally highly reliable, continuous condition monitoring of electrical drive systems becomes more and more important, as the adoption of such systems in safety critical applications, like x-by-wire and in the so called more electric aircraft, increases. To fulfill the demand of high efficiency and good return on investment the different drive components are operated at or near their rated values. This fact and additional stress added due to high dynamic operation, fast switching of modern power electronics like IGBT lead to increased risk of drive breakdown. In many applications this is completely unacceptable and has to be compensated by preventive maintenance, fault tolerant operation or continuous condition monitoring and detection of faults in an early stage. A variable speed drive basically consists of three main components - the inverter, the cabling and the machine itself. These components - including their parasitic elements - form a complex impedance system. The proposed method evaluates the transient current reaction on inverter switching. A change in this reaction is correlated to a change in the mentioned complex impedance system, e.g. resulting from degradation of the insulation system. Application of high-frequency current sampling and further signal processing allow a very accurate monitoring of system parameters and even small changes in magnitude and location can be detected. Experimental results proof the applicability of the proposed condition monitoring technique.	[Nussbaumer, P.; Santin, C.; Wolbank, Th.

The fault detection methodology proposed is based on digital signal processing techniques applied to the available SEIG electrical signals. In order to get the enough data to perform the analysis, the dynamic model of SEIG was simulated in Matlab/Simulink (R) platform. The simulated models describe the machine behavior under healthy and several faulty conditions. The main characteristics of the signals were obtained by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform and the Global Wavelet Spectrum applied on the stator voltages of the generator. A particular pattern, for each operating condition, was observed and quantified. Consequently, the fault detection technique is characterized by a low computational cost for practical implementation.

It can produce fast and reliable monitoring results using a simple measurement technique. However, it is sensitive to disturbances such as sensor calibration, inherent machine asymmetry and supply voltage unbalances. This paper demonstrates an effective phasor compensation technique for these disturbances to allow more accurate shorted turn fault detection.

So far, the research has been carried out mainly in the detection of localized faults, but the diagnosis of distributed faults is still under development. In this context, this work presents a new scheme for detecting and classifying both kinds of faults. This work deals with a new diagnosis monitoring scheme, which is based on statistical-time features calculated from vibration signal, curvilinear component analysis for compression and visualization of the features behavior and a hierarchical neural network structure for classification. The obtained results from different operation conditions validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed methodology.	[Delgado, M.; Garcia, A.; Ortega, J.

This indicator is based on the statistical analysis of the stator current spectrum. The principle of the method is to compare the current spectrum to a healthy reference spectrum. The reference spectrum is used to center and reduce the current spectrum and provides an indication on its difference from the reference spectrum. A statistical based indicator is then constructed as the sum of the contributions of the centered reduced spectrum for different interesting frequency bands. This indicator has been tested on 2 different test campaigns, for 4 different speeds and compared a vibratory indicator. Results show that the proposed indicator evolves the same way than the vibratory indicator and provides with an efficient detection of bearing fault with only very few false alarms.

When these systems employ real vibration data obtained from bearings artificially damaged, they have to cope with a very limited number of training samples. Moreover, an important issue that has been little investigated in the literature is the presence of noise, which disturbs the vibration signals, and how this affects the identification of bearing defects. In this paper, a new strategy based on the fusion of different Support Vector Machines (SVM) is proposed in order to reduce noise effect in bearing fault diagnosis systems. Each SVM classifier is designed to deal with a specific noise configuration and, when combined together - by means of the Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) technique - they provide high robustness to different noise-to-signal ratio. In order to produce a high amount of vibration signals, considering different defect dimensions and noise levels, the BEAring Toolbox (BEAT) is employed in this work. Experiments indicate that the proposed strategy can significantly reduce the error rates, even in the presence of very noisy signals.

Detecting Partially Fallen-out Magnetic Slot Wedges in AC Machines Based on Electrical Quantities only	38TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2012)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual Conference on IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON )	OCT 25-28, 2012	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS), Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES)	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS)		INDUCTION-MOTORS; FAILURE ANALYSIS	The winding system of high voltage machines is usually composed of pre-formed coils. To facilitate the winding fitting process stator slots are usually wide opened. These wide opened slots are known to cause disturbances of the magnetic field distribution. Thus losses are increased and machine's efficiency is reduced. A common way to counteract this drawback is given by placing magnetic slot wedges in the slots. During operation the wedges are exposed to high magnetic and mechanical forces. As a consequence wedges can get loose and finally fall out into the air-gap. State-of-the-art missing slot wedge detection techniques deal with the drawback that the machine must be disassembled, what is usually very time consuming. In this paper a method is investigated which provides the possibility of detecting missing magnetic slot wedges based only on measurement of electrical quantities and without machine disassembling. The method is based on exploitation of machine reaction on transient voltage excitation. The resulting current response contains information on machine's magnetic state. This information is composed of several machine asymmetries including the fault (missing wedge) induced asymmetry. A specific signal processing chain provides a distinct separation of all asymmetry components and delivers a high sensitive fault indicator. Measurements for several fault cases are presented and discussed. A sensitivity analysis shows the high accuracy of the method and the ability to detect even partially missing slot wedges.

Nonetheless, this conventional approach has many constraints, most of them related to the usual operation of most motors under situations differing from a pure stationary regime, or directly under transient conditions. Indeed, these situations are the most common in many industrial processes, a fact that reveals the necessity of developing techniques suited for the analysis of machine quantities during non-stationary operation. A vast work has been developed during these recent years in this area, raising many transient-based techniques being able to diagnose machines under transient conditions which furthermore overcome some of the drawbacks of conventional stationary analysis. Most of these techniques are based on the application of proper signal processing tools, especially adapted to analyze transient signals (time-frequency decomposition (TFD) tools). This paper carries out a review of the most significant techniques sustained on transient-analysis, grouping them in accordance to the nature of the TFD tool used in each case.

These indicators are based on the analysis of stator current. As bearing defect signatures can be tracked through amplitude increase of some current harmonics, two specific indicators have been built-based on energy considerations and on the Spectral Kurtosis analysis. These indicators are tested on a real industrial fan equipped with ceramic balls, in its environment. Several measurements for different operating points are tested to validate the approach and to its robustness during long time tests. From an experimental comparison between a healthy fan and another with damaged bearings, a frequency selection is performed to identify the frequency ranges where the energy is the most sensitive to the considered faults. This actuator is used in an air conditioning fan in aeronautic applications.

Several high resolution spectral estimation techniques have been developed and used to detect induction machine abnormal operating conditions. In this paper, a modified version of MUSIC algorithm has been developed based on the faults characteristic frequencies. This method has been used to estimate the stator current spectrum. Then, an amplitude estimator has been proposed and a fault indicator has been derived for fault severity measurement. Simulated stator current data issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach has been used to prove the appropriateness of the method for air gap eccentricity and broken rotor bars faults detection.

The SWPT is used for feature extraction under lower sampling rate. MWSVM is developed to perform the faults recognition. Different binary Multiclass SVM strategies are compared with various wavelet kernel functions in terms of classification accuracy, training and testing complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to detect the faulty conditions with high accuracy.

The model enables simulating nominal and faulty PMSM behavior, with several stages of degradation, and is supported by tests results. Specific indicators are proposed for each fault. They do not require additional material or sensors since they are based on the signals already monitored for the machine control. An application is made on a 9-slots 8-poles synchronous machine being popular in aeronautics.

The first one consists in designing the full physical or empirical model of the system in healthy and faulty conditions. The major drawback of this approach is the difficulty to obtain an accurate model reflecting all the operating conditions and phenomena. The second approach, used in this work, consists in using signal processing techniques for the characterization of the healthy and faulty behaviors. This paper deals with the study of a fault detection and isolation procedure on a three phase inverter feeding an induction machine drive using pattern recognition techniques. The diagnosis procedure relies on the use of classifiers after the collection of the output currents of the inverter flowing in the machine windings. The proposed classifiers are based on Support Vector Machines (SVM). We show in this paper how it is possible to tune the SVM and also the influence of the data normalisation to perform an effective diagnosis with experimental data.

Indeed the most efficient way of reducing these costs would be to continuously monitor the condition of these systems. This allows for early detection of the generator health degeneration, facilitating a proactive response, minimizing downtime, and maximizing productivity. This paper provides then an assessment of a failure detection techniques based on the homo polar component of the generator stator current and attempts to highlight the use of the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) as a tool for failure detection in wind turbine generators for stationary and non stationary cases.

Despite the performed work researches and the improvement that has been brought, these machines still remain the potential seats of failures both in stator and rotor levels. Consequently, WRIM faults detection is currently one of the centers of interest of several researches of both academic and industrial laboratories. In fact, this article addresses this problem by the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for faults detection in Electric Vehicle Engine (EVE). An accurate analytic modeling of healthy and faulted EVE is suggested to perform the data matrix needed for PCA method. Tests were achieved using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Analysis of EVE tests proves the efficiency of PCA method. Several results will be presented and discussed.	[Ramahaleomiarantsoa, J.

The method is associated to a fusion process based on belief functions which analyze the measurements. In previous works, it has been shown that it is possible to detect the inter-turns short circuit in the stator windings of electrical machines using a noninvasive method. It is based on the analysis of the variation of sensitive harmonics when the load varies, and eliminates the main drawback presented by other diagnostic methods which use the comparison with a healthy state assumed known. Several measurements around the machine are necessary to increase the probability of the fault detection because the fault position relatively to the sensor can strongly influence the results. So in this paper it is proposed to exploit conjointly the whole measurements in order to obtain a more robust and reliable diagnostic and to increase the probability of detecting the fault. The merging of the different estimations being realized through the belief functions framework, this approach is tested on real measurements. Experimental tests are performed on a special rewound induction machine in order to validate the theoretical approach.

It is shown that under these conditions, the instantaneous frequency plot of the main fault component versus the slip is a straight line with a specific slope and offset. In addition and for a given pole pair number, this pattern is not dependent on the machine features, nor the way in which the load changes. Besides, the practical methodology of this technique is introduced for diagnosing mixed eccentricity. The approach is validated by laboratory tests.

Significant progress has been made in identification of faults in electrical machines employing intrusive and non intrusive methods. In most of the published work, supervised learning technique is form the core approach for identification and classification of faults. This technique is more suitable for new commissioned machines. For the development of diagnostic algorithm, complete set of fault signatures over the machine's life span are required. However, in case of machines which are already in-service, complete set of signatures reflecting different fault states can't be made available for development of diagnostic algorithm. This imposes a sever limitation on diagnosis algorithms. In this paper, a proposed method is presented which can be employed for the identification of operational health state of in-service machines. The proposed method is based on the comparison of principal components. Fault diagnosis is based on features extracted from time frequency representation of fault current.

Novel Methodology for Improving Performance of Sensorless Speed Observers in Induction Motors at Variable Load Conditions	38TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2012)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual Conference on IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON )	OCT 25-28, 2012	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS), Montreal, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES)	Univ Quebec, Ecole Technologie Superieure Montreal (ETS)	Experimental study; Field programmable gate arrays; Performance analysis; Speed observers; System-on-chip; Variable load	DRIVES	Speed observation of rotating machines under different operational conditions is required in applications from fault detection to traction. Sensorless rotating speed observation has become popular in recent years. The MRAS rotor-flux-oriented and synchronous models are common schemes used for sensorless speed observation. These techniques are affected under low rotating frequencies and variable load conditions. This work presents an experimental analysis on the performance of both schemes during rotating speed estimation under different rotational frequencies and variable-load conditions. Obtained results show performance deficiencies on their estimations according to the rotational speed and load. A double scheme methodology that mixes the MRAS-based and the synchronous speed observers through a compensation function is proposed. Its performance analysis indicates an improvement on the estimated speed at different rotational frequencies with variable load. An FPGA-based implementation is developed as a low-cost, portable system-on-chip solution for real-time online estimation of rotating speed on induction motors.

There is a lack of works dealing with the diagnosis and identification of multiple combined faults. In this framework, this paper presents the stator current bi-spectrum analysis to detect two types of faults mixed together which may appear in three phase induction motors. Based on real experimental data, the detection study concerns isolated rotor broken bars and damage in the bearing's inner race rolling element. For multiple faults detection, and for lack of experimental data, only synthetic data are used. To deal with the frequency analysis, a mathematical model of the stator current has been derived and used into the bi-spectrum formulas. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a theoretical method which may help the user to assess the presence of fault frequencies in induction motors in both settings namely single or multiple combined faults. To highlight the superiority of the bi-spectrum tool over the spectrum, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis has been carried out. Therefore, simulation results are performed in noisy environment showing that the bi-spectrum is able to detect frequency faults better.

They can solve small-sample learning problems better by using Structural Risk Minimization in place of Experiential Risk Minimization. It can solve the problem of small sample sets learning and avoid the problem of over-learning with limited swatch amount at the same time. A fuzzy SVM multi-category classifier system model based on "one-against-all" is designed and established, which improves the performance of SVM and classification precision by reducing the blind area with fuzzy theory. It has good learning ability and generalization performance by the experiment with RBF-NN, Common-SVM and Fuzzy-SVM. At last, this model is applied in engine fault diagnosis, which improves classification accuracy and satisfies with the request of fault diagnosis for the engine.

To overcome the above issues, symbolic dynamics based method is proposed. The time series vibration data is converted into symbolic series from which dictionary of the signal is constructed. Common Signal Index (CSI) a parameter is computed based on dictionary constructed from the reference signal and the test signal. Deviations of the computed CSI value from the CSI value of the healthy state serve as an indicator for the presence of bearing fault. No-load healthy vibration data is used as a reference signal to detect the bearing in healthy or faulty condition. The algorithm is tested with the experimental data obtained for different bearing fault of various sizes and at varying loads. Comparisons of the proposed method with existing time-domain and data based methods are made.	[Muruganatham, Bubathi; Sanjith, M.

In all prognostics approaches, identification of appropriate monitored parameters, which can be employed to predict imminent failure, is critical. However traditional approaches, data-driven prognostics and model-based prognostics have their limitations. This paper proposes a fusion prognostics framework, which identifies the appropriate parameters monitored by failure modes, mechanisms and effects analysis (FMMEA), and predicts system remaining useful life by data-driven prognostics based on Bayesian theory. The fusion prognostics framework leverage the strength from both approaches to provide better predictions of remain useful life.

Compared with the spectrum analysis method via Fourier transformation, it is more effective for the rotating machinery vibrating signal analysis. Extracting the rotor system fault feature frequency from Hithert marginal spectrum can not only enhance the frequency resolution, but also remove other unrelated frequency component, so as to make the spectrum peak of the fault feature frequency more obviously, and the analysis diagnosis results more accurately. This method result is applied to the fault feature extraction and diagnosis of the rotor system, and the analysis results of the experiment signal verify the validity of this method.

The influences of rotational speed and initial phase difference on the operation stability of the rotor-bearing system are discussed. It transpires that the response of the rotor system with axial rub- impact is mainly synchronous periodic motion. The vibration signals of axial rub-impact include such as the synchronous signal and the multiple frequencies, in which the synchronous signal is dominating signal. There is no weakening wave phenomenon in time wave plot. All the results are in reasonable good agreement with those observed in engineering. The results of this paper could provide certain reference for fault diagnosis and self-healing of large high-speed rotating machinery system, thus ensuring the safe operation of the system.

The main goal of this paper is to identify the faster detection of transients in synchronous generator terminals by using the real-time wavelet coefficients of both the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and maximal overlapped discrete wavelet transform (MODWT), as well as identify the best mother wavelet for this purpose. Faults with very damped transients were obtained through an experimental system composed of an actual synchronous generator connected to a simplified power system and good results were obtained, showing the efficacy of the wavelet transform for real-time fault detection.

The proposed scheme has been also tested through external faulted cases as well as energizing inrush phenomenon. In addition, it has been compared with a conventional differential algorithm. The results have shown that the proposed intelligent technique provides fast, sensitive and reliable detection of minor internal turn-to-turn faults in power transformers. The dynamic simulations of a test benchmark have been conducted using the PSCAD/EMTDC software.

The method was used to predict early detection, transition from normal cell to cancerous cell and prognosis signature of patients with adjuvant systemic therapy. Several genes were selected as susceptible genes associated with breast cancer. It can be shown by the results that the "cognition" BPR method could correctly predict detection, cancerous cell transition and good or poor prognosis signature with approximate 85%, 98% and 88% accuracy separately. In order to study the performance of BPR, Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machine (SVM) methods also were applied to analyze the gene expression data. From the results, it can be found that the BPR method is superior to FDA and SVM with respect to classification ability. Furthermore, the prediction performance can be improved through using biomarker instead of whole gene expression data for any method.

The approach monitors the evolution of the statistical complexity of the generated vibrations envelope vis-a-vis its Renyi entropy. The statistical complexity is obtained through the wavelet coefficients calculated from the generated vibrations. Such an approach allows seamless estimation of the remaining useful life of the monitored drive without any prior information about the operating conditions and no a priori data regarding the physical characteristics of the monitored drive.

These specific AC brushless motors are increasing their importance in automation machineries because they can work with a built-in flexibility. In particular the angular displacement of the shaft is continuously monitored by an embedded encoder while the control system allows to perform complex motion profiles such as polynomial ones, even with the inversion of the rotating direction. Direct-drive motors avoid the presence of a mechanical cams or gearboxes between the motor and the load with a subsequent money-saving. On the other side, unfortunately, the diagnostics of ball bearing in those motors is not trivial. In fact most of the solutions proposed in the literature require a constant frequency rotation of the shaft since the characteristic fault frequencies are directly proportional to speed of the motor. It follows that in a varying speed application the fault characteristic frequencies change instantaneously as the rotational frequency does. In this paper an industrial application is considered, where the direct drive motors are used in the kinematic chain of an automated packaging machine performing a cyclic polynomial profile. The basic idea is to focus on signal segmentation using the position profile of the shaft - directly measured by the encoder - as trigger. Next the single cycles of the machine is analysed in time domain, again using encoder signal machine contribution is deleted. Feature extraction for damage detection is done by applying the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the STFT for each cycle is averaged in time-frequency domain in order to enhance fault signature. Finally, the sum of STFT coefficients is used as a simple indicators of damage.

The PCs are optimized to represent hidden characteristics of the healthy data as experienced over different operating conditions. The auto-encoder may thus be used to detect signal distortions (discrepancies) in a novel signal, where the discrepancies are the result of machine faults. By analyzing the vibration signal piece-wise by means of block windows it is possible to generate a discrepancy signal. The discrepancy signal indicates the time instances and associated severity of individual signal discrepancies. The periodicity of the discrepancy signal, as analyzed by means of its spectrum and cepstrum, allows for insight into which gear components are damaged. The case study assumes that neither any additional transducers, nor any historical fault data are available.

This study is presented to compare the performance of bearing fault detection using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA). The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from preprocessed signals are used as inputs to ANN classifier for five-class recognition (one normal and four with different levels of fault). The system of features selection is based on genetic algorithms as optimization method and the trace criterion from the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as evaluation function.. The ANNs are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions, and tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated with and without features selection. The results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology.

In this paper is proposed, a diagnosis method of rotating machinery using vibration signatures using a Radial Basis Function classifier. Recorded signals were preprocessed with a Wavelet Decomposition and indicators were extracted both in temporal and frequency domains. To improve diagnosis performance, two techniques for dimension reduction of indicators space were combined; Principal Component Analysis and the ReliefF filter. The method was tested on real signatures from a vibration test rig, operating under several conditions, the results showed the interest to look closely at the choice of indicators in order to obtain best diagnosis performances.

Currently, vibratory analysis becomes the most reliable tool for the conditional maintenance of rotating machines. The associated techniques evolved so much that one passed from a simple late detection to the diagnosis, even the prediction. Researches in this field are directed towards the possibility of anearly detection, several signal processing techniques, often adapted to a precise defect type, were established throughout these last years.

In particular this paper focuses on the condition monitoring of ball-bearings in variable-speed applications. In this context the paper aims to present a simple method inspired and derived from the mechanisms of the immune system, and its application in a real case of bearing faults recognition. The proposed algorithm is a simplification of the original process, adapted to a particular case of a much bigger class of algorithms and methods grouped under the name of Artificial Immune Systems, which have proven to be useful and promising in many different application fields. The proposed algorithm is based on the Euclidean distance minimization in the evaluation of the binding between antigens. Experimental results are also provided with an explanation of the algorithm functioning.

In contrast to the typical method of using Fourier analysis of the steady-state stator current, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) methods have been found to better analyze the time changing nature of the current spectrum of these machines at start-up when broken bars exist [1]. This paper advances the analysis to Wavelet Packets (WP) in order to study the high order harmonic components of the spectrum which constitute a useful source of information in situations where tracing the low-frequency fault harmonics (sideband components) may not reach a definite diagnostic (i.e. presence of low-frequency load torque oscillations, effect of inter-bar currents, etc...).

Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system. The presented structure is generic and can be extended to the verification and validation of other diagnosis and prognostic algorithms on different platforms. It has been successfully preventing aircraft system/subsystem failures, identifying and predicting failures that will occur, which provides real application on making health management information and decisions.

The mechanical failures account for more than 60% of breakdowns of the system. Therefore, the identification of impending mechanical fault is very important to prevent the system from illness running. It generally requires high performance computer to complete the traditional parallel computing, while the parallel FFT algorithm based on Hadoop MapReduce programming model can be realized in the low-end machines. Combining with Cloud Computing and equipment fault diagnosis technology, it can realize the massive data parallel computing and distributed storage.

IEEE Guide C57.104 and IEC Publication 60599 recommend several DGA diagnostic methods used for utilities and most of them are available to classify the different types of faults using gas ratios or %gas. However, the task of DGA interpretation is not easy because they often can provide unresolved diagnoses and wrong diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new method for gas interpretation that has higher accuracy and more reliable diagnoses. This paper proposes new diagnostic methods to classify six types of faults specified in IEEE Guide C57.104 and IEC Publication 60599 using gas ratio and relative % of combustible gases (H-2, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 and CH4). And accuracy of the proposed diagnosis methods was verified using IEC TC10 and related databases. Also, on-line DGA diagnostic system, HiDGA(Hyosung intelligent Dissolved Gas Analysis), that is possible to continuously monitor transformer in service is developed and it is possible to identify faults of transformer by visual inspection using new diagnostic method that applied to diagnostic HMI(Human Machine Interface).				kym1777@hyosung.com					[Anonymous], 2011, Patent No. [P201109-021KR-10-2011-0142843, 20110902110201101]; [Anonymous], 2008, D10115 CIGRE TF; [Anonymous], 2011, Patent No. [P201109-020KR-10-2011-0142842, 20110902010201101]; [Anonymous], 2011, Patent No. [P201109-019KR-10-2011-0142841, 20110901910201101]; Duval M., 2002, IEEE ELECT INSULATIO; Duval M., 2001, IEEE ELECT INSULATIO; IEEE, 2008, C57104 IEEE; International Electrotechnical Commission [IEC], 2007, IEC PUBL; Kim S.

It has a direct influence in the process and product. When the vibrations in a machine increases, this increasing has a logical reason, it could be a mechanical problem if there are no transient conditions or not properly installed or bad operation or inappropriate design. Diagnosis of a multi-stage turbocompressor that have common signs of some mechanical faults with the correct evaluation and correction could be considered useful and valuable experience. This case study was done by vibration, phase, coast down and orbit analysis then unbalance of rotor was diagnosed and confirmed by condition monitoring department. Olefin plant production capacity and revolution of turbine have direct proportion, in other words rising of turbine revolution will cause increasing of production capacity. Vibration amplitude in high pressure compressor were been proportional with square increasing turbine revolution. So that this rising of vibration and reaching to the danger threshold had been caused restriction of plant production capacity or reducing production.

Different from classical diagnostic and prognostic system, like Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) / Prognostic Health Management (PHM), this system can be used on aircraft not only off-line for maintenance, but also at on-line during its flight mission. Machine learning of the system will be done with more powerful computer at Aircraft Ground Center or Maintenance Center. According to the different situations requirement and different equipment's conditions, two monitoring terminals are built: one is on operation at the aircraft on-line, which only needs to make 2 judgments of the health of aircraft - normal (contains the small faults which fault tolerant system can resolve) and dangerous (- back to airport) for pilot; another one is for the maintenance office, which needs detailed diagnosis results and to forecast the aircraft health. In comparison with some other methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is more convenient and stable. Unlike expect system or others methods, it can easily add new faults and new rules into database. In addition, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), it can also make a visualization of evaluation of flux data with haut dimension and of their boundary, which is used to realize prognosis and useful for engineers to study faults. This system should not be a black box. Indeed, it is designed to illuminate engineering consulting services, and to accumulate the knowledge for re-engineering purposes (including diagnosis operational rules) and the design of new aircrafts. The system has been fully tested by using actual experimental data from Dassault Aviation.

A continuous assessment method is the new method on assessing the condition of equipment that had gained an interest lately compared to the traditional time-based maintenance. One of these methods is known as condition-based monitoring. This predictive maintenance with the aid of online monitoring provides an indication of the equipment's condition. The development of measurement technologies and data analysis techniques using computational methods have an advantage of saving time and improve safety. This paper will review computation methods using in the time domain monitoring to determine the condition of the equipment in detail.

This paper reviews a strategy for a maintenance management system based on Failure Mode Avoidance, which uses advanced techniques and technologies to underpin a predictive maintenance strategy. It is shown how condition monitoring (CM) is important to predict potential failures in high precision machining facilities and achieve intelligent and integrated maintenance management. There are two distinct ways in which CM can be applied. One is to monitor key process parameters and observe trends which may indicate a gradual deterioration of accuracy in the product. The other is the use of CM techniques to monitor high status machine parameters enables trends to be observed which can be corrected before machine failure and downtime occurs. It is concluded that the key to developing a flexible and intelligent maintenance framework in any precision manufacturing operation is the ability to evaluate reliably and routinely machine tool condition using condition monitoring techniques within a framework of Failure Mode Avoidance.

Among the rotating machinery, many mechanical problems are attributed due to bearing failures. So implementing condition monitoring for bearing is critically needed. Considering that most research for condition monitoring only focus on detecting the existing fault, this paper add degradation tendency prognostics into the condition monitoring process. The kernel of bearing condition monitoring method presented in this paper is related to condition features extraction and remaining useful life prediction. The former is realized by the comprehensive vibration analysis for specific fault frequencies. The latter is achieved by adaptive neuron-fuzzy inference system based on extracted degradation signal. For illustration purpose, a bearing case from NASA data repository is used to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The result indicates that the performance degradation of bearing can be effectively monitored and the predicted remaining useful life with 5.6% relative error can be the important reference for maintenance decision making.

Matlab possesses many signal analytic functions and Delphi has a friendly visual programming environment. These two advantages are fully combined in the mixed programming. This system can be easily upgraded to expand new analytic functions with help of COM module technology. Fault diagnosis of a grinding machine is carried out by using this system. A same vibrational signal sampled from the machine is analyzed in turn by three methods in this system that are Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Wigner-Ville Distribution(WVD) and Choi-Williams Distribution(CWD). Comparing with the three results, it shows that CWD can get best diagnostic information and validity of the estimation on the instantaneous frequency of a signal. Success of the mixed programming is presented meantime.

Base on a general dynamic model of a non-salient PMSM subjected to the multiphase inter-turn short circuit fault, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed which can provide a diagnosis of the fault position and level by identifying the amount of the shorted turns for each phase. The advantages of the proposed algorithm, is the capability of single, multiple and simultaneous phase ITSC fault diagnosis. The proposed method is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Extensive simulation studies provide preliminary verification of the fault diagnosis scheme.

It is now becoming an effective way to manage massive hardware resources in flexible scales. While power and hardware cost can be significantly saved through virtualization, the fault detection of system becomes more difficult due to the increasing scalability and complexity in a virtualized environment. In this paper, a fault detection framework for virtualized environments is proposed, multiple levels, including application server (AS), operating system (OS) and virtual machine monitor (VMM), are considered in a holistic manner. The framework has been evaluated through a benchmark, Bench4Q. Results show the effectiveness of our framework. And the overhead of our framework is less than 10%.

This paper introduced the expansion of the fourth-order cumulant matrices in estimating the dynamic fault source number, plus the relationship between the source signal number and the number of sensors being utilized in the selection of the blind source separation algorithm to achieve adaptive blind source separation. Experiments showed that the source number estimation algorithm could be quite effective in estimating the dynamic number of fault sources, even in the underdetermined condition. This adaptive blind source separation algorithm could then effectively achieve fault diagnosis in respect to the positive-determined, overdetermined and underdetermined blind source separation.

This has encouraged researchers to develop methods for improved monitoring of industrial units. This work is based on a pathway modeling approach using multi-block PLS as the mathematical machinery. The proposed approach is a multivariate data analysis procedure which divides the process data into different blocks, determines relationships among the blocks, which are then used for fault detection. In the developed methodology, an extension of multi-block PLS, a special modification of the PLS technique is realized by incorporating the H-Principle in the algorithm. This renders it different from PLS as the analysis is done in steps, maximizing the product of size of improvement of fit and associated precision at each step. The T-2 statistic is primarily used as an indicator of normalcy or fault in the system. This new technique is illustrated via application to two industrial-scale, high-fidelity simulated systems namely the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and a Depropanizer Process (DPP).

As batteries age to the point of replacement, individually, and collectively in single and multiple string systems, we are finding individual and combined characteristics, collective and distinctive fingerprints indicating aging and end of life conditions. In this paper, this is shown and described both in descriptive and graphical presentation. These individual and collective traits cannot be simulated and seen conclusively in the laboratory setting. Accelerated life testing, due to the artificially shorter time required, reduced quantity of data, plus other restraints of simulation do not reflect real world data. These studied traits can only be reliably observed in real life usage conditions over months and years. This is achieved through continuous and frequent monitoring of key signature measurement parameters. Archival of data, trends, and events plus detailed analysis are essential to observe actual battery behavior over real lifetime periods. As a battery ages, there are changes over time in the internal ohmic value. As researched and stated in various IEEE standards, rises in Ohmic Value greater than 30 - 50% are significant and warrant investigation. While not definitive, this level of rise from a baseline of a 100% capacity battery is an indication that the battery has decreased below full capacity of when the battery was new and performing to manufacturer's specifications. Further evidence showing correlation of ohmic values vs. capacity has been shown in extensive studies performed several years ago (2002) by EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute.) A great deal of controversy exists regarding the correlation of ohmic value vs. capacity shown and calculated during a battery discharge test. This controversy continues to exist regardless whether the battery user performs ongoing discharge tests after initial acceptance discharge tests or not. Most users elect to rely on ohmic values and trends plus other measurement parameters to determine RUL (Remaining Useful Life.) and replacement criteria. This is done without periodic discharge testing which can cause risk and additional costs. These aging changes are caused by time, temperature, electrical and chemical variances, mechanical and other anomalies, plus usage patterns, interfaced equipment, charge/discharge cycles, harmonics, and load levels. All aging factors will cause ohmic values to rise or change as the battery decreases in capacity. Some common aging factors causing Ohmic rise or change are listed in this paper. Continuous frequent monitoring and record keeping of battery ohmic values, plus other battery measurement parameters are essential to predicting end of life conditions. This is true for individual battery units, as well as the complete battery system. Measuring, trending, and archiving ohmic values over time, in addition to other measurement parameters that affect ohmic values allow for extensive predictive analysis. In addition, continuous monitoring, data analysis and archived trend analysis help maintain battery unit and system state of health (SOH), state of charge (SOC), and allow for the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL). Observation, collection of this data and the use of proven mathematical prognostic techniques and models can be combined for lifetime prediction and forecasts. This will be part 2 of this paper. Prognostic methods are varied and diverse. They include many modeling techniques. Examples include: Bayesian theories, Neural Networks, Moving Averages, Kalman Filters, and many other high level mathematical models. These methods allow for the prediction of future points in calculated curve series utilizing data from battery Ohmic values which are affected by other measurement parameters including temperatures, AC float and ripple voltages and currents, etc. In addition, these prognostic techniques can also be used to prove or disprove various charging techniques (i.e.: Intermittent charging, individual cell or unit boosting or equalization charging), and other methods being used to potentially improve and extend VRLA life. The purpose of this paper is an introduction to battery aging fingerprints using ohmic trends, familiarization of definitive prognostic analysis techniques, and the using of historical models to develop future analysis methods. Continuous monitoring and analysis builds up an archived database that can be analyzed during the life of the battery asset. Actions can be taken in real time to maintain health as the battery system ages by identifying individual batteries in need of maintenance or replacement. In addition, actions can be taken to predict not only individual battery replacements, but also when the battery system /string(s) have fallen below safe capacity to perform. (<80%). An example of five single battery string lifetimes supporting a single UPS through time is shown. These strings and individual battery units within the strings are shown through 4 lifetime string replacements, their respective life fingerprint profiles, which include individual battery unit failures. Fourteen years of battery unit and string(s) history supporting a UPS are shown in graphical format.

Frequently MCM/PHM systems will examine vibration data from rotating machinery and define models describing the system's current state. However, vibrations can be affected by many different forces, and state detection generally only seeks to understand some of these. To help eliminate the effects of irrelevant forces, we propose generating a baseline vibration pattern while the machine is operating under stable environmental conditions, and then differencing out this baseline from any data gathered afterwards. In this way, abnormal states will be identified by how they modify baseline behavior. We present a case study demonstrating this approach using data from a dynamometer test bed, and show that the modified data leads to more general models (models which can be built from one environmental condition and applied to others) than using the data without modification.

This study revolves around analyzing and interpreting vibration signals gathered from multiple accelerometers installed on various components of a dynamometer designed to test the drive train and generator of the turbine. We applied feature level fusion to combine these vibration readings, and then assessed the abilities of six well known machine learners to detect changes in state from the raw accelerometer data and from the fused data. Analysis of the performance of these classifiers showed more stable performances for the six classifiers in detecting the state of the machine from the fused data versus from the data from the individual sensor channels.

The uncertain material parameters in Paris' law are modeled as random variables and the crack propagation process based on Paris' law is treated as stochastic. The failure time of a cracked gear is expressed as the summation of a series of orthogonal polynomials with random variables. The stochastic collocation algorithm is employed to obtain the numerical solution of the stochastic equation. Comparing to Monte Carlo simulation, generalized polynomial chaos technique is capable of considering multi-dimensional uncertainty space with faster convergence rate, which allows the equipment health prognostics to be implemented in a practical and much more efficient way.

Key variables in iteration are computed approximately by Monte Carlo sampling which effectively solves the problem that some integrals can't have analytical solutions and at the same time overcome the constraint of vector machine kernel selection in traditional algorithm. Prognostic outputs are of the form of probability distribution which is more suitable for prognostic application. Finally, A simulation experiment is adopted which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Their complex structures make it difficult to detect pending faults in a timely manner. In fact, simultaneous existence of different faults is frequently found in diesel engines. To ensure the security of diesel engines, it is involved with two issues. One is the on-line condition monitoring, and the other is the intelligent fault diagnosis. However, the investigations have been addressed to one of the two problems extensively in previous work while very limited work has been done to develop an on-line intelligent condition monitoring and fault diagnosis (CMFD) system. For this reason, a new intelligent CMFD system is proposed to on-line analyze the vibration signals using the Hessian-based locally linear embedding (HLLE) and support vector machine (SVM) in this work to detect the diesel engine faults and to prevent the malfunction of the machines. The vibration signals were firstly recorded on-line by an embedded system. Then the HLLE was used to reduce the dimensions of original vibration signals to extract useful fault features, and lastly the SVM was adopted for faults detection. Experimental tests have been implemented to evaluate the performance of the on-line intelligent CMFD system. The diagnosis results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective for the fault diagnosis of diesel engines. The faults can be detected on-line with a high rate of 90%	Yantai Engn & Technol Coll, Dept CNC Technol, Yantai 264006, Peoples R China		Xu, HF (corresponding author), Yantai Engn & Technol Coll, Dept CNC Technol, Yantai 264006, Peoples R China.	lifei_1970@126.com					Chen Ru-qing, 2008, Proceedings of the CSEE, V28, P70; Delvecchio S, 2010, J VIB ACOUST, V132, DOI 10.1115/1.4000807; [胡明江 Hu Mingjiang], 2011, [振动、测试与诊断, Journal of Vibration, Measurement and Diagnosis], V31, P464; Li Z., 2012, MEASUREMENT, DOI [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.06.013, DOI 10.1016/J]; Li Z., 2012, J MECH SCI TECHNOL, V26, P1; Li ZX, 2012, TRIBOL LETT, V47, P1, DOI 10.1007/s11249-012-9948-1; Li ZX, 2012, MECHANIKA, P29, DOI 10.5755/j01.mech.18.1.1276; Li ZX, 2011, J MAR SCI APPL, V10, P17, DOI 10.1007/s11804-011-1036-7; Li ZX, 2011, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V25, P2589, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.02.017; Maurya MR, 2010, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V23, P950, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2010.01.027; Shancang Li, 2007, Information Technology Journal, V6, P885; Sugumaran V, 2011, EXPERT SYST APPL, V38, P4088, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.09.072; [夏天 Xia Tian], 2011, [振动与冲击, Journal of Vibration and Shock], V30, P77; [肖云魁 XIAO Yunkui], 2008, [内燃机学报, Transactions of Csice], V26, P369; Xu Weiguo, 2010, Electric Power Automation Equipment, V30, P121; Zhao CL, 2011, EXPERT SYST APPL, V38, P9908, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2011.02.043	16	1	1	0	6	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	DURNTEN-ZURICH	KREUZSTRASSE 10, 8635 DURNTEN-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND	1660-9336		978-3-03785-520-1	APPL MECH MATER			2012	235						408	412		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.235.408			5	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Manufacturing	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering	BEE79	WOS:000316308600076					2022-02-14

The real-valued coding genetic algorithm is used to optimize the binary tree structure. In optimization algorithm, we use roulette wheel selection operator, partially mapped crossover operator, inversion mutation operator. In simulation experiment, we use Monte-carlo analysis for 40kHz Sallen-Key bandpass filter and get transient response of ten faults. Then we extract feature vector by db3 wavelet packet transform and principal component analysis (PCA), and diagnose circuit faults by different SVM methods. Experiment results show the proposed method has the better classification accuracy than one-against-one (o-a-o), one-against-rest (o-a-r), Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAGSVM) and binary tree SVM (BT-SVM). It is suitable for practical use.

In this study, we examine the influence of algorithmic parameters in the prediction power of a gene signature and in the selection process of the signature itself. We focus on one gene selection approach applied on a dataset of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using quite different parameters and evaluate the influence on the selected signature. In particular, we adopt a recursive feature elimination process where at each step the prognostic power of the set of remaining genes is evaluated by five different classifiers, as well as by four classifier-fusions schemes. More specifically, we consider the logistic-sigmoid, kernel nearest centroid, kernel minimum squared error, kernel subspace, and support vector machines as classifiers with different parameters and/or kernel functions. We also study four fusion methods in order to reduce uncertainties related to the classifier evaluating the prognostic significance of genes. In all cases, the selection process is embedded into a cross validation scheme in order to enhance the confidence on the generalization of results. We consider the differences of signatures based on gene overlap and also the biological annotation of selected genes, using the MIPS FunCat architecture. We found out that a robust identification of a number of highly differential genes can offer "good" predictive power to the models. Furthermore, the classification accuracy achieved by mixtures of experts can be significantly better than the one of the individual classifiers. We also pointed out that different selection schemes result in a diverse size of gene signature, with differences in the selected genes. Nevertheless, when we annotate the genes of each signature we find that the same biological processes are invoked, with possibly small differences in the relative frequency of participation.

The aim is to detect additive faults, i.e., faults in the actuators and sensors. The inconsistency between the actual behavior of the process and the expected behavior of the model is represented by means of residuals. For the isolation of faults, a limit checking criterion based on the energy content of a residual is employed. Furthermore, the load torque acting as an external disturbance is estimated by using a reduced-order observer. A simulation analysis shows the effectiveness of the parity space approach for the detection and the isolation of additive faults in a hybrid synchronous machine.

The current best practice employs heuristic decisions based on the TNM classification scheme that many believe can be improved upon. Much research has recently been devoted to searching for gene signatures derived from gene expression microarrays for this challenge, but a consensus signature is still elusive. We present an approach to first create a benchmark for recurrence prediction based only upon gender, age and TNM features that uses several learning classifier induction methods and combines them into an ensemble using a recent extension of the general regression neural network. Using this approach on a pooled sample of 422 patients from two previously published studies (Shedden and Raponi), we demonstrate error rates in the low 20% for both false positives and negatives. Future work will focus on discovering if gene signatures can be discovered that can improve this performance.	[Schaffer, J.

Fisher's linear discriminant is used to project the multiple SPs from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional space for distinguishing states, and discriminant rules are set by possibility theory. Moreover, sequential diagnosis is also proposed by which the conditions of the machinery can be identified sequentially. Sensitive evaluation method for selecting good symptom parameters using Distinction Index (DI) is also suggested for detecting faults in rotating machinery. Finally, practical examples of the diagnosis for rotating machine are shown to verify the efficiency of the method.

Bearing and gear fault diagnosis using adaptive wavelet transform of vibration signals	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES SCIENCE AND CONTEMPORARY ENGINEERING 2012	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances Science and Contemporary Engineering (ICASCE)	OCT 24-25, 2012	Jakarta, INDONESIA			Bearing defect; gear defect; condition monitoring; adaptive wavelet; continous wavelet transform (CWT)		The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is widely used for analyzing non-stationary vibration signals from rotating machines. It is a well known fact that, if the shape of the wavelet function matches adequately with the shape of the burst present in signal at a specific scale and location, a large transform value is obtained, and a low transform value is obtained if the signal and wavelet do not correlate well. It is also worth noticing that each rotating system and its corresponding defect signature are unique in nature. Therefore, the challenge remains in arriving with a robust wavelet function for the wavelet transform technique to solve any specific class of problem in hand. This challenge has been addressed in the present work and in order to understand the defect signature appropriately, the concept of adaptive wavelet design and its implementation for defect identification are discussed. In presence of seeded defects, a random burst from the vibration signal is used for designing the corresponding adaptive wavelet. Similarly, the designed adaptive wavelet is used to compute the CWT coefficients. The CWT coefficients so generated are compared with the standard wavelet based scalograms. The adaptive wavelet transform is shown to be apposite in analyzing the vibration signals and also is corroborated with the acquired experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V ...

In clinical routine, EF is often computed from manually or automatically segmenting the Left Ventricle (LV) in End-dyastole and End-systole frames, which is prohibitively time consuming and needs user interactions. In this paper, we propose a method to minimize user effort and estimate the EF directly from image statistics via machine-learning techniques, without the need for comprehensive segmentations of all the MRI images in a subject dataset. From a user-provided segmentation of a single image, we build a statistic based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient of similarity between image distributions for each of the images in a subject dataset (200 images). We demonstrate that these statistical features are non-linearly related to the LV cavity areas and therefore can be used to estimate the EF. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the features and areas. Then, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to predict the LV cavity areas from the dimension-reduced features. The EF is finally estimated from the obtained areas.

To explore this feasibility, resected, stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues from six survivor and six fatal cases were immunostained and scanned. Regions of interest were selected to include one cell and its centrosomes. After segmentation, feature abstraction, and optimization, six non-redundant features were used for statistical analysis and classification. Two analytic methods showed that for each feature, centrosomes from survivors differed from centrosomes of fatalities, indicating sampling from different populations. The data were classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machines (SVM) with 10-fold cross-validation. Classification accuracy was 74% by LDA and 79% by SVM, respectively, and further improved to 85% with bagging. Centrosome can be a biomarker for stage I NSCLC prognosis and has potential for clinical utility.

Effective signal de-noising and feature extraction methods are necessary to analyze these signals. In this paper, an improved lifting scheme is proposed for such vibration signal analysis. The auto-correlation factor of scale decomposition vibration signal is used as to optimize the prediction operator and update operator at each sample point, which can adapt to the vibration signal characteristic. Improved lifting scheme decomposition and reconstruction procedures are designed.

NSPs are defined for reflecting the features of vibration signals measured in each state. Detection index (DI) using statistical theory has also been defined to evaluate the applicability of the NSPs. The DI can be used to indicate the fitness of an NSP for ACO. Lastly, the state identification for the condition diagnosis of rotating machinery is converted to a clustering problem of the values of NSPs calculated from vibration signals in different states of the machine. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is also introduced for this purpose. Practical examples of fault diagnosis for rotating machinery are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The verification results show that the structural faults often occurring in a rotation machinery, such as a unbalance, a misalignment and a looseness states are effectively identified by the proposed method.

A compound method composed of optimal filtering, statistical analysis, and fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory based Mapping networks is able to detect and diagnose system and sensor/actuator failures. Although previously proven in the literature to be successful for systems that are well-described in a state-space representation, current research has shown the viability in extending the scheme to unknown and nonlinear systems while still maintaining failure detection and identification capabilities. This utility of the method has been demonstrated in a case study for determining failures in a known reusable liquid rocket engine model and an unknown input-output relation in a fluid flow test bed. Then, for providing prognostic statements regarding the remaining life of a component, research has also focused on an integrated neuro-fuzzy system. The developed technique uses fuzzy logic and rule-based knowledge for the preprocessing of training data, which is then fed into an artificial neural network for learning. Once trained, the artificial neural network was tested and deployed for prognostics by estimating remaining useful life.

Inter-turn Fault Detection in PM Synchronous Machines by Physics-based EMF Estimation	2012 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 15-20, 2012	Raleigh, NC	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc		Inter-turn Fault; permanent magnet synchronous machine; back (EMF) estimation; physics-based model of PMSM	DIAGNOSIS	Inter-turn short circuit fault (ISCF) detection, in permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSM) was developed using a physics-based back electromotive force (EMF) estimator. The electro-thermal saturation-dependent model of the machine was employed in the heart of the open loop estimator. The fault detection system works based on the difference between the estimated EMF and a reference EMF.

In this paper we proposed an improved algorithm which reduces the number of support vectors through the reduction of the sample spae to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. As the traditional fuzzy support vector machine cannot classify the sample with the same membership, so we use intuition index to lower the probability of the sample to get the same membership. Here we improve the accuracy of the algorithm through properly redefine the fuzzy membership and intuition index. Finally, we use the improved algorithm to build a multi-classifier based on one against one principle and the voting rules, and apply the multi-classification algorithm to the wind turbine gearbox fault diagnosis. The diagnose results prove that the improved algorithm we proposed can properly resolve the problem of wind turbine gearboxes fault diagnosis.

Hence, the current paper analyses the mechanism of system-level BIT false alarms. The technical process of system-level BIT false alarm recognition is presented. First, sensor damage states are estimated using sensor network time stress data generated during its lifetime. In different damage states, a dual support vector machine (SVM) relevance model is built, it can recognise system-level BIT type II false alarms induced by sensor faults. Subsequently, a fault propagation correlation model of the sensor network is set up. Based on this model, a false alarm recognition method is proposed based on probability reasoning. This method can effectively reduce system-level BIT type I false alarms caused by sensor network fault propagation. Lastly, a case about the helicopter horizon system is studied to validate the proposed technology.

In PLC controlled flexible manufacturing systems, there is no inherent automatic fault finding module in controller itself, so additional diagnostic module needs to be develop. Developed fault finding and diagnostic modules depending on measured data from the inspection machines and sensor data. In this work, a fault detection and diagnostic module is described based on internal PLC program signal data which is acquired through OPC Server. The observed or real-time PLC signal data is compared with normal PLC signal data to find out possible faults or deviations. The data acquisition procedure and the techniques used have been explained in this paper.

The mountain region consists of high mountain valley of deep and faults-knit environment, fragile geological, abrupt slopes, and steep rivers. With the rapid development in recent years, there has been not only great change in land use, but the destruction of the natural environment, the improper use of soil and water resources also. It is prudent to effectively build and renew the existing land use information as soon as possible. Among various land use status investigation and monitoring technology, the remote sensing has the advantages in getting data covering wide-range and in richness of spectral and spatial information. In this study, hybrid land use classification methods combining with an edge-based segmentation and three kinds of supervised classification methods, means Maximum Likelihood, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine, were conducted to automatically recognize land use types for Yi-Lan area using multi-resource data, e. g. satellite images and DTM. The second land use investigation result of Taiwan in 2006 by the Ministry of the Interior is assumed as the ground truth. The higher classification accuracy results indicate that the proposed methods can be used to automatic classify agricultural and forest land use types. Moreover, the results of object-based DT and object-based SVM are better than the ones for the object-based ML methods. However, adequate training is not easy to select the appropriate samples for the transportation, hydrology, and built-up land classes.	[Chang, K. T.; Lin, Y.

Vector-bispectrum is the bispectrum analysis method based on the full vector spectrum information fusion. It can be used to fuse the double-channel information of the rotary machines effectively and reflect the nonlinear properties in the signals more completely and accurately. In order to realize the aim that the faults of the machines can be diagnosed effectually and intelligently under the situation of the lack of the fault samples, the intelligent diagnosis method of the faults by combining the vector-bispectrum with SVDD is put forward. By using the vector-bispectrum to process the signals and extract the characteristic vectors, which can be used as the input parameters of SVDD. The classification model is set up and therefore the running states of the machines can also be classified. The method is applied to the gearbox fault diagnosis. The results indicate that the method can be effectively used to extract the characteristic information of the gearbox signals and increase the accuracy of SVDD in the fault diagnosis.

Directing to the difficulties of measuring the wear loss between the valve plate and cylinder barrel, this paper presents a hybrid prediction method based on EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and SVM (Support Vector Machine), in which EMD is used to get the pump's health state and PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization)-SVM is used to make a prediction for the pump's remaining useful lifetime. Oil-return flow was selected to indicate the wear condition of pump with several IMFs. SVM was trained by these IMFs, and then be used to predict the oil-return flow one-step ahead or multi-step ahead. In the SVM's training process, PSO was used to search the optimal parameter of SVM's kernel function. Applications show that hybrid prediction method has higher prediction precision and could be applied for the remaining useful lifetime prognostics.

Connectors subjected to harsh environments may experience vibration resulting in fretting corrosion and degradation in contact resistance over time. Tin coated, rectangular-pin and socket electrical connectors have been studied. Connectors are extensively used in automotive systems in conjunction with wire harnesses. Electronics may be full filling many vehicle performance critical functions including: collision avoidance, lane departure warning, supplemental restraint, and driver distraction detection. Connector degradation may cause electrical failure during or prior to vehicle operation. In this paper, a random vibration test profile has been used to stimulate the contact resistance degradation due to connector fretting corrosion. The contact resistance has been measured in situ using the resistance spectroscopy method in conjunction with phase sensitive detection. It has been shown that precise resistance spectroscopy and phase measurements can provide a leading indicator of failure significantly prior to the traditional definition of failure. Prognostic health management (PHM) is a useful tool for assessment of the remaining life of electrical components, and is demonstrated for electrical connectors in this paper. The ability to predict the remaining useful life of a connector can benefit operators with the knowledge of when to schedule preventative maintenance, aid in the cost optimization of operations and products and increase safety by providing advanced warning of potential critical failures. The presented approach can be used for assessment of damage accrual in connectors systems in the pre-failure space and prognosticate remaining useful life. Impending failure can be identified prior to both intermittent and catastrophic failure. Repeatability of the setup and the robustness of the unique PHM prediction algorithms have been quantified.

Aging has been previously shown to effect the reliability and constitutive behavior of second-level leadfree interconnects. Prognostication of accrued damage and assessment of residual life can provide valuable insight into impending failure. In this paper, field deployed parts have been extracted and prognosticated for accrued damage and remaining useful life in an anticipated future deployment environment. A subset of the field deployed parts have been tested to failure in the anticipated field deployed environment to validate the assessment of remaining useful life. In addition, some parts have been subjected to additional know thermo-mechanical stresses and the incremental damage accrued validated with respect to the amount of additional damage imposed on the assemblies. The presented methodology uses leading indicators of failure based on micro-structural evolution of damage to identify accrued damage in electronic systems subjected to sequential stresses of thermal aging and thermal cycling. Damage equivalency methodologies have been developed to map damage accrued in thermal aging to the reduction in thermo-mechanical cyclic life based on damage proxies. The expected error with interrogation of system state and assessment of residual life has been quantified. Prognostic metrics including alpha-lambda metric, sample standard deviation, mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, average bias, relative accuracy, and cumulative relative accuracy have been used to compare the performance of the damage proxies.

The damage may manifest itself as an open circuit after a finite period of operation. The traditional methods for damage detection such as microscopy and x-ray are destructive in nature and provide limited information offline. In this paper, resistance spectroscopy and phase-sensitive detection based state space vectors have been used to monitor the health of interconnects and assess remaining useful life. Two techniques including Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter have been used to estimate the future state of the system. The measured state variable has been related to the underlying interconnect damage in the form of inelastic strain energy density. Performance of both the prognostication health management algorithms during vibration and mechanical shock has been quantified using performance evaluation metrics. The methodology has been demonstrated on lead-free area-array and advanced interconnect electronic assemblies. Model predictions have been correlated with experimental data. The presented approach is applicable to functional systems where corner interconnects in area-array packages may be often redundant. Prognostic metrics including alpha-lambda metric, sample standard deviation, mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, average bias, relative accuracy, and cumulative relative accuracy have been used to assess the performance of the damage proxies. The presented approach enables the estimation of residual life based on level of risk averseness.

Previously, damage initiation, damage progression in electronic assemblies have been monitored using state-space vector from resistance spectroscopy and then be analyzed with particle filter (PF) and the theory of Bayesian. Precise resistance measurement based on the resistance spectroscopy method and the predicted model for the damage process, have been used to quantify the damage initiation and damage progression. However, they vary a lot in different materials and situation. The presented effectiveness of the proposed prognostic health management method based self-adaptive filter and Auto Regressive model. During a shock or vibration test, we can see that the damage of the solder must come from the previous damage in the last state. Therefore, the Auto Regressive model can help us get a precise step propagation function, build the relationship among the continuous state vectors, rate of change of the state vector and acceleration of state vector. With this relationship, we can construct a feature vector. In order to fit different material and situation, the weight of different state variables will be predicted by the self-adaptive filter in which the minimum mean square error algorithm will be used. With the estimated auto-correlation function, cross-correlation function metrics and state parameters, we can propagate the feature state vector into the future and predict the time at which the feature vector will cross the failure threshold. Therefore, remaining useful life has been calculated based on the propagation of the state vector. Standard prognostic health management metrics were used to quantify the performance of the algorithm against the actual remaining useful life.

In particular, we consider multiple faults detection and identification in Petri nets that have state machine structures (i.e., every transition in the net has only one input place and one output place). We develop an approximation algorithm to design the fault-tolerant Petri net controller so as to minimize the sum of the arc weights in the (input and output) incident matrices of the redundant controller. A design example for an AGV system is also provided to illustrate our approach.

Malaysia DOE is actively imposing the Clean Air Regulation to mandate the installation of analytical instrumentation known as Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS). CEMS is used to report emission level online to DOE office. As hardware based analyzer, CEMS is expensive, maintenance intensive and often unreliable. Therefore, software predictive techniques is often preferred and considered as a feasible alternative to replace the CEMS for regulatory compliance. The LSSVR model is developed based on the emissions data from an acid gas incinerator that operates in a LNG Complex. PSO technique is used to optimize the hyperparameters used in training the LSSVR model. Overall, the LSSVR models have shown good performance in certain key areas in comparison with the BPNN model.

The method adopts Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier to identify the power swing and fault types. The power swing blocking elements are based on monitoring the rate of change of wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet entropy of voltage and current signal, the positive current and zero sequence component. The process of training the LS-SVM using a K-folded cross validation process for determining the values of parameter sigma and parameter gamma in RBF kernel parameters can minimize the classification error. The proposed method can successfully detect power swing and provide power swing blocking signal for accurate distance protection.

The advantages of the RVM over the support vector machine (SVM) are probabilistic predictions, automatic estimations of parameters, and the possibility of choosing arbitrary kernel functions. Most importantly, RVM is capable of comparable classification accuracy to SVM, but with fewer relevance vectors (RVs) and higher testing speed. Performances of RVM are analyzed and validated using typical classification examples and then RVM is applied to fault diagnosis of transformer. The RVM-based fault diagnosis of transformer is described in detail. The method takes normalized transformer feather gases content as inputs. Transformer fault diagnosis model is constructed based on binary tree classification method. Experimental results show that RVM-based transformer fault diagnosis is capable of comparable or even more excellent diagnosis accuracy to SVM, but with typically highly sparse models and highly diagnosis speed.

Aiming at this issue Based on the reliability test technique, the scheme of accelerated degradation testing for aerospace relay was designed. The test system of aerospace electromagnetic relay storage parameters under temperature-accelerated stress was designed and developed. Taking a certain aerospace electromagnetic relay as the research object, the accelerated storage degradation testing was carried out. The most past research on storage reliability of relay only focuses on the measurement of relay contact resistance. And, the relay time parameters (closing time, opening time, overtravel time, rebound duration time.) which reflect main performance function was not monitored. So, in this paper the relay time parameters and relay contact resistance were detected simultaneously. The test system of relay storage parameters could be implemented the function that the contact resistances and time parameters of 40 aerospace relays under several temperatures were monitored automatically at the same time. And, the test system transmitted the test data to the host computer for processing. According to the analysis on experiment results of contact resistance, relay time parameters, the degradation phenomena and degradation mechanism of aerospace electromagnetic relay in long-term storage are investigated. These studies provide the basis and reference for latter aerospace electromagnetic relay storage life prediction and using the method of prognostics and health management.

The uniqueness of the proposed architecture is the ability of MAM to evolve in the wake of an attack of malicious intent by mutation and thus always monitoring a power system bus remotely. Also, the architecture interacts with the mutated agents using a voting methodology thus alleviating the effect of agent malfunction in the presence of an attack. This architecture also enables inter-agent communication which makes a collaborative framework and increases the degree of fault tolerance. This architecture is tested on a two-area, five-machine, and 8 bus power network for abnormal condition detection, generator bus isolation, and also for restoring power to the area which is affected by the bus isolation. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed methodology is capable of not only detecting the power grid attack but it can also continuously monitor and isolate the generator bus even in the presence of sustained attack as the agents are regenerated.

This is performed using a reconfigurable circuit topology working in tandem with two adaptive agents: a fault diagnostic agent and fault-tolerance agent. The fault diagnostic agent uses the trajectory of a condition monitoring vector and its momentum and applies a support vector machine approach. Thus, it is fast and reliable to be used under transient conditions, while the existing techniques either require a long processing time or perform well only under steady-state conditions. Using Q-learning, the fault-tolerance agent will find an optimum action to reduce the amount of detected stress or to isolate and replace the faulty component by an auxiliary component. This agent finds the optimum action using an effective reinforcement learning methodology.

Analog circuit fault diagnosis can be regarded as a pattern recognition issue and addressed by one-against-one SVM. In order to obtain a good SVM-based fault classifier, the principal component analysis technique is adopted to capture the major fault features. The extracted fault features are then used as the inputs of SVM to solve fault diagnosis problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results.

Firstly, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is used to improve the performance of the neural network to build the fault diagnosis model. Then the vibration signals are analyzed to estimate the states of the diesel engine. Finally, the five states of diesel engine are set to validate the veracity of diagnosis method. According to experiment and simulation researches, it indicates that the diagnosis method with RBF neural network based on AIC is effective. The veracity of identification is 100% to the single fault. It is a valuable reference to the vibration diagnosis for other complex rotary machines.

But conventional statistical methods are often ineffective to diagnose the faults of Sucker-rod Pumping System. One reason is that there are more parameters or smaller sample sizes than a simple model in analyzing dynamometer cards, so that their degree of freedom is reduced. Another reason is that the accurate structure of the conventional statistical model diagnosing the faults of Sucker-rod Pumping System is hard to make certain, because of that statistical criteria are crucially dependent on such assumptions as normality, homogeneity, independence. In the paper, we present a SVM-based approach for fault diagnosis of Sucker-rod Pumping System by analyzing dynamometer cards. With the method, we can get the working status of the Sucker-rod Pumping System.

Our Condition monitoring methodology is an integral component of a condition-oriented strategy, whose methods make predictable prognoses possible for large engines plants in order to operate them with the highest possible plant efficiency at a certain safety level. This is only possible by realizing the experimental results, obtained by using high speed cylinder pressure measurement in combination with online diagnostics. The expert system AVL EPOS (TM) can be used for new engines or as retrofit system for engines in operation. Every root cause of a change in the operating condition of the engine or its subsystems can be analyzed and used for a permanent optimization of the engine operation. This enables planned continuous operation of the engine plant beside the overall monitoring approach to ensure engine safety and engine efficiency. In case of an unforeseeable abrupt breakdown of the system afterwards the exact history until such time as the failure occurred can be analyzed. So the found disturbance can be attributed to the causal origin. By gaining enough information of the system in the past, the gathered data will be used for trend analysis of the near future.

This paper investigates and provides additional results on a recently developed approach to designing aliasing-free space compaction hardware targeting particularly embedded cores-based system-on-chips for single stuck-line faults, extending well-known concept from conventional switching theory, viz. that of compatibility relation as used in the minimization of incomplete sequential machines. For a pair of response outputs of the circuit under test, the method introduces the notion of fault detection compatibility and conditional fault detection compatibility (conditional upon some other response output pair being simultaneously fault detection compatible) with respect to two-input XOR/XNOR logic. The process is illustrated with design details of space compactors for the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 85) combinational (and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential) benchmark circuits using simulation programs ATALANTA and FSIM, attesting to the importance of the technique from the viewpoint of simplicity, resultant low area overhead and full fault coverage for single stuck-line faults, thereby making it an appropriate choice in commercial design environments.

The model-based prognostics is so complicated, moreover, they are not suitable for on-line application since that more parameters and modeling information should be obtained in advance. An on-line data-driven battery RUL prediction approach based on Online Support Vector Regression (Online SVR) is proposed. With Online SVR algorithm, the lithium-ion battery monitoring data series can be forecasted precisely, on the other hand, an ensemble approach is adopted to realize combined prediction with multi-models containing off-line and on-line algorithms to achieve better prediction capacity. Experimental results with the NASA battery data show that the proposed method can effectively predict the RUL of lithium battery.

After recalling the basis of the geometric approach for fault detection and isolation in nonlinear systems, we will study some structural properties which are fault detectability and isolation fault filter existence. We will then design filters for residual generation. We will consider two approaches: a two-filters structure and a single filter structure, both aiming at generating residuals which are sensitive to one fault and insensitive to the other faults. Some numerical tests will be presented to illustrate the efficiency of the method.

A Decentralized Fault Prognosis Scheme for Nonlinear Interconnected Discrete-Time Systems	2012 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference (ACC)	JUN 27-29, 2012	Montreal, CANADA	Boeing Co, Bosch, Corning, Eaton, GE Global Res, Honeywell, MathWorks, Mitsubishi Elect Res Lab, Natl Instruments, Xerox, Adept MobileRobots, Momentum Press, Quanser, SIAM, Springer, Taylor & Francis, United Technologies Res Ctr, Visual Solut, Wiley-Blackwell			DIAGNOSIS	This paper deals with the design of a decentralized fault diagnosis and prognosis methodology for interconnected nonlinear dynamical systems. For each subsystem, a local fault detector (LFD) is designed based on the measured local states of the subsystem alone. A fault is detected by using a local residual signal generated via the measured local subsystem states and the LFD estimates states. Each LFD consists of an adaptive online approximator to compensate the fault dynamics from local and non-local faults. Due to the interconnection nature of the large scale system, the non-local faults propagate to other subsystems and therefore are detected thus eliminating the need to measure and transmit the states of other subsystems. Fault detectability condition is also included for both local and non-local faults. Upon detection, faults local to the subsystem and to other subsystems are isolated. In addition, the proposed scheme provides the time to failure (or remaining useful life) information by using local measurements alone. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized fault diagnosis and prognosis scheme.

The parameter (s) in this kernel is crucial to robust performance of SVM. In this paper, we derive a formula to compute the optimal s under the principle of maximizing the class separability in the kernel space. The most attractive feature of the proposed method is that no optimization search algorithm is required in parameter selection; and thus our method is computational effective.

According to different machine degradation states, the feature parameters from multifractal aspects are first calculated and further optimized by a MTS statistical method, based on which incipient faults can be subsequently identified and diagnosed accurately. A comparative application study of the effectiveness of the proposed method is carried out through case study of bearings. It is also proved to be a powerful and comprehensive tool for machine's elaborate condition monitoring management which combines a unified representation in both current and predictive perspectives of the fault degradation behavior.

This paper focuses on condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing in order to detect the failure ahead of time and estimate the fault location accurately when failure occurs. Wavelet energy entropy is introduced into the field of mechanical condition monitoring and SOM network is used in fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a bearing accelerated life test is performed on the accelerated bearing life tester(ABLT-1A). The results indicate that wavelet energy entropy has better performance and can forecast fault development earlier compared with kurtosis and RMS of the vibration signal, while SOM network, which has a advantage of visualization, can distinguish bearing fault type well.

For deployment of a PHM system successfully, A key step is prognosis certification. This calls for a set of performance metrics that not only evaluate key aspects of predicting into the future but also integrate notions from practical aspects such as reliability, safety, mission criticality, logistics, economic viability, etc. In order to standardize the prognostics evaluation, this paper conducts the related research as follows: firstly, the detail requirement including user requirements and technical requirements is presented to indicate the objective of prognostics evaluation; secondly, the correlative metrics are listed after the functional classification of prognostics metrics; based on the study mentioned above, a general evaluation flow for prognostics performance is designed in succession; at last, the issue from assessing the prognostics performance is discussed to help standardize subsequent developments.

Based on the features which are the energies of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extracted from normal gearbox vibration signal, a CHMM is trained to model the normal condition. The logarithm of the probability of this CHMM is then used to detect any defects and assess their severity. Then, SVM is used to predict the value of new feature which is the logarithm of the probability. Experimental data collected from a gearbox degradation test is used to verify the efficacy of the new scheme.

The objective is to identify the set of permanent faulty nodes when at most t nodes can fail simultaneously. We consider the asymmetric comparison diagnosis model which assumes that nodes are assigned a set of tasks and their outcomes are compared. Based on the agreements and disagreements among the nodes' outputs, the diagnosis algorithm must identify all faulty nodes. The new linear SVM-based diagnosis is first trained using various input syndromes with known fault sets. Then, it is extensively tested using randomly generated diagnosable systems of different sizes and under various fault scenarios. Results from the thorough simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVM-based fault diagnosis algorithm, in terms of diagnosis correctness, diagnosis latency, and diagnosis scalability. We have also conducted extensive simulations using partial syndromes, i.e., when not all the comparison outcomes are available prior to initiating the diagnosis phase. Simulations showed that the SVM-based diagnosis performed efficiently, i.e. diagnosis correctness was around 99% even when at most half of the comparison outcomes are missing, making it a viable alternative to existing diagnosis algorithms.

In this paper, the histogram method which is the simplest method in statistics is used to analyze the ultrasonic signals. Through the analysis, the bearing faults could be preliminarily diagnosed. A verification research with respect to vibration method is carried out to analyze the effectiveness and superiority of ultrasonic method by using the histogram. Extensive experiments have been performed in a bearing vibration measuring instrument, and the results indicated that the fault diagnosis method based on the ultrasonic amplitude histogram is more useful than the method based on the vibration amplitude histogram. In addition, it is more sensitive and more effective than the method based on vibration amplitude histogram.

By researching the characteristic of non-linear vibration signals of rolling bearings, a study of box dimension in analyzing the vibration signals and diagnosing the fault pattern of rolling bearings is proposed. Box dimension algorithm is presented in details and quantificational calculating of non-linear vibration signals generated by bearing system is also discussed. Experimental results show that kinematics mechanisms of rolling bearing result in the different working state, so the box dimensions are different evidently. The application of box dimension in monitoring working state is a new approach to promote the accuracy of rolling bearings.

In this paper, fusion information entropy is defined by fusing speed with three kinds of information entropy that are singular spectrum entropy in time domain, power spectrum entropy in frequency domain and wavelet energy spectrum entropy in time-frequency domain from multiple perspectives to describes vibration fault characteristics. According to the principle of entropy increase, condition information entropy increase of vibration fault are defined and used as new criterion for fault diagnosis, and the grey correlation between sample fault and typical fault is defined to realize the vibration fault diagnosis. Finally, the method's effectiveness is verified by vibration simulation data from vibration fault simulator. The result shows that this method can identify 6 typical vibration faults correctly.

Gene Expression Profiles for Predicting Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Cross-Study Comparison of Classification Methods	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							PROGNOSTIC SIGNATURE; DISTANT METASTASIS; MICROARRAY; SELECTION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; SURVIVAL; DATASETS	Machine learning has increasingly been used with microarray gene expression data and for the development of classifiers using a variety of methods. However, method comparisons in cross-study datasets are very scarce. This study compares the performance of seven classification methods and the effect of voting for predicting metastasis outcome in breast cancer patients, in three situations: within the same dataset or across datasets on similar or dissimilar microarray platforms. Combining classification results from seven classifiers into one voting decision performed significantly better during internal validation as well as external validation in similar microarray platforms than the underlying classification methods. When validating between different microarray platforms, random forest, another voting-based method, proved to be the best performing method. We conclude that voting based classifiers provided an advantage with respect to classifying metastasis outcome in breast cancer patients.

In this paper, a new bio-inspired optimisation algorithm which is the simulation of 'the great salmon run' (TGSR) is developed. Thereafter, it has been used to predict the efficient structure of an aggregated artificial neural network (AANN) to identify the behaviour of laser solid freeform fabrication (LSFF) system. Our experiments show that the combination of AANN and an appropriate supervised method is best suit for modelling cited engineering process. To prove the superiority of TGSR in both robustness and quality, it has been compared with most of the state-of-the-art optimisation techniques such as fast simulated annealing (FSA), parallel migrating genetic algorithm (PMGA), differential evolutionary with parent centric crossover (DEPCX), unified particle swarm optimisation (UPSO), shuffle frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), artificial bee colony (ABC), firefly algorithm (FA) and cuckoo search (CS). The obtained results confirm the acceptable potential of the proposed method to be applied on complex engineering systems.

In addition, numerical simulation can provide useful tools to assess the proper functioning of industrial machines. We use different suspension theories with a concern of the effect of solid particles liquid lubricant itself on bearing behavior. We consider both simple models based on the Einstein's mixture theory and a micropolar fluid theory, which is characterized by the presence of suspended rigid micro-structured particles. We suppose in this study that there are no abrasion and no wear (which are not beneficial for the contact performances) due to the presence of particles. Thus in this case we found theoretically that the presence of rigid particles in the lubricant increases the effective viscosity which enhances the load-carrying capacity as well as the minimum film thickness.

The method is extended under the premise of the linearity, lossless invertibility, high time-frequency resolution of S transform. On the basis, a coefficient which is direct to the signal energy distribution is introduced. In this way, the resolution of the S transform can be adjust adaptively. Eventually, this method is applied to the time-frequency filtering. The results of simulation and faulty bearing show that the proposed methodology can achieve good effect of noise reduction, and be more suitable for the non-stationary characteristics of vibration signals.

The VS is a type of nonparametric model of a nonlinear system, it can model a wide range of nonlinear systems, and can get the volterra kernel that includes the related characteristics of the system through identification. The NRS extracts useful information based only on the data itself, and is used for redundant attributes reduction to make the selected features more objective. In this paper, speed signal and vibration peak-peak value were selected as input and output signals, identified volterra kernels were applied as fault features first, then the NRS was applied for feature selection, and finally support vector machine(SVM) was used as a classifier to recognize faults of the speed-up and speed-down process. The experiment results demonstrate the proposed model not only identifies the fault type, but also identifies the fault severity.

In GCGD, a geodesic distance based proximity measure is employed replacing Euclidean distance that cannot correctly describe the relationship between data lying in a manifold, and GCGD determines partitioning of the feature vectors from a combinatorial optimization viewpoint. Fault detection experiments of inlet valve leakage in a two-stage reciprocating compressor reveal that GCGD achieves a better performance of fault detection than the K-means algorithm and a genetic algorithm based clustering technique.

These data consist of module-string currents and voltages and their instantaneous (filtered) rates of change, acquired via a combination of analog and digital sensors. Our diagnostics algorithms comprise thermal and electrical System ID stages, augmented by a Bayesian MAP (Maximum A posteriori Probability) inference engine utilizing a simplified stochastic, spline-based integrated plant model in the optical, electrical and thermal domains. Our (path-integral, physics-based) MAP inference engine detects incipient hot-spots; attributes them to the most likely proximate-and underlying causes (such as shading or dust-deposition patterns, direct heating, inherent mismatches or circuit failures); and renders quantitative estimates of the most likely culpable environmental factor (e.g. a time-varying shading pattern). The same simplified plant model is periodically used to prognosticate the likely future evolution of the incipient hot spot. Our diagnostics and prognostics algorithms can be applied to simulated and/or empirical data (the latter from our roof-top PV lab at Carnegie Mellon). The algorithms leverage changes in estimated conductances in different regions of the electrical state-space, and at different granularities (cells, panels, strings and full array). It take into account temperature coefficients, ohmic-and optical heating, and (optionally) inherent electrical mismatches. Our algorithm suite requires as input neither temperature sensors, nor sub-panel electrical data, nor load sweeps; even pyranometer data is optional. The only necessary sensor data are string electrical data at the actual instantaneous in-operation external load (either with or without a perturb-and-observe MPPT control procedure). Digitized measurements of the low-pass-filtered time derivatives of these currents are useful, but if not available they can be replaced with numerical differentiation. However, occasional voltage sweeps - augmented with pyranometer, thermal and intra-panel (bypass diode voltage) data from our heavily instrumented PV array - along with online astronomical and meteorological data and artificially induced shading patterns - are used to validate our algorithms and to improve the baseline System ID parameters estimation.

However, this classification method has some weaknesses. For example, it can not separate fuzzy information, is particularly sensitive to the interference and the isolated points of the training sample, and has great demand for memory in calculation. In view of the problems mentioned above, a binary tree-based fuzzy SVM multi-classification algorithm (BTFSVM) has been put forward. This paper focuses on the study of the application of the intelligent theory BTFSVM to fault diagnosis on modern main engine cooling water system of ships. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm has strong anti-interference ability and good classification effects. Consideration can be made that it can be further applicable to the diagnosis on other mechanical faults of ships.

Reports indicate that efficiency and availability are heavily dependent upon high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the fault detection and isolation (FDI) system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Finding healthy HVAC source as the reference for health monitoring is the main aim in this area. To dispel this concern a comprehensive transient model of heat ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is developed in this study. The transient model equations can be solved efficiently using MATLAB coding and simulation technique. Our proposed model is validated against real HVAC system regarding different parts of HVAC. The developed model in this study can be used for a pre tuning of control system and put to good use for fault detection and isolation in order to accomplish high-quality health monitoring and result in energy saving. Fan supply consider as faulty device of HVAC system with six fault type. A sensitivity analysis based on evaluated model shows us three features are sensitive to all faults type and three auxiliary features are sensitive to some faults. The magnitude and trait of features are a good potential for automatic fault tolerant system based on machine learning systems.

The Gearbox Fault Detection of Machine Center by Using Time Frequency Order Spectrum	MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING, PTS 1 AND 2	Advanced Materials Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Management, Manufacturing and Materials Engineering (ICMMM 2011)	DEC 08-10, 2011	Zhengzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Assoc Management Sci & Engn Technol		Non-Stationary Signal; Short-Time Fourier Transform; Back Propagation Neural Network; Time Frequency Order Spectrum		Previously, for the case of fixed or steady state rotation rate, spectrum analysis can be used to extract the frequency features as the basis for the gearbox fault detection of machine center. However, the gearbox of machine center for increasingly instant speed variations mostly generate non-stationary signals, and the signal features must be averaged with analysis time which makes it difficult to identify the causes of failures. This study proposes a time frequency order spectrum method combining the short-time Fourier transform (SIFT) and speed frequency order method to capture the order features of non-stationary signals. Such signal features do not change with speed, and are thus effective in identifying faults in mechanical components under non-stationary conditions. In this study, back propagation neural networks (BPNN) and time frequency order spectrum methods were used to verify faults diagnosis and obtained superior diagnosis results in non-stationary signals of gear-rotor systems in machine center.

EEMD is a. self adaptive analysis method for non-linear and non-stationary signals and it was recently proposed by Huang and Wu to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The vibration signal is usually noisy. To detect the fault at an early stage of its development, generally the residual signal is used. There exist different methods in literature to calculate the residual signal, in this paper we mention some of them and we propose a new method which is based on EEMD. The results given by the different methods are compared by using simulated and experimental signals.

But prognostics are the ability to assess the current health of the machinery and predict the future health for a fixed time horizon or predict the time to failure of the machinery. Fault diagnosis of industrial machineries improves the quality of manufacturing as well as to reduce the cost for product testing. In modern manufacturing environment, a fast and reliable diagnosis system has turned into a challenging issue in the complex industrial atmosphere. In the present work, the diagnosis of bearing system has been considered as the platform of health monitoring system by used lubricant analysis process. Rule based inference system has been adopted in the present work, where possible characterized wear particles from the bearing system have been interpreted into the fuzzy inference mechanisms. Based on the proposed strategy, the possible maintenance policies have been taken into consideration.				ghosh.surojit@gmail.com; bijon_sarkar@email.com; sanyal_s_k@yahoo.co.in; jmoysaha@yahoo.co.in	Ghosh, Surojit/AAB-2745-2021				BRADY M, 1982, COMPUT SURV, V14, P3; Dote Y, 2001, P IEEE, V89, P1243, DOI 10.1109/5.949483; Ghorui S, 2000, PRAMANA-J PHYS, V54, pL331, DOI 10.1007/s12043-000-0028-y; Ghosh S, 2005, J QUAL MAINT ENG, V11, P318, DOI 10.1108/13552510510626954; Hasegawa M, 1996, WEAR, V192, P40, DOI 10.1016/0043-1648(95)06768-X; KIRK TB, 1995, WEAR, V181, P717; MIETTINEN J, 2000, THESIS TAMPERE U TEC; Pan J., 1995, WCNN '95.

CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE MODIFIED WINDING FUNCTION THEORY	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; AIR-GAP ECCENTRICITY; CAGE INDUCTION-MOTOR; ROTOR-BAR; MACHINES; STATOR; FAULT	The Modified Winding Function theory (MWFTh), regarded as a very powerful and general theory, has been extensively used for the last 15 years. This paper performs an in-depth review of the mathematical and physical framework on which the MWFTh is based, showing that it is indeed very well suited to analyse machines with small air gaps of arbitrary shape. However, contrary to what is usually stated in the literature, it is also proved that its general formulae fail when applied to large air gaps. This major finding is deduced from two different approaches, both of which are later reinforced by numerical examples. In spite of that, the re is an important industrial field (diagnosis techniques of salient-pole synchronous machines eccentricities) in which good theoretical results have been reported by applying the MWFTh to these large air-gap machines. This issue is addressed and clarified in the paper.

In the first stage. PCA was applied to identify the principal components of product modular features, which was conducted by analyzing the product cost components and their influencing factors driven by features of modules firstly, and then by calculating the eigenvalue and eigenvector of correlation coefficient matrix to reduce the dimension of the data, later by defining the first few principal components which contain most of the feature variables. In the second stage, the mapping from the restructured product modular feature to the product cost was established by general regression neural network (GRNN).

We adopted a multi-parameters synthetic condition assessment model based on fuzzy theory and set up a fault diagnosis model in terms of reasoning machine based on expert knowledge. Then the results from the above models may help the managers to make a maintenance decision. All of these operations were completed with the assistance of the data base. The software was programmed with C++ Builder as the basic tool. As a general platform, the system has integrated functions of condition assessment, fault diagnosis and maintenance decision. On the basis of the support system, we can inspect and maintain the ship or part of that effectively and economically.

This paper presents a detailed introduction of main content-self-validating function, especially the quantitative health evaluation and remaining using life forecasting. As a fundamental self-validating function, a novel strategy based on relevance vector machine (RVM) coupled with wavelet analysis is proposed for failure detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) of multifunctional self-validating sensor. It centers on the working principle and on-line updating algorithm of WRVM predictor. The proposed WRVM predictor can also distinguish the fault free signal with sudden change from the failure signal and it is updated online for pursuit of signal change. A multifunctional self-validating sensor experimental system is designed to evaluate the performance of novel strategy. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology provides a good solution to the FDIR of multifunctional self-validating sensor.

A novel method based on zoom-FFf has been developed, and compared to an existing method based on zero-crossing time (ZCT) processing using real data from faulty and healthy motors. Numerical tests show that both methods can reliably detect broken rotor bars. ZCT processing entails better performance than zoom-FFT for low load and low current, but zoom-FFf is easier to tune, thus being preferable for embedded systems such as motor controllers, softstarters and drives that have to operate with a vast variety of motors.

The support vector regression technique in statistical learning theory is employed to model the control system with a little sampling data firstly. Then the feasibility of detecting and identifying faults for the satellite attitude control system with the Mahalanobis distance is analyzed in detail. Finally a set of fault-detection observers are designed and implemented based on the residual evaluation. The simulation result indicates that the diagnosing method proposed in this paper is characterized with light computation burden and good real-time performance.

Class imbalance problem is encountered in the fault diagnosis, which causes seriously negative effect on the performance of classifiers that assume a balanced distribution of classes. Though it is critical, few previous works paid attention to this class imbalance problem in the fault diagnosis of gear. In imbalanced problems, some features are redundant and even irrelevant. These features will hurt the generalization performance of learning machines. Here we propose PREE (Prediction Risk based feature selectionfor EasyEnsemble) to solve the class imbalanced problem in the fault diagnosis of gear. Experimental results on UCI data sets and gear data set show that PREE improves the classification performance and prediction ability on the imbalanced dataset.

Damage accrued during the storage and prior usage may reduce the remaining useful life of the electronic system during deployment. Methods for assessment of accrued damage under simultaneous stresses are scarce. Test to failure data has been measured to study the effect of simultaneous thermal and vibration loadings on the reliability of BGA components. Two groups of pristine and isothermally aged components have been tested at both room temperature and 125 degrees C while simultaneously being subjected to vibration loads. The transient response of printed circuit boards under the overlapping stresses has been characterized. Damage accrued under overlapping stresses has been investigated using physics-based leading indicators of damage. The leading indicators are state vectors based on optically measured strains and deformation, resistance spectroscopy and phase sensitive detection. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of the BGA components. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, has been used to robustly demonstrate and quantify the repeatability of the resistance spectroscopy measurements and the accompanying prognostic algorithms.

An adaptive learning system is employed to determine the duration of a future task based on similar prior tasks. Durations of some maintenance tasks are calculated using statistical regression where nature and specification of the task are well defined. However, for other tasks where the durations are dependent upon the condition of several other parts and subsystems, they are derived through machine learning methodologies like Neural Network and Bayesian rule. Moreover, the duration of the tasks is further refined by Prognostics Health Management assessment that predicts impending failure based on near real time condition of vehicles and its subsystems. Determining the task durations dynamically based on prior knowledge or from prognostic data will make the schedule efficient, saving money and resources required for maintenance.

C	Penna, JAM; Nascimento, CL; Rodrigues, LR			IEEE	Moreira Penna, Jose Affonso; Nascimento, Cairo Lucio, Jr.; Rodrigues, Leonardo Ramos			Health Monitoring and Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Lithium-Ion Aeronautical Batteries	2012 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2012	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, Phmsoc, AESS				Batteries are essential components of any aircraft electrical system. They are used to start the aircraft propulsion engines and to provide power during electrical emergencies. As is the case with most aircraft components, batteries exhibit aging and health degradation during operation. Therefore, the correctly estimation of the battery state-of-health (SoH) and of the remaining useful life (RUL) is important to aircraft operators. Failure to do so can result in underutilization of the equipment (if it is removed before the end of its life cycle) or unpredicted failure events during operation (when the battery SoH is overestimated). The consequences can range from increased operation costs to reduced flight safety. This article first presents the life cycle of lithium-ion aeronautical batteries. Then a method is proposed to generate discharge, capacity and health monitoring models during the battery life cycle. It is shown how these models are used to estimate the battery SoH and RUL. The method is validated using data from the NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository. The models are implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and used to simulate a typical battery in different operational conditions.

It is believed that at least part of these costs can be avoided if adequate system prognosis programs are used. The aim of these programs is to evaluate the current state of an aircraft component based on the available system data (e. g., flight and maintenance data) and to estimate the future performance and the remaining useful life of this component. Several algorithms can be used for this purpose. This paper proposes a method of performing prognostics on aircraft component based a binary classification Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification algorithm. The algorithm is used to classify each flight according to a fault pattern which the algorithm was trained to recognize. Flight data and maintenance logs were used to generate the training and testing datasets. In this case study, for each flight, a number of characteristics were extracted from parameters of the aircraft Air Management System. From the classification results a degradation index is created to serve as an aid to better plan the aircraft maintenance. An advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require a deep knowledge on the system. Furthermore, it does not need a large amount of input-output samples to be trained. The method should be easily extended to other aircraft systems as long as enough flight data and maintenance logs are available.

Since the primary goal of PHM systems is to estimate the health state of components and equipments, as well as forecasting their Remaining Useful Life (RUL), they are often closely associated with the reduction in the number of unscheduled maintenance tasks. Indeed, the avoidance of unscheduled maintenance is a very important factor, but this technology may potentially lead to considerable further savings in other fields. Scheduled maintenance planning, improved troubleshooting, inventory management optimization and intelligent aircraft allocation to routes are other examples of how the operators can benefit from PHM techniques. These benefits may lead to important competitive advantages such as reduction in operational cost and increase in fleet reliability. The purpose of this work is to enumerate and explore qualitatively some of these benefits in terms of the mentioned competitive advantages to aircraft operators. Although PHM systems can offer benefits to other members of the aeronautical sector such as aircraft manufacturers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), this work will focus on the aircraft operator's point of view.

In this paper, we discuss a systematic data-driven process for detecting and diagnosing faults in the regenerative braking system of hybrid electric vehicles. The process involves data reduction techniques, exemplified by multi-way partial least squares, multi-way principal component analysis, for implementation in memory-constrained electronic control units and well-known fault classification techniques based on reduced data, such as support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, partial least squares, principal component analysis and probabilistic neural network, to isolate faults in the braking system. The results demonstrate that highly accurate fault diagnosis is possible with the pattern recognition-based techniques. The process can be employed for fault analysis in a wide variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to buildings to aerospace systems.

Detecting Broken Rotor Bars With Zero-Setting Protection	2012 IEEE/IAS 48TH INDUSTRIAL & COMMERCIAL POWER SYSTEMS TECHNICAL CONFERENCE (I&CPS)	IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems and Technical Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	48th IEEE/IAS Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference	MAY 20-24, 2012	Louisville, KY	IEEE, IAS		Induction motor protection; broken rotor bars; squirrel cage rotor; induction motor relaying; condition monitoring	END-RING FAULTS; INDUCTION-MOTORS; MACHINES	Broken rotor bars in induction motors can be dependably detected by analyzing the current signatures under sufficient motor load conditions. Detection becomes less dependable under light motor load conditions. There are also cases in which tolerable motor operating conditions generate current signatures similar to those of motors with broken rotor bars. These cases may present security concerns when the detection element is set to trip the motor and to send alarms. In this paper, we: . Show how broken rotor bars cause characteristic current signatures. . Show how to detect broken rotor bars with a zero-setting protection element, which uses the current signature method. .

Thus, the network actively participates in creating a smart environment. Distributed Sensor Networks promise to revolutionize sensing in a wide range of application domains. This is because of their reliability, accuracy, flexibility, cost effectiveness and ease of deployment of nodes in topology of DSN. Smart sensors can offer vigilant surveillance and can detect and collect data concerning any sign of machines failure, earthquakes, floods and even a terrorist attack energy efficiency, topology control and fault-tolerance are the most important issues in the development of next-generation DSN. Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to deliver a desired level of functionality in presence of faults in the topology. Topology control as a low level service governs communication among all nodes and is hence the primary target for increasing connectivity and saving energy. In this work, we have proposed two models for fault detection and fault recovery to achieve fault tolerance in topology. The proposed fault detection model is used to detect faults at node level (checking node's energy) and network level faults (link failure and packet error). The proposed fault recovery model is used to achieve fault tolerance by adjusting the topology of the randomly deployed sensor nodes. Finally, we have evaluated the performance parameters for the proposed scheme.

A Decentralized Fault Detection and Prediction Scheme for Nonlinear Interconnected Continuous-time Systems	2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA				DIAGNOSIS	Complex nonlinear systems such as an aircraft, trains, automobiles, power plants and chemical plants are represented as nonlinear interconnected subsystems. Therefore, in this paper a novel decentralized fault diagnosis and prognosis (FDP) methodology is proposed for such large-scale systems. Current FDP approaches require the knowledge of the entire state or its estimated vector. But the main goal in this work is to design a local fault detector (LFD) or observer for each subsystem based on the measured local states of the subsystem alone. A local residual signal is generated via the measured states of the local subsystem and the estimated states provided by the LFD. A fault is detected when this local residual exceeds a predefined threshold. The adaptive online approximator in each LFD is activated upon detection to compensate the fault dynamics due to local and non-local faults. A novel update law for tuning the parameters of the online approximator is derived. Upon detection, faults local to the subsystem and to other subsystems are isolated. In addition, the proposed scheme provides the time to failure (or remaining useful life) information by using local measurements and the parameter update law of the LFD. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized FDP scheme.

This is usually a difficult problem per se, due to the localization of the tumour in an extremely sensitive and difficult to reach organ such as the brain. The clinical analysis of brain tumours often requires the use of non-invasive measurement methods, the most common of which resort to imaging techniques. The discrimination between high-grade malignant tumours of different origin but similar characteristics, such as glioblastomas and metastases, is a particularly difficult problem in this context. This is because imaging techniques are often not sensitive enough and their spectroscopic signal is overall too similar. In spite of this, machine learning techniques, coupled with robust feature selection procedures, have recently made substantial inroads into the problem. In this study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from an international, multi-centre database were used to discriminate between these two types of malignant brain tumours using ensemble learning techniques, with a focus on the definition of a feature selection method specifically designed for ensembles. This method, Breadth Ensemble Learning, takes advantage of the fact that many of the frequencies of the available spectra convey no relevant information for the discrimination of the tumours.

Since the spectral structure of a gear vibration signal is mainly characterized by the interaction between the meshing harmonics and their sidebands, the spectral correlation density (SCD) function has been applied to gear monitoring. This approach is capable of completely extracting the fault characteristic frequencies related to the defect. This gives a desirable ability to detect the singularity characteristic of a signal precisely. This technique permits both fault detection and identification of the damaged gear. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on cyclostationary analysis can effectively diagnose the faults of gear.

So it's necessary to monitor and analyze the condition of the machine machines. Now, more and more tools have been applied to the marine mechanicals' condition monitoring and fault diagnoses. The spectral analysis technique has been widely used to detect the contents of abrasive metal in the lubricating oil. To mine the spectral data better, a method was put forward, which can be used to build the healthy record and reveal the important information about the operated conditions of the equipment. In the method, the similar information of the principal component in oil was obtained in the stable abrasion of the different friction pairs of equipment. The composition of mechanical and electrical equipment was also gained. The healthy record was created preliminarily according to all the information. In the malfunction detection of the equipment, cooperated with the data of the threshold of oil, the analysis results of spectra can be compared with the healthy record. So, the abnormal abrasion can be judged accurately.

The tasks performed by these motors grow increasingly complex because of modern industries hence there is a need to determine the faults. Early detection of faults will reduce an unscheduled machine downtime that can upset production deadlines and may cause heavy financial losses. This paper is focused in developing a computer based system using Fuzzy Inference system's membership function. An unusual increase in vibration of the motor could be an indicator of faulty condition hence the vibration of the motor of an induction motor was used as an input, whereas the output is the motor condition. An inference system of the Fuzzy Logic was created to classify the vibration characteristics of the motor which is called vibration analysis. The system classified the motor of the gas distribution pump condition as from 'acceptable' to 'monitor closely'. The early detection of unusual increase in vibration of the induction motor is an important part of a predictive maintenance for motor driven machinery.	[Janier, Josefina B.; Zaharia, M. F.

Under spectral analysis of the instantaneous power one obtains the components which are connected with definite types of damage. An analysis of the amplitudes and frequencies of the components allows to recognize the type of fault. The paper presents a metrological analysis of the measurement system used for diagnosis of induction motor bearings, based on the analysis of the instantaneous power. This system was implemented as a set of devices with dedicated software installed on a PC. A number of measurements for uncertainty estimation was carried out. The results of the measurements are presented in the paper. The results of the aforementioned analysis helped to determine the measurement uncertainty which can be expected during bearing diagnostic measurements, by the method relying on measurement and analysis of the instantaneous power of an induction machine.

In this paper, a novel method based on statistical property and residual signals is developed for estimating the fault severity of rotating machinery. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is applied to extract the so-called multifrequency-band energy (MFBE) from the vibration signals of rotating machinery with different fault severity levels in the first stage. Usually these features of the working conditions with different fault sensitivities are different. Therefore a sensitive features-selecting algorithm is defined to construct the feature matrix and calculate the statistic parameter (mean) in the second stage. In the last stage, the residual signals computed by the zero space vector are used to estimate the fault severity. Simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed method based on statistics and residual signals is effective and feasible for estimating the severity of a rotating machine fault.

Fault diagnosis in industrial systems based on blind source separation techniques using one single vibration sensor	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Structural Engineering Dynamics (ICEDyn)	JUN 20-22, 2011	Tavira, PORTUGAL	Tech Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecnico (IST), Inst Engn Mecanica (IDMEC)		Fault diagnosis; damage detection; vibration monitoring; Hankel matrices		In the field of structural health monitoring or machine condition monitoring, most vibration based methods reported in the literature require to measure responses at several locations on the structure. In machine condition monitoring, the number of available vibration sensors is often small and it is not unusual that only one single sensor is used to monitor a machine. The aim of this paper is to propose an extension of fault detection techniques that may be used when a reduced set of sensors or even one single sensor is available. Fault detection techniques considered here are based on output-only methods coming from the Blind Source Separation (BSS) family, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Second Order Blind Identification (SOBI). The advantages of PCA or SOBI rely on their rapidity of use and their reliability. Based on these methods, subspace identification may be performed by using the concept of block Hankel matrices which make possible the use of only one single measurement signal. Thus, the problem of fault detection in mechanical systems can be solved by using subspaces built from active principal components or modal vectors. It consists in comparing subspace features between the reference (undamaged) state and a current state. The angular coherence between subspaces is a good indicator of a dynamic change in the system due to the occurrence of faults or damages. The robustness of the methods is illustrated on industrial examples.	[Nguyen, V.

Therefore, singularity detection has played an important role in signals processing, biomedical, e.g. ECG/EEG event detection, machine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics, etc. The wavelet modulus maxima method has been widely used method for the detection of singularity points. A review of the literature shows that the mentioned method may give very high efficiency in detection of events in the noisy ECG/EEG waveforms and also exist many application of the wavelet in machine fault diagnostics. Actually, both types of systems can be called CBMS - Condition Based Monitoring Systems. Because, we monitor the digital signal for search the specific events in both cases. The paper presents the proposal of system design for biomedical signal and vibration analysis and monitoring of machines, based on the Mallat and Hwang wavelet singularity analysis.

The loads include machines such as induction motors and three phase diode rectifiers as well as larger electrical systems. The emulation of unbalanced four-wire loads has been achieved using a four-leg VSI. The load emulator is effectively a dynamically controllable source or sink which is capable of bidirectional power exchange with either a grid or another power electronic converter system. Using load emulation, the feasibility of connecting a particular machine to a grid or converter under various load conditions can be examined without the need for any electromechanical machinery. The additional feature of the load emulation technique described in the paper is the feedback of power absorbed by the emulator back to the grid. This feedback of power has been termed as power regeneration and has been achieved by another VSI in current controlled mode with the references generated using instantaneous p-q-r theory. The consistency of the experimental results with the simulation results proves the ability of emulator and the proposed testing approach.	[Rao, Y.

Safety, reliability, efficiency and performance are major concerns that direct the research activity in the field of electrical machines. Though the induction machine is very reliable, many failures can occur such as bearing faults, air-gap eccentricity and broken rotor bars. Therefore, the challenge is to detect them at an early stage in order to prevent breakdowns. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach for fault detection based on the spectral subtraction. The technique effectiveness is demonstrated using simulation data issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach and experiments in the case of bearing failures.

Quantitative and qualitative data about medical images are vital components of a radiological report and are very important to the oncologist that requests the radiological exams. However, traditional methods to register these data are inefficient and error prone. The use of unstructured free text in radiology reports makes it impossible to perform even simple calculations, such as changes in lesion dimensions. It also makes the aggregated analysis of many reports difficult. Free text reports lack a reference to the image regions of the finds they refer to and are not machine-computable. This paper proposes a method to provide support for collaborative work among radiologists and oncologists (providing care or taking part in clinical trials) using an imaging web tool, ePAD, to generate structured radiology reports that can be machine-computable. It also shows how ePAD uses RadLex ontology terms and the Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) language (and templates) to generate the reports.

Events are generated without following a general consistent rule and different hardware and software components of such systems have different failure rates. Distinguishing between normal system behaviour and faulty situation relies on event analysis. Being able to detect quickly deviations from normality is essential for system administration and is the foundation of fault prediction. As HPC systems continue to grow in size and complexity, mining event flows become more challenging and with the upcoming 10 Petaflop systems, there is a lot of interest in this topic. Current event mining approaches do not take into consideration the specific behaviour of each type of events and as a consequence, fail to analyze them according to their characteristics. In this paper we propose a novel way of characterizing the normal and faulty behaviour of the system by using signal analysis concepts. All analysis modules create ELSA (Event Log Signal Analyzer), a toolkit that has the purpose of modelling the normal flow of each state event during a HPC system lifetime, and how it is affected when a failure hits the system. We show that these extracted models provide an accurate view of the system output, which improves the effectiveness of proactive fault tolerance algorithms. Specifically, we implemented a filtering algorithm and short-term fault prediction methodology based on the extracted model and test it against real failure traces from a large-scale system. We show that by analyzing each event according to its specific behaviour, we get a more realistic overview of the entire system.

Generally, the sound and vibration signals obtained from wind power generation are time-variant since they are strongly related to the rotational speed which is not constant even in the macro steady state. Since the mostly used signal processing method, the Fourier analysis, is only suitable for stationary signals, the development of the joint time-frequency analysis is demanded. Here, Q statistic (also referred as squared prediction error, SPE) is introduced, it is used to monitor the vibration signals and three-phase currents. The control limit of the Q statistics is calculated to decide the state of the rotating machine, and the contribution plot of SPE is used to find the fault source. The method can efficiently detect faint change and the validity of the method is proved by experiments.

Due to various reasons, there is great dispersion in the life of bearing. Therefore, it is very important to have fault diagnosis of rolling bearing, especially the small fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. According to the characteristics of rolling bearing defect signals and the features integrated with wavelet transform, Hilbert transform and envelope spectrum detailed analysis, this text proposed a method to judge the bearing failure. At first, bearing vibration signals are reconstructed from wavelet filter and envelope signals are obtained by Hilbert transform and then vibration spectrum is obtained from the refining envelope spectrum. Bearing failure is judged from the refining frequency spectrum. Bearing failure is also estimated by experiment to verify the correctness of theoretical analysis.

The perfect performance of SVM will be realized only if the parameters are rightly selected. The accuracy and efficiency of classification largely depend on the quality of the parameters selection. Focusing on the problem of the parameters selection in least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), a new method is proposed to optimize the parameters in LSSVM using adaptive genetic algorithm. The research is provided using this method on the fault diagnosis of a certain type of helicopter's helicopter-electrical-box.

It has great significance to identify the fault early and implement intelligent fault diagnosis. However there is a big nonlinear about large rotating machinery and has less fault samples. This led great difficulties for feature selection and state recognition. Based on Entropy in feature selection, we extract each intrinsic mode's function energy as eigenvector and make them for input parameter of the support vector machine (SVM) to fault diagnosis. The experiment shows that this method can classify the fault state, and completed intelligent fault diagnosis.

The advantage of this approach is which does not require a long temporal recording, and their processing is simple. This analysis offers an easy interpretation to conclude on the induction motor condition and its voltage supply state. The proposed signature shows its robustness and its power especially in the case of unloaded machine.

The operating principal of the incremental is detailed in order to analyze the origin of a fault and its impact on encoder output, and then on its propagation on the whole control of the system under study. The developed algorithm depends only on previous measures and does not require any parameter system knowledge. It is simple, so, it does not need a specific target device to be implemented. Simulation results are carried out to illustrate this analysis, and experimental results on a 4kW laboratory setup are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in cases of total loss and gain fault encoder output.

As these machines grow in scale, faults become more frequent and system complexity makes it difficult to detect and to diagnose them. The difficulty is particularly large for faults that degrade system performance or cause erratic behavior but do not cause outright crashes. The cost of these errors is high since they significantly reduce system productivity, both initially and by time required to resolve them. Current system management techniques do not work well since they require manual examination of system behavior and do not identify root causes. When a fault is manifested, system administrators need timely notification about the type of fault, the time period in which it occurred and the processor on which it originated. Statistical modeling approaches can accurately characterize normal and abnormal system behavior. However, the complex effects of system faults are less amenable to these techniques. This paper demonstrates that the complexity of system faults makes traditional classification and clustering algorithms inadequate for characterizing them. We design novel techniques that combine classification algorithms with information on the abnormality of application behavior to improve detection and characterization accuracy significantly. Our experiments demonstrate that our techniques can detect and characterize faults with 85% accuracy, compared to just 12% accuracy for direct applications of traditional techniques.

Existing failure detection techniques rely on domain knowledge, precious (often unavailable) training data, textual console logs, or intrusive service modifications. We hypothesize that many machine failures are not a result of abrupt changes but rather a result of a long period of degraded performance. This is confirmed in our experiments, in which over 20% of machine failures were preceded by such latent faults. We propose a proactive approach for failure prevention. We present a novel framework for statistical latent fault detection using only ordinary machine counters collected as standard practice. We demonstrate three detection methods within this framework. Derived tests are domain-independent and unsupervised, require neither background information nor tuning, and scale to very large services. We prove strong guarantees on the false positive rates of our tests.

The methodology utilizes thermal and power cycling to accelerate the life of the devices. The major failure mechanism for the stress conditions is die-attachment degradation, typical for discrete devices with lead-free solder die attachment. It has been determined that die-attach degradation results in an increase in ON-state resistance due to its dependence on junction temperature. Increasing resistance, thus, can be used as a precursor of failure for the die-attach failure mechanism under thermal stress. A feature based on normalized ON-resistance is computed from in-situ measurements of the electro-thermal response. An Extended Kalman filter is used as a model-based prognostics techniques based on the Bayesian tracking framework. The proposed prognostics technique reports on preliminary work that serves as a case study on the prediction of remaining life of power MOSFETs and builds upon the work presented in [1]. The algorithm considered in this study had been used as prognostics algorithm in different applications and is regarded as suitable candidate for component level prognostics. This work attempts to further the validation of such algorithm by presenting it with real degradation data including measurements from real sensors, which include all the complications (noise, bias, etc.) that are regularly not captured on simulated degradation data. The algorithm is developed and tested on the accelerated aging test timescale. In real world operation, the timescale of the degradation process and therefore the RUL predictions will be considerable larger. It is hypothesized that even though the timescale will be larger, it remains constant through the degradation process and the algorithm and model would still apply under the slower degradation process. By using accelerated aging data with actual device measurements and real sensors (no simulated behavior), we are attempting to assess how such algorithm behaves under realistic conditions.

Improvements in database's technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. The primary aim of data mining is knowledge discovery, i.e. patterns in the data that lead to better understanding of the data generating process and to useful predictions. The knowledge that becomes available through data mining enables an asset owner to make important decisions about life cycle costs in advance. In maintenance field, CMMS (Computer maintenance management system) and CM (Condition Monitoring) are the most popular software available in the industries. Since first one stores all historical data, maintenance actions, events and manufacturer recommendations, second one collects and stores all critical physical parameters (vibration, temperature..) to be monitored in a regular time basis. However, converting these data into useful information is a challenge. The degradation process of a system may be affected by many unknown factors, such as unidentified fault modes, unmeasured operational conditions, engineering variance, environmental conditions, etc. These unknown factors not only complicate the degradation behaviors of the system, but also make it difficult to collect quality data. Due to lack of knowledge and incomplete measurements, certain important context information (e. g. fault modes, operational conditions) of the collected data will be missing. Therefore, historical data of the system with a large variety of degradation patterns will be mixed together. With such data, learning a global model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction becomes extremely hard since the end user does not have enough and good-quality data to model properly the system. This has led us to look for advanced RUL prediction techniques beyond the traditional RUL prediction models. The degradation process for many engineering systems, especially mechanical systems, is irreversible unless the condition is recovered by effective maintenance actions. The irreversible degradation process does not necessarily imply that the observed features will exhibit a monotonic progression pattern during degradation. Such progression pattern is sometimes hard to model using parametric methods. Considering a degradation process involving no or limited maintenance, the process may compose of a sequence of irreversible stages (either discrete or continuous) from new to be worn out, which can be implicitly expressed by the trajectory of the measured condition data or features. Therefore, the RUL of the system can be estimated if its future degradation trend can be projected from those historical instances. In this paper, a novel RUL prediction method inspired by feature maps and SVM classifiers is proposed. The historical instances of a system with life-time condition data are used to create a classification by SVM hyper planes. For a test instance of the same system, whose RUL is going to be estimated, degradation speed is evaluated by computing the minimal distance defined based on the degradation trajectories, i.e. the approach of the system to the hyper plane that segregates good and bad condition data at a different time horizon. Therefore, the final RUL of a specific component can be estimated, and global RUL information can then be obtained by aggregating the multiple RUL estimations using a density estimation method. Proposed model develops an effective RUL prediction method that addresses multiple challenges in complex system prognostics, where many parameters are unknown. Similarities between degradation trajectories can be checked in order to enrich existing methodologies in prognostic's applications. Existing CM data for bearings will be used to verify the model.

Since most mechanical equipment operates under some sort of stress or load, it tends to deteriorate or degrade over time, thus possibly resulting in discrete degradation states (damage degrees), ranging from perfect functioning to complete failure. This multi-state deterioration is the motivation for using condition monitoring tools for the purpose of modeling, diagnosis, prognosis, and condition-based maintenance. Most mechanical equipment is subject to multiple independent failure modes and degradation processes. Rather than independently diagnosing and prognosing the health condition of the equipment for a single failure mode, it is important to investigate how multi-dimensional condition monitoring information can be used for recognition purposes of the state of the health of equipment with multiple independent failure modes. This paper focuses on a non-repairable piece of equipment with multiple independent failure modes, in which the state of the equipment for each single failure mode is not directly observable and only incomplete information is available through condition monitoring. The main objective of this paper is to develop a method to obtain an observation probability matrix which can be used as the main tool for damage degree classification of each failure mode. An observation probability matrix represents the statistical relationship between the actual health state (damage degree and failure mode) of the equipment and the condition monitoring information. This observation probability matrix is an input for such methods, as hidden Markov models, hidden Semi-Markov models, and Naive Bayes classifiers. We modify the Naive Bayes classifier to use this observation probability matrix for classification. The result of this paper is applied for damage degree classification of a planetary gearbox, which is subject to multiple failure modes.

LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's performance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken. During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating,, etc. It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge. In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.

Thus it is critical to devise a systematic feature extraction (FE) approach that provides a useful and automatic guidance on using the most effective features for machine performance recognition without human intervention. This paper proposes a locality preserving projection (LPP)-based FE approach for machine performance degradation recognition. Different from principal component analysis (PCA) that aims to discover the global structure of the Euclidean space, LPP is capable to discover local structure of the data manifold. This may enable LPP to find more meaningful low-dimensional information hidden in the high-dimensional observations compared with PCA. This experimental result on a bearing test-bed shows that LPP-based FE improves the performance of recognizers for identifying performance degradation of bearings.

These machines now affect the safety of humans as well as the security of personal data and consequently money transactions. To ensure the integrity of these systems' operating state, several fault detection mechanisms have been developed to safely correct or stop unforeseen execution behavior. Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented system functionality. Reduced hashing implementations are characterized for their fault detection efficiency. This hardware-based approach provides a completely transparent solution to counteract faults resulting from emerging wear-out defects or intentional attacks on the execution integrity.

Since the frequencies of ultrasonic signal are very high, they will lead to much higher computing burden when using the common technique of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) directly. In this paper, envelope detection technology and heterodyne technology which integrated in an ultrasonic data collection system are used to reduce the frequency effectively. To allow for the easier detection of the bearing faults, these two techniques has been used together with FFT. A verification research with respect to vibration analysis is carried out to analyze the effectiveness and superiority of ultrasonic data collection in time domain and frequency domain aspects respectively. Extensive experiments have been performed in an Alternating Current (AC) motor system, and the results indicated that this ultrasonic data collection system is as useful as vibration analysis system in diagnosing the faults of bearings. In addition, it is more sensitive in fault diagnosis in the early stages of the bearing faults than vibration acquisition system.

The three levels of information fusion for multisensors are described. For the complex in the structural health monitoring, the distributed multisensor information fusion is more suitable and the structure is discussed. In the damage information fusion for character level, the concept for structural integral support vector machine damage detection matrix, damage self-information, and damage information entropy are presented. For a complex structure, it can be divided into multiple substructures in order to simplify the difficult for health monitoring, the data acquisition and support vector machine are established for each substructure in order to form integral damage detection matrix. In the damage information fusion for decision level, the methods based on fuzzy set theory, material element theory, and fuzzy neural network are proposed.

In general, bearings diagnostics is well-recognized field; however it is not the case for machines working under non-stationary load. An additional difficulty is that the Main Bearing (MB) discussed here, it is used to support low speed shaft, so dynamic response of MB is not clear as for a high-speed shaft. In the case of varying load/speed a vibration signal acquired from bearings is affected by operation and makes the diagnosis difficult. These difficulties come from the variation of diagnostic features caused mostly by load/speed variation, low energy of sought features and high noise levels. In the paper a novel diagnostic approach is proposed for main rotor bearings used in wind turbines. From a commercial diagnostic system two kind of information have been acquired: peak-to-peak vibration acceleration and generator power that is related to the operating conditions. The received data cover the period of several months, when the bearing has been replaced due to its failure and the new one has been installed. Due to serious variability of the mentioned data, a decision-making regarding the condition of bearings is pretty difficult. Application of classical statistical pattern recognition for data from the period A (bad condition) and the period B (after replacement, good condition) is not sufficient because the probability density functions of features overlap each other (pdf of peak-to-peak feature for bad and good conditions). Proposed approach is based on an idea proposed earlier for planetary gearboxes, i.e. to analyse data for bad/good conditions in two-dimensional space, feature - load. It is shown that the final data presentation is a good basis to the very successful classification of data (i.e. recognition of damaged and undamaged bearings).

However, it is difficult to rind the general and highly sensitive SPs for rotating machinery diagnosis. Intelligent methods, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc., often cannot converge when being trained. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a new intelligent diagnosis based on distinctive frequency components (DFCs) and support vector machines (SVMs) which can be used to detect faults and recognize fault types of rotating machinery. The method has been applied to detect the. structural faults of rotating machinery, and the efficiency of the method is verified by practical examples.

A review on the existing speed measurement methods of rotary machine was proposed to find out the defects of each method. A new approach was introduced to fulfill steam turbine speed accurate measuring. The periods of phase signal pulse generated by the key groove and speed signal pulse generated by the velocimetry gear, were measured respectively by the two independent 16-bit timer/counters, and the "counter overflow" problem was resolved by calling a byte memory unit. According to the record number of the counter, the value of steam turbine speed was calculated accurately.

In order to extract the crack signal of the imbalance-crack coupling fault, and realize the fault diagnosis, the paper mainly analyzes its mechanical properties, and then use wavelet packet to de-nosing, decomposing and reconstructing the acquisition of vibration acceleration signal, and then analyzing the characteristics of frequency domain of the fault signal by using the energy spectrum. So the experiment proved that analyze and dispose the acquisition of the fault signal by using the method of the energy spectrum and the wavelet packet, which can effectively distinguish between the crack signal and unbalanced signals in imbalance-crack coupling faults. It also can provide some reference for the diagnosis and prevention for such fault.

Then the PCA method was used to analyze the data in the high dimensional space to extract the nonlinear features which is used as training sample of SVM fault classifier. Then the rotor fault is identified using the trained classifier. The classification effect of KPCA-SVM is compared with PCA-SVM and SVM.

Dynamic predictive maintenance model based on data-driven machinery prognostics approach	ELECTRICAL INFORMATION AND MECHATRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, PTS 1 AND 2	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Information and Mechatronics (ICEIM)	DEC 23-25, 2011	Jiaozuo, PEOPLES R CHINA	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China		Predictive maintenance; Prognostics; Health index; Cost; Optimization		As an increasing number of manufacturers realize the importance of adopting new maintenance technologies to enable systems to achieve near-zero downtime, machinery prognostics which enables this paradigm shift from traditional fail-and-fix maintenance to a predict-and-prevent paradigm has arose interests from researchers. Machine's condition and degradation estimated by machinery prognostics approach can be used to support predictive maintenance policy. This paper develops a novel data-driven machine prognostics approach to assess machine's health condition and predict machine degradation. With this prognostics information, a predictive maintenance model is constructed to decide machine's maintenance threshold and predictive maintenance cycles number. Through a case study, this predictive maintenance model is verified, and the computational results show that this proposed model is efficient and practical.	[Liao, W.

J	Ahmad, R; Kamaruddin, S				Ahmad, Rosmaini; Kamaruddin, Shahrul			A review of condition-based maintenance decision-making	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						decision-making process; condition monitoring; CM; deterioration modelling; condition-based maintenance; CBM	RESIDUAL LIFE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MINIMAL REPAIR; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MODEL; PROGNOSTICS; MACHINE; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSTICS; REPLACEMENT	Condition-based maintenance (CBM) has been a research topic since 1975. It has been introduced as an alternative approach to enhance the effectiveness of preventive maintenance strategy. Currently, CBM research is growing rapidly. Compared with the traditional time-based maintenance approach, CBM application is more beneficial and realistic. With CBM, better maintenance decisions can be made to avoid or minimise unnecessary maintenance costs. This paper attempts to explore how exactly CBM decision-making is conducted, with the methods of decision-making classified into current-condition-evaluation-based and future-condition-prediction-based. This paper systematically reviews the applications of these methods by focusing on the techniques used, as well as on case studies. It concludes with findings based on the academic and industrial perspectives.

As well as having a locating function, fixtures must also ensure that the dimensional quality of the manufactured workpiece can be achieved. Inaccuracies in fixture's location scheme result in a deviation of the workpiece from its nominal specified geometry. A "multistage" machining process refers to a part that is machined through different setups. At multistage machining, the errors of pervious stages are transferred to next stages. In this paper, an analytic model is developed to integrate the errors in each stage and accumulated error of pervious stages. This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for the multistage process. A mathematical model is developed by the kinematic analysis of the fixture using Jacobian matrix and homogeneous transformation matrix (HTM). The effectiveness of the resultant deviation model is verified by example.	[Abedini, V.; Shakeri, M.; Siahmargouie, M.

In the method, the morphology operator had been constructed by average of the closing and opening operator. For the construction of structure element (SE), the flat and zero was adopted as the shape and the height of SE, respectively, and the element numbers of the SE was optimized by a new proposed criterion (called SNR criterion). Vibration signals of two defective rolling bearings with an outer and an inner fault respectively are employed to validate the proposed method and the results are compared with ones calculated by envelopment analysis method. It shows that the proposed method is effective and robust to extract morphological features, and can be used to the on-line diagnostics of rolling element bearings in rotating machines conveniently.

As a major unsupervised learning technology, cluster analysis plays an important role in fault intelligent diagnosis based on machine learning. In rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the traditional spectrum analysis method usually adopts the resonant demodulation technology, but when the inner circle, rolling body or multi-point faults produce composite modulation, it is difficulty to identify the fault type from demodulation spectral lines. According to this, a novel rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on KFCM (Kernel-based Fuzzy C-Means) cluster analysis is proposed. Through clustering on test data and the known samples, the memberships of test data are obtained. From these, the rolling bearing fault type can be determined. Experimental results show that this method is effective.

The component analysis was performed initially to extract the features and to reduce the dimensionality of original data features. Kernel parameters selection of support vector machine which has great influence on the performance of defects classification has been discussed in this work. Precisely, we focus on wavelet transform to extract the feature from the original signals, adopt component analysis to do feature selection and apply support vector machine to classify the defects. This paper exploits the parameter optimization procedure to ensure the generalization ability of SVM. The result shows that multi-class SVM produces promising results and has the potential for use in fault diagnosis.	[Wen, X. C.; Leong, W.

In gliomagenesis, the role of canonical (i.e., beta-catenin-dependent) signalling is largely unknown. Here, we studied canonical wnt pathway activation in 15 short-term cultures from high-grade gliomas and potential pathomechanisms leading to cytoplasmic beta-catenin accumulation. Furthermore, we assessed the prognostic relevance of beta-catenin expression in a tissue microarray comprising 283 astrocytomas. Expression of beta-catenin, its transcriptional cofactors TCF-1 and TCF-4 as well as GSK-3 beta and APC, constituents of the beta-catenin degradation complex was confirmed by RT-PCR in all cultures. A cytoplasmic beta-catenin pool was detectable in 13/15 cultures leading to some transcriptional activity assessed by luciferase reporter gene assay in 8/13. Unlike other malignancies, characteristic mutations of beta-catenin and APC leading to cytoplasmic stabilization of beta-catenin were excluded by direct sequencing or protein truncation test. In patient tissues, beta-catenin expression was directly and its degradation product's (beta-catenin-P654) expression was inversely correlated with WHO grade. Increased beta-catenin expression and low beta-catenin-P654 expression were associated with shorter survival. Altogether, we report on potential canonical wnt pathway activation in high-grade gliomas and demonstrate that beta-catenin expression in astrocytomas is associated with increased malignancy and adverse outcome.

Fortunately, the Kalman filtering technique can filter the noise effectively, and the impending system fault can be revealed to prevent the system from malfunction. This paper has discussed recent progress of the Kalman filters for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. A case study on the rolling bearing condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using Kalman filter and support vector machine (SVM) has been presented. The analysis result showed that the integration of the Kalman filter and SVM was feasible and reliable for the rolling bearing condition monitoring and fault diagnosis and the fault detection rate was over 96.5%.

The operation parameter recorder for construction machinery developed based on industrial control computer and embedded technology can detect, record and manage the operation parameters. The real time fault alarm and historical data analysis can also be realized. The industrial computer, which is core module of this operation parameter recorder, controls the operation parameter acquisition module based on micro-controller ARMSTM32F103 to acquire and condition each operation parameter of the construction machinery. Application software running on the industrial computer processes the operation parameters and carries out alarm and control operations under abnormal conditions for fault protection. The abnormal data shall then be stored for later fault analysis. This operation parameter recorder can record many different types of operation data and has a large storage capacity, so it is applicable to many different types of construction machinery.

Different degradation modeling techniques, such as the Brownian motion process, gamma process, and random coefficients models, have been used to model the evolution of sensor-based degradation signals with the goal of estimating lifetime distributions of various engineering systems. A parametric stochastic degradation modeling approach to estimate the Residual Life Distributions (RLDs) of systems/components that are operating in the field is presented. The proposed methodology rests on the idea of utilizing in situ degradations signals, communicated from fielded components, to update their respective RLDs in real time. Given the observed partial degradation signals, RLDs are evaluated based on a first-passage time approach. Expressions for the first-passage time for a base case linear degradation model, in which the degradation signal evolves as a Brownian motion, are derived. The model is tested using simulated and real-world degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.

To address this, we integrate a Conservative Semi-LAgrangian Multi-tracer transport scheme (CSLAM) into HOMME. The algorithm is specifically re-designed for multiple processors and the cubed-sphere grid with the element-wise domain decomposition as employed by HOMME. Based on these spectral elements, we create a finite volume mesh and add a halo zone of cells since a higher-order CSLAM needs a patch of tracer values for a reconstruction that extend the element. Therefore, we extend HOMME to also be capable of communicating cell center data. Our data structures and design allow us to provide a numerical scheme that still conserves mass locally to machine precision and is also monotone on multiple processor systems, but reduces the communication of tracer values by one for each time step. This is based on the idea that we calculate the reconstruction coefficients redundantly, in a cell of an element and in the corresponding cell in the halo zone. Our algorithm of CSLAM in HOMME is the first one for multiple processor systems and multi-tracers that is highly scalable and efficient.

However, although the current signal has lower SNR (Signal Noise Ratio), it is difficult to identify the feature frequencies of machine tools from complex current spectrum that the feature frequencies are often dense and overlapping by traditional signal processing method such as FFT transformation. With the study in the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA), it is found that the entropy is of importance for frequency identification, which is associated with the probability distribution of any random variable. Therefore, it plays an important role in the signal processing. In order to solve the problem that the feature frequencies are difficult to be identified, an entropy optimization technique based on motor current signal is presented in this paper for extracting the typical feature frequencies of machine tools which can effectively suppress the disturbances. Some simulated current signals were made by MATLAB, and a current signal was obtained from a complex gearbox of an iron works made in Luxembourg. In diagnosis the MCSA is combined with entropy optimization. Both simulated and experimental results show that this technique is efficient, accurate and reliable enough to extract the feature frequencies of current signal, which provides a new strategy for the fault diagnosis and the condition monitoring of machine tools.

Gearbox bearing fault simulation using a finite element model reduction technique	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND					The dynamics of a mechanical system such as a gearbox assembly comprising shafts, gears and bearings can be simulated using Lumped Parameter Models (LPMs). Finite Element Method (FEM) reduction techniques based on the Craig-Bampton method of Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) are useful in creating more accurate dynamic models. These models, despite having more degrees-of-freedom for the individual components than the LPM, make very much larger FE models computationally tractable. In this paper both these approaches, namely LPM and reduced FEM, are compared to create a dynamic model of a gearbox. Earlier simulation models (both LPM and combined LPM and reduced FEM) are further improved to better match the geometry of the bearing faults used in the experimental measurements, and the experimental results from a gearbox test rig. The dynamic model is used to simulate the vibration signals in the presence of localised inner and outer race faults. The new results show better correspondence with the measured signals, in particular with respect to the detailed response to entry and exit from the fault, which can be used to determine fault size. The paper highlights the plausibility of fault simulation in Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM) where a large amount of data can be gathered without experiencing large numbers of actual failures or carrying out costly and time consuming experiments until failure with seeded faults. The simulation data can be used to train neural networks to automate the diagnostic and prognostic processes.	[Deshpande, L.; Randall, R.

Hence, exact condition monitoring and fault diagnosis for them plays an important role of ensuring machinery's reliable running. Cyclic spectral analysis has been used for diagnosis of rolling element bears, where the signals' cyclic spectrum (spectral correlation function) is proven to be equivalent to square envelop and the signals' cyclic coherence has been shown to be superior to cyclic spectrum under narrow band noise and gear vibrations. However, the magnitude of cyclic coherence only represents the "cyclostationary extent" of the signal, and doesn't represent the extent of faults, which can be better represented by the magnitude of cyclic spectrum. In this paper, AR filtering are used before cyclic spectrum analysis, and the corresponding diagnosis results for rolling element bearings under influence of gear vibrations are analyzed and compared with cyclic coherence analysis. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to compare the effectiveness of cyclic spectrum analysis, cyclic coherence analysis and the cyclic spectrum combined AR filtering analysis.

Their faults can be catastrophic and result in costly downtime. Bearing fault is almost the most common fault of fans and pumps as rolling element bearings are widely used in these machines. Hence, condition monitoring and diagnosis of bearings are important. Two different impulsive faults of bearings have been observed and studied in previous research. The first fault presents very clear impulsive symptom in envelope spectrum, but the bearing can work for a long time. The other fault shows relatively indistinct symptom, but the bearing will break down in a short time. To overcome the problems of inaccurate diagnosis, a combinational approach based on an impulsive energy indicator and traditional enveloping analysis is proposed in this paper. This approach discriminate these two faults well and can support the maintenance decision for the machines with rolling element bearings.

A new approach to haul truck tire monitoring is being investigated based on optical strain measurement, which has the advantage of providing quantitative information from sensors that do not contact the tire. A laboratory-scale apparatus has been constructed to monitor a tire as it is subjected to various loads and pressures. Digital image correlation is used to calculate the deformation in the tire. Using this method, damage resulting from a horizontal and vertical cut created on the tire surface could be detected. A three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the tire was created to assist in the characterization of more complex damage types such as wear and fatigue.

In practice, due to differences existing in such aspects as production technology, drivers, etc., a certain fault may derive from different causes, which will lead to a lower diagnostic accuracy of expert systems. Besides, a variety of expert systems now available have a dual problem of low generality and low expandability, of which the former can lead to the repeated development of expert systems for different machines, while the latter restricts users from expanding the system. Aimed at these problems, a type of task-based software architecture of expert system is proposed in this paper, which permits a specific optimization based on a set of common rules, and allows users to add or modify rules on a man-machine dialog so as to keep on absorbing and improving the expert knowledge. Finally, the integration of the expert system with the condition monitoring system to implement the automatic and semi-automatic diagnosis is introduced.

Statistical and time domain signal analysis of the thermal behaviour of wind turbine drive train components under dynamic operation conditions	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND					Gearboxes and generators are fundamental components of all electrical machines and the backbone of all electricity generation. Since the wind energy represents one of the key energy sources of the future, the number of wind turbines installed worldwide is rapidly increasing. Unlike in the past wind turbines are more often positioned in arctic as well as in desert like regions, and thereby exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Especially the temperature in those regions is a key factor that defines the design and choice of components and materials of the drive train. To optimize the design and health monitoring under varying temperatures it is important to understand the thermal behaviour dependent on environmental and machine parameters. This paper investigates the behaviour of the stator temperature of the double fed induction generator of a wind turbine. Therefore, different scenarios such as start of the turbine after a long period of no load, stop of the turbine after a long period of full load and others are isolated and analysed. For each scenario the dependences of the temperature on multiple wind turbine parameters such as power, speed and torque are studied. With the help of the regression analysis for multiple variables, it is pointed out which parameters have high impact on the thermal behaviour. Furthermore, an analysis was done to study the dependences in the time domain. The research conducted is based on 10 months of data of a 2 MW wind turbine using an adapted data acquisition system for high sampled data. The results appear promising, and lead to a better understanding of the thermal behaviour of a wind turbine drive train. Furthermore, the results represent the base of future research of drive trains under harsh environmental conditions, and it can be used to improve the fault diagnosis and design of electrical machines.

Case-based reasoning combined with statistics for diagnostics and prognosis	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND				SYSTEM; INTEGRATION; SERVICE	Many approaches used for diagnostics today are based on a precise model. This excludes diagnostics of many complex types of machinery that cannot be modelled and simulated easily or without great effort. Our aim is to show that by including human experience it is possible to diagnose complex machinery when there is no or limited models or simulations available. This also enables diagnostics in a dynamic application where conditions change and new cases are often added. In fact every new solved case increases the diagnostic power of the system. We present a number of successful projects where we have used feature extraction together with case-based reasoning to diagnose faults in industrial robots, welding, cutting machinery and we also present our latest project for diagnosing transmissions by combining Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) with statistics. We view the fault diagnosis process as three consecutive steps. In the first step, sensor fault signals from machines and/or input from human operators are collected. Then, the second step consists of extracting relevant fault features. In the final diagnosis/prognosis step, status and faults are identified and classified. We view prognosis as a special case of diagnosis where the prognosis module predicts a stream of future features.

Intelligence diagnosis method for roller bearings using features of AE signal	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND					Rolling bearings are important components in rotating machines, which are wildly used in industrial production. The fault diagnosis technology plays a very important role for quality and life of machines. Based on symptom parameters of acoustic emission (AE) signals, this paper presents an intelligent diagnosis method for roller bearings using the principal component analysis, rough sets, and BP neural network to detect faults and distinguish fault types. The principal component analysis and the rough sets algorithm are used to reduce details of time-domain symptom parameters for training the BP neural network. The BP neural network, which is used for condition diagnosis of roller bearings, can obtain good convergence using the symptom parameters acquired by the principal component analysis and the rough sets during learning, and automatically distinguish fault types during diagnosing. Practical examples are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed method.	[Pan, J.; Wang, H. Q.; Wang, F.; Yang, J. F.; Liu, W.

Follow the frequency-domain blind deconvolution flow, the morphological filtering was firstly used to extract modulation features embedded in the observed signals, then the CFPA algorithm was employed to do complex-domain blind separation, finally the J-Divergence of spectrum was employed as distance measure to resolve the permutation. Experiments using real machine sound signals was carried out. The result demonstrate this algorithm can be efficiently applied to gear box combined failure detection in practice.

A hybrid prognostic model for multistep ahead prediction of machine condition	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND					Prognostics are the future trend in condition based maintenance. In the current framework a data driven prognostic model is developed. The typical procedure of developing such a model comprises a) the selection of features which correlate well with the gradual degradation of the machine and b) the training of a mathematical tool. In this work the data are taken from a laboratory scale single stage gearbox under multi-sensor monitoring. Tests monitoring the condition of the gear pair from healthy state until total brake down following several days of continuous operation were conducted. After basic pre-processing of the derived data, an indicator that correlated well with the gearbox condition was obtained. Consecutively the time series is split in few distinguishable time regions via an intelligent data clustering scheme. Each operating region is modelled with a feed-forward artificial neural network (FFANN) scheme. The performance of the proposed model is tested by applying the system to predict the machine degradation level on unseen data. The results show the plausibility and effectiveness of the model in following the trend of the timeseries even in the case that a sudden change occurs. Moreover the model shows ability to generalise for application in similar mechanical assets.	[Roulias, D.; Loutas, T.

The bearing faults detection could be enhanced without knowledge of the optimum frequency bands to demodulate, however, envelope analysis over full bandwidth brings more noise interference. Stochastic resonance (SR), which is now often used in weak signal detection, is an important nonlinear effect. By normalized scale transform, SR can be applied in weak signal detection of machinery system. In this paper, signal pre-whitening based on cepstrum editing and SR theory are combined to enhance the detection of bearing fault. The envelope spectrum kurtosis of bearing fault characteristic components is used as indicators of bearing faults. Detection results of planted bearing inner race faults on a test rig show the enhanced detecting effects of the proposed method. And the indicators of bearing inner race faults enhanced by SR are compared to the ones without enhancement to validate the proposed method.

It generalizes the yes-no Boolean logic into numerical value of 1 and 0 but also permits the in between values. This paper presents the use of Fuzzy Logic to determine the unusual increase of vibrations of an induction motor called vibration analysis. Sudden increase of vibrations could be a good indicator of faulty condition of the motor. Based on the vibration characteristics of the motor, a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) was created. The system classified the motor of the gas distribution pump as, acceptable. of the vibration ranges from 1.8mm/s to 4.5mm/s or, monitor closely. of the vibration ranges from 4.5mm/s to 7.1mm/s respectively. The system enabled an early detection of faults which is very important in maintenance management.

A crack in vibrating structures can lead to premature failure if it is not detected in time. Researchers have been working on the dynamics of cracked structures for decades to be able to monitor a structure and diagnose fault at the earliest possible stage. An effort has been made in the current paper to understand different techniques and methodologies for fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of damaged structures subjected to varied dynamic loading. The methods used are classical, wavelet transform, and finite element methods, artificial intelligence methods, and numerical and experimental methods. Using classical methods, engineers are able to predict faults. But using artificial intelligence techniques, it is observed that the forecasting time for fault diagnosis improves a lot in comparison to other methodologies.

J	Barszcz, T; Sawalhi, N				Barszcz, Tomasz; Sawalhi, Nader			Fault Detection Enhancement in Rolling Element Bearings Using the Minimum Entropy Deconvolution	ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS			English	Article						rolling bearing; fault detection; Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED); wind turbine	UNSUPERVISED NOISE CANCELLATION; VIBRATION SIGNALS; DIAGNOSTICS; DECOMPOSITION	Minimum Entropy Deconvolution (MED) has been recently introduced to the machine condition monitoring field to enhance fault detection in rolling element bearings and gears. MED proved to be an excellent aid to the extraction of these impulses and diagnosing their origin, i.e. the defective component of the bearing. In this paper, MED is revisited and re-introduced with further insights into its application to fault detection and diagnosis in rolling element bearings. The MED parameter selection as well as its combination with pre-whitening is discussed. Two main cases are presented to illustrate the benefits of the MED technique. The first one was taken from a fan bladed test rig. The second case was taken from a wind turbine with an inner race fault. The usage of the MED technique has shown a strong enhancement for both fault detection and diagnosis. The paper contributes to the knowledge of fault detection of rolling element bearings through providing an insight into the usage of MED in rolling element bearings diagnostic. This provides a guide for the user to select optimum parameters for the MED filter and illustrates these on new interesting cases both from a lab environment and an actual case.

With the Morlet wavelet transform, the effective fault information is extracted from the time-frequency domain of the vibration signals. Then, the wavelet coefficients are divided into multi-segments, and the infinity-norms of each segment is applied as the features to construct the observation vector of the hidden Markov models. Finally, the experimental results on bearing faults identification and isolation are illustrated.

Because it often breaks down suddenly, there are many problems in the planned maintenance of low-speed rotating machinery in industry plants. In order to detect fault of low-speed rotating machinery as earlier as possible, this paper proposes a sensitivity evaluation method of fault diagnosis by using symptom parameters and frequency analysis of vibration signal and acoustic emission (AE) signal measured for the diagnosis. The practical examples are shown for explaining the efficiency of the sensitivity evaluation method proposed in this paper.

The effect of EEMD depends on two key parameters which are the amplitude of white noise and the ensemble times. However, the shortcoming of EEMD is that it lacks adaptability and reliability because these two key important parameters are obtained by experience and human intervention. An Improved Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition method is proposed in this paper, by adding white noise and ascertaining ensemble number adaptively. The criterion of adding white noise in Improved EEMD is established, by which a composite simulation signal could be adaptively and accurately decomposed into IMFs without mode mixing. The proposed method is applied to a gear fault detection of hot strip finishing mills. The result shows that Improved EEMD method successfully extracts the gear fault feature with high precise diagnosis results.

Before the fault diagnosis was made, the fault patterns were firstly obtained from technical manuals and field experience to build a sample set, and then they were classified and coded according to the rule. In order to improve diagnosis speed, the fault diagnosis system was designed as a hybrid neural network system which consists of two-grade neural networks. When the fault pattern was input the system, the fault was first classified by the first-grade BP network, and according to the fault type, the corresponding second-grade ART network was activated to perform fault diagnosis. In this paper, the train algorithms of two kinds of neural networks were programmed by MATLAB. Comparing with the traditional diagnosis method, the presented technology possesses advantages of automatic fault diagnosis and ability for self-learning and self-organization.

NONLINEAR ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENTS WITH EMATS FOR DETECTING PRE-CRACKING FATIGUE DAMAGE	REVIEW OF PROGRESS IN QUANTITATIVE NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION, VOLS 31A AND 31B	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation (QNDE)	JUL 17-22, 2011	Univ Vermont, Burlington, VT	QNDE Programs, AF Res Lab, Army Res Lab, Amer Soc Nondestruct Testing (ASNT), Dept Energy, AMES Lab, Fed Aviat Adm (FAA), Natl Aeronaut & Space Adm (NASA), Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Ind/Univ Cooperat Res Ctr, Iowa State Univ, Ctr Nondestruct Evaluat	Univ Vermont	Nonlinearity; Ultrasonic wave; EMAT; Rayleigh wave; Fatigue damage	WAVES	This paper describes an approach for measuring material degradation using nonlinear acoustics. The importance of this measurement is that prior efforts have shown that the degree of acoustic nonlinearity increases as a function of fatigue damage accumulation. By exploiting this physical mechanism, there is the potential to develop methods for measuring the remaining life of critical components. The challenge with existing approaches for measuring acoustic nonlinearity is that primarily they have only been shown to be successful in a laboratory setting. This paper presents a potential approach for field measurement of acoustic nonlinearity that utilizes Rayleigh waves generated from electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs). Rayleigh waves have unique advantages because the sound propagates along the surface, allowing for application on complex engineering structures. EMATs were used in place of traditional piezoelectric transducers because the sound is generated directly in the metallic structure, eliminating the need for sound coupling fluids that are a source of variability. Custom EMATs were developed and nonlinearity measurements were performed on 410 stainless steel specimens that were subjected to a fatigue process. Some experiments showed an increase in the acoustic nonlinearity of up to 500% compared to the unfatigued value. Other experiments had too much scatter and did not show this relationship consistently due to unanticipated challenges in producing repeatable measurements. Lessons learned from the project effort will be presented to potentially improve the repeatability of the measurement approach. If the scatter can be reduced, this EMAT-based technique could result in a field deployable prognosis tool.

In this paper, a new efficiency fault recognition method is provided, by using improved Support Vector Machines (LibSVMs). The recognition methods, ANN and LibSVM are compared on their recognition accuracy, and the results show that the LibSVM is more efficient than ANN. The algorithm of LibSVM is improved by using Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the GA-LibSVM can obtain higher recognition accuracy than usual LibSVM for mechanical fault recognition of CB.

First of all, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was used to decompose the vibration signals into a finite number of stationary Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), and then complexity features of each IMF is extracted as the fault characteristics vectors and served as input parameters of LS-SVM classifier to diagnosis fault. Application results showed that the proposed method is very effective, which can better extract the nonlinear features of the fault and more exactly diagnosis fault.

Recent researches have shown that E3 ubiquitin ligases Pirh2 (p53-induced RING-H2 protein) is highly expressed in HCC cell lines and is correlated with poor survival and prognostic in patients with HCC; however, the function of Pirh2 in the genesis and the development of HCC remains unclear. Pirh2, a member of the RING finger family, can target p53 for degradation and thereby repress a diverse group of biological activities and involved in many signalling pathways related to the genesis and evolution of cancer. Up to now, four Pirh2 variants had been reported and named Pirh2A, Pirh2B, Pirh2C and Pirh2D. Here we report the existence of two additional isoforms from human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2 cell) and named as Pirh2E and Pirh2F. Compared to full-length Pirh2A, Pirh2E lacks amino acids 235-261, while Pirh2F is missing C-terminal amino acids 227-261 and both isoforms harbor the RING domain; therefore, we speculate that ubiquitin ligase activity maybe reversed by them. Further studies are required to determine whether Pirh2E and Pirh2F functions in a manner similar to Pirh2A.

Currently, staining is the golden standard in histopathology but requires surgical removal of tissue. In order to avoid resection of non-diseased tissue a non-invasive real-time imaging method is required which can be applied ideally intrasurgically. In this proceeding a combination of second harmonic generation (SHG), two photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) imaging has been employed to investigate tissue sections of head and neck carcinomas focussing on laryngeal carcinoma. Primary laryngeal and other head and neck carcinomas consist to 99% of squamous cell carcinoma. By fusing the various imaging methods it is possible to measure the thickness of the epithelial cell layer as a marker for dysplastic or cancerous tissue degradation and to differentiate keratinizing and nonkeratininzing squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). As nonkeratinizing SCCs of the oropharynx correlate with a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection as a subentity of head and neck cancer, and HPV related tumors are associated with a better clinical prognosis, the differentiation between keratinizing and non-keratinizing forms of SCCs is of high diagnostic value. TPEF is capable of displaying cell nuclei, therefore, morphologic information as cell density, cell to cytoplasm ratio, size and shape of cell nuclei can be obtained. SHG - on the other hand - selectively reveals the collagen matrix of the connective tissue, which is useful for determination of tumor-islets boundaries within epithelial tissue - a prerequisite for precise resection. Finally CARS in the CH-stretching region visualizes the lipid content of the tissue, which can be correlated with the dysplastic grade of the tissue.

We developed a CAD system which detects sclerotic bone metastases in the spine on CT images. After the spine is segmented from the image, a watershed algorithm detects lesion candidates. The over-segmentation problem of the watershed algorithm is addressed by the novel incorporation of a graph-cuts driven merger. 30 quantitative features for each detection are computed to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The classifier was trained on 12 clinical cases and tested on 10 independent clinical cases. Ground truth lesions were manually segmented by an expert. The system prior to classification detected 87% (72/83) of the manually segmented lesions with volume greater than 300 mm(3). On the independent test set, the sensitivity was 71.2% (95% confidence interval (63.1%, 77.3%)) with 8.8 false positives per case.

Here, fault diagnosis for wireless sensor network based on genetic-support vector machine is presented in the paper. In SVM, inappropriate training parameters can lead to over-fitting or under-fitting. Thus, genetic algorithm is used to select the appropriate training parameters of support vector machine. Genetic algorithm is a kind of evolutionary computing algorithm, which has strong global search ability. In the experiments, 60 state samples of wireless sensor network are employed to study the diagnosis ability of genetic-support vector machine. The experimental results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the genetic-support vector machine model is higher than that of the support vector machine model.

New Combined Method for Fault Detection, Classification, and Location in Series-compensated Transmission Line	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						distance protection; hyperbolic S-transform; support vector classification and regression; series compensation	PROTECTION SCHEME; S-TRANSFORM; IDENTIFICATION; MACHINE; TCSC	In this article, a new full-scheme distance protection for a series-compensated transmission line is proposed. The new combination of hyperbolic S-transform and learning machines is applied for fault detection, classification, and location, which are the three main aspects of distance relays. The hyperbolic S-transform is used for extracting useful features from the current and voltage signals sample of the power system from one terminal. The extracted features are employed for distance protection using support vector classification and support vector regression methods. The proposed method is evaluated by the different series capacitor location in the transmission line, where a metal oxide varistor protects the series capacitor against over-voltages. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed protection scheme provides accurate tripping logic with good accuracy of fault location. Also, the non-tripping decision for external faults that occurred on adjacent uncompensated transmission line is embedded in the proposed scheme. The various operating conditions of the series-compensated transmission line are simulated in the PSCAD/EMTDC (Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) environment. The obtained results of support vector classification and support vector regression confirm that the new extracted features from the time-frequency hyperbolic S-transform-matrix are very effective and reliable.

Based on the advances of the statistical learning theory, one of the first SVM algorithms was proposed in mid 1990s. Since then, they have drawn a lot of research interests both in Theoretical and application domains and have became the state-of-the-art techniques in solving classification and regression problems. The reason for the success is not only because of their sound theoretical foundation but also their good generalization performance in many real applications. In this chapter, we address the theoretical, algorithmic and computational issues and try our best to make the article self-contained. Moreover, in the end of this chapter, a case study on default prediction is also presented. We discuss the issues when SVM algorithms are applied to bankruptcy prognosis such as how to deal with the unbalanced dataset, how to tune the parameters to have a better performance and how to deal with large scale dataset.

WSNs can provider health monitoring of aircraft structures, improving safety and reducing costs by enabling predictive maintenance. A simple solution, which meets the requirements for lightness and compactness, is represented by piezoelectric generators fixed to the surface of the wing (i.e. the wing skin). Such piezoelectric patches can harvest the strain energy available when the wing is flexed, as occurs, for example, in the presence of gust loading. For this study, monolithic piezoelectric sheets and macro fibre composite (MFC) generators were fixed to plates made of two materials commonly used for aircraft wing skin: Al-2024 aluminum, alloy and an epoxy-carbon fibre composite. The plates then underwent harmonically varying loading in a a tensile testing machine. The power generation of the harvesters was measures at a selection of strain levels and low excitation frequencies, across a range of electrical loads. the optimal electrical load, yielding maximum power extraction, was identified for each working condition. The generated power increases quadratically with the strain and linearly with the frequency. the optimal electrical load decreases with increasing frequency and is only marginally dependent on strain. Absolute values of generated power were highest with the MFC, reaching 12mW (330 mu W/cm(2)) under 1170 mu strain with the excitation at 10Hz with a 66k Omega load. Power generation densities of 600 mu W/cm(2) were achieved under 940 mu strain with the monolithic transducers at 10Hz. It is found that MFCs have a lower power density than monolithic transducers, but, being more resilient, could be a more reliable choice. The power generated and the voltage outputs are appropriate for the intended application.

Synergistic combination of systems for structural health monitoring and earthquake early warning for structural health prognosis and diagnosis	HEALTH MONITORING OF STRUCTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS 2012	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Health Monitoring of Structural and Biological Systems	MAR 12-15, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers		Earthquake Early Warning; Structural Health Monitoring; Bayesian Probability; Damage Prediction; Damage Assessment; Decision Support System; Prognosis and Diagnosis	INCOMPLETE MODAL DATA; PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; PERFORMANCE	Earthquake early warning (EEW) systems are currently operating nationwide in Japan and are in beta-testing in California. Such a system detects an earthquake initiation using online signals from a seismic sensor network and broadcasts a warning of the predicted location and magnitude a few seconds to a minute or so before an earthquake hits a site. Such a system can be used synergistically with installed structural health monitoring (SHM) systems to enhance pre-event prognosis and post-event diagnosis of structural health. For pre-event prognosis, the EEW system information can be used to make probabilistic predictions of the anticipated damage to a structure using seismic loss estimation methodologies from performance-based earthquake engineering. These predictions can support decision-making regarding the activation of appropriate mitigation systems, such as stopping traffic from entering a bridge that has a predicted high probability of damage. Since the time between warning and arrival of the strong shaking is very short, probabilistic predictions must be rapidly calculated and the decision making automated for the mitigation actions. For post-event diagnosis, the SHM sensor data can be used in Bayesian updating of the probabilistic damage predictions with the EEW predictions as a prior. Appropriate Bayesian methods for SHM have been published. In this paper, we use pre-trained surrogate models (or emulators) based on machine learning methods to make fast damage and loss predictions that are then used in a cost-benefit decision framework for activation of a mitigation measure. A simple illustrative example of an infrastructure application is presented.

The study aims at addressing an increasing need in the biomedical area where robust, reliable, and non-invasive methods to assess the bone-interface of dental and orthopedic implants are increasingly demanded for clinical diagnosis and direct prognosis. The methods are based on the electromechanical impedance method and on the propagation of solitary waves. Nobel Biocare (R) 4.3 x 13 mm implants were entrenched inside bovine rib bones that were immersed inside Normal Saline for 24 hours before test in order to avoid dehydration and simulating physiologic osmolarity of the corticocancellous bone and plasma. Afterwards the bones were immersed in a solution of nitric acid to allow material degradation, inversely simulating a bone-healing process. This process was monitored by bonding a Piezoceramic Transducer (PZT) to the abutment and measuring the electrical admittance of the PZT over time. On the other hand the bones calcium loss was calculated after immersing in acid by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy over time for comparison. Moreover a novel transducer based on the generation and detection of highly nonlinear solitary waves was used to assess the stiffness of the abutment-implant bone. In these experiments it was found that the PZT's conductance and some of the solitary waves parameters are sensitive to the degradation of the bones and was correlated to the bone calcium loss over time.

RADIAL FORCE CHARACTERISTIC ASSESSMENT IN A NOVEL TWO-PHASE DUAL LAYER SRG USING FEM	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; MAGNETOSTATIC FIELD ANALYSIS; SWITCHED-RELUCTANCE MOTORS; DYNAMIC ECCENTRICITY; MISALIGNMENT FAULT; ACOUSTIC NOISE; DIAGNOSIS; TORQUE; REDUCTION; ALGORITHM	This paper investigates the radial force characteristics of a novel two-phase dual layer switched reluctance generator. The proposed generator consists of two magnetically dependent stator and rotor layers, where each stator set includes four salient poles with windings wrapped around them while, the rotor comprises of two salient poles. In this paper, the radial and tangential force components and their trends in healthy condition under different load levels are assessed with the respect to critical rotor positions. One of the most important problems seen in the industrial applications of generators which have concerned users is the rotor eccentricity which may conclude the unbalanced distribution of flux linkage as well as acoustic noise and vibration due to the radial forces produced during the rotation of machine's rotor. In this regard, in this paper, it is attempted to obtain and evaluate the radial force components resulted from different degrees of eccentricity faults.

Acoustic Emission Characterization of the Onset of Corrosion in Reinforced Concrete	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2012, PTS 1 AND 2	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical, and Aerospace Systems	MAR 12-15, 2012	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Asian-Pacific Network Ctr Res Smart Struct Technol (ANCRiSST)		acoustic emission; corrosion; reinforced concrete; accelerated test; steel reinforcement; service life	STEEL	The development of techniques capable of evaluating deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) is instrumental to the advancement of the structural health monitoring (SHM) and service life estimate for constructed facilities. One of the main causes leading to degradation of RC is the corrosion of the steel reinforcement. This process can be modeled phenomenologically, while laboratory tests aimed at studying durability responses are typically accelerated in order to provide useful results within a realistic period of time. Among nondestructive methods, acoustic emission (AE) is emerging as a tool to detect the onset and progression of deterioration mechanisms. In this paper, the development of accelerated corrosion and continuous AE monitoring test set-up for RC specimens are presented. Relevant information are provided with regard to the characteristics of the corrosion circuit, continuous measurement and acquisition of corrosion potential, selection of AE sensors and AE parameter setting. Results from small-scale pre-notched RC specimens aim to isolate the frequency spectrum where the corrosion first takes place. Waveform analysis critical in the definition of a prognosis model will extend the AE dataset for the onset of corrosion.

However, its training speed and diagnosis speed are relatively slow. Signed Directed Graph (SDG) based on deep knowledge model has better completeness that is knowledge representation ability. However, much quantitative information is not utilized in qualitative SDG model which often produces a false solution. In order to speed up the training and diagnosis of SVM and improve the diagnostic resolution of SDG, SDG and SVM are combined in this paper. Training samples' dimension of SVM is reduced to improve training speed and diagnosis speed by the consistent path of SDG; the resolution of SDG is improved by good classification performance of SVM. The Matlab simulation by Tennessee-Eastman Process (TEP) simulation system demonstrates the feasibility of the fault diagnosis algorithm proposed in this paper.

J	Bingol, O; Pacaci, S				Bingol, Okan; Pacaci, Serdar			A Virtual Laboratory for Neural Network Controlled DC Motors Based on a DC-DC Buck Converter	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						DC-DC converter; DC motor; artificial neural network; virtual laboratory	EDUCATIONAL-TOOL; FAULT-DETECTION; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; DRIVE	DC-DC converters have a wide usage as the driver circuit of direct current (DC) motors. This has necessitated sensitive speed controls to be made on DC motors. Classical controllers have lower performance due to the non-linear features of DC motors, such as saturation and friction. The Neural Network Controllers (NNC) are widely used in controlling poorly-defined, nonlinear and uncertain systems. NNC courses are now being offered by several universities at the bachelor's and master's degree levels as a result of NNC's successful applications in these fields. However, the training of an NNC driver circuit in a laboratory environment is a time-consuming and expensive task. In this study, an NNC training set of the DC converter-fed Permanent Magnet Direct Current (PMDC) motor, which is part of the electrical machinery courses, was prepared. The set has a flexible structure and a graphical interface. Thanks to this set, it has become possible to change the PMDC motor and controller parameters, and monitor the system's reaction under various operational conditions in graphics.

Hence, saturation profile as an effective parameter on fault diagnosis accuracy is taken into account. Broken bars are detected for different distributions of broken bars over different motor poles. The influence of control techniques on locating broken bars is investigated in detail. The competency of the amplitude of the sideband components at frequencies (1 +/- 2ks)f(s) as common indices for broken bars recognition is studied in the controlled motor via the open-loop constant voltage/frequency and closed-loop direct torque control techniques.

In this paper, the wear behavior of diesel engines, especially on oil analysis, is studied based on condition data. In terms of analyzing historical data, descriptive statistics is used as data mining tools to find the relationship between condition factors of the machine and its final status. The equipments have been monitored in two different environments which are: plantation-forestry, and general construction. Based on this relationship a specific baseline is achieved for selected sets of equipment in their specific conditions. A striking result is that the new baseline for each material is different significantly in each condition, which shows that for each condition making a specific baseline is essential.

In this study four common faults in rotating machineries namely: 1) Mass Unbalance 2) Angular Misalignment 3) Bearing Faults and 4) Mechanical Looseness have been considered. Each of these defects has been created separately on a test rig comprising of an electrical motor coupled to a rotor assembly. A Vibrotest 60 vibration spectrum analyzer has been used to collect velocity spectrum of the vibration on the bearings. Eleven characteristic features have been chosen to distinguish different faults. Based on the acquired data an Artificial Neural Network Multi Layer Perceptrons(MLPs) and Radial Basis Functions(RBF) Neural Network has been designed to recognize each one of the aforementioned defects. After training the Neural Network, it was checked by new data gathered by new experiments and the results showed that the designed network can predict the faults with more than 75% reliability, and it can be a good assistance to an ordinary machine operator to guess the problem and hence make a good decision.

Vibration analysis based on mechanical bearing frequencies in industrial machines is currently used to detect the presence of a fault condition. Since these mechanical vibrations are associated with variations in the physical disturbances of the machine, the air gap flux density is modulated and peak amplitudes are generated at predictable frequencies related to the electrical supply and vibration frequencies. Spartan3E FPGA was used in this process to reduce the time of detection and to increase the accuracy in displaying the fault position. Induction motor HS-1 by High Speed Motors is taken as the device under test to perform the vibration analysis and draw the results. The device SI-100 by Syscon Instruments is the sensor used to extract the analog information of interest from the motor during the implementation. In addition all this phenomena is also tested using LabVIEW2009 and NI-ELVIS to check the accuracy of the results.

Periodic/cyclic impulses are related to local faults which cause impulse/concentric forces/stresses in kinematic pairs. Typical examples of such local faults which cause mechanical system condition change are spall/pitting on bearings elements: outer/inner races and/or rolling elements. For analyzed objects, impulses associated with local faults are masked by other signal sources. In the first part of the paper objects are presented for the better understanding of mechanical phenomena that exist in the system, then preliminary signal analysis will be performed (in time, frequency and time-frequency domain) for the identification of signal nature. Next the idea of an adaptive system and the brief description of Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) algorithm will be presented. Application of NLMS is better than classical LMS due to stability of the adaptation. In the last section the results of adaptive filtering for signals from bearings is discussed.

The acoustic emission (AE) signal is the transient and non-stationary signal. Wavelet Transform has outstanding advantage revealing the character of this signal in time-frequency. With the increasing of the rotor speed, the noise increases a lot and the wavelet coefficients of AE signal change to high-scale. The db10 was applied in AE signal processing, and the modulus maxima method was applied to reconstruct of the signal. The result shows that the AE signal of rotor rubbing could be separated from noise by Daubechies Wavelet.

K entropy value was used to describe the disorder degree of aeroengine parts performance parameters, analyzing the health status and evolutive trend of aeroengine components. Optimization base on K entropy was used to analyze muli-parameter time series trend of K entropy, according to preferred status indicator changes analyzes the overall health of aeroengine. Experimental demonstration on the actual flight data can be more accurately reflected the health of aeroengine,have some significance to fault diagnosis and repair of aeroengine. Aero-engine as the plane "heart", the work status is directly related to the flight safety, and therefore it is necessary the wing of engine health monitoring and its states condition assessment and fault diagnosis, timely detection of potential failure risks, protect their work([1]). Areo-engine performance parameters such as exhaust temperature (E-GTM), fuel flow (W-F) and rotor speed (N-1 and N-2), each has the corresponding threshold, most of the engine monitoring assessment should include these parameters are lower than their threshold, to determine whether the engine in the health status([2]). Aero-engine in the process of operation, affected by high temperature, high speed working environment,internal gravity larger, cause attenuation of the capabilities of pneumatic components, the engine performance decline. Machine performance parameters compared with a series of thresholds, it is not enough to understand the engine health state internal development, can't effectively achieve the engine performance parameters of the gradient analysis([3-5]). Areo-engine is a complex nonlinear system, its complex internal flow field, influenced each other in various parts of the system, which difficult to monitor and calculate, and the actual measurement of feature information or characteristic parameters is also changes with time, some even changes randomly([6]). Some scholars have been in accord with the sequence based on the joint entropy done a certain amount of exploration and research, on this basis, the entropy and many goals optimization are introduced into the aircraft engine health monitoring, to make up for deficiencies by the joint entropy of the aircraft engine to obtain more accurate overall health trend. Based on the theory of Kolmogorov entropy, combined with the maximum likelihood algorithm proposed by Schouten, a single parameter time series by estimated K entropy, which describes the parts performance parameters of the disorder degree, analysis of aero-engine components health status. In view of the independent analysis each parameter exists greater uncertainty, weight of the unknown multi-parameter be preferred with K entropy, monitoring the whole aircraft engine health.

The hybrid model, known as FMM-CART, exploits the advantages of both FMM and CART for undertaking data classification and rule extraction problems. A series of real experiments is conducted, whereby the motor current signature analysis method is applied to form a database comprising stator current signatures under different motor conditions. The signal harmonics from the power spectral density are extracted as discriminative input features for fault detection and classification with FMM-CART. A comprehensive list of induction motor fault conditions, viz., broken rotor bars, unbalanced voltages, stator winding faults, and eccentricity problems, has been successfully classified using FMM-CART with good accuracy rates. The results are comparable, if not better, than those reported in the literature. Useful explanatory rules in the form of a decision tree are also elicited from FMM-CART to analyze and understand different fault conditions of induction motors.

Fault diagnosis can be taken as a pattern recognition problem. As most processes are intrinsically nonlinear, support vector machines (SVMs) are one of the most popular and promising classification algorithms. The fatal drawbacks of standard SVM is the computing overhead grows with the number of training samples, where as training samples from real industrial processes are increasing with time grows. An incremental fault diagnosis approach based on OISVM is proposed in this work. Some related problem such as variable selection and parameter setting are also discussed in this work. Simulation results on the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Diagnosing intermittent fault is an important approach to restrain BIT false alarms. This paper proposes a intermittent faults diagnostic methods based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multiple support vector machine (MSVM). Firstly, the EMD method is used to decompose the original signal into a number of intrinsic mode function (IMF), the auto-regressive (AR) model of each IMF component is established. The AR model parameters and the variance of remnant are regarded as the feature vectors, are input to MSVM classifier, so the working conditions and faults are classified. The experimental results show that the BIT false alarm caused by intermittent fault can be effectively reduced by this proposed method.

In this methodology, the effect of unbalanced supply conditions, constructional imbalances and measurement errors are also investigated. The sizes of the wings determine the loading on the motor and the travel of the wings while their areas determine the degree of severity of the faults. This approach is also applied to detect open circuit faults or single phasing conditions in induction motors. In order to validate this method, experimental results are presented for a 5 hp squirrel cage induction motor. The proposed technique helps improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of the motor system and industrial plant. It also allows maintenance to be performed in a more efficient manner, since the course of action can be determined based on the type and severity of the fault.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used as a key technique to estimate the motor parameters. The zero-sequence voltage equation for the stator has been used as a model to estimate motor stator parameters - the stator resistance and the stator leakage inductance. The comparison of the parameter estimation by the earlier Recursive Least Square (RLS) method and the proposed GA technique has been discussed. The GA technique shows better accuracy in the estimation. The estimation has been tested on both simulations and a real test motor.

J	Li, ZX; Yan, XP; Jiang, Y; Qin, L; Wu, JP				Li, Zhixiong; Yan, Xinping; Jiang, Yu; Qin, Li; Wu, Jingping			A new data mining approach for gear crack level identification based on manifold learning	MECHANIKA			English	Article						gear; crack level; data mining	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; VIBRATION	Gear crack is a common damage model in the gear mechanisms, and an unexpected serious crack may break the transmission system down, leading to significant economic losses. Efficient incipient fault detection and diagnosis are therefore critical to machinery normal running. One of the key points of the fault diagnosis is feature extraction and selection. Literature review indicates that only limited research considered the nonlinear property of the feature space by the use of manifold learning algorithms in the field of mechanic fault diagnosis, and nonlinear feature extraction for gear crack detection are scarce. This paper reports a novel data mining method based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and supervised locally linear embedding (SLLE) applied to gear crack level identification. The EMD was used to decompose the vibration signals into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) for feature extraction, whilst the SLLE for nonlinear feature selection. The experimental vibration data acquired from the gear fault test-bed were processed for feature reduction and extraction using the proposed method. Study results show that the sensitive characteristics between different gear crack severity vibration signals can be revealed effectively by EMD-SLLE. The energy distribution and the statistic features of IMFs vary with the change of the gear operation conditions, and the most distinguished features can be extracted by nonlinear method of SLLE. In addition, the performance of feature extraction of SLLE is better than that of the linear method of principal component analysis (PCA).

J	Kolodziejek, P; Bogalecka, E				Kolodziejek, Piotr; Bogalecka, Elzbieta			Broken rotor symptoms in the sensorless control of induction machine	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Induction motor drive; Broken rotor diagnosis; Sensorless control; Wind power; Road vehicles		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the need for a universal method for sensorless controlled induction motor drive diagnosis. The increasing number of sensorless control systems in industrial applications require a universal method for the drive diagnosis, which provides reliable diagnostic reasoning independent of control system structure and state variables measurement or estimation method. Design/methodology/approach - Simulations and experimental investigation has been done with assumptions of multiscalar control system as a generalized vector control method, voltage source inverter application, sensorless control system based on selected speed observer structure and squirrel cage induction motor. Broken rotor symptoms are analyzed in the state variables and control system variables using DSP processing without outside measurement devices. Findings - Symptoms of rotor asymmetry caused by broken rotor in the state and control variables was identified and symptoms amplitudes were compared. Based on the simulation and experimental results a new diagnosis method was proposed. Practical implications - For early broken rotor detection there is a need to identify variables most sensitive to rotor asymmetry. In closed-loop operation broken rotor symptom signals amplitudes are changed due to control system influence and in sensorless control due to used estimator frequency characteristics. The proposed method assumption is to aggregate symptoms in variables that altogether give results for broken rotor range regardless of applied control system structure or state variable estimator. Originality/value - This paper shows control system influence to rotor fault symptom amplitudes in the state and control system variables. Identified phenomena is used for a new diagnosis method development.

For real time, integrated health monitoring of steam turbine, novel fault detection data is essential to reduce operating and maintenance costs while optimizing the life of the critical engine components. This paper describes about normal and abnormal vibration data detection procedure for a large steam turbine (210 MW) using artificial neural networks (ANN). Self-organization map is trained with the normal data obtained from a thermal power station, and simulated with abnormal condition data from a test rig developed at laboratory. The optimum size of self-organization map is determined using quantization and topographic errors, which has a strong influence on the quality of the clustering.

J	Shen, ZJ; Chen, XF; Zhang, XL; He, ZJ				Shen, Zhongjie; Chen, Xuefeng; Zhang, Xiaoli; He, Zhengjia			A novel intelligent gear fault diagnosis model based on EMD and multi-class TSVM	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Gear reducer; Empirical mode decomposition; Multi-class transductive support vector machine; Fault diagnosis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HILBERT SPECTRUM; VIBRATION; SVM	In the condition monitoring of gear reducer, the labeled fault samples are sparse and expensive, while the unlabeled samples are plentiful and cheap. How to diagnose the faults occurring in complex and special gear reducer effectively becomes a troublesome problem in case of insufficient labeled samples or excess unlabeled samples. This paper presents a novel model for fault diagnosis based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multi-class transductive support vector machine (TSVM), which is applied to diagnose the faults of the gear reducer. The experimental results obtain a very high diagnosis accuracy. Even though the number of unlabeled samples is 50 times as that of labeled samples, the mean of testing accuracy of the proposed novel method can reach at 91.62%, which distinctly precedes the testing success rates of the other similar models in the same experimental condition.

A multichannel fusion approach based on coupled hidden Markov models for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						coupled hidden Markov model; multichannel fusion; fault diagnosis; rolling element bearing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET; PROGNOSTICS; HMMS; TOOL	This paper presents a novel multichannel fusion approach based on coupled hidden Markov models (CHMMs) for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis. Different from a hidden Markov model (HMM), a CHMM contains multiple state sequences and observation sequences, and hence has powerful potential for multichannel fusion. In this study, a two-chain CHMM is employed to integrate the two-channel vibration signals collected from bearings, i.e. the horizontal and vertical vibration signals. Efficient probabilistic inference and parameter estimation algorithms are developed for the model. An experiment was carried out to validate the proposed approach. Normalized wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet energy entropy are extracted as features for classification respectively. Then, the results of the proposed approach are compared with those of the currently used approach based on HMMs and one-channel signals. The results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective to improve the classification rate.	[Xiao, W. B.; Chen, J.; Dong, G. M.; Zhou, Y.; Wang, Z.

This new method is able to discriminate the presence of a true rotor fault from a time-varying load and can be used even when both the fault and the load torque variation coexist. A theoretical analysis complemented with experimental results support the effectiveness of this new diagnostic approach for the detection of rotor faults in operating three-phase induction motors.

Use of numerical modeling makes it possible to precisely study the eccentricity in these types of machines. The accuracy of the FEM model is validated using experimental measurement. To the best awareness of the authors, effects of static eccentricity in AFPMMs have not been studied before. Hence, a new definition for the static eccentricity factor (SEF) is presented and it is shown that the occurrence of static eccentricity is very high in these types of machines. A motor with different degrees of rotor eccentricity is simulated and the flux density distribution in the air gap and the total axial force between rotor and stator is obtained. In addition, unbalanced magnetic force (UMF) is calculated and it is mentioned that a steady torque is created by the forces. This study indicates that static eccentricity has noticeable effects on motor characteristics and can deteriorate the motor performances.

Inter-cluster distance in the feature space shows the degree the classes are separated. A larger inter-cluster distance value implies a pair of more separated classes. For each classifier, the optimal kernel parameter which results in the largest inter-cluster distance is found. Then, a new continuous search interval of kernel parameter which covers the optimal kernel parameter of each class pair is determined. Self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm is used to search the optimal parameter combination in the continuous intervals of kernel parameter and penalty parameter. At last, the proposed method is applied to several real word datasets as well as fault diagnosis for rolling element bearings. The results show that it is both effective and computationally efficient for parameter optimization of multi-class SVM. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Jaya, A; Tiong, UH; Clark, G				Jaya, A.; Tiong, U. H.; Clark, G.			The interaction between corrosion management and structural integrity of aging aircraft	FATIGUE & FRACTURE OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						aircraft joints; corrosion management; fatigue cracking; paint coating degradation	FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; ALUMINUM-ALLOY; BOLTED JOINTS; DEGRADATION; COATINGS; SEALANT	Aircraft joints feature prominently in aircraft structural degradation; fatigue cracking and corrosion damage are major issues, which can reduce joint strength and degrade service life. Protecting the structure against corrosion usually involves use of highly developed protective coatings paints and sealants and, increasingly, the application of corrosion inhibiting compounds (CICs) which retard corrosion principally by penetrating into crevices and cracks, and displacing water. A combination of coatings and CIC use can provide effective corrosion protection, but both interact in different ways with joint structural performance and overall system durability. This paper discusses the interaction between these two corrosion protection measures and fatigue performance of joints. The first issue relates to the extent to which application of CICs (or other lubricants) can cause a reduction in the fatigue life of mechanically fastened joints. The CICs are lubricants which will reduce the friction at the faying surface of the joint, and change the load transfer characteristics of the joint. This paper discusses results from a test program assessing the fatigue life and failure mode of simple riveted lap joints; the results show a distinct reduction in fatigue life for joints containing CICs, and the paper discusses the changes thought to be responsible for the reduction. The second issue discussed is the degradation of protective coatings in service. Joints are key locations for coating cracking and failure, because areas such as sheet ends and fastener heads, where displacements are concentrated, may produce concentrated strain in coatings. So far, however, the potential influence of aircraft loading on coating degradation prognostics has received little attention. This paper discusses the role of joint displacement in service as a factor contributing to degradation in aircraft coatings at joints, and argues that this local strain effect, and indeed structural loading history, needs to be considered in predicting and assessing rates of coating degradation. It describes analyses of displacements in aircraft joints, to identify the levels of strain and to identify the roles and relative contributions of the various deflections in the joints. The results indicate the potential for very large strains in coatings.	[Jaya, A.; Tiong, U.

J	Graney, BP; Starry, K				Graney, Brian P.; Starry, Ken			Rolling Element Bearing Analysis	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						fundamental bearing faults; high-frequency natural bearing resonance indicator; discrete frequency indicators; time-waveform analysis; fast fourier transform		All rotating machinery uses bearings to support the load and maintain the clearances between stationary and rotating machinery elements. More than 90% of these machines have rolling element bearings. Unfortunately, rolling element bearings are prone to a myriad of premature failures. A mere 10% of rolling element bearings reach their L10 life, the expected life of 90% of similar bearings under similar operating conditions. Early failures are attributed to lubrication, load and design/application errors, and even pre-existing problems that were not detected during manufacture. A comprehensive condition-based maintenance program incorporating preventative maintenance and predictive maintenance should be in place to detect the onset of wear and deterioration of rolling element bearings. A mature program provides not only indications of wear in the bearings, but also an evaluation of the severity and recommendations for when corrective actions should be taken. The purpose of this paper is to briefly discuss how the high-frequency natural bearing resonance indicator, discrete frequency indicators (acceleration), acceleration time-waveform characteristics, acceleration time-waveform crest factor, and the velocity amplitude of bearing fault frequencies associated with rolling element bearings can be integrated to determine bearing health and the risk of catastrophic failure.

In such environments, when applying ICMP connectivity checks and conventional fault detection methods such as IP-SLA, it takes time to recover from faults to allow for coordination between the core network and the user logical networks in the cloud. This paper proposes a method where a correspondence list of user logical networks and core networks is registered beforehand in a cloud management system. When a fault has occurred, the NIC of the virtual machine corresponding to the fault location is closed off, thereby resulting in a rapid switchover to a redundant configuration.

The objective is to bring new knowledge in manufacturing process control, by using dynamics signal processing and interdisciplinary knowledge in order to build, in the future, a predictive monitoring system for the machine tool. Machine vibration and noise component dominates the overall spectrum at a certain frequency, and so the overall level of vibration or noise is a useful parameter for early detection of faults. Three levels of maintenance program of machine tool were proposed. The experimentation has been validated by results based on measuring the vibration and noise signals of the milling spindle using module "tracking" of the Schenck equipment Vibroport 41.

It occurs when there are significantly fewer examples in one or more classes in a dataset compared to the number of instances in the remaining classes. When trained on highly imbalanced datasets, traditional machine learning techniques can often simply ignore the minority class(es) and label all instances as being of the majority class to maximize accuracy. This problem has been studied in many domains but there is little or no research related to the effect of class imbalance in fault data for condition monitoring of an ocean turbine. This study makes the first efforts in bridging that gap by providing insight into how class imbalance in vibration data can impact a learner's ability to reliably identify changes in the ocean turbine's operational state. To do so, we empirically evaluate the performances of three popular, but very different, machine learning algorithms when trained on four datasets with varying class distributions (one balanced and three imbalanced) to distinguish between a normal and an abnormal state. All data used in this study were collected from the testbed for an ocean turbine and were undersampled to simulate the different levels of imbalance. We find here, as in other domains, that the three learners seemed to suffer overall when trained on data with a highly skewed class distribution (with 0.1% examples in a faulty/abnormal state while the remaining 99.9% were captured in a normal operational state). It was noted, however, that the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers performed better when only 5% of the total number of examples were representative of an abnormal state (the remaining 95% therefore indicating normal operation) than they did when there was no imbalance present.

A process subject to an incipient fault experiments slowly developing degradation. Sensor measurements and Condition Monitoring (CM) data extracted from the system allow to follow up the process drift. The prognosis architecture we propose makes use of a dynamical clustering algorithm to model the data in a feature space. This algorithm uses a sliding window scheme on which the model is iteratively updated. Metrics applied on the parameters of this model are used to compute a drift severity indicator, which is also an indicator of the health of the system. The architecture for prognosis is applied on a benchmark of wind turbine. The used benchmark has been constructed to serve as a realistic wind turbine model. It was used in the context of a global scale fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control competition. The benchmark also proposed a drifting fault scenario that we used to test our approach.

In such complex system it is imperative to differentiate between a system failure and a sensor failure or between process noise and measurement noise. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach based on a hierarchical, multilevel control techniques. The approach is designed to provide sensor measurement validation, associates a degree of integrity with each measurement, identifies faulty sensors, and estimates the actual system states and sensor values in spite of faulty measurements. Using Virtual Machine Model concept, the method is achieved in three steps: state prediction, fault detection & sensor measurement and system online update or correction. A combination of flexible least square algorithm and adaptive Kalman filtering method are implemented to learn and predict system behavior. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithms can efficiently identify faulty components, reduce noise errors injected by sensors/system and thus providing self healing. The Virtual Machine Model (VMM) architecture described in this paper has proved to have several advantages over traditional models; the proposed model allows easy application provisioning, upgrades and maintenance; it provides fault tolerance, speedy disaster recovery and high availability platform.

A laboratory 2.8 kW line-start permanent magnet synchronous machine (LSPMSM) is used in the numerical investigations for initiating permanent magnet demagnetization and detecting the fault. Firstly, experiments were performed on the machine to determine it parameters and understand its steady-state and dynamic performance using a developed position sensor and an experimental setup. A mathematical model of the machine was then developed using the dq axis theory to analyze the behavior of the machine under healthy and demagnetization conditions. Later, an ANN based detection scheme is proposed and verified through numerical investigations. The results obtained from the investigations are thus analyzed.	[Lu, Xiaomin; Iyer, K.

By comparing the calculated results with the machine running under different fault level conditions, an effective method for stator inter-turn fault detection of the machine is proposed. Additionally, simulations of the machine upon the operation of vector-controlled PMSM drives verify the feasibility of the proposed method, which shows that even single-coil short circuits faults also could be exactly detected.

This paper introduces an upgrade of fundamental wave model approach by respecting both inherent and fault-induced deviations of machine flux from its fundamental component. A field-oriented control scheme for an asymmetric induction machine is presented. The algorithm is based on observing newly introduced flux-angle-based variations in the transient leakage inductance due to the asymmetry. A simple extension of the conventional rotor field-oriented control structure is proposed that takes into account detected variations and improves machine performance in the asymmetry conditions. Detection and characterization of newly formed modulation in transient leakage inductance are performed by employing an unscented Kalman filter. Simulation results for the case of a 5.5 kW induction machine are presented.

The broken bar classifier is implemented by support vector machine due to its good robustness and generalization performances. The proposed method is based on frequency and time domain analysis of one phase steady state and transient current signal, which is only physical value to be measured. Broken bar related features are extracted using Fourier transformation, Welch's PSD estimation and statistical parameters: variance, skewness and kurtosis. It is shown that proposed method successfully detects faulty condition in various operational situations and sub-nominal load conditions.

Fault diagnostics is crucial also for all the applications requiring a high degree of reliability, such as aerospace or marine applications. In this paper the behavior of multiphase induction machines with an odd number of phases is investigated when the stator winding is unbalanced owing to a fault or an incipient damage. A method to detect the stator resistance unbalance, to localize the faulty phase and, at the same time, keep the drive behavior unchanged is proposed. The theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the control scheme are confirmed by experimental tests.

These advantages are possible by the development of high-power transistors. On the other side these fast switching components lead to steep voltage rises and high stress on the winding insulation of the machine. Faults in the winding system of a machine can cause a dramatic damage due to their fast developing behaviour. An early detection of winding faults can reduce the consequences. In this paper a method is investigated to detect stator winding faults in their early stage. The method is based on voltage pulse excitation done by inverter switching. Current response measurements and subsequent signal processing lead to a fault indicator with high precision and low dependence on the machine point of operation. Measurements on a specially designed machine are carried out to determine the sensitivity of the fault indicator to early stage faults.	[Stojcic, G.; Stankovic, J.; Wolbank, T.

However, it is very challenging to identify the root cause of failures on a complex circuit board. Ambiguous diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increases the repair cost. We propose an automatic diagnostic system using support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed system acquires debug knowledge from empirical data; this strategy avoids the difficulties involved in knowledge acquisition in traditional fault diagnosis methods. SVMs provide an optimal separating hyper-plane in classification. The optimal solution and generalization ability of SVMs lead to higher diagnostic accuracy, compared to the classical learning approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). An industrial board is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the SVMs-based diagnostic system provides quantifiable improvement over current diagnostic software and an ANN-based diagnostic system.

In the proposed method, we select parzen window as the generative classifier and Gentleboost as the discriminative classifier. Compared with SVM, boosting method has a very interesting property of relative immunity to overfitting. In addition, we propose a novel adaptive parzen window algorithm. It employs variational adaptive parzen window rather than a global optimized and fixed window, therefore, more accurate density estimates can be obtained. In experiments, artificial and machine vibration data are used to compare with other algorithms. Our proposed algorithm achieves stronger robustness and lower classification error rate.

The aim is to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a resource (i.e. a component of the system) based on partial knowledge. In this paper the models describing the behavior of the resource are, and in order to be more realistic, stochastic. Hence, a probabilistic method based on Maximum Relative Entropy (MRE) approach is used. Based on partial knowledge, provided by expert, the MRE allows to update the probability distribution of the damage parameters. Finally, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, damage trajectory is constructed.

Though prognostics is one of the main parts of PHM, it is the least mature. This paper is based on the past work of data driven prognostics applied in the field of power electronics modules and primarily concerned with the data driven prognostics methods that take advantage of measured characteristics of individual systems or components in order to predict the remaining useful life (RUL).

Current state-of-the-art PV monitoring systems require module and array topology details or extensive modeling of the PV system. We present a method using an artificial neural network (ANN) which eliminates the need for a priori information by teaching the algorithm "good" performance behavior based on the initial performance of the array. The PHM algorithm was tested on two PV systems under test at the Outdoor Test Facility (OTF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The PHM algorithm was trained using two months of AC power production. The model then predicted the output power of the system using irradiance, wind, and temperature data. Based on the deviation in measured AC power from the AC power predicted by the trained ANN model, system outages and other faults causing a reduction in power were detected. Had these been commercial installations, rather than research installations, an alert for maintenance could have been initiated. Further use of the PHM system may be able to indicate degradation, detect module or inverter failures, or detect excessive soiling.

It is a task to predict the future health of systems, which has few researches so far. In this paper, a hybrid approach for failure prognostics is proposed. The approach combines least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) with hidden Markov model (HMM). Features extracted from sensor signals are used to train HMMs, which represent different health levels. LSSVR algorithm is used to predict feature trend. According to the probabilities of each HMM, it can determine the future health state and estimate the remaining useful life (RUL). To evaluate the proposed approach, test was carried out using bearing vibration signals. Simulation results show that the LSSVR-HMMs method is efficient in prognostics.

Firstly, the sampled data was denoised by morphological filter. Secondly, the denoised signal was transformed in frequency domain, and some frequency bands which could express the typical fault type were selected by harmonic window decomposition. Thirdly, the normalized energy distributions of these frequency bands were calculated. Different fault type corresponds with different normalized energy distribution. Finally, the grey relation between the symptom set and standard fault set was calculated as the identification evidence for fault diagnosis. The practical results show that this method is quite effective in rotor fault identification. It's suitable for on-line monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machinery.

The industry now-a-days are known for their high speed manufacturing processes. A delayed downtime may cost a company millions. Similarly an inaccurate operation of certain machinery parts of a packaging machine may cost highly. Therefore, the quickest possible method to resolve a fault or even tuning is most advisable. This is where a high speed camera system comes into use. High speed imaging is a technique used for specific motion analysis and troubleshooting purposes. This may include applications in fast operating industry machinery, crash impact testing for automobiles and so on. It is when photography is conducted in a very high rate ranging from 250 frames per second and higher. This may range up to as high as several thousand frames per second depending on the application and budget. For example, if a motion sequence at 600 frames per second is captured and played back at 30 frames per second, a smooth continuous motion or a frame by frame playback of that event can be viewed. It can be studied for improvement, tuning or solving a malfunction which cannot be done with the naked human eye or standard video framing (approximately 25-30 fps). Availability of such a tool can greatly reduce machinery downtime in a fast moving packaging system. This paper will talk about troubleshooting a problem of a certain cam profile between two screw conveyors in series. The two screw conveyors are required to function in a certain cam profile which will transfer a fixed number of bottles to the next machine in a process. This transfer process often works properly at low speed (e.g. ten containers per minute) but at high speed (e.g. 300 containers per minute) its functionality deviates from the desired pattern. In such a case, to observe and analyze the problem, a high speed imaging tool reduces troubleshooting time significantly. Such problems between two servomotors can be found in machines such as orienters, transfer screw conveyors, stackers, palletizers, high speed cutter and so on.

In the first part, we develop a tractable approach to design a robust residual generator to detect and isolate faults in high dimensional nonlinear systems. Previous approaches on fault detection and isolation problems are either confined to linear systems or they are only applicable to low dimensional dynamics with more specific structures. In contrast, we propose a novel methodology to robustify a linear residual generator for a nonlinear system in the presence of certain disturbance signatures. To this end, we formulate the problem into the framework of quadratic programming which enables us to solve relatively high dimensional systems. In the second part, the application is motivated by the emerging problem of cyber security in power networks. We provide description of a multi-machine power system that represents a two-area power system, and we model a cyber-physical attack emanating from the vulnerabilities introduced by the interaction between IT infrastructure and power system. The algorithm developed in the first part is finally used to diagnose such an intrusion before the functionality of the power system is disrupted.	[Esfahani, P.

However, their widespread application in commercial areas is hampered by the relatively poor reliability performance during long-term usage. Among the failure mechanisms of RF MEMS, stiction induced by the charge accumulation in the dielectric layer is the predominant one, accounting for most of the failed components. However, the origin of the accumulated charge, its properties and distribution, and its adverse effect on devices' electrical performance has not yet been fully understood. In this paper, we propose the design, realization, characterization, and reliability test of a novel RF MEMS capacitive switch which has a high RF performance and low fabrication cost with a capability of predicting its state of health for various applications from phase shifters to tunable antennas. The key characteristic of our design is the introduction of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) using non-intrusive monitoring method, which allows us to calculate the remaining useful life of our RF MEMS capacitive switches and provide a warning before its onset of failure. We overstress the device using two methods: electrostatic discharge (ESD) and operational voltage waveform. We discovered the difference of RF MEMS behavior and lifetime. We also present the effect of driving voltage polarity on the lifetime of RF MEMS.

Model-based prognosis is generally divided into two sequential problems: a joint state-parameter estimation problem, in which, using the model, the health of a system or component is determined based on the observations; and a prediction problem, in which, using the model, the state-parameter distribution is simulated forward in time to compute end of life and remaining useful life. The first problem is typically solved through the use of a state observer, or filter. The choice of filter depends on the assumptions that may be made about the system, and on the desired algorithm performance. In this paper, we review three separate filters for the solution to the first problem: the Daum filter, an exact nonlinear filter; the unscented Kalman filter, which approximates nonlinearities through the use of a deterministic sampling method known as the unscented transform; and the particle filter, which approximates the state distribution using a finite set of discrete, weighted samples, called particles. Using a centrifugal pump as a case study, we conduct a number of simulation-based experiments investigating the performance of the different algorithms as applied to prognostics.

C	Popov, A			IEEE	Popov, Alexandre			System Health Management and Space Medicine Predictive Diagnostics. Common Concepts and Approaches	2012 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2012	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, Phmsoc, AESS			DISORDERS; ANXIETY	Mission design for future human exploration spaceflight (moon, asteroids and Mars), with their inherent risks and communications delays, requires a shift in space medicine from a telemedicine paradigm to that of medical autonomy. With the absence of real-time medical ground support, clinical decision support technologies for health monitoring and diagnostics may be required to assist the onboard Crew Medical Officer (CMO). This paper introduces a predictive diagnostics concept for space medicine based on an approach which could be common for both biological and technical systems. In discussing the similarities and differences between the two domains, the paper explores potential solutions applicable for health risk assessment and management. Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) and associated challenges can be represented in different terms. The engineering discipline focuses on the fundamental principles of system failures in attempt to predict when they might fail, and links the principles to system life cycle management. This is referred to as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). Since PHM is a maturing discipline the scientific method that underlines all scientific disciplines has not made its way into PHM research [1]. It must be noted also that there is no general agreement in the research community with respect to the PHM terminology (for example, component aging). [1, 2] Like PHM, predictive diagnostics in conventional medicine is in its infant state due to the lack of scientific foundation on disease prediction. Despite of the infancy stage both of the disciplines have much in common. For both, it is important to know what factors determine the occurrence of the failure (disease). In predictive diagnostics, identification of negative trends with particular failure precursors followed by predicting the future health condition (if no preventive measures are taken) is a challenging task. While prognostics is an engineering discipline focused on predicting the time at which a system or a component will no longer perform its intended function [3], predictive diagnostics is built on the powerful foundation of predictive analytics. Unlike prognostics, predictive analytics in space medicine would need to take into account the essential element - the uniqueness of each crew member. It requires the development of a "set of fingerprints" for each individual that would include information on medical history with the individual health baseline, genetic pre-disposition, medical events, operational context, etc. Whereas predictive analytics indicates what is going to fail, predictive diagnostics also indicates both root and contributing causes of, or factors leading to the potential failure, as well as a priority of the impending failure. However, like PHM, the predictive analytics is based on health maintenance, eliminating the "surprise" factor. The paper introduces a concept for space medicine predictive diagnostics based on real-time health monitoring. To leverage the strength from both data-driven and model-based approaches, a hybrid approach was taken. The concept includes a module-based architecture consisting of a space medicine domain knowledgebase, a customizable inference engine supported by a number of "plug-in-play" voting inference sub-engines, and a web-based interface.

This paper presents a novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using Deep Belief Networks (DBN). The DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using the DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing the sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for the diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. The performance of health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification is compared with support vector machine technique and demonstrated with aircraft wing structure health diagnostics and aircraft engine health diagnosis using 2008 PHM challenge data.

The core of TTEthernet is a set of fault-tolerant protocols for clock synchronization, startup, and clique detection and resolution. We present recent work on model-based analysis of the TTEthernet startup and synchronization protocols. We first use automated test-generation tools to drive high-coverage testing of prototype TTEthernet hardware, based on a state-machine model of the TTEthernet protocols. With almost no human guidance, this technique enables us to achieve MC/DC coverage of the startup protocol under valid fault scenarios. We then focus on the TTEthernet clock-synchronization protocol. We develop correctness proofs of key properties of this protocol using the PVS interactive theorem prover [1]. As a result of this formalization, we have identified a suboptimal design choice in the clock-compression function defined in the TTEthernet draft standard [2]. We propose an alternative definition and, using model-checking tools, we show that the new function achieves better clock precision than the original. These results demonstrate effective use of modeling and formal techniques in proof and test of a fault-tolerant network infrastructure relevant to avionics and other embedded systems.

In this work, we extend the AI-ESTATE Common Element Model to provide "soft outcomes" on tests and diagnoses. We then demonstrate how to use these soft outcomes with the AI-ESTATE Fault Tree Model to implement a "fuzzy" fault tree. The resulting model then enables isolating faults within a system such that levels of degradation can also be tracked. In this paper, we describe the proposed extensions to AI-ESTATE as well as how those extensions work to implement a fuzzy fault tree using the demonstration circuit from previous Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML) demonstrations.

Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Techniques Using Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) Measurements to Detect Degradation in Electronic Equipment	2012 IEEE AUTOTESTCON PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Autotestcon Conference	SEP 10-13, 2012	Anaheim, CA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, AESS, Disneyland, IEEE Aerosp & Electr Syst Soc		electromagnetic interference; EMI; diagnosis; prognosis; frequency measurements; component degradation; corrosion; fault isolation		Electronic equipment are subject to degradation and failure as a result of aging and corrosion. Diagnosing to the culprit component, however, is usually not obvious. Some strategic and novel electromagnetic interference (EMI) measurements can be utilized to detect and diagnose failures or degradations. Measuring and monitoring the EMI characteristics of a Unit Under Test (UUT) indicates that the circuit is experiencing an anomaly. The approach is ubiquitous, but in this paper we will focus our discussion to power supplies. Within a power supply, the Fourier series of a full wave rectifier contains only even harmonics of the input waveform. If one of the diodes is degraded or has failed, the output spectral component at the input signal frequency and the odd harmonics of the input will not be zero. An odd harmonic of the input signal frequency will provide an indication of degradation or failure of one of the diodes in the bridge. We present potential measuring and monitoring equipment that can provide in situ non-intrusive prognostic and diagnostic results in operational circuits. The EMI signatures will help pinpoint the culprit component, and repair decisions can be made before the unit is removed from its environment, resulting in substantial savings in support costs.

As a result, investigation of precursors to failure in electronics and prediction of remaining life of electronic components is of key importance. DC-DC power converters are power electronics systems employed typically as sourcing elements for avionics equipment. Current research efforts in prognostics for these power systems focuses on the identification of failure mechanisms and the development of accelerated aging methodologies and systems to accelerate the aging process of test devices, while continuously measuring key electrical and thermal parameters. Preliminary model-based prognostics algorithms have been developed making use of empirical degradation models and physics-inspired degradation model with focus on key components like electrolytic capacitors and power MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor). This paper presents current results on the development of validation methods for prognostics algorithms of power electrolytic capacitors. Particularly, in the use of accelerated aging systems for algorithm validation. Validation of prognostics algorithms present difficulties in practice due to the lack of run-to-failure experiments in deployed systems. By using accelerated experiments, we circumvent this problem in order to define initial validation activities.

Electrolytic capacitors have higher failure rates than other components in electronic systems like power drives, power converters etc. Our current work focuses on developing first-principles-based degradation models for electrolytic capacitors under varying electrical and thermal stress conditions. Prognostics and health management for electronic systems aims to predict the onset of faults, study causes for system degradation, and accurately compute remaining useful life. Accelerated life test methods are often used in prognostics research as a way to model multiple causes and assess the effects of the degradation process through time. It also allows for the identification and study of different failure mechanisms and their relationships under different operating conditions. Experiments are designed for aging of the capacitors such that the degradation pattern induced by the aging can be monitored and analyzed. Experimental setups and data collection methods are presented to demonstrate this approach.

However, this technique may fail in the case of outer cage damage of double cage induction motors, due to the small current circulation in the rated operating conditions. The situation is more complicated under time-varying conditions, where the typical Rotor Fault Frequency Components (RFFCs), which appear in the phase current spectrum of faulty motors, are spread in a bandwidth proportional to the speed variation and are difficult to detect accurately. A new diagnosis method based on the combined use of Double-Frequency Sliding (DFS) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is proposed here for the analysis of the stator phase current. A experimental study on a copper-made double cage separate end ring rotor shows the validity of the proposed approach, leading to an effective diagnosis procedure for fault detection in double cage motors under time-varying conditions.

Dynamic Modeling of Double Cage Induction Machines for Diagnosis of Rotor Faults	2012 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 15-20, 2012	Raleigh, NC	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc			MOTORS	Double cage induction motors are typically employed in applications that require high starting torque for frequent, loaded starts. This makes the starting (outer) cage susceptible to fatigue failure since it must withstand the large thermo-mechanical stress associated with the high starting current and long acceleration time. Conventional FFT-based spectrum analysis techniques are insensitive to outer cage faults due to the small outer cage current under steady state operation, and the fault indicators and thresholds applied to single cage rotors cannot be used. Therefore, there is a strong industrial need for research and development of analysis techniques and advanced fault detection algorithms for double cage machines. However, there are only a few publications that investigate double cage rotor faults. In this paper, a dynamic model for rotor cage faults in double cage motors, which is the first step towards double cage rotor fault research, is derived. A 7.5 Hp separate end ring fabricated copper double cage rotor is built for experimental verification of the proposed fault model (copper inner cage/brass outer cage). The tests performed under startup and steady state operation show that the proposed fault model can provide sufficient accuracy and can be used as the basis for interpretation of FFT results and development of advanced fault detection algorithms.

However, there are many limitations to applying existing test methods such as motor current signature analysis (MCSA) in the field, especially for variable frequency applications. In this paper, a new inverter-embedded test approach for detecting eccentricity for induction motors is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to perform a standstill test whenever the motor is stopped, to extract information on motor eccentricity. The motor is excited with a low frequency pulsating ac field superimposed on different levels of dc fields, and the variation in the differential inductance pattern due to the change in the degree of magnetic saturation caused by eccentricity is observed.

In effect, they regulate expression of a gene or protein. It has been observed that they play an important role in various cellular processes and thus help in carrying out normal functioning of a cell. However, dysregulation of miRNAs is found to be a major cause of a disease. Various studies have also shown the role of miRNAs in cancer and utility of miRNAs for the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. A large number of works have been conducted to identify differentially expressed miRNAs as unlike with mRNA expression, a modest number of miRNAs might be sufficient to classify human cancers. In this regard, this paper presents a rough set based feature selection algorithm to select miRNAs from expression data that can classify tissue samples into their respective category with minimal error rate. It selects a set of miRNAs by maximizing both the relevance and significance of miRNAs. The effectiveness of the rough set based algorithm, along with a comparison with other related algorithms, is demonstrated on three miRNA microarray expression data sets using the B.632+ bootstrap error rate of support vector machine.

The method is illustrated using public data for predicting Li-ion battery RUL to end-of-life (EOL). A battery life prediction is obtained using the capacity values up to the prediction time. The root mean squared error (RMSE) is used for performance evaluation. The predictions over time are compared with the actual time to EOL for each test battery and the RUL is calculated at four time intervals. The prediction performance of the NBC is compared with that of a support vector machine (SVM). The case study shows that the NBC generates competitive prediction performance, even though other factors contributing to Li-ion battery degradation are concealed. This method is also applicable to predicting RUL to end-of-discharge (EOD) and the failure prognostics for other components.	[Ng, S. Y. S.; Tsui, K.

Survival estimation for many cancers is based on Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging systems that involve three factors: tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. The most recent clinical staging of melanoma uses TNM staging but does not include a growing number of other prognostic features. The Ensemble Algorithm of Clustering of Cancer Data (EACCD) by Chen et al. is a machine learning algorithm that regroups patients with different prognostic factors according to the survival dissimilarity. This algorithm has the potential to integrate emerging prognostic factors to more accurately stage melanoma. In this study, we use EACCD to examine the current AJCC staging of melanoma by analyzing a melanoma dataset from the National Cancer Centers Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Rresults (SEER) database. Our results demonstrates that the EACCD algorithm generates results in-line with AJCC staging and may provide a mechanism to incorporate other prognostic factors to produce a more nuanced estimation of prognosis and survival.

It may cause unnecessary losses if the bearing faults are not noticed in time. A method using wavelet neural network to diagnose the rolling bearing failure by the non-stationary of the rolling bearing signals is introduced in the paper. The feature vectors required for the training and testing of neural network are calculated by the implementation of a wavelet packet. Back-Propagation neural network is used for faults classifications. The results show that the wavelet neural network identified the fault categories of rolling element bearing accurately and has a good diagnosis performance.

It is of great significance to study the fault diagnosis method for aircraft health management. This paper introduces a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach to build an observer on Hydraulic servo system and obtain the fault diagnosis results by identifying of the residuals. A support vector observer estimates the output of the system. By comparing with system output, the residual is generated and then clustered by a support vector classifier for fault detection. Finally we use MATLAB/Simulink to establish fault diagnosis model and verify the correctness of this method.

Firstly, the definition of grey relation degree was introduced. Secondly, on the base of analyzing the defects existed in the grey relation degree, the definition of grey similar relation degree was introduced. Thirdly, the symptom set and standard fault set had been established based on the known knowledge, experience and fault examples. Finally, the grey similar relation degree was used to describe the similarity between the faults and symptoms. Even the fault information was imperfect and the fault mechanism was not clear, the results of diagnosis would be more correct than before. The practical results show that this approach is quite efficient and intelligent. It's suitable for on-line monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machinery.

A product without quality leads to loss and lack of customer satisfaction. This is true in case of textile industries also. Textile manufacturing is a process of converting various types of fibers into yarn, which in turn woven into fabric. Weaving process is used to produce the fabric or cloth by interlacing two distinct set of yarn threads namely warp and weft yarn. In textile industries, quality inspection is one of the major problems for fabric manufacturers. At present, the fault detection is done manually after production of a sufficient amount of fabric. The fabric obtained from the production machine are batched into larger rolls and subjected to the inspection frame. The nature of the work is very dull and repetitive. Due to manual inspection of the manufactured fabric, there is a possibility of human errors with high inspection time, hence it is uneconomical. This paper proposed a PC-based inspection system with benefits of low cost and high detection rate. Both normal and faulty images are processed and features are extracted by using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and classification is done using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). Proposed scheme performs 36.66% better than the existing microcontroller based classification system.	[Venkatesan, B.; Ragupathy, U.

This paper looks at automatically detecting three different walking conditions (walking normally with preferred walking speed (PWS), walking while carrying a glass of water, and walking blind folded) using inertial sensor data. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes were used to acquire movement data from both feet during the three gait tasks. Five healthy young subjects undertook 10 trials per condition on a GAITRite mat. Statistical properties such as the mean, standard deviation (std), skewness (skew) and kurtosis were calculated for each trial that included several gait cycles' data. Altogether 48 features were analyzed using Fuzzy Clustering Mean (FCM) algorithm to verify the separable nature of sensor data. The results show that three clusters could be found with an almost equal number of points; however the membership was not high enough to result in complete discrete clusters. Then three different Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were used to examine whether the conditions could be automatically classified based on the features that were extracted from inertial sensor data. The results indicate 83-84% of accurate classification of the three gait conditions with three SVM algorithms. The study demonstrates that the inertial sensor data could be used to classify differences in walking conditions using powerful computational intelligence techniques.

Results on thermal overstress and electrical overstress experiments are presented. In addition, preliminary results toward the development of physics-based degradation models are presented focusing on the electrolyte evaporation failure mechanism. An empirical degradation model based on percentage capacitance loss under electrical overstress is presented and used in: (i) a Bayesian-based implementation of model-based prognostics using a discrete Kalman filter for health state estimation, and (ii) a dynamic system representation of the degradation model for forecasting and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. A leave-one-out validation methodology is used to assess the validity of the methodology under the small sample size constrain. The results observed on the RUL estimation are consistent through the validation tests comparing relative accuracy and prediction error. It has been observed that the inaccuracy of the model to represent the change in degradation behavior observed at the end of the test data is consistent throughout the validation tests, indicating the need of a more detailed degradation model or the use of an algorithm that could estimate model parameters on-line. Based on the observed degradation process under different stress intensity with rest periods, the need for more sophisticated degradation models is further supported. The current degradation model does not represent the capacitance recovery over rest periods following an accelerated aging stress period.

Use of Infrared thermography for computation of heating curves and preliminary failure detection in induction motors	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		Infrared thermography; thermal analysis; induction motors; fault diagnosis; startup transient; broken rotor bars		This paper proposes a methodology for the computation of the energy balance and heating curves of an induction motor taking as a basis the information provided by the application of the infrared thermography. Moreover, use of infrared thermography data to diagnose rotor bar failures is preliminarily studied. In the paper, a 1.1 kW induction motor is tested. Thermography images of the chassis temperature are captured at each second during the whole startup transient, from standstill till steady-state, by using an infrared camera connected to a laptop computer fitted with an acquisition and analysis program. A model based on the calculation of the heat losses by convection and radiation through the frame of the machine is developed. It uses the geometrical dimensions as well as temperature values obtained from the thermography images. The developed model enables studying any motor configuration and operating conditions by just varying thermal and geometry parameters. Finally, a preliminary study relying on the possible use of Thermography data for diagnosis of rotor failures is carried out. Experimental data corresponding to a healthy machine and a machine with broken bars are analysed and compared. This methodology will be the baseline for further complex failure diagnosis in electric motors.	[Picazo-Rodenas, M.

The vibration analysis has been commonly used as an effective tool for gear fault diagnosis in several researches. Other alternatives, such as stator current analysis or acoustic pressure analysis which are known as non-invasive methods have received great attention over the years. The effect of gearbox torsional vibration in the stator current has been recently studied based on real frequency components observation in the mechanical torque. A possible monitoring of gearbox-based electromechanical system through the stator current analysis has been investigated as well. This paper aims to provide a comparative study of vibration, acoustic pressure and stator current analysis capabilities for a gear tooth wear fault diagnosis. A test-rig based on a 250W squirrel-cage induction machine shaft-connected to a single-stage gearbox has been used for this purpose.

The contribution is based on a multi-stage artificial neural network which has been shown to be more efficient than a single network due to the problem complexity. This new method is based on the time-domain analysis of digital data directly coming from sensors without any computation but with a dedicated pre-processing process for data and a post-processing technique for both faults detection and localization. After, its presentation the proposed technique has been applied to a wound rotor induction generator for which sixteen non-destructive windings faults have been analyzed. This new technique has been tested on real data showing clearly its efficiency in term of training time and of errors compared to already proposed techniques.

The main idea of the method is to compute the residual current estimates of the fault specific frequency components and eliminate them from the current spectrum of the motor. Such a method has many advantages in addition to load independent detection such as low cost, high sensitivity to detect low level eccentricity faults, minimal hardware requirement etc. Also the scheme is non-invasive in nature and can be employed for online detection. For the first time both stator line current and field current of the synchronous machine have been used independently to diagnose eccentricity. Experiments conducted on a 3 hp salient pole synchronous motor have been used to validate the proposed technique.

The analysis is focused on the external magnetic field, especially its transverse component. A specific signature is highlighted and explained by an analytical model. The proposed method is reliable, original, inexpensive and simple to implement. It has the advantage to be noninvasive and eliminate the main drawback presented by other diagnostic methods which use the comparison with a healthy state assumed known. Experimental tests are performed on a special rewound induction machine in order to validate the theoretical approach.

One of the stator currents has been used in the investigating of effects of rotor faults on the current envelopes. Fluctuations of the envelope were used as features of faults conditions for diagnosis. For feature extraction, frequency spectrum of the envelope of current was obtained by fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Significant picks in the spectrum were used to discern "healthy" and "faulty" motor conditions. The motor conditions were classified by Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In experiments three different rotor faults and healthy motor conditions were investigated by 30 HP, 8 '', with 18 bars, 380V, 2 poles and 50 Hz squirrel cage submersible induction motor. The proposed decision structure detects and classifies rotor bar faults with 100% accuracy.

It is shown that under these conditions, the Instantaneous Frequency plots of the fault components versus the slip are straight lines with a specific slope and offset for each kind of fault. In addition, neither of these patterns are dependent on the machine features, nor the way in which the load changes. Besides, the practical methodology of this technique is introduced for diagnosing two different kinds of fault: stator winding asymmetry and rotor winding asymmetry. The approach is validated by laboratory tests, for both types of faults.

Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Induction Motors Based on Hidden Markov Model	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		fault detection; fault diagnosis; Induction Motor; Hidden Markov Model; squirrel cage motors; pattern recognition; feature extraction; motor-current signal analysis	TRANSFORM	Accurate fault detection and diagnosis in complex systems is necessary for economic and security reasons. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fault detection and diagnosis based on Hidden Markov Models. This approach uses pattern recognition combining motor current signature analysis and multiple features extracted from transformations made on current and voltage signals in order to build the representation space. If the representation space is well chosen, each operating mode can be represented as a class. A hidden Markov model is then designed for each class and used as classifier for the detection and diagnosis of faults. The proposed approach is tested on an induction motor of 5.5 Kw with bearing failures and broken rotor bars. Further, the effectiveness of this approach is compared with a neural-network-based approach. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the hidden Markov model-based approach in condition monitoring of electrical machines.

Understanding the significance and prospects of self-excited induction generators (SEIGs) in distributed wind power generation, this paper presents an exclusive study of fault and a artificial neural network (ANN) based technique for its detection across the stator terminals of the SEIG. Firstly, two-axis model of a 7.5 hp industrial copper-rotor SEIG is developed to perform numerical investigations under static loading conditions, faulty conditions and hence derive data for designing the ANN based detection scheme. Fault tolerant capability of the machine is experimentally elicited by applying a short-circuit fault across the terminals of the machine and the need for fault detection in the SEIG system is discussed. Lastly, a novel ANN based scheme is developed for fault detection and numerical investigations are performed to illustrate the performance of the developed scheme. This paper aims to provide a good study to understand and develop a ANN based device for fault detection in a SEIG system.	[Iyer, K.

Inter-turn Short-circuit Analysis in an Induction Machine by Finite Elements Method and Field Tests	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		Finite elements method; Induction machine; Inter-turn short-circuit; Inverse sequence impedance; Park's Vector approach	WINDING FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; STATOR; MOTORS	Modern industry requires reliability in the continuous operation of the electric motors which requires the use of predictive maintenance techniques. Present commonly used techniques consist in offline test that involves stopping the electrical motor and taking measurements to detect faults [1] [2] [3]. The fault detection methods are based on symptoms generated from the fault condition, and these symptoms are evaluated by testing offline or through signals obtained from the machine [3] [4]. The finite element method FEM has proved to be a valuable tool in determining the presence of failure symptoms and the establishment of its severity levels, obviating the need for laboratory tests that are often harmful for the same machine [5][6]. The negative sequence parameters analysis and the Extended Park Vector Approach, with the evolution of short-circuit turns of the stator phase winding in a 3HP induction machine was done in this paper by using field tests and FEM computer simulations.				dariodiazs@gmail.com; martha.amaya@univalle.edu.co; apaz@javerianacali.edu.co					[Anonymous], 1995, 1159 IEEE; Bakhri S, 2010, AUSTR U POW ENG C AU, P1; Cabanas M.

Planetary Gearbox Effects on Induction Machine in Wind Turbine: Modeling and Analysis	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		Condition monitoring; electrical signature analysis; wound rotor induction machine; machine current signature analysis; modeling; planetary gearbox; wind turbine	TORSIONAL VIBRATION; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS	Wind energy's contribution to electricity supply is significantly increasing. As a result, reliability of the wind turbine becomes crucial. Gearbox is known as one of the most critical subassemblies of the wind turbine in which failures could lead to a long-term and high cost downtime. Recently, electrical signature analysis has been considered as an alternative for vibration monitoring in order to detect both electrical and mechanical faults in a cheap, easy to install and accessible way. This paper aims to monitor the planetary gearbox effect of a wind turbine on the wound rotor induction generator using electrical signature. For that, dynamic model of a single stage planetary gearbox have been implemented. The proposed model includes essential non-linearities such as time varying mesh stiffness, transmission error and damping force. Simulation results clearly show that electromagnetic torque and stator current of generator contain mesh and rotating related frequencies of the gears in its spectra.

The calculations indicate that fault specific changes exist in the machine torque and therefore the vibration signal. Model predictions are validated by torque and vibration signals measurements on a commercial 30kW machine. The paper establishes closed form expressions that enable the evaluation of torque and vibration signals spectral frequencies and linking these to healthy and faulty operating conditions.

A Voltage-Based Approach for Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis in Voltage-Fed SVM Motor Drives Without Extra Hardware	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		Condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; power switch open-circuit faults; pulse width modulation inverters; semiconductor device reliability	OPEN-SWITCH FAULTS; POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS; PWM INVERTER; RELIABILITY; SYSTEMS; VECTOR; MODEL	The widespread use of electric drives has led to an increasing interest in their condition monitoring and fault diagnostics. Regarding power switch open-circuit fault diagnosis, the proposed voltage-based approaches require additional hardware, increasing the system cost. Thus, the industry acceptance may be low. Therefore, this paper proposes a new voltage-based approach for open-circuit faults diagnosis in voltage source inverters with space vector modulation (SVM) feeding permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) without additional sensors, by employing a flux observer based on the machine current model, which allows to estimate the motor terminal voltages. The diagnostic method uses the average values of the errors between the reference and the estimated voltages. Its implementation in a direct torque controlled (DTC) PMSM drive implies a minimum additional computational effort, because the flux observer is usually already available.

Analysis of Demagnetization Faults in Surface-Mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous with Inter-turns and Phase-to-Ground Short-Circuits	2012 XXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 02-05, 2012	Marseille, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE France Sect, Inst Engn & Technol		Permanent magnet synchronous machines; demagnetization; short-circuit; finite elements analysis; simulation; fault diagnosis	MOTOR	Demagnetization faults are troublesome in permanent magnet synchronous motors since they may greatly reduce their performance and efficiency. Additionally, the temperature of the magnets deeply influences the remanent flux density. Hence, the temperature may have a demagnetization effect on the magnets. This work studies the behavior of a surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor running under inter-turn and phase-to-ground short-circuits faults. Concretely, the temperature increase of such faults and a potential reversible or irreversible demagnetization of the rotor magnets are analyzed. The analysis is based on 2D FEM simulations which includes rotor magnet skew. The simulations conducted in this work clearly show that inter-turn faults do not lead to irreversible demagnetization. However, in case of a phase-to-ground short-circuit an irreversible demagnetization may take place instantaneously.

In this context, diagnosing the magnets status of the motor is crucial for improving its reliability. This paper presents a new characterization of rotor faults for such a motor due to local and uniform demagnetization by means of two dimensional (2-D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and proposes a new non-invasive method for their detection by means of advanced Wavelet Transform (WT) of the back-EMF. Moreover, a cyclic quantification of the fault extent over time was introduced for accurate rotor fault detection.

Thus, a reliable bearing condition monitoring scheme able to detect either local or distributed defects are mandatory to avoid a breakdown in the machine. So far, the research has been carried out mainly in the detection of local faults, such as balls and raceways faults, but surface roughness is not so reported. This paper deals with a novel and reliable scheme capable to detect any fault that may occur in a bearing, based on EXIN Curvilinear Component Analysis, CCA, and Neural Network. The EXIN CCA, which is an improvement of the Curvilinear Component Analysis, has been conceived for data visualization, interpretation and classification for real time industrial applications. The effectiveness of this condition monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from different operation conditions.	[Delgado, M.; Garcia, A.; Ortega, J.

A controlled laboratory experiment has been performed in which a great deal of tests was carried out progressively drilling a hole in one of the rotor bars of an induction motor.

The devices are usually operated near or at the rated vales. Additionally high dynamic operations, overload cycles and the fast switching inverter are putting additional stress to all machines components. The stator winding system is one of the most critical components. Faults in the winding system of a machine can cause a dramatic damage due to their fast developing behavior. An early detection of winding faults can reduce these consequences. In this paper a method is presented to achieve reliable fault detection on stator winding faults focused on application at higher speed levels where immediate detection is imperative. Higher inverter modulation indexes provide the possibility to estimate the transient leakage inductance in each PWM modulation cycle. This parameter contains the information on machine asymmetries. Specific signal processing steps provide a high sensitive fault indicator.	[Stojcic, G.; Wolbank, T.

Rotor faults create asymmetries that affect the phase currents in a subtle yet distinctive way. The approach presented here is based on the application of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to the measured start-up current for the extraction of a specific complex Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF). The characteristics of this particular IMF are quite distinct for the case of an asynchronous machine with rotor asymmetry and can be used to discriminate between faulty and healthy machines. This task of fault diagnosis is performed via the use of two Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which are well known for their temporal pattern recognition capabilities. Simulation and experimental data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for the detection of rotor asymmetries.

Novel time-frequency techniques have been applied to these transient quantities, in order to detect the characteristic evolutions of fault-related harmonic components. The detection of these patterns, which are usually specific for each type of fault, enables reliable diagnostic of the corresponding failures. In this context, most of the works hitherto developed have been based on analysis of currents. However, in some applications vibration measurements are also available. The goal of this work is to validate the applicability of this transient-based diagnosis framework to vibration measurements. A specific time-frequency decomposition tool, the Wigner-Ville Distribution, is proposed. Experimental results prove the ability of the approach to complement the information obtained from the current analysis.

This paper proposed to develop a magnetic coupling non-contact machinery vibration detection sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The magnetic coupling technology and elastic diaphragm are adopted to achieve the vibration detection by changing the axial strain of optical fiber. Theoretical analysis and static experiment show that the function of output wavelength and the measured spacing is exponential decrease. Dynamic vibration measurement shows that the proposed FBG diaphragm accelerometer provides a wide frequency response range (0-90Hz), identifying it as a good candidate for machinery health monitoring.

Now, a unified monitoring methodology has been developed that embodies a symbiotic integration of heretofore separate EP and SAR to achieve proactive fault monitoring of integrated h/w-s/w systems and appliances. The key enabler for achieving integrated EP-SAR functionality is Oracle's continuous system telemetry harness (CSTH), which collects time series signals relating to the health of dynamically executing enterprise systems. These time series provide quantitative metrics associated with physical variables (distributed temperatures, voltages, currents, fan RPMs, vibration levels); performance variables (CPU and memory loads, throughputs, queue lengths, etc.), and various quality-of-service (QOS) metrics that now include vibration-driven IO throughput latencies in systems with spinning disk drives.										0	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1071-9458		978-0-7695-4928-6; 978-1-4673-5048-8	PROC INT SYMP SOFTW			2012							245	245					1	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BET66	WOS:000318043300056					2022-02-14

Electrical Motor Current Signal Analysis using a Modulation Signal Bispectrum for the Fault Diagnosis of a Gearbox Downstream	25TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC ENGINEERING (COMADEM 2012)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Congress on Condition Monitoring and Diagnostic Engineering (COMADEM)	JUN 18-20, 2012	Huddersfield, ENGLAND			Gearbox; Motor current signature analysis; Modulation signal bispectrum		Motor current signal analysis has been an effective way for many years of monitoring electrical machines themselves. However, little work has been carried out in using this technique for monitoring their downstream equipment because of difficulties in extracting small fault components in the measured current signals. This paper investigates the characteristics of electrical current signals for monitoring the faults from a downstream gearbox using a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB), including phase effects in extracting small modulating components in a noisy measurement. An analytical study is firstly performed to understand amplitude, frequency and phase characteristics of current signals due to faults. It then explores the performance of MSB analysis in detecting weak modulating components in current signals. Experimental study based on a 10kw two stage gearbox, driven by a three phase induction motor, shows that MSB peaks at different rotational frequencies can be based to quantify the severity of gear tooth breakage and the degrees of shaft misalignment. In addition, the type and location of a fault can be recognized based on the frequency at which the change of MSB peak is the highest among different frequencies.	[Haram, M.; Gu, F.; Ball, A.

It is suitable for monitoring the health of mechanical systems where it usually is impossible to know every potential fault. In this paper, two novelty detectors are presented. The first detector which integrates One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with an incremental clustering algorithm is designed for health monitoring of the turbopump, while the second one which is trained on sensor fault samples is designed to recognize faults from sensors and faults actually from the turbopump. Analysis results showed that these two detectors are both sensitive and efficient for the health monitoring of the turbopump.

When a bistable system maintains the state of stochastic resonance (SR), the output of system is chaotic, and the most effective spectral shape is obtained when the output power is distributed closet to the frequency of the Melnikov scale's peak. In classical SR, improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved by increasing the noise intensity, but this approach may be unwieldy. Instead of it in this paper, the more effective SNR enhancement is achieved by adding a harmonic excitation with frequency based on the system's Melnikov scale factor to the system while the noise is left unchanged. The effectiveness of this method is confirmed and replicated by numerical simulations. Combined with the strategy of scale transform, the method cab be used to detect weak periodic signal with arbitrary frequency buried in the heavy noise. At last, the method for enhancement detection of machinery fault characteristic signal is discussed via a case data.

Unfortunately, current predictive maintenance solutions are only suitable for very specific use cases like reliability predictions based on vibration monitoring. Furthermore, they do not consider the fact that machines may deteriorate non-uniformly, depending on external influences (e.g., the work piece material in a milling machine or the changing fruit acid concentration in a bottling plant). In this paper two concepts for a generic predictive maintenance solution which also considers non-uniformly aging behaviour are introduced. The first concept is based on system models representing the health state of a technical system. As these models are usually statically (viz. without a timely dimension) their coefficients are determined periodically and the resulting time series is used as aging indicator. The second concept focuses on external influences (contexts) which change the behaviour of the previous mentioned aging indicators in order to increase the accuracy of reliability predictions. Therefore, context-depended time series models are determined and used to predict machine reliability. Both concepts were evaluated on data of an air ventilation system. Thereby, it could be shown that they are suitable to determine aging indicators in a generic way and to incorporate external influences in the reliability prediction. Through this, the quality of reliability predictions can be significantly increased. In reality this leads to a more accurate scheduling of maintenance actions. Furthermore, the generic character of the solutions makes the concepts suitable for a wide range of aging processes.

This toolbox implements both new methods and prior art and is aimed for practical down-to-earth data analysis work. The target is to improve knowledge of the operation and behaviour of machines and processes throughout their entire life-cycles. The toolbox supports different phases of condition based maintenance with tools that extract essential information and automate data processing. The paper discusses principles that have guided toolbox design and the implemented toolbox structure. Case examples are used to illustrate how condition monitoring applications can be built using the toolbox. In the first case study the toolbox is applied to fault detection of industrial centrifuges based on measured electrical current. The second case study outlines an application for centralized monitoring of a fleet of machines that supports organizational learning.

Wind farms are adding a significant amount of electrical generation capacity. The increase in the number of wind farms has led to the need for more effective operation and maintenance procedures. Condition Monitoring System(CMS) can be used to aid plant owners in achieving these goals. Its aim is to provide operators with information regarding the health of their machines, which in turn, can help them improve operational efficiency. In this work, wind turbine fault detection system based on wind vs. power performance curve obtained from SCADA is studied. Considered fault detection scheme utilizes artificial neural network for training normal behavior of wind turbine system. Furthermore, In order to verify the effectiveness of the performance curve based fault detection scheme, SCADA data obtained from 850kW wind turbine system installed in Kunsan Korea are used and various simulation studies were carried out.

The cloud provider supports the execution of these VMs without detailed knowledge of the guest applications and operating systems in the VMs. In addition to elastic resource provisioning for the VMs, a desirable "value-added" service the cloud provider can provide is the emergency response to runtime incidences of software bugs and vulnerabilities. The challenge is to facilitate the automatic runtime detection, location, and patching of the software vulnerability - outside the VMs and without the source code. In this paper, we present CloudER, a cloud "emergency room" architecture that automatically detect, locate, and patch software vulnerabilities in cloud application binaries at runtime. CloudER leverages an existing taint-based system (Demand Emulation) for runtime anomaly detection, employs new algorithms for software vulnerability location and patch generation, and adapts a virtual machine introspection system (XenAccess) for dynamic patching. Our preliminary evaluation experiments with a number of real-world server applications show that CloudER achieves timely response to runtime software faults or attacks from outside the VMs.	[Chen, Ping; Mao, Bing] Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Ping; Xu, Dongyan] Purdue Univ, Dept Comp Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA		Chen, P (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Chen, P (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Comp Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

A generic adaptive prognostic function for heterogeneous multi-component systems: Application to helicopters	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			HEALTH MANAGEMENT; PHYSICS; LIFE	The Helimaintenance project aims at optimizing the maintenance of civil helicopters. An embedded supervision system is in charge of monitoring the helicopter and detecting problems which require maintenance actions. A data processing system integrating a prognostic function receives information from the supervision system and suggests component replacements before they fail and cause a system failure. In this paper we propose a hybrid component-oriented model for a heterogeneous physical system. The model describes the evolution of the health condition of the system over time from the available knowledge on behaviour and degradation of components. A generic adaptive prognostic function is developed and provides a common support for the maintenance decision of a heterogeneous multi-component system. It computes faults probabilities of components by using the parametrized Weibull model and updates these probabilities according to new data like on-line diagnostic result or new measurements. For illustration, the prognostic function is then applied on an example of a helicopter subsystem.

Fault detection through physical modelling in an axial flow compressor of a combined-cycle power plant	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			QUANTITATIVE MODEL; INTELLIGENT SYSTEM	The methods that are most frequently used in fault detection are able to detect that some abnormal behaviour of a system is occurring, but are unable to explain directly its causes. The main goal of the new method proposed in this paper is to achieve the capability to explain incipient fault, detected using a physical interpretation. To this end a detailed physical model of an axial flow compressor has been developed using empirical off-design correlations and turbo machine fundamentals to determine flow conditions at the mid-span of each blade. Then the methodology has been applied using real faulty behaviour data from the compressor of a combined-cycle plant. An incipient fault could be detected using the method over a non-measurable variable of the system, the enthalpy at the outlet of first rotor cascade. These results suggest the possible improvements that the application of this methodology could bring.	[Garcia-Matos, J. A.; Sanz-Bobi, M.

Predictive maintenance policy for oil well equipment in case of scaling through support vector machines	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			TUTORIAL	The formation of mineral scale is a persistent, expensive and one of the most serious problems in oil and gas industries. This may cause undesirable consequences such as unscheduled equipment shutdowns, interruption of oil production as well as economical losses related to oil well unavailability. This paper proposes using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build a non-linear mapping between a set x of variables and the scale build-up y. Thus, SVM will be adopted to predict future scale deposition values over time. Given this model, it is possible to establish appropriate maintenance strategies that aim at preventing wellbore unavailability. In this context, SVM works as a valuable tool to anticipate the knowledge about system failures.

Prognosis applied to an electromechanical system: A nonlinear approach based on sliding mode observer	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			DAMAGE	This paper is dedicated to model-based prognosis. More precisely, in this paper, a methodology is proposed to predict remaining useful life of a system. This methodology is applied on multiple time scale systems made up of a slow and a fast dynamic behaviors subsystems, defining damage state and state of system behaviors respectively. Here, slow dynamic subsystem behavior is supposed to be unknown, only the structure is assumed to be known a priori. Remaining useful life estimate implies to identify parameters of the structure of the slow dynamic behavior subsystem model. For that, in the fast dynamic behavior subsystem, unmeasured state are estimated based on the design of unknown input observers. Slow dynamic behavior state in the fast dynamic behavior subsystem is led back to an unknown input. Sliding mode observer is used to estimate state and unknown input. With these estimates and the dynamic unknown input estimate, the slow dynamic behavior model parameters are then identified. Finally, remaining useful life prediction is achieved. Pertinence of the proposed methodology is illustrated based on simulation results to an electromechanical oscillator.

Optimal prognostic maintenance planning for multi-component systems	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF			OPTIMIZATION	Decision making based on predictions of remaining useful life is still an underexplored area in maintenance management. The objective of this paper is to optimally plan maintenance for a multi-component system considering different levels of dependencies (economic, structural and stochastic dependence) based on prognostic information. The added value of prognostic information in maintenance planning and decision making is quantified. This is achieved by constructing a stochastic discrete-event simulation model, which optimizes maintenance action scheduling by considering different maintenance policies. A multi-objective optimization is performed by taking into account both cost and availability criteria as the maintenance objectives. Considering cost and availability as two separate objectives makes it possible to adapt and find the optimal maintenance policy according to the business environment at the time of decision making. A genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimal maintenance schedule which takes into account the predicted deterioration of all components. The added-value of prognostic - information in maintenance planning is determined by comparing this maintenance policy to five other conventional maintenance policies, which are: corrective maintenance, block-based and age-based preventive maintenance, inspection-based CBM and continuous CBM. A multi-component system is investigated to illustrate the ability of the prognostic maintenance policy to react to different and changing deterioration patterns and dependencies between all considered components. In this way an optimal maintenance policy is guaranteed all of the time and not only over time. The developed dynamic maintenance planning model is illustrated and validated by a real life case study on manufacturing equipment.

Probabilistic prognosis of a system: Application to a pneumatic valve	ADVANCES IN SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety And Reliability Conference (ESREL)	SEP 18-22, 2011	FRANCE	Univ Technologie Troyes, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc, Reg Champagne Ardenne, Ville Troyes, Ctr Natl Rech Sci, Electricite France, GIS 3SGS, Det Norske Veritas, Grand Troyes, GDR MACS CNRS, MAIF				We propose here a global methodology for the probabilistic prognosis of a complex system. First, the prognosis problem is translated in mathematical terms: it consists in computing the distribution of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system conditionally to available online information. Considering online information allows to provide a specific prognosis for each system according to its life. Second, a global methodology is proposed when the state of the system and its degradations are modelled using a Markov process. This method is basically a two-steps technique. One one hand, it requires the computation of the conditional law of the system regarding the available observations. One the other hand, it involves the computation of the reliability of the system. Third, some reliability computation techniques are proposed when the Markov process is a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). The method is illustrated on an aeronautic example: a pneumatic valve within the BLEED air system, used to provide regulated air (pressure, temperature) in the cabin.

Currently, the requirements of Environmental Testing and Reliability Testing can't be met that simulating environment accurately due to lacking of simulation methods and experimental equipments on non-stationary random vibration. Under the circumstances, some primary research was made in this paper on simulating cyclostationary random vibration environment which is a kind of non-stationary stochastic processes: firstly, the characteristics of Cyclic Mean and the periodic properties of Linear Periodic Time-Varying system were discussed; secondly, a Linear Periodic Time-Varying system was established to generate cyclostationary random signals with specified statistical parameters, whose structure was built based on trigonometric function and whose coefficients were determined by Least Mean Square algorithm; finally, the signals were loaded to electro-dynamic shaker and simulated cyclostationary random vibration environment successfully. This method was verified by numerical simulation and practical experiments, which could be applied in fault diagnosis and reliability assessment etc.	[Mao, C.; Jiang, Y.; Tao, J.; Chen, X.] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Mechatron Engn & Automat, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China					MAO, Chao/0000-0002-6343-9075; Jiang, Yu/0000-0003-0398-2938	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [50905181]	This research was supported by Project 50905181 from National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Probabilistic performance assessment of concrete structures subjected to corrosion process	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano			REINFORCEMENT CORROSION; RELIABILITY	In general, all structures are subjected to deterioration due to environmental and traffic actions over their life time. Maintaining an adequate safety level over their entire service life is thus not only an expensive task, but also filled with some level of uncertainty. Degradation in itself is not easily quantifiable because numerous aspects reduce the load bearing capacity of a structure. Furthermore, the development of actions over the multi-decade life time as well as the effects of preventive maintenance and rehabilitation measures is difficult to predict. For concrete bridges (chloride induced) reinforcement corrosion is in many cases the governing deterioration process, especially in regions where winter salt is commonly applied for traffic safety. This paper introduces a feasible approach to analyse the effects of chloride induced deterioration on the safety level, which is validated by the application to a real highway bridge. A probabilistic prognosis of the corrosion processes during the planned service life of the structure accounts for uncertainties in the experimental investigations, material properties and actions and provides the inputs for a long term performance assessment. In particular, comprehensive probabilistic analyses reveal the time dependent reliability levels with respect to code based serviceability and ultimate limit states.

Sensor Driven Prognosis Scheme Based on Extreme Value Theory	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano			PERFORMANCE PREDICTION; GENERAL-APPROACH; STEEL BRIDGES; INSPECTIONS; DAMAGE; TAIL	In this paper, an extreme value theory (EVT) based structural health prognosis scheme is presented to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of monitored structure by utilizing abundant sensor data acquired from online monitoring system. For the proposed prognosis scheme, hundreds of sensor data records are acquired within a short time period at each degradation stage. Moment Estimator from EVT is introduced to fuse the RUL information obtained from sensor data. Only a small portion of the total measurements are needed for quantile and end point estimation of the RUL. As a prerequisite, the monotonicity relation between measurements and estimated RUL are required. An example of fatigue prognosis is presented in the paper to demonstrate the proposed prognosis scheme. The results show that EVT based prognosis scheme can be more computationally efficient in performing prognosis compared to full sensor data based prognosis without loss of much accuracy.

Structural health monitoring-based finite element model of Stonecutters Bridge	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano				The recently built Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong is a cable-stayed bridge with a main span of 1018 m, the second-longest cable-stayed span in the world. As the bridge is located in a highly urbanized area, its serviceability and safety in long service life becomes a public concern. Therefore, a comprehensive structural health monitoring system (SHMS) has been installed on Stonecutters Bridge by Highways Department of Hong Kong S. A. R., and the sensory system is composed of totally 1,571 sensors in 15 different types, namely, anemometers, barometers, rainfall gauges, temperature sensors, hygrometers, corrosion cells, accelerometers, dynamic strain gauges, static strain gauges, global positioning systems, tiltmeters, dynamics weigh-in-motion stations, video cameras, articulation sensors and tensio-magnetic gauges. The SHMS provides very useful information for safety evaluation and regular maintenance of the bridge under in-service condition. After the instrumentation of SHMS in the bridge, Hong Kong' s Highways Department has carried out a serious of in-situ measurement, including the measurement of as-built profiles, modal frequencies, cable forces, etc. In particular, the displacement and strain influence lines were obtained by sensors at multiple locations during the road testing. It is noteworthy that the number of sensors is still very limited for such a large-scale structural system, and the locations of structural defects or degradation may not be directly monitored by sensors. In view of this fact, an accurate finite element model (FEM) that relates the bridge performance and condition to the measurement at limited locations becomes an essential tool for the effective health diagnosis and prognosis of the bridge. This paper presented the development of the SHM-oriented FEM for Stonecutters Bridge, including the modeling, updating and validation of the FEM. All the superstructures, substructures, connections and boundary conditions of the bridge were properly modeled in 3D frame FEM. The model updating was carried out according to in-situ measured results (e. g. the deck profile, cable forces and modal frequencies). A good agreement between the computed results and in-situ measurement validates that the established FEM can well serve as a basis for bridge rating system and performance prediction. Furthermore, the static influence lines due to moving highway vehicles were analyzed using the 3D FEM, and the critical locations or members were identified through the deflection influence lines. It should be noted that the 3D global FEM presented in this paper is only the first stage in the development of health prognosis tool for Stonecutters Bridge. A more sophisticated model, 3D multi-scale FEM of Stonecutters Bridge, is being developed currently.	[Zhu, S.; Xu, Y.

Even though this concept satisfies a large share of the requirements it bears some major disadvantages concerning off-board fault-tracking. This is especially true when the fault is not absolute and the on-board system indicates a number of DTCs resulting from side effects like network or performance issues. The reason for this is that DTC sequences are difficult to sort out individually since they must be considered with respect to the local context of the machine. To improve this situation the authors propose a lean multi-level sensor fusion approach to help bridge this gap by preserving this semantic information in form of compact aggregated context data.

A New Method for Fault Diagnosis of Mine Hoist based on Manifold Learning and Genetic Algorithm Optimized Support Vector Machine // Electronics and Electrical Engineering. - Kaunas: Technologija, 2012. - No. 7(123). - P. 99-102. This paper reports a new development based on the manifold learning and intelligent classifier for the nonlinear feature extraction and fault pattern recognition of mine hoists. The Wavelet packet was firstly used to extract the statistic characteristics of the hoist vibrations to obtain the original feature space. Then the locally linear embedding (LLE) was employed to learn the underlying nonlinear manifold in the original feature space to select distinct features. Following, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the fault pattern recognition. The energy-entropy based genetic algorithm was used to optimize the SVM parameters. The experimental vibration data measured on a mine hoist test rig was used to evaluate the proposed method. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is efficient for the mine hoist and can increase the detection rate by 2.5% or better when compared with existing diagnosis approaches.

J	Xu, BG				Xu, Bin Gang			Intelligent fault inference for rotating flexible rotors using Bayesian belief network	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Bayesian belief network; Flexible rotor; Uncertainty inference	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DECISION-SUPPORT; CRACK DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; VIBRATION; OPTIMIZATION	Flexible rotor is a crucial mechanical component of a diverse range of rotating machineries and its condition monitoring and fault diagnosis are of particular importance to the modern industry. In this paper, Bayesian belief network (BBN) is applied to the fault inference for rotating flexible rotors with attempt to enhance the reasoning capacity under conditions of uncertainty. A generalized three-layer configuration of BBN for the fault inference of rotating machinery is developed by fully incorporating human experts' knowledge, machine faults and fault symptoms as well as machine running conditions. Compared with the Naive diagnosis network, the proposed topological structure of causalities takes account of more practical and complete diagnostic information in fault diagnosis. The network tallies well with the practical thinking of field experts in the whole processes of machine fault diagnosis. The applications of the proposed BBN network in the uncertainty inference of rotating flexible rotors show good agreements with our knowledge and practical experience of diagnosis.

Principal components analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) method are introduced to recognize the fault pattern of the rolling bearing in this paper. Multidimensional correlated variable is converted into low dimensional independent eigenvector by means of PCA. The pattern recognition and the nonlinear regression are achieved by the method of SVM. In the light of the feature of vibrating signals, eigenvector is obtained using PCA, fault diagnosis of rolling bearing is recognized correspondingly using SVM fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that the recognition of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on PCA and SVM theory is available in the fault pattern recognition and provides a new approach to intelligent fault diagnosis.

The FEM has the features which consider the actual mapping of winding distribution and, as a result, modeling of the faults in stator winding will be more accurate. In comparison with traditional methods (coupling method), the FEM considers the complex geometry, actual materials of bar, current and the flux distributions within the electrical machines. As a result the A-GE and the broken bars can be easily modeled using this method. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) has been used to give a decision about the fault occurrence. For the broken rotor bar, frequency of the sideband components around the fundamental is used to indicate the presence of fault. However the sideband frequencies cannot be used to recognize the stator winding short circuit and eccentricities faults, where the harmonics have approximately the same frequency over the spectrum. Third harmonic components have been used to differentiate between them.

One of the important techniques which can be used to fault diagnosing of rotating machines is order-tracking. In this paper, an order tracking technique with high-resolution based on adaptive Kalman filter is proposed for detecting the fault in an induction motor bearing. The order tracking problem has been solved as the tracking of frequency-varying band pass signals. The algorithm is implemented on the real digital signal obtained from the vibration of induction motor to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. Ordered amplitudes are estimated with high-accuracy when experimental implementation is done. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology has been validated for several cases in fault diagnosis of an induction motor.

The objective is to identify the eccentricity specific harmonic components present in the line current and field current of the synchronous machine unambiguously through simulation. By comparing the results it is found that the MWFA based model is better suited because not only it is computationally faster but also identifies the fault specific harmonic components with better clarity. These results are confirmed through experiments.
