So it is commonly used in rotated machine. Whether bearing is normal or not affects straightly the mechanical working state, any fault or invalidation took place in the running of the machine will bring serious sequence and great economic loss. So it is necessary to check the state of the bearing and diagnose the fault. In this paper, the energy features of the vibration signal of the roll bearing are extracted by Wavelet Packet, then the method of RBF Neural Network is presented to diagnose the faults, the faults can realize intelligent classification by this method. Simulation is used to assist in the roll bearing faults diagnosis. The simulation results obtained indicated that the method of energy features extracted by Wavelet Packet is efficient and the method of intelligent classification can identify the faults well.

First, Vibration signals are used as data of fault diagnosis, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is employed for feature extraction of the normal and fault examples, and SVDD algorithm as classifier is used for fault diagnosis. Second, fuzzy control rules are designed for the normal signals in order to keep the quantity of the glue with the variation of the fiber. Experiments show that SVDD algorithm is practical and efficient and the control process based on fuzzy control is stable and reliable.

The outlier objects can be distinguished from target objects if the information of the target class is available without knowing the outlier class by this algorithm. The machine condition can be monitored only using normal condition signals by applying this method to mechanical condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. It is unnecessary for this method to pre-process the signals to extract their features. The experimental results show that this algorithm has stronger classification ability and higher efficiency than conventional classification method of neural network.

Bio-inspired Computer Visual System using GPU and Visual Pattern Assessment Language (ViPAL): Application on Breast Cancer Prognosis	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			2ND-ORDER FEATURES; ORIENTATION; 1ST-ORDER; SHAPE	Bio-inspired computer vision is an emerging field. It aims to reproduce the capabilities of biological vision systems, eventually to simulate the visual functions for various purposes. In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired computer visual system using Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), and its application on breast cancer prognosis. The system extracts visual features from an input image using a mechanism which is similar to human visual system. Then classify the visual features using a machine learning algorithm. As a result, the elements of the input image, which might be related to particular knowledge concepts, can be identified. In order to operate the bio-inspired computer visual system, in this work, a new computer language, named Visual Pattern Assessment Language (ViPAL), is proposed. The ViPAL provides a shell between the bio-inspired computer visual system and the users. The complexity of the low-level image feature assessment can be managed by the shell. As a result, the workload of the users can be reduced. Based on the bio-inspired computer visual system and the ViPAL, we propose an application for breast cancer prognosis in order to support the works of the pathologists. A well-trained pathologist usually can complete the analysis of a biopsy in 10 to 30 seconds. However, in a big medical institute, sometimes a pathologist need to analyse more than 100 biopsies per day. Hence, in order to support their works, we implemented an application of breast cancer diagnosis. The system thus roughly simulated the decision-making as the procedures of the breast cancer prognosis.

C	Lall, P; Gupta, P; Panchagade, D			IEEE	Lall, Pradeep; Gupta, Prashant; Panchagade, Dhananjay			Self-Organized Mapping of Failure Modes in Portable Electronics Subjected to Drop and Shock	2010 PROCEEDINGS 60TH ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (ECTC)	Electronic Components and Technology Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	60th Electronic Components and Technology Conference	JUN 01-04, 2010	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE			NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION	Portable electronic products subjected to transient shock may exhibit multiple failure modes in vicinity of the interconnects. Failure is often diagnosed by loss of functionality using techniques including the built-in self test, which provides limited insight into reliability and remaining useful life. In this paper prognostic framework for electronic systems has been developed with neural network based self organizing maps. The presented approach resides in the pre-failure space with a focus on electronic systems with multiple failure modes. Unsupervised learning of the neural net has been used to train the neural net for identification of individual failure modes. Feature vectors have been developed based on damage pre-cursors from time-spectral measurements. The clustered damage pre-cursors have been correlated with failure modes of the underlying damage. Several chip-scale packages have been studied, with leadfree second-level interconnects including SAC305, SAC405 alloys. Transient strain has been measured during the drop-event using digital image correlation and high-speed cameras operating at 100,000 fps. Continuity has been monitored simultaneously for failure identification. In addition, explicit finite element models have been developed and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, trace fracture, package falloff and solder ball failure. Fault modes predicted by simulation based pre-cursors have been correlated with those from experimental data. Activation of different neurons in the lattice for various failure modes and combinations of failure modes has been demonstrated. Previously the authors have developed techniques based on statistical pattern recognition for leading indication of impending failure and detection of damage initiation and progression [Lall 2006(a), 2007(a), 2008]. Early classification of multiple failure modes in the pre-failure space is new.

In this paper, bearing prognostic has been studied in viewpoint offal lure degradation as an object of prediction. This study proposes the application of relevance vector machine (RVM), logistic regression (LR) and ARMA/GARCH in order to assess the failure degradation of run-to-failure bearing simulated data. Failure degradation is calculated using L R and then regarded as target vectors of failure probability for RVM training. ARMA/GARCH based on multi-step-ahead prediction is employed for censored data. Furthermore, RVM is selected as intelligent system then trained by using run-to-failure bearing data and target vectors of failure probability estimated by LR. After training process, RVM is employed to predict failure probability of individual unit of bearing sample. T he result shows the novelty of the proposed method which can be considered as machine degradation prognostic model.

An effective ensemble should consist of a set of learners that are both accurate and diverse. In the training stage, we use the Adaboost. R2 technique to train several weak learners (multi layer perceptron network-MLP) to increase the diversity of the individual models. In the prediction stage, we focus on the design of the fusion of the weak learner ensemble. In contrast with the traditional static weight a location method based on the over all data set, we propose a dynamic weight allocation method, based on the performance of an individual weak learner on the subset. The idea be hind this method was to use a test sample's neighbors to estimate the accuracy and bias of the individual weak learner when the learner is used to make the prediction. An improved hyperrectangle neighborhood defining method is proposed in this paper. Some experiments using MLP neural network as a weak learner on a NASA turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset were carried out. The preliminary empirical comparisons showed higher performance of the novel ensemble learning methodology for the R UL estimation of engineering systems.

Maintenance is an appropriate measure to ensure machinery normal condition. So performance degradation assessment is very important for maintenance decision-making. There are two very interesting aspects when degradation assessment is performed. One is to detect early fault of machinery as early as possible. Another is to estimate remaining useful life (RUL) once early fault of machinery is detected. In this paper, wavelet lifting scheme (WLS) and hidden Markov model (HMM) are used to describe cur rent condition of gearbox and detect early gearbox faults with a dynamic threshold. After that, another model based on final failure data is pro posed to predict how much time is left before a failure occurs given the current machine condition. At last, the proposed method is validated by a set of whole life gearbox data.

During a flight mission, the aircraft, the operation of crew members and the dynamic change of flight environments interacts as a system. The change of safety situation of an aircraft should be attributed to the behavior of those human-machine-environment factors, which established the basis of the in-flight safety monitor system designing. The research extends the implementation of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) methodology from aircraft system health to aircraft in-flight safety. An integrated safety monitoring function architecture that developed on the platform of Centralized Maintenance System (CMS) is presented. Starting with identification and selection of a set of flight safety situation indicators that describe the risk level of aircraft system, the safety monitoring system should detect and monitor the operation of crew members, the condition of systems and components and advert of flight environments in a real-time or near real-time manner, determine and assess the safety level of the aircraft instantly, detect and track errors of human operation, anomalies of systems, and abnormal event of flight environment, diagnose the causes for the above abnormal events, and estimate the near future safety situation of the current flight aircraft. During a flight, if there are any abnormal event that may led to a critical safety situation is being detected, the flight safety monitoring system should also trigger a alert or warning report, present the relationship between the information of a abnormal event and its root cause, its effects and consequences, and the emergency response knowledge for it, provide crew members with situational awareness of the system safety, and promote better safety decision support. The technologies and tools for the implementation of flight safety monitoring and early warning are also discussed.

Using thermal image, it is easy to obtain information about the machine condition rather than other conventional methods of machine condition diagnostic technique. Thermal image technique can be successfully applied in the field electrical and electronics system, mechanical system, energy system and medical diagnosis. To get information from the image many techniques of image processing such as discrete Fourier transformation, discrete cosine transformation, neural networks, wavelet transform and many others methods is being used. In this study, our main focal point is to analysis thermal image by discrete wavelet decomposition and tries to find out significant result of machine condition monitoring. In this work, decomposition level of 2 shows satisfactory result for machine condition diagnosis.

This paper presents a novel pattern classification approach for the fault diagnostics, which combines the morphological multi-scale analysis and the "one to others" support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Morphological pattern spectrum describes the shape characteristics of the inspected signal based on the morphological opening operation with multi-scale structuring elements. The pattern spectrum entropy and the barycenter scale location of the spectrum curve are extracted as the feature vectors presenting different faults of the bearings. The "one to others" SVM algorithm is adopted to distinguish six kinds of fault bearing signals which were measured in the experimental test rig running under eight different working conditions. The recognition results of the SVM are ideal even though the training sample is few. The combination of the morphological pattern spectrum parameter analysis and the "one to others" multi-class SVM algorithm is suitable for the on-line automated fault diagnosis of the rolling element bearings. This application is promising and worth well exploiting.

Based on the APSO-LSSVM fault prognostic algorithm, fuzzy reasoning algorithm and expert knowledge database, a PHM (prognostic and health management) system is established for the AEW Radar. The experiment shows that, because of using the APSO algorithm to adjust the parameters of LSSVM model, the APSO-LSSVM algorithm has a better fault prognostic ability; because of integrating the APSO-LSSVM algorithm with the fuzzy reasoning expert knowledge database, the PHM system not only can enhance the ability of health condition monitoring, but also can improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis and maintenance for the AEW Radar. So, this PHM system can play a very important role in the AEW Radar's logistic support.

The core idea of the proposed framework is not only utilize historical fault data of equipment operation and major repair, but also select appropriate dynamic condition monitoring signal. The feature evaluation is introduced to analyze the dynamic signals. The degradation index with accurate definition and apparent trend variation is extracted, and introduced to proportional hazards model, which effectively capture the effects of the covariates. Covariates could be dependent or independent of time and any quantity or combination of quantities that describe a system's condition can be included in reliability models. Maximum likelihood is chosen to estimate the reliability parameters in proportional hazards model. This method permits in-situ assessment of machine reliability, and the evaluation can really reflect the trend of fault occurrence and development. It is suitable for realizing individual equipment reliability assessment and prognosis based on operational condition feature and performance degradation signal. A practice example of rolling bearing test device is given to provide operational data, and the reliability size and changing trend are analyzed in detail under different operational conditions and damaged severity.

A set of augmented Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARRs), termed AARRs, is proposed to extend the capability of ARRs to identify degradation of components which are not represented by physical parameters. The methods utilize the unified constraint relations, named global AARRs (GAARRs), for health monitoring of hybrid systems. The mode information is provided by a mode tracker, which is based on Mode-change Signature Matrix (MChSM) and is only triggered when inconsistency between monitored system and its nominal model is detected. Once a fault is detected, a hypothesis set is generated and a multiple hybrid differential evolution algorithm is adopted to identify the degradation dynamics and the unknown mode changes. The optimization problem is efficiently solved by a hybrid differential evolution algorithm, which is able to simultaneously handle real and binary unknown parameters. Simulation results are reported to validate the proposed method.

Enhancing the Ability of Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition in Machine Fault Diagnosis	2010 PROGNOSTICS AND SYSTEM HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference	JAN 12-FEB 14, 2010	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA				TRANSFORM	Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is an adaptive time-frequency analysis method that has been widely employing for machinery fault diagnosis. EMD is famous in revealing instantaneous change of frequency or time from non-linear sensory signal so that the occurrence of anomalous signal can be accurately detected. However, its shortcomings include mode mixing and end effects that often appear in its decomposed bands. These problems decrease the accuracy, particularly in vibration-based fault diagnosis. Recently, many researchers have proposed various improved methods, which include the famous Ensemble EMD (EEMD), to solve the problem of mode mixing. Its purpose is to introduce controlled amount of white noise to the original EMD. After adding known white noise into the raw signal, the signal in the band will have a uniformly distributed reference scale which forces the EEMD to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process for minimizing mode mixing effect. Even though EEMD becomes popular, the proper settings for the number of ensemble and the amplitude of white noise that should be added a re still not formally prescribed. This paper discusses the influence of parameters setting on the results of reducing mode mixing problem. Tests were done using both simulated and real machine signals.

To achieve autonomous logistics support mode, improve aircraft operational readiness, reduce life cycle cost, PHM technology is one of the key technologies. Capabilities that airborne PHM system detect fault, isolate fault and forecast fault directly determine the effectiveness of the work of aircraft maintenance. It also influences aircraft economy, availability and security. Airborne PHM system adopts a hierarchical architecture. Using built-in test equipment (BITE) and sensors, PHM system collects data that reflect characterization of failures and faults trends. With the advanced algorithms and intelligent model to monitor, diagnose, predict and manage the status of the aircraft. Furthermore, accurate fault detection, isolation and projections are achieved. At Present, fault detection, isolation and predictive measurement and verification methods in MIL -STD2165, GJB 2547, GJB2072 and GJB1909 have not fully applicable to the PHM system. In this paper, based on detail analysis of the relevant standards for airborne PHM system and airborne PHM system function and work flowchart, according to design features of airborne PHM system architecture and in accordance with the different levels of system design, index requirements of sensor-BITE, regional manager and aircraft platform manager are proposed respectively. The index system of airborne PHM system is established. At the same time, a verification method of airborne PHM system is derived. That is, "hierarchical verification, comprehensive evaluation" method. Utilizing validation results of underlayer indexes in eluding the design capacity of board level and equipment level built-in test (BIT), fault diagnostic model of regional platform manager and so on, we validate top-level requirements of airborne PHM system by comprehensive evaluation.

However, it can be a non trivial task to develop and implement effective prognostics models including the inherent uncertainty of prognostics. Moreover, there is no systematic way to construct a prognostics tool since the user can make some assumptions: choice of a structure, initialization of parameters ... This last problem is addressed in the paper: how to build a prognostics system with no human intervention, neither a priori knowledge? The proposition is based on the use of a neuro-fuzzy predictor whose architecture is partially determined thanks to a statistical approach based on the Akaike information criterion. It consists in using a cost function in the learning phase in order to automatically generate an accurate prediction system that reaches a compromise between complexity and generalization capability. The proposition is illustrated and discussed.

In this paper, taking an aircraft fuel System as an example, with virtual instrument technology and computer simulation technology, an integrated approach of signal processing method and model-based method is introduced to build the virtual simulation software of aircraft fuel PHM system for overcoming the difficulty in obtaining the failures information from the real fuel system. During the process of constructing the aircraft fuel PHM system, the first step is to analyze the fuel system failure m odes and status parameters that can identify the failure modes. The main failure modes are determined as joints looseness, pipe broken, nozzle clogging, and fuel tank leakage. The status parameters are fuel pressure and fuel flow. Then, the status parameter model is constructed to imitate the behavior of sensor which detecting fuel system status. On this basis, utilizing the signal processing module provided by Labview software, the outputs from the virtual sensors, which collect the failure data, are processed to realize the simulation of failure detection and failure diagnosis. All the result shows that the virtual simulation software well accomplishes the task of the aircraft fuel system failure detection and diagnosis.

Aiming at the strong coupling of various fault features of hydraulic pump when multiple faults occur simultaneously, a hiberarchy clustering fault diagnosis strategy was proposed, in which three le vel fault reasoning machine was adopted for five kinds of failures for hydraulic pump. The main idea is to distinguish the obvious failures with individual signal processing first, then figure out the blurry information with data fusion techniques. To the desultorily features, such as increscent clearance of piston/shoe subassembly and off-center of swashplate subassembly, the intensive techniques is u esed to strengthen fault feature under lognitudinal and transverse direction so as to realize the multiple fault diagnosis. Through accumulating the power over +/- 10 Hz of basic axial and severalfold frenquency, the sum of relative power can be exploited to realize the fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis under confused information. Application indicates that hiberarchy clustering method can diagnose the multiple failures correctly of hydraulic pump with high precision even in farraginous condition.

With the development of sensor technology and signal processing methods, in order to precisely detect and identify faults, fault diagnosis is a typical multi-sensor fusion problem. New challenges have arisen with regard to obtaining a reliable fault diagnostic result based on multi-source information. From the viewpoint of evidence theory, information obtained from each sensor can be considered as a piece of evidence, and as such, multi-sensor based machines diagnosis can be viewed as a problem of evidence fusion. In this paper we investigate the use of Dempster-Shafer(D-S) evidence theory as a tool for modeling and fusing multi-source information from the machines. We present a preliminary review of evidence theory and explain how the multi-sensor machine diagnosis problem can be framed in the context of this theory. We propose a method for enhancing the effectiveness of basic probability assignment functions in modeling and the method combining pieces of evidence. By introducing importance index, the issues of evidence importance in the practical application of D-S evidence theory are addressed. Finally, we report a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

While the conservation work being carried out is "state of the art", there is no evidence at present of the effectiveness of the conservation work 50 plus years ahead. A Prognosties Framework is being developed to monitor the "health" of the ship's iron structures to help ensure a 50 year life once conservation is completed with only minor deterioration taking place over time. This paper presents the prognostics framework being developed which encompasses four approaches: Canary and Parrot devices, Physics-of-Failure (PoF) models, Precursor Monitoring and Data Trend Analysis and Bayesian Networks. "Canary" and "Parrot" devices have been designed to mimic the actual mechanisms that would lead to failure of the iron structures with canary devices failing faster to act as an indicator of forthcoming failures while parrot devices fail at the same rate as the structure under consideration. A PoF model based on decrease of corrosion rate over time is used to predict the remaining life of an iron structure. Mahalanobis Distance (MD) is used as a precursor monitoring technique to obtain a single comparison metric from multiple sensor data to represent anomalies detected in the system. Bayesian Network models integrating remaining life predictions from PoF models with information of possible anomalies from MD analysis are used to obtain more accurate predictions of remaining life. This paper describes why and how the four approaches are used for diagnostic and prognostics purposes and how they are integrated into the prognostics framework.

The traditional approach depends on constant summary of experiences from the experts. However, the acquired knowledge is probably inaccurate and inefficient. With the benefit of network, the different companies and users that have the same equipments can be organized to form an integrated information source in order to share the original data and diagnosis knowledge. Thus, the more accurate diagnosis knowledge may be acquired using know ledge mining and information fusion so that the precision of status identification can be improved. Furthermore, the diagnostic services based on remote knowledge service can be provided via network. The framework of remote knowledge service system based on web service technology is proposed in this study. Combined with the ferrography analysis method, the application of knowledge service for remote wear debris analysis has been studied and demonstrated in this study.

At present, more than one half of the total energy consumption of data centers is for the power and cooling infrastructure. One way to save energy is an approach called "free air cooling," where ambient air is used to cool the equipment, thereby reducing the energy consumed in cooling and conditioning the air. Free air cooling is being adopted for data centers that are already in operation where the equipment used are unlikely to have been designed or qualified for free cooling regime. Traditional reliability evaluations depend on industry standards that assume pre-defined environmental conditions and generally perform set of environmental tests that relate to those conditions. Equipment level risk identification and mitigation methods are not practical to apply for the data center as a system. This paper provides an overview of the associated challenges posed by such an operating environment. This paper discusses the reason why traditional reliability methods cannot be used to assess the risks of free air cooling of data centers. Finally, as an alternative approach, prognostics and health management technique that can provide the users of data centers with the ability to identify impacts of free air cooling, estimate remaining useful life of the equipment, and help identify impending intermittent service interruptions and degradations is described.

The method is based on Hilbert transform and adaptive wavelet analysis. We apply the Hilbert transform to present the characteristic envelope of the periodic impulsive signal to show the fundamental frequencies. The Gaussian functions are optimized to get the optimal parameters to show the characteristic frequencies of the Hilbert transform-based envelope of the vibration signals. The simulated signal and experimental signal are used to test the method. The results show it is applicable and effective to fault diagnosis of fluid machines by analyzing the periodic impulsive signal.

Aiming at the strong coupling of various fault features of hydraulic pump when multiple faults occur simultaneously, a hiberarchy clustering fault diagnosis strategy was proposed, in which three le vel fault reasoning machine was adopted for five kinds of failures for hydraulic pump. The main idea is to distinguish the obvious failures with individual signal processing first, then figure out the blurry information with data fusion techniques. To the desultorily features, such as increscent clearance of piston/shoe subassembly and off-center of swashplate subassembly, the intensive techniques is uesed to strengthen fault feature under lognitudinal and transverse direction so as to realize the multiple fault diagnosis. Through accumulating the power over +/- 10 Hz of basic axial and severalfold frenquency, the sum of relative power can be exploited to realize the fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis under confused information. Application indicates that hiberarchy clustering method can diagnose the multiple failures correctly of hydraulic pump with high precision even in farraginous condition.

Expectations today are demanding and in a production environment unexpected installation startup issues or downtimes are unwanted and costly. While many papers have been written discussing the benefits of predictive maintenance one area that is sometimes overlooked is the installation of machinery. Multiple components and structures assemble together to form one operating system. Within a system one will find a structural base supporting a motor and the driven equipment. When these systems are not thoroughly reviewed the potential for resonant frequencies that result in structural vibration during startup and/or operation may exist. The use of impact testing and modal analysis has proven to be very beneficial in resolving vibration issues of this type. Using the case studies, this paper will show how impact testing and modal analysis are used to solve vibration problems.

Cancer prognosis estimates recurrence of disease and predict survival of patient; hence resulting in improved patient management. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are shown to be powerful tools for analyzing data sets where there are complicated nonlinear interactions between the input data and the information to be predicted. In this paper, we have targeted this strength of SVMs to analyze the potential of classification through feature vectors for predicting the survival chances of a breast cancer patient. Experiments were performed using different types of SVM algorithms analyzing their classification efficiency using different kernel parameters. SEER breast cancer data set (1973-2003), the most comprehensible source of information on cancer incidence in United States, is considered. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy parameters along with RoC curves have been used to explain the performance of each SVM algorithm with different kernel types.

Specifically, approach of Kalman filter (KF) based on the innovation obtained through support vector machine (SVM) is presented. In the proposed approach, factors related with the capacity of a VRLA battery have been taken into account as elements of the multi-dimensional input vector while time series is trained by SVM to predict future innovation. Then step by step prognosis is implemented through Kalman predictor with innovation obtained through SVM. Measurements using realtime data are used to verify the capability of the proposed method for estimating SOH and SOC of VRLA batteries. Experiment results show that our proposed methodologies are suitable for monitoring the SOC and SOH of the battery, with accuracy in determining the SOH and its trend of deterioration within 4%. Moreover, by accounting for the nonlinearities present within the dynamic cell models, the application of KF prediction based on SVM innovation update is shown to provide verifiable indications of Soli.

In this paper a new method of fault detection and treatment for 5-phase PMSM under partial demagnetization has been introduced. In the proposed technique various rotor demagnetization scenarios have been considered. As the optimum performance is of great importance in industrial applications the excitation of stator phases has been modified to attain the maximum output torque per input phase current in the event of demagnetization. Field reconstruction method has been used in conjunction with optimization methods to detect the fault and find the proper excitation.

The main goal is to compare two feature-based ensemble construction methods, and present a third variation from one of them. The use of ensembles instead of single classifier systems has been widely applied in classification problems lately. The diversification of classifiers performed by the methods presented in this work is obtained by varying the feature set each classifier uses, and also at one point, alternating the intrinsic parameters for the training algorithm. We show results obtained with the established genetic algorithm GEFS and our recently developed approach called BSFS, which has a lower computational cost. We rely on a database of real data, with 2000 acquisitions of vibration signals extracted from operational motor pumps. Our results compare the outcomes from the two methods mentioned, and present a modification in one of them that improved the accuracy, reinforcing the motivation for the usage of that method.

Targeted Delivery of Molecular Probes for in vivo Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Imaging	26TH SOUTHERN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE: SBEC 2010	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference, SBEC 2010	APR 30-MAY 02, 2010	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Natl Sci Fdn, Biomed Engn Soc Chongqing, Natl Canc Inst (NCI)	Univ Maryland	Electron paramagnetic resonance; Breast cancer; HER2; Liposomes; Nitroxides; Imaging	CELLS	With recent advances in electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI), in vivo visualization of a physiologically distinct tissue (e.g., a tumor) has become a real possibility. EPRI could be a powerful imaging modality to detect metastatic lesions and report tissue-specific physiological information. Approximately 25-30% of breast tumors overexpress the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). HER2-overexpressing breast tumors are proliferative, metastatic, and have poor clinical prognoses. We have developed a novel mechanism for selective in vivo delivery of "spin probes" (molecular probes for EPRI) to Hc7 cells, which are MCF7 breast cancer cells engineered to overexpress HER2. Spin probes can be encapsulated in anti-HER2 immunoliposomes at high concentration (>100 mM). At such concentrations, the spectroscopic signal of spin probes is severely "quenched"-a process analogous to the self-quenching of fluorophores. This makes the intact immunoliposomes spectroscopically "dark" and thus invisible by EPRI. Tumor-specific contrast is generated after selective endocytosis of anti-HER2 immunoliposomes. Intracellular degradation of endocytosed liposomes liberates the spin probes from the liposomal lumen. Once de-quenched by dilution into the much-larger cellular volume, the spin probes regain their spectral signal and make the cells visible by EPRI. Through uptake of immunoliposomes, Hc7 cells can achieve an intracellular spin probe concentration of similar to 750 mu M. Using imaging phantoms, we verify that this concentration of spin probes is easily imageable by EPRI. We have optimized immunoliposomes for in vivo applications by increasing their persistence in circulation to maximize tumor targeting. Through near-infrared fluorescence imaging of tumor-bearing animals, we demonstrate that optimized anti-HER2 immunoliposomes selectively target Hc7 tumors in vivo, enabling high-contrast imaging with minimal background. This work lays the foundation for imaging Hc7 tumors with EPRI.	[Burks, S. R.; Rosen, G. M.; Kao, J. P. Y.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Biomed Engn & Technol, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Burks, S.

However, it is increasingly important not just to measure overall expression of specific molecules, but also their spatial distribution-at various scales and while preserving cellular and tissue architectural features. Such high-resolution molecular imaging is technically challenging, especially when signals of interest are co-localized. Moreover, in fluorescence-based methods, sensitivity and quantitative reliability can be compromised by spectral cross-talk between specific labels and also by the presence of autofluorescence commonly present, for example, in formalin-fixed tissues. In brightfield microscopy, problems of overlapping chromogenic signals pose similar imaging difficulties. These challenges can be addressed using commercially available multispectral imaging technologies attached to standard microscope platforms, or alternatively, integrated into whole-slide scanning instruments. However, image analysis is a central and still incompletely solved piece of the entire imaging process. New and evolving machine-learning technologies as well as other image-understanding approaches can create tools that can readily be used to separate image regions into appropriate classes ("cancer", "stroma", "inflammation", e.g.) with (near) clinically acceptable accuracy. By itself this is useful, but can also be combined with specific segmentation and quantitation tools to extract molecular data automatically from appropriate cellular and tissue compartments, information necessary for designing and testing targeted diagnostic and therapeutic reagents. Having tools such as these available will allow pathologists to deliver appropriate quantitative and multiplexed analyses in a reproducible and timely manner.

The analysis results to the caculation of six typical fault signals show that the timedivision scale level original moment and the time-division scale level invariant moment can be used to display the detailed information of wavelet gray level image, extract the signal's characteristics effectively, and distinguish the vibration fault. The result by FFT and wavelet gray moment vector analysis are also given Compared to the approach of wavelet gray moment vector and conventional FFT, the timedivision scale level moment approach can provide higher calculation speed and higher capacity of fault identification, hence it is a good quantitative fault diagnosis approach and more suitable for online fault diagnosis for rotating machinery.

Though there are several data acquisition systems and digital analysis instrumentation arc available, the practice is still to depend on off-line diagnostics systems requiring skilled rotor dynamics knowledge operators to quickly make fault diagnosis. A fully working monitoring and diagnostics tool is not available for easy-to-operate systems. In this paper a system that incorporates these requirements is developed here.	[Rao, J. S.; Swaroop, K.

Vibration signals coming out of gearbox can be captured by accelerometers. Vibration signal analysis is very effective tool in finding gear fault at early stage. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been used for fault diagnosis. The EMD method decomposes an original signal in to different frequency-bands in time domain, known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). A serious problem in application of EMD is boundary distortion of IMFs. While doing statistical analysis of IMFs, boundary distortion may provide high values of statistical indicator (e.g. kurtosis), even if fault is not present. Several extension methods are employed to eliminate the boundary distortion problem. Extension-based methods can not completely eliminate the boundary distortion, especially when the low-frequency component of the analyzed signal is weak. Recently, cosine window-based method has been proposed by which the boundary distortion can be controlled in boundaries of the signal and the middle component of it can be exactly decomposed in to IMFs. The cosine window-based method is good only for a particular IMF depending on the size of cosine window. Since, in EMD process the boundary distortion of successive IMFs increases, therefore a variable cosine window is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method boundary distortion problem is minimized by using variable cosine window for all IMFs. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method based on variable cosine window is a powerful technique for fault diagnosis.

With regard to this, fault symptom analysis techniques can be used to point out significant indications of the presence of a shaft crack by means of the on-line analysis of vibration data. However, some symptoms of a crack propagation can be similar to those caused by other usual malfunctions. Therefore suitable diagnostic techniques must be applied to proper monitoring data sets in order to obtain successful results. Moreover, the assumption of the presence of a shaft crack can be confirmed by the results provided by model-based methods aimed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of rotating machines under the effect of typical faults. In this paper the case history of the timely identification of a circumferential crack propagated in the shaft of a steam turbine is described. The diagnostic strategy successfully used to detect the crack on the basis of the analysis of the vibration data collected in operating condition as well as during runups and coastdowns carried out under different machine thermal states are shown.

The analysis on vibration signal is often based on the waveform signal collected at a specific measuring point in a specific flash. Thus the vibration waveform signal is the representation of the condition. If the fault occurs, under certain condition, it is possible that the fault information is not revealed in the vibration waveform, or submerged by other information. Under such circumstance, because the characteristic of the fault is not absolutely distinct, the fault diagnosis method based on the randomly extractive information of condition can not well differentiate these faults. However, the fault, in any case, is accompanied by some symptoms. In one condition these symptoms may be indistinct, but in the others it may appear quite distinct. Thus through investigating the process composed of a good many conditions, the chances to detect faults will increase substantially. Under a condition, the vibration information of the fault may appear decentralized and random, but when the whole process is taken into consideration, the rules stand out. In order to describe the rule of changes in the vibration process, on the basis of the information entropy, a new identification index----the information exergy is defined.

Using thermal image, it is easy to obtain information about the machine condition rather than other conventional methods of machine condition diagnostic technique. To get information from the image many techniques of image processing such as discrete Fourier transformation, discrete cosine transformation, neural networks, wavelet transform and many others methods is being used. In this study, our main focal point is to analysis thermal image by discrete wavelet decomposition and tries to find out significant result of machine condition monitoring. In this work, decomposition level of 2 shows satisfactory result for machine condition diagnosis.

These latter vibrations are rarely measured by means of permanent probes in industrial machines; therefore these phenomena can be often pointed out only by detecting abnormal harmonic components in the frequency spectrum of the lateral vibrations measured during common monitoring activities. Then, the diagnosis of the occurrence of coupling effects between torsional and lateral vibrations can be confirmed by the results provided by model-based techniques. In this paper, the results of the analysis of the dynamic behaviour of a small power unit that was affected by abnormal lateral vibrations caused by the excitation of torsional normal modes of the geared shaft-train are shown and discussed.

The method is based on the assignment of character frequencies generated by the rotating parts of rolling bearings. The faults of the bearing units cause periodic changes in the instant speed of the rotor, short-time changing of rotating electromagnetic torque, redistribution of magnetic field fluxes in air gap and occurrence of highest harmonics in the spectrum of consumed current. Analysing the spectrum and its changes during a particular period of time allows the diagnostics of bearing units faults, monitoring and possible prognosis of bearing units residual life.				aleksandrs.gasparjans@latja.lv; aleksandrs.terebkovs@latja.lv; znastja@latnet.lv					Collacott R.A., 1977, MECH FAULT DIAGNOSIS; Fitzgerald A.E., 2002, ELECT MACHINERY; GASPARYAN AS, 2003, VESTN NTU SER ELEKTR, V10, P250; GASPARYAN AS, 2005, VESTN NTU SER ELEKTR, V45, P356; GREIVULIS J, 2001, P INT C UNC EL EL SY, P463; Greivulis J., 1998, P INT C EL SHIP IST, P56; HENAO H, 2003, P IEEE IND APPL C IA, V2, P1368; PETUKHOV VS, 2007, DIAGN ELECTR MOTORS; *TER AN, 2003, QUICK FIELD FIN EL A; TEREBKOVS A, 2007, P 9 INT SCI PRACT C, P160; Vazhnov A.I., 1980, PEREKHODNYE PROTSESS; VINCENTE P, 2008, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V8, P1112	12	1	1	0	2	LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE, FACULTY ENGINEERING, INST MECHANICS	JELGAVA	5 J CAKSTES BLVD, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA	1691-3043			ENG RUR DEVELOP			2010							174	181					8	Agricultural Engineering	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Agriculture	BSD58	WOS:000284206100033					2022-02-14

IMSE refers to the calculation of improved sample entropies, i.e., fuzzy sample entropies (FSampEn) across a sequence of time scales, which takes into account not only the nonlinearity but also the interactions and coupling between mechanical components, thus providing much more information regarding machine health condition compared to traditional single scale-based entropy. On the other hand, in engineering practice, the amount of fault samples is often limited, which thus decrease the performance of traditional classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANNs). Currently popular SVMs provide a favorable solution to small sample-sized problems. In this study, IMSE and SVMs were employed as fault feature extractor and classifier, respectively. The experimental results verify that the proposed method has potential applications in bearing health condition identification.

Accordingly, a new fault diagnosis method based on EMD (empirical mode decomposition)-approximate entropy and LS-SVM (least square support vector machine) was proposed. The localization characteristics of EMD and approximate entropy were utilized to quantify the fault feature, and then the LS-SVM was combined to identify fault types. Firstly, the vibration signal of fault was decomposed into some IMFs (intrinsic mode functions) by EMD, and then the approximate entropies of the first four IMFs were taken as the eigenvectors. Finally, the eigenvectors were input into LS-SVM classifier for fault type recognition. Simulation results show that this proposed method not only can effectively extract fault features, but also compared with BP (back propagation) networks, the LS-SVM network has smaller samples, shorter training time and higher recognition rate.

This paper presents a novel intelligent method for fault diagnosis based on empirical mode decomposition, fractal feature parameter extracting and orthogonal quadratic discriminant function classifier. The new method consists of three steps. Firstly, with investigating the feature of impact fault in vibration signals, the raw vibration signals are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions by empirical mode decomposition. Secondly, using the method of time sequences fractal dimension calculating, fractal feature parameters are extracted from intrinsic mode functions. Then, each raw signal sample has a feature set. Finally, training set and testing set are inputted into the orthogonal quadratic discriminant function model in the classification phase to identify different abnormal cases. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing, and the test results indicate that the novel intelligent diagnosis method is sensitive to fault severity and capable of fault detection and fault diagnosis.

Under the force of tubular columns, erosion and pressure of drilling fluids, the oil well tubing usually fails in long-term service, which always leads to accidents and stagnation of production. So it's especially necessary to detect faults in tubing. Intense-magnetic memory testing equipment for reusable offshore oil well tubing is developed for this consideration. The equipment is composed of feeding machines, baiting machines, transport machines and a detection machine. Measurement and control system decides the running sequence logic of these components and obtains fault signals of tubing. The avoidance of transport machines for oil well tubing coupling makes the transport of tubing stable. The synchronization control of transport and detection of tubing decides the accurate location of faults. The automatic switch of both detection units and measurement of fault signals makes it convenient to detect oil well tubing of multiple sizes.

Due to the complex nature of machinery, these two techniques can only diagnose about 30% to 40% of faults when used independently. Therefore, it is critical to integrate vibration analysis and wear particle analysis to provide a more effective maintenance program. This paper presents a new fault diagnosis approach of rolling bearings via the combination of vibration analysis and wear particle analysis. Both the tribological and vibrant information of the rolling bearings with typical faults were collected by an experimental test rig. Wear particle analysis was applied to the oil samples to obtain the wear particle number and size distribution, the particle texture and the chemical compositions, etc. Vibration analysis was used to get the time and frequency characteristics of the vibration data. Then, an intelligent data fusion method based on the genetic algorithm based fuzzy neural network was employed to identify the rolling bearing conditions. The analysis results suggest that the proposed method is more feasible and effective for the rolling bearing fault diagnosis than separated use of the two techniques with respect to the classification rate, and thus has application importance.

It also details a successful application to complex vacuum pumping systems. More precisely, using historical vibratory data, we first model the behavior of systems by extracting a given type of episode rules, namely First Local Maximum episode rules (FLM-rules). A subset of the extracted FLM-rules is then selected in order to further predict pumping system failures in a vibratory datastream context. The results that we got for production data are very encouraging as we predict failures with a good time scale precision. We are now deploying our solution for a customer of the semi-conductor market.

Currently there are three techniques to diagnose breast cancer: mammography, FNA (Fine Needle Aspirate) and surgical biopsy. In this paper we develop an integrated expert system for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction for breast cancer using soft computing techniques. The basic aim is to compare the various neural network models from the recent literature. Breast cancer database used for this purpose is from the University of Wisconsin (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. Three different data sets have been used, each employing different diagnostic technique. It can use diagnosis, prognosis and survivability prediction of breast cancer patient in one intelligent system. We implement six models of neural networks namely Back Propagation Algorithm, Radial Basis Function Networks, Learning vector Quantization, Probabilistic Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Network, and Competitive Neural network. Experimental Results show that different models give optimal performance for different types of data sets. However, all the models are able to solve the problem to a reasonable extent.	[Janghel, R.

C	Garvey, DR; John, M; Baumann, J			IEEE	Garvey, Dustin R.; John, Martin; Baumann, Joerg			Nonparametric Life Consumption Modeling of High End Drilling Tools	ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM, 2010 PROCEEDINGS	Reliability and Maintainability Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium/International Symposium on Product Quality and Integrity	JAN 25-28, 2010	San Jose, CA	AIAA, IEEE, ASQ, IEST, IIE, SAE, SOLE, SRE, SSS		Nonparametric regression; empirical modeling; prognostics		Equipment, process, and system prognostic techniques can be classified as belonging to one of three major classes of methods: 1) conventional reliability-based using failure times (Weibull), 2) population based with environmental considerations (e. g. proportional hazards modeling), and 3) individual based (e. g. general path model). This paper describes a new individual based, nonparametric life consumption model (LCM) that builds on the previously described path classification and estimation model (PACE). In the original implementation of the PACE, the general path model (GPM), which is the foundation of the majority of the modern individual based prognosis algorithms, is recast as a classification problem, where a current device's cumulative stress path is classified according to a series of exemplar paths and the results of the classification are used to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the device. While the PACE was shown to produce accurate estimates of the RUL, its use in "real world" applications was found to be limited since it was founded on the premise of estimating the RUL, given an observed cumulative stress at a given point in time. In other words, to estimate the RUL, the complete stress history up to that point in time must be constructible, which is rarely the case for large scale, worldwide device deployments. This short coming was overcome by redefining the prognostic question from, "what is the RUL of the device?" To, "how much life has been consumed in the latest deployment?" By making this simple modification, the problem can be approached from a different angle. Rather than attempting to classify the cumulative device stress at an instant in time, the "character" of the stress accumulation over a period of time can be classified. To do this, regression analysis is used on a device's cumulative stress path for a deployment to generate a set of parameters that define the "shape" of the stress accumulation over a particular deployment. The calculated parameters are then classified according to the regressed parameters of example failure paths. The results of the classification are then combined with the life consumptions of the exemplar paths to generate an estimate of the individual's life consumed for the deployment. These life consumption estimates can then be easily aggregated over deployments to accurately assess the individual device's remaining life. The newly proposed method will be applied to data collected from the hydraulic steering tool of a high end drilling system used for deep oil exploration, with the objective of estimating and accumulating the life consumption of example steering tools over different deployments. This paper builds on previous work in this area by developing a new life consumption estimation model that has been specifically designed to ensure that it can be viable in the "real world". The developed model was shown to be able to estimate the life consumed of an individual drilling tool to within 4-12% with uncertainties of +/- 15-35%.

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper. The feasibility of the newly proposed paradigm is also demonstrated through application examples.

It is therefore imperative to monitor the rolling bearing conditions in time in order to prevent the malfunctions of the plants. In the present paper is described a fault detection and diagnosis technique for rolling bearing multi-faults based on wavelet-principle component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN). In the diagnosis process, the wavelet analysis was firstly employed to decompose the vibration data of the rolling bearings under eight different operating conditions, and for each sample its energy of each sub-band was calculated to obtain the original feature space. Then, the PCA was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature vector and hence the most important features could be gotten. Lastly, the FKNN algorithm was employed in the pattern recognition to identify the conditions of the bearings of interest. The experimental results suggest that the sensitive fault features can be extracted efficiently after the wavelet-PCA processing, and the proposed diagnostic system is effective for the rolling bearing multi-fault diagnosis. In addition, the proposed method can achieve higher performance than that without PCA with respect to the classification rate.

Firstly, an electro-hydraulic system is introduced and a linear robust observer is designed for the system. Secondly, inner leakage and outer leakage faults of the system are experimentally simulated. Simulating results show that robust residual is sensitive to leakage faults but can not distinguish inner leakage and outer leakage in rod side. Thirdly, a nonlinear support vector machine was closely studied by regarding waveform and kurtosis index of displacement, residual, and pressure. Finally, educating and testing experiments show that the nonlinear support vector based on robust observer can diagnose all leakage faults of the system successfully.

Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method based on statistical learning theory, which can solve the classification problem of small sampling, non-linearity and high dimensionality. However, it is difficult to select suitable parameters of SVM. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a new optimization method, which is motivated by social behavior of bird flocking. The optimization method not only has strong global search capability, but is also very simple to apply. However, PSO algorithms are still not mature enough for handling some of the more complicated problems as the one posed by SVM. Therefore an improved PSO algorithm is proposed and applied in parameter optimization of support vector machine as IPSO-SVM. The characteristics of satellite dynamic control process include three typical reaction wheel failures. Here an IPSO-SVM is used in fault diagnosis and compared with neural network-based diagnostic methods. Simulation results show that the improved PSO can effectively avoid the premature phenomenon; it can also optimize the SVM parameters, and achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than artificial neural network-based diagnostic methods.

Due to an accurate automatic diagnosis and prognosis of faults, savings of the current expenses devoted to maintenance can be obtained. The aim of this work is to develop an automatic prognosis system based on vibration data. An on-line version of the Sensitivity-based Linear Learning Model algorithm for neural networks is applied over real vibrational data in order to assess its forecasting capabilities. Moreover, the behavior of the method is compared with that of an efficient and fast method, the On-line Sequential Extreme Learning Machine.

The presented work concerns a SOM based diagnostic system architecture for the monitoring of fault evolution in bearings. Bearings form an essential part of rotating machinery and their failure is one of the most common causes of machine breakdowns. A SUM based approach has been used to map time series of feature data produced by acceleration sensors in order to capture the process dynamics. The fusion of specific features and the introduction of new features related to fault severity can enable the monitoring of fault evolution. The evolution of system states showing the bearing health trend has been shown to warn of impeding failure.

When manufacturing equipment was failure, field operators used manufacturing equipment information service system to invoke the fault diagnosis web service which provided by remote diagnosis center, the web service transmitted information of failure equipment to diagnosis center, in the diagnosis center expert system was applied to analyze these information and displayed them in diagnosis webpage, the remote-experts browsed this webpage and diagnosed the equipment. After the cause of the failure was found, the system generated a maintenance direction, which helped field operator to fix the machinery.

A transfer function for the prediction of gas hydrate inventories in marine sediments	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							METHANE HYDRATE; ORGANIC-MATTER; EARLY DIAGENESIS; CONSTRAINTS; CARBON; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; DISSOCIATION; CLATHRATE; TRANSPORT	A simple prognostic tool for gas hydrate (GH) quantification in marine sediments is presented based on a diagenetic transport-reaction model approach. One of the most crucial factors for the application of diagenetic models is the accurate formulation of microbial degradation rates of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the coupled formation of biogenic methane. Wallmann et al. (2006) suggested a kinetic formulation considering the ageing effects of POC and accumulation of reaction products (CH4, CO2) in the pore water. This model is applied to data sets of several ODP sites in order to test its general validity. Based on a thorough parameter analysis considering a wide range of environmental conditions, the POC accumulation rate (POCar in g/m(2)/yr) and the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ in m) were identified as the most important and independent controls for biogenic GH formation. Hence, depth-integrated GH inventories in marine sediments (GHI in g of CH4 per cm(2) seafloor area) can be estimated as: GHI = a.POCar.GHSZ(b).exp(-GHSZ(c/POCar) /d)+e with a = 0.00214, b = 1.234, c = -3.339, d = 0.3148, e = -10.265. The transfer function gives a realistic first order approximation of the minimum GH inventory in low gas flux (LGF) systems. The overall advantage of the presented function is its simplicity compared to the application of complex numerical models, because only two easily accessible parameters need to be determined.

Ecological risk assessment and remediation of affected sites is often constrained due to lack Of suitable prognostic and diagnostic tools that provide information of abiotic-biotic interactions Occurring between contaminants and biological targets. Therefore, the identification and quantification of genes involved in the degradation of hydrocarbons may play a crucial role for evaluating the natural attenuation potential of contaminated sites and the development Of successful bioremediation strategies. Besides other gene clusters, the alk operon has been identified as a major player for alkane degradation in different soils. An oxygenase gene (alkB) codes for the initial step of the degradation of aliphatic alkalies under aerobic conditions. In this work, we present an MPN- and a real-time PCR method for the quantification of the bacterial gene alkB (coding for rubredoxin-dependent alkane monooxygenase) in environmental samples. Both approaches enable a rapid culture-independent screening of the alkB gene. in the environment, which can be used to assess the intrinsic natural attenuation potential of a site or to follow tip the on-going progress of bioremediation assays.

Defect of fatigue cracks may lead to long out-of-service periods, heavy damages of machines and severe economic consequences. With the method of finite element, vibration behavior of cracked rotors and crack detection was received considerable attention in the academic and engineering field. Various researchers studied the response of a cracked rotor and most of them are focused on the crack detection based on vibration behavior of cracked rotors. But it is often difficult to identify the crack parameters quantitatively. Second generation wavelets (SGW) finite element has good ability in modal analysis for singularity problems like a cracked rotor. Based on the fact that the feature of SGW could be designed depending on applications, a multiresolution finite element method is presented. The new model of SGW beam element is constructed. The first three natural frequencies of the rotor with different crack location and size were solved with SGW beam elements, and the database for crack diagnosis is obtained. The first three metrical natural frequencies are employed as inputs of the database and the intersection of the three frequencies contour lines predicted the normalized crack location and size. With the Bently RK4 rotor test rig, rotors with different crack location and size are tested and diagnosed. The experimental results denote the cracks quantitative identification method has higher identification precision. With SGW finite element method, a novel method is presented that has higher precision and faster computing speed to identify the crack location and size.

J	Wang, QH; Zhang, YY; Zhu, YS				Wang Qinghua; Zhang Youyun; Zhu Yongsheng			Neural Network Compact Ensemble and Its Applications	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural network compact ensemble(NNCE); combination weights; classification performance; fault diagnosis		There has been many methods in constructing neural network (NN) ensembles, where the method of simultaneous training has succeed in generalization performance and efficiency. But just like regular methods of constructing NN ensembles, it follows the two steps, first training component networks, and then combining them. As the two steps being independent, an assumption is used to facilitate interactions among NNs during the training stage. This paper presents a compact ensemble method which integrates the two steps of ensemble construction into one step by attempting to train individual NNs in an ensemble and weigh the individual members adaptively according to their individual performance in the same learning process. This provides an opportunity for the individual NNs to interact with each other based on their real contributions to the ensemble. The classification performance of NN compact ensemble (NNCE) was validated through some benchmark problems in machine learning, including Australian credit card assessment, pima Indians diabetes, heart disease, breast cancer and glass. Compared with other ensembles, the classification error rate of NNCE can be decreased by 0.45% to 68%. In addition, the NNCE was applied to fault diagnosis for rolling element bearing. The 11 time-domain statistical features are extracted as the properties of data, and the NNCE is employed to classify the data. With the results of several experiments, the compact ensemble method is shown to give good generalization performance. The compact ensemble method can recognize the different fault types and various fault degrees of the same fault type.

J	Zhang, FP; Lu, JP; Tang, SY; Sun, HF; Jiao, L				Zhang Faping; Lu Jiping; Tang Shuiyuan; Sun Houfang; Jiao Li			Locating Error Considering Dimensional Errors Modeling for Multistation Manufacturing System	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						multistation manufacturing process; error propagation; dimensional errors; state space model	VARIATION PROPAGATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Multistation machining process is widely applied in contemporary manufacturing environment. Modeling of variation propagation in multistation machining process is one of the most important research scenarios. Due to the existence of multiple variation streams, it is challenging to model and analyze variation propagation in a multi-station system. Current approaches to error modeling for multistation machining process are not explicit enough for error control and ensuring final product quality. In this paper, a mathematic model to depict the part dimensional variation of the complex multistation manufacturing process is formulated. A linear state space dimensional error propagation equation is established through kinematics analysis of the influence of locating parameter variations and locating datum variations on dimensional errors, so the dimensional error accumulation and transformation within the multistation process are quantitatively described. A systematic procedure to build the model is presented, which enhances the way to determine the variation sources in complex machining systems.

Design/methodology/approach - The structure of TMR system is designed to be multi-master and multi-save. According to the multi-machine environment, an invalidation detecting mechanism is designed. Considering the advantage and weakness of the traditional PULL and PUSH heartbeat model, the mechanism combines PUSH model with PULL model. To further enhance real-time ability and reliability of the invalidation detecting mechanism, hierarchy heartbeat monitor and integrating the heartbeat message into data transmission are designed in the mechanism. Findings - The invalidation detecting mechanism combines PUSH with PULL heartbeat monitor model can enhance reliability and decrease the system misdiagnosis rate greatly. By adapting hierarchy heartbeat mechanism and integrating the heartbeat detecting message into the data transmission, the system communication cost is decreased and the input-to-output response time is shortened. The effectiveness and reliability of this mechanism are proved by system field commissioning and MATLAB simulation. Originality/value - Using a new heartbeat invalidation detecting mechanism, this paper provides a new way of fault diagnosis of TMR multi-machine system.

Design/methodology/approach - A time stepping finite element method (FEM) analysis is performed for the study of IM with inter-turn fault and determining the machine parameters (self and mutual inductances) after occurring fault. A simple dynamic model for IM with inter-turn fault is presented. The model parameters are obtained by FEM analysis. An experimental test is also carried out to verify the results. Findings - The behavior of IM is studied under various insulation failure inter-turn fault conditions and severity using FEM. The paper's results help the machine designers to improve the fault tolerance as well the overall design of the machine drive system. It can also be useful for predict and detection of fault in IM. Practical implications - Predicting and detection of turn faults in IM are in industry very. helpful because it avoids the fully damage of IM and it is more easy to repair the machine. Designing a fault tolerant IM is required in some applications for increasing the reliability. Originality/value - By using FEM for studying the fault, the machine parameters which are calculated with FEM and the study's results are very precise and accurate because the flux fluctuation after occurring fault has been taken into account. On the other hand, the fault model is very fast, global and accurate. It can be used in model-based health monitoring systems.

Power System Protection Using Machine Learning Technique	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN POWER ENGINEERING	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT CLASSIFICATION; TRANSMISSION-SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; SCHEME	This chapter presents a new approach for distance relaying of transmission line using machine intelligence technique such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). SVM is a relatively new computational learning method based on the statistical learning theory. The proposed technique is used for developing protection schemes for Thyristor Controlled Series Compensated (TCSC) Line using post fault current samples for half cycle (10 samples) from the inception of the fault and firing angle as inputs to the SVM. Three SVMs are trained to provide fault classification, ground detection and section identification respectively for the TCSC line. Also SVM is used for faulty phase selection and ground detection in large power transmission system without TCSC. The method uses post fault current and voltage samples for 1/4(th) cycle (5 samples) as inputs to SVM-1 to result faulty phase selection. SVM-2 is trained and tested with zero sequence components of fundamental, 3(rd) and 5(th) harmonic components of the post fault current signal to result the involvement of ground in the fault process. The polynomial and Gaussian kernel based SVMs are designed to provide most optimized boundary for classification. The classification test results from SVMs are accurate for simulation model as well as experimental set-up, and thus provides fast and robust protection scheme for distance relaying in transmission line.

The radial forces dependent on the distribution of the flux density in the air gap region of the machine. These forces are influenced by the natural aspects of the PMSM such as rotor and stator slots, saturations and winding type but also on the health state of the machine as for example the eccentricity. The aim of this work is to study the effect of eccentricity on radial forces in PMSM. For this purpose an analytical and numerical model for calculating radial force taking into account eccentricity are developed. Thus an experimental test bench has been developed to validate the proposed model in the case of a dynamic eccentricity fault.	[Rezig, A.; Mekideche, M.

Software redundancy design for a Human-Machine Interface in railway vehicles	COMPUTERS IN RAILWAYS XII: COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGN AND OPERATION IN RAILWAYS AND OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Computer System Design and Operation in the Railway and other Transit Systems	AUG 31-SEP 02, 2010	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	WIT, Transact Built Environ		human-machine interface; reliability; software fault tolerance; redundancy design; reliability analysis		The Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which displays the real-time status of electrical systems, interacts with the driver or operator, and collects and reports system fault information, is an important device in railway vehicles. The HMI is a critical component of the control and diagnosis system in the railway vehicle, thus the reliability of the HMI software affects the reliability and safety of the whole railway vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to design the HMI software with high reliability for railway vehicles so as to ensure the reliability, stability and safety of the railway vehicle operation. This paper analyzes the HMI software function requirements, which include information display, the human-machine interaction, and communication. A kind of redundancy mechanism is proposed, which employs two structural redundancy methods: N-version programming and recovery blocks. The HMI software is divided into the information display module, the human-machine interaction module and the communication module, and each module is made up of some components. Based on the analysis of the reliability requirement, complexity, and the implementation cost for each component in the HMI software modules, the corresponding redundancy design mechanism is proposed, which consider the tradeoff between the reliability and the cost. In order to evaluate the reliability of the designed redundancy mechanism, a scenario-based reliability analysis method is used to calculate the reliability of the HMI software, which constructs five scenarios and employs the component dependency graph to compute the reliability. The reliability of the HMI software after redundancy design is compared with that before the redundancy design.

Affordable High-Integrity Controls	CONFERENCE: AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING: LAND-TECHNIK 2010 - PARTNERSCHAFTEN FUR NEUR INNOVATIONSPOTENZIALE	VDI Berichte		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Agricultural Engineering - LAND TECHNIK 2010	OCT 27-28, 2010	Braunschweig, GERMANY					During each of the past three decades, a different set of machines has transitioned from mechanical to electronic controls. In the 1980s it was aircraft with fly-by-wire and glass cockpit technologies. In the 1990s it was automotive motivated by standards for exhaust emission and on-board diagnostics. And in the 2000s it has been off-road machines transitioning from mechanical to electronic control driven by diesel engine emission standards and an increasing array of machine attachments needing precise operator controls. As these machines have evolved to more electronic controls, technologies to provide high-integrity controls have been needed and developed. These technologies involve deterministic communications, high-reliability controllers, and software processes and tools that validate the software code. To understand the practicality of these technologies, a prototype tractor was developed with an x-by-wire design for both the braking and steering systems. This paper will outline these technologies and the steps to implement them to deliver a fault-tolerant x-by-wire tractor. From this development, some conclusions were drawn that then lead to two new developments: 1) investigating processes and technologies that can provide the level of fault tolerance needed for off-road applications thus minimizing the number of redundant components and 2) the time criticality of the embedded system. In this paper we describe an approach where high-integrity controls can be achieved in off-road machines at an affordable cost for development and system implementation.

By using the magnitude and the phase of a target motor, fault probability is calculated based on their distributions of healthy motors obtained beforehand. Examination using motors with turn-to-turn short circuit faults proved that the method proposed is quite effective.

J	Tran, V; Yang, BS				Tran, Van Tung; Yang, Bo-Suk			Machine fault diagnosis and condition prognosis using classification and regression trees and neuro-fuzzy inference systems	CONTROL AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; classification; induction motors; decision trees; forecasts; fuzzy systems	INDUCTION-MOTORS; EMBEDDING DIMENSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; PREDICTION; KNOWLEDGE	This paper presents an approach to machine fault diagnosis and condition prognosis based on classification and regression trees (CART) and neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In case of diagnosis, CART is used as a feature selection tool to select pertinent features from data set, while ANFIS is used as a classifier. The crisp rules obtained from CART are then converted to fuzzy if-then rules, employed to identify the structure of ANFIS classifier. The hybrid of back-propagation and least squares algorithm are utilized to tune the parameters of the membership functions. The data sets obtained from vibration signals and current signals of the induction motors are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm. In case of prognosis, both of these models in association with direct prediction strategy for long-term prediction of time series techniques are utilized to forecast the future values of machine operating condition. In this case, the number of available observations and the number of predicted steps are initially determined by false nearest neighbor method and auto mutual information technique, respectively. These values are subsequently utilized as inputs for prediction models. The performance of the proposed prognosis system is then evaluated by using real trending data of a low methane compressor. A comparative study of the predicted results obtained from CART and ANFIS models is also carried out to appraise the prediction capability of these models. The results of the proposed methods in both cases indicate that CART and ANFIS offer a potential for machine fault diagnosis and for condition prognosis.

J	Zhou, R; Bao, W; Li, N; Huang, X; Yu, DR				Zhou, Rui; Bao, Wen; Li, Ning; Huang, Xin; Yu, Daren			Mechanical equipment fault diagnosis based on redundant second generation wavelet packet transform	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Second generation wavelet packet transform; Lifting scheme; Feature extraction; Fault diagnosis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LIFTING SCHEME; RECOGNITION; CONSTRUCTION	Wavelet transform has been widely used for the vibration signal based mechanical equipment fault diagnosis. However, the decomposition results of the discrete wavelet transform do not possess time invariant property, which may result in the loss of useful information and decrease the classification accuracy of fault diagnosis. To overcome this deficiency, a novel fault diagnosis method based on the redundant second generation wavelet packet transform is proposed. Firstly, the redundant second generation wavelet packet transform is constructed on the basis of second generation wavelet transform and redundant lifting scheme. Secondly, the vibration signals are decomposed by redundant second generation wavelet packet transform and then the faulty features are extracted from the resultant wavelet packet coefficients. Finally, the extracted fault features are given as input to classifiers for identification. The proposed method is applied for the fault diagnosis of gearbox and gasoline engine valve trains.

Accelerated natural fault diagnosis in slow speed bearings with Acoustic Emission	ENGINEERING FRACTURE MECHANICS			English	Article						Slow speed bearings; Acoustic Emission; Condition monitoring; Source location; Size of natural defect		Rolling element bearings are the most common cause of rotating machinery failure. Over the past 20 years. Acoustic Emission (AE) technology has evolved as a significant opportunity to monitor and diagnose the mechanical integrity of rolling element bearings. This paper presents results of an investigation to assess the potential of the Acoustic Emission (AE) technology for detecting and locating natural defects in rolling element bearings. To undertake this task a special purpose test-rig was built that allowed for accelerated natural degradation of a bearing race. It is concluded that sub-surface initiation and subsequent crack propagation can be detected using a range of data analysis techniques on AE's generated from natural degrading bearings. The paper also investigates the source characterisation of AE signals associated with a defective bearing whilst in operation. This study also attempted to identify the size of a natural defect on bearings using AE technology. In conclusion, the results from this investigation show that whilst measurements on operational bearings cannot be achieved as described in this paper, the method of identifying the onset of crack propagation can be employed as a quality control tool for bearing manufacturers particularly for testing bearing material homogeneity.

J	Liao, L; Lee, J				Liao, Linxia; Lee, Jay			Design of a reconfigurable prognostics platform for machine tools	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Prognostics; Machine performance assessment; Reconfigurable platform; Machine tool	FAULT-DETECTION; DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM; MAINTENANCE; MANAGEMENT	For decades, researchers and practitioners have been trying to develop and deploy prognostics technologies with ad hoc and trial-and-error approaches. These efforts have resulted in limited success, due to the fact that it lacks a systematic approach and platform in deploying the right prognostics tools for the right applications. This paper introduces a methodology for designing a reconfigurable prognostics platform (RPP) which can be easily and effectively used to assess and predict the performance of machine tools. RPP can be installed on the equipment and it has the prognostic capabilities to convert the data into performance-related information. The equipment performance information can then be integrated into the enterprise asset management system for maintenance decision making through the Internet. Two industrial cases are used to validate the effectiveness of applying the RPP for different prognostic applications as well as the reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed RPP.

Precise wavelet for current signature in 3(phi) IM	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Pattern classification; Current signature analysis; Feature extraction; Feature selection; Wavelet transforms; Support Vector Machine (SVM)		induction motors, which are used worldwide as the "workhorse" in industrial applications, are intermittently subjected to faults, mainly the stator faults. In this paper, fault diagnostics of induction motor using current signature analysis, with wavelet transform, is treated as a pattern classification problem. The major steps in pattern classification are feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The feature extraction is done by wavelet transforms, using different wavelets which allow the use of long time intervals where there is precise low-frequency information, and shorter regions where there is precise high-frequency information. The extracted features are classified using the new generation pattern classification technique of Support Vector Machine (SVM) identification. Then the relative capability of the different wavelets, in performing the stator winding fault identification is analyzed and the best wavelet is selected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

C	Tiong, UH; Clark, G		Lukas, P		Tiong, Ung Hing; Clark, Graham			The structural environment as a factor affecting coating failure in aircraft joints	FATIGUE 2010	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Fatigue Conference	JUN 06-11, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Coating failure; Mechanically-induced strains; Aircraft joints; Joint displacement; Finite element analysis	DEGRADATION	For critical aircraft structural features such as mechanically fastened joints, coatings which prevent the ingress of moisture are vital for preventing the onset of corrosion which might require costly rectification or, at worst, threaten structural integrity. While aircraft coatings are usually of relatively high quality, they must provide a long service life in a demanding environment, with thermal cycles, high levels of ultraviolet radiation, and mechanical loading. To date, the effect of load history on coating longevity has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in promoting coating failure at specific sites (such as joints) and the rate of coating degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints and also outlines the factors which influence the complex strain history at joints. The research identifies the important regions in a joint and specifically the strain concentration locations where coatings are likely to fail. These regions include exposed sheet ends, shear interfaces and fastener heads. Finite element modelling and experimental testing of a generic joint configuration, which is representative of many light military and civil aircraft structures, is use to predict the sheet end movements under the maximum load capacity of the joint, and to measure critical displacements which would be experienced by a coating layer at the interfaces.

The method is based on Extended Discrete-Furrier Transform or EDFT. The principle is that any fault either in the stator or the rotor may distort the sinusoidal response of the motor RPM and the main frequency. Because the EDFT relates to both amplitude and frequency of number of harmonics in a signal, hence it is expected to show some harmonics around the mains frequency and some frequencies which have ability to differentiate the faults. The method is tested on 3 different motor conditions: healthy, stator fault, and rotor fault motor at full load condition. The experiments show that it can differentiate conditions clearly by observing the change in specific harmonic amplitudes. The method can also indicate the level of the fault severity by observing the percent change in the harmonic amplitudes.

The aeronautics industry belongs to one these activity fields which are trying to carry out important changes around its maintenance strategy. It needs to minimize the cost for the maintenance support and to increase its operational reliability and availability (avoiding delays, cancellations, etc) which would lead to a further decrease in costs. However, to support this change, it requires transforming the traditional corrective maintenance practice of "fail and fix" to "prevent and predict". The aim of this article is to show the usefulness and the benefits of innovative techniques such as Bayesian Networks to support an intelligent function "decision support", the basis for the new type of maintenance strategy based on prediction and prognosis. It helps to achieve a maximum optimization of resources and operational availability while minimizing economic costs, and replaces the current maintenance carried out in the aircraft industry up to now.

Much work has been put into it and is available with literature. However, little work has been done in the scope of modeling the system with a view towards simulating and analyzing the dynamic behavior of the system as governed by the hybrid control architecture. This attempt is quite significant at the design stage, wherein fault-diagnosis can be easily done and rectified for. The aim of this paper is to present such a model for the adopted architecture and simulate the dynamic behavior of the system. Discussion regarding the logical organization and integrity between various modules has been presented, including abstraction between device layer and the controlling sub-systems. Overall dynamic behavior of the system has been realized through a hybrid finite system machine (FSM), thereby exhibiting the essential combination between a continuous reactive layer and discrete event-based deliberative sub-system. The required modeling of FSM and control-subsystems has been done with Stateflow/Simulink from Matlab. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Das, S. K.; Shome, S.

Herein, a method for optimizing membership functions is proposed based on the statistical properties of vibration spectra and identifying fuzzy measures based on interaction levels using partial correlation coefficients between spectra. The possibility of a given fault is obtained from fuzzy integrals using membership degrees determined by the membership function, and the fuzzy measures for the set of spectra. The method is also evaluated using the example of diagnosis of misalignment and unbalance faults.

In this study, a GMR sensor is connected through a signal conditioner to a wireless node. By exploiting the sensitivity of GMR sensors to near-field changes in magnetic flux, it is postulated that GMR sensor could detect vibration of a ferromagnetic structure without contact. The wireless GMR sensor node samples the signal of the sensor and transmits it wirelessly to a personal computer to display the frequency spectrum. Preliminary tests indicated that the sensor is able to detect the vibration of a 440-Hz tuning fork and the increase vibration due to imbalance of a rotor on a fault simulator. Vibration analysis is one way to observe the health condition of a machine. Moving parts of a machine generate vibrations, which can be observed in the frequency spectrum of approximately 10 Hz to 5 kHz. Faults of typical rotating machinery such as misalignment, imbalance and bearing wear out will produce increased amplitudes of vibration and exhibit frequency harmonics. As such, the condition of bearings and other moving components can be monitored. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using wireless GMR sensor node for detection of vibrations of a ferromagnetic structure.	[Goh, K. M.; Chan, H. L.; Ong, S. H.; Moh, W.

Based on the failure mechanism analysis of axial piston pump, the abrasion resulting from uneven contact between valve plate and cylinder barrel is the crux. With measured value, this paper presents a updated grey model and algorithm flow based on fix dimension updated technique and 8 filter, in which the grey model overcomes the influence of uncertainty and disturbance and 8 filter improves the quality of original data. Through renewing the information of grey model dynamically, the precision of prognostics increases greatly. Application indicates that the updated grey prediction algorithm could strengthen the scoring of new data and improve the prognostic accuracy with limit data.

A novel application is presented exploring the problem of detection and estimation of the various defects; the early detection and classification of aircraft defects is of particular importance, as the defects can lead to severe problem due to material failure, component analysis was performed initially to extract the features and to reduce the dimension of the original data features. Kernel parameters selection of support vector machine is a very important problem, which has great influence on the performance of support vector machine. This paper exploits the parameter optimization procedure to ensure the generalization ability of SVM. The result shows that multi-class SVM produces promising results and has the potential for use in fault diagnosis.

Hence the stator inter-turn fault is one of the most difficult faults to discriminate and detect in an induction machine. Discrimination of the stator inter-turn fault from stator electrical asymmetry essentially helps to arrange maintenance in a proper schedule. In this paper, a simple on-line load test is proposed to detect the presence of stator inter-turn fault under stator electric asymmetrical condition of the machine. The proposed test is based on the observation of steady-state stator current locus with change in load. The test procedure does not require additional sensors, training and database, past history of the machine and speed measurement. It is also applicable to any unknown machine. This paper presents analytical studies and experiments on a faulted and electrically asymmetrical motors to confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed load test.

Furthermore interference of the fault indicator with control dynamics of the load level lower the accuracy of most detection methods proposed. These disturbances can be avoided if the detection can be realized at standstill of the drive using the inverter as a measurement device. In this paper the sensitivity of a method is analyzed that enables the detection of rotor bar defects at zero load and around standstill. The method is based on the excitation of the machine with voltage pulses generated by the switching of the inverter. Measuring the resulting response of the machine phase currents, the spatial distribution of the transient inductance can be identified with high accuracy. An asymmetry in the rotor bars leads to a distinct change in the spatial distribution of the transient flux linkage and thus also of the transient inductance. The accuracy is such that even partial broken bars can be detected. Measurements on a machine with a specially manufactured copper rotor cage are presented. The resistance of a single bar is stepwise increased by changing the material of the bar from copper to aluminum, brass, and finally steel. It is shown that even the stepwise increase of a single bar resistance before the bar is broken can be clearly detected. It is thus possible to monitor the machine even for a developing rotor defect.

Use of high order harmonics for diagnosis of simultaneous faults via Wigner-Ville distributions	IECON 2010 - 36TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)/4th IEEE International Conference on E-Learning in Industrial Electronics/IES Industry Forum	NOV 07-10, 2010	Glendale, AZ	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE), IEEE Ind Elect Soc, New Jersey Sci & Technol Univ, New Jersey Inst Technol (NJIT), N Carolina State Univ (NCSU), Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE), Auburn Univ, Intel, Altera, IEEE Phoenix Sect			ROTOR BAR DETECTION; INDUCTION MACHINES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; MOTORS; DWT	In this paper, high-order fault-related current harmonics are used for the diagnosis and discrimination between two different faults in induction machines: rotor asymmetries and mixed eccentricities, both when only these faults are simultaneously present in the machine and when they are combined with other non-fault related phenomena. The idea is to track the evolutions of both the high-order fault-related harmonics and the low-frequency ones during the startup transient, making use of suitable time-frequency decomposition tools. In this work, a Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD)-based method is proposed, since this is a tool showing a good trade-off between frequency resolutions at high and low frequencies, despite other Time Frequency Decomposition (TFD) tools could be also valid. As stated by several authors, use of high-order harmonics can provide very useful information for the diagnosis, mainly in those cases in which the only identification of low-frequency fault-related components might be not enough conclusive (presence of inter-bar currents, effect of load torque oscillations, etc.). In the paper, several cases corresponding to single and combined faults are presented. Simulated and experimental results show the ability of the tool for tracking those fault-related components, enabling the diagnosis of the aforementioned faults, even when these faults are combined or coexist with other phenomena which could interfere the diagnosis, such as pulsating load torques.

The main goal is to apply two feature-based ensemble construction methods to a real-world problem. Recent studies have shown that the use of ensembles of classifiers that are accurate and at the same time have diversifying results can improve the final classification accuracy, compared to a single accurate classifier. The diversification performed by the methods presented in this work is obtained by varying the feature set each classifier uses. We show results obtained with the established genetic algorithm GEFS and a recently developed approach called BSFS, which has lower computational cost. We rely on a database of real data, with 2000 acquisitions of vibration signals extracted from operational motor pumps. Our results show that the ensemble methods had a higher classification accuracy solving a real-world fault diagnosis problem than single classifiers. Also, we present promising results in our experiments with both algorithms, that successfully solves the problem.

Current-based bearing fault detection has significant advantages over traditional vibration-based methods in terms of cost, implementation, and system reliability. This paper proposes a new wavelet filter-based method for incipient bearing fault detection using electric machine stator currents. The proposed method can dramatically increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the bearing fault related signals in the stator current samples. The normalized energy of the wavelet-filtered stator current signals is mainly related to bearing faults and is applied as the index for bearing fault detection. Experiments are carried out for an induction machine with developed bearing faults; the results show that the proposed method is effective to detect the bearing faults at an early stage.

Commonly rotary machine faults described in this paper are misalignment fault, bearing cage defect, ball bearing defect, bearing outer race fault and inner race fault. The use of structural resonance frequency, ISO 10816 for vibration level assessment, spectrum assessment for misalignment and bearing faults have been detailed. Beside fault diagnosis, repair action has been included to recommend different maintenance plans according to the faulty conditions. These methods form the basis of a knowledge-based system for diagnosis. The results have been successfully tested on a Hitachi Seiki high speed milling machine. The developed diagnosis platform minimized the need for human intervention in rotary machine performance monitoring and degradation detection.	[Lim, W. Q.; Zhang, D. H.; Zhou, J. H.; Belgi, P.

This floating-space-vector technique is developed based upon space-vector concepts, and its mathematical formulation is elaborated in this paper. The technique is verified numerically as well as experimentally using a 7.2kW PM machine as a wind generator. The numerical model is based on a multi-physics model of a PM generator. The simulation and experiments are performed under the uncertainties of generator speed, number of shorted turns and fault resistance value. The calculated results show the robustness, accuracy, and proper speed response of the technique.

Both share commonalities, with prognosis being the succeeding phase of diagnosis. In this paper, a prognosis algorithm based on the statistical hidden Markov model, is presented for the electrical faults of permanent magnet AC machines. The model parameters are computed by using the training outputs of the diagnosis phase. The algorithm estimates the failure state probability for each sampled observation. Time-frequency features extracted from the torque producing component of the machine current is used as the health indicator. The remaining useful life is estimated in terms of the probability of failure state. Parameter training of Hidden Markov Models generally need huge amounts of historical data, which are often not available in the case of highly reliable electrical machines. A method, which uses experimental observations, is presented for the computation of the state dependent observation probability densities from the limited data	[Zaidi, Sycd Sajjad H.; Aviyente, Selin; Strangas, E.

For rolling bearing fault detection, it is expected that a desired time domain analysis method has good computational efficiency. The point of interest of this investigation is the presence of an effective method for multi-fault diagnosis in such systems with extracting features in time-domain from the vibration signals and multi-class support vector machine (MSVM) that used to the detection and classification of rolling-element bearing faults. The roller bearings nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature are to be extracted through some indirect means. The method consists of two stages. Firstly, the features in time-domain from the vibration signals, which are widely used in fault diagnostics, are extracted. Finally, the features that extracted are classified successfully using MSVM classifier and the work condition and fault patterns of the roller bearings and then faults are diagnosis real tine based on Voting.

This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach capable of distributing the control effort among actuators on the basis of PHM information, exploiting relations between control effort and actuator degradation. Constraints are then imposed to ensure that the accumulated actuator degradation will not reach a unsafe level at the end of M-H. A simulated tank level control system is used as a case study to illustrate the details of the proposed approach. The results show that the predictive controller distributes the control effort in a suitable manner to relieve the actuator with larger accumulated damage.

The initial study on the rotor incipient fault in induction machines consisted of the energy evaluation of a known low frequency bandwidth through time-scale analysis. It was shown that the stator current space vector magnitude (SCSVM) and the instantaneous magnitude of stator current (IMSC) are both good candidates to be used as an indicator for incipient rotor fault monitoring in the steady-state working condition of the induction machine. In this paper, it will be demonstrated that in the case of load fluctuation, there exists a time-varying dc component that may affect the energy criterion, resulting in a false alarm. Thus, a new technique based on a numerical phase lock loop (NPLL) is utilized to estimate and then remove this time-varying component before the SCSVM and IMSC energy calculations through time-scale analysis to handle this problem. Moreover, by definition of new frequency bandwidths associated with incipient stator fault in the rotor current signature, this technique can be extended to a more general slip independent incipient stator/rotor fault detection technique in wound-rotor induction machines. This proposal is validated through experimental tests based on a 10hp wound-rotor induction machine test-rig.

First a model for a four-rotor vehicle, obtained via a Lagrange approach, is presented. In order to stabilize the quadrotor at low cruise speed, a control strategy based on nested saturation controllers is presented. Using a Thau's observer, a diagnostic system has been developed for the nonlinear model of the quadrotor. Different simulation trials have been performed and the analysis of the results proves that the developed diagnostic system represents an effective solution to the problem of actuator fault detection in mini-flying machines.

Since the costs of maintenance contribute a substantial portion of the production costs, companies must budget maintenance effectively. Machine deterioration prognosis can decrease the costs of maintenance by minimizing the loss of production due to machine breakdown and avoiding the overstocking of spare parts. This paper gives a review of some fault detection and prognosis methods to diagnose faults and failure on rotating electrical machines. To develop the monitoring system accelerometers have been used to acquire vibration measurements. Performance are studied on a laboratory-scale experimental system.

Electrical and mechanical models of fault due to a partial short-circuit on one phase is described and used on a numerical simulation in order to detect and localize the fault. Fault detection is realized by a diagnostic observer (Kalman filter) which generates residual functions depending on the kind of fault. This diagnostic observer is designed by the Luenberger method and uses vibration measures to generate these residual functions.	[Ojeda, X.; Li, G.

This lead to operate power units in a discontinuous way and also machine types that are not normally designed to operate in such way, like steam and some gas turbo-generators, are forced to start and stop often during the day. Mechanical faults can increase and their quick identification plays a fundamental role in reducing fixing costs and off-line times.

Moreover, a cyclic quantification of the fault extent over time was introduced for accurate rotor fault detection. Simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of this new method in discriminating healthy from faulty rotor in time-varying operating conditions.

Three methods using different signals such as stator or rotor current and the leakage flux will be described and experimented. The rotor currents provide interesting signatures since the stator faults introduce new harmonics in the rotor windings. Hence, in this paper, it is proved that sensing one rotor current by using a current sensor is one of possible techniques for detecting this kind of electrical fault. The leakage flux is another alternative for this kind of problems since in this paper; it is proved that a simple external leakage flux sensor is efficient to detect, in the low frequency range, the internturn short circuit in three-phase induction machines even in presence of power supply harmonics. Stator currents space vector is also an interesting technique since it is proved that inter-turn short circuit faults can be considered as a stator unbalance which can be detected using negative sequence of stator currents. The comparison of these three methods is performed using experiments on a 5.5kW-220V/380V-50Hz-8 poles wound-rotor induction machine working in both healthy and faulty modes at different load conditions.

Rotor Fault Detection in Induction Motors Using the Fast Orthogonal Search Algorithm	IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE 2010)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE)	JUL 04-07, 2010	Bari, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc, Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE)		Condition monitoring; current signature analysis; fast orthogonal search; induction motor; rotor fault detection		This paper presents a method of detecting rotor faults in induction motors using the fast orthogonal search (FOS). Proper online condition monitoring of induction machines is very important to ensure safe operation, timely maintenance, and efficiency. It has been shown that when a fault occurs in the rotor, it will exhibit itself as a series of sidebands around the fundamental frequency in the stator current, which can be detected using a spectrum analyzer. Conventional methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are inadequate for motors operating under light load because the fault signatures will be close to the fundamental. Therefore a balance between resolution and sampling time must be achieved, which is difficult with the FFT. The higher degree of resolution of FOS makes it a promising choice for broken bar detectection in motors operating under light load, and the reduction in sampling time is beneficial for motors that are prone to transient conditions. Experimental results using a 1/4 horsepower motor with a rotor winding fault are presented to verify this approach.

This data imbalance issue seriously affects the performance evaluation of fault diagnosis algorithms. Due to the limitations of conventional accuracy (ACC) and geometric mean (G-mean) measures, this paper discusses the application of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in evaluating distribution fault diagnosis performance. After introducing how to obtain ROC curves, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Immune Recognition Systems (AIRS), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm are compared using ROC curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) on real-world fault datasets from Progress Energy Carolinas. Experimental results show that AIRS performs best most of the time and ANN is potentially a good algorithm with a proper decision threshold.

Whereas major winding faults can be easily identified from supply current magnitude, minor faults involving less than 5% of turns are not readily discernible. The present work documents experimental results for monitoring of minor short circuit faults in stator windings of induction motor. Motor line current has been analyzed using modern signal processing and data reduction tools combining Park's transformation and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). Support Vector Machine (SVM) based data classification tool has been used for fault characterization based on fault features extracted using CWT.

Such measurement originated uncertainties cause difficulties in interpreting measurement results obtained from practical power transformer insulation diagnosis methods using Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) and Polarisation and Depolarisation Current (PDC) measurement techniques. A support vector machine (SVM) algorithm has been developed in this paper to tackle any measurement originated uncertainties.

One of the major problems faced in the operation of distance relays is to distinguish between a symmetrical fault and a power swing. Also, fast and reliable detection of symmetrical faults, occurring during power swing blocking, poses another challenge. This paper introduces a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based power swing identification scheme, which, along with the conventional impedance measuring unit, is able to detect and discriminate power swings from symmetrical faults occurring in the system. The proposed scheme has been tested on WSCC 9-bus system and its performance has been compared with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference System (ANFIS) based power swing blocking scheme.

In this paper, a new approach to transformer fault diagnosis is introduced based on the idea of exchanging information with explicit, formal and machine accessible descriptions of meaning by using the Semantic Web. An ontology model is developed for accurate and efficient fault diagnosis for power transformers. Through the use of this model, various transformer fault diagnostic methods can be integrated to describe and inference among fault phenomena, fault sources and causes of faults. The proposed ontology model provides a dedicated semantic model for knowledge representation and information management concerning fault diagnosis of power transformers.	[Wang, D.; Tang, W.

However, these sensors are rarely used for commercial machines requiring safety since it is difficult to eliminate the possibility of failure. Although fault tolerance is an important issue, no critical method for general force measurement is proposed in the past. Hence, this paper proposes a fault tolerance measurement method using sensing devices with redundancy. The proposed method accomplishes both: fault detection without additional sensors; and force estimation during fault period. Furthermore, the fault detection handles many kinds of faults such as disconnection of wires, peeling of strain gauge, and so on. The validity of the proposed method is verified through some simulations and experiments.

Disturbance Detection, Identification, and Recovery by Gait Transition in Legged Robots	IEEE/RSJ 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems	OCT 18-22, 2010	Taipei, TAIWAN				MACHINES; STATE	We present a framework for detecting, identifying, and recovering within stride from faults and other leg contact disturbances encountered by a walking hexapedal robot. Detection is achieved by means of a software contact-event sensor with no additional sensing hardware beyond the commercial actuators' standard shaft encoders. A simple finite state machine identifies disturbances as due either to an expected ground contact, a missing ground contact indicating leg fault, or an unexpected "wall" contact. Recovery proceeds as necessary by means of a recently developed topological gait transition coordinator. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system by presenting preliminary data arising from two reactive behaviors - wall avoidance and leg-break recovery. We believe that extensions of this framework will enable reactive behaviors allowing the robot to function with guarded autonomy under widely varying terrain and self-health conditions.

J	Gebraeel, N				Gebraeel, Nagi			Prognostics-Based Identification of the Top-k Units in a Fleet	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Condition monitoring; prognostics; residual life distributions; stochastic models	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; ACCELERATED DEGRADATION; RELIABILITY MODEL; INFERENCE; REGRESSION	This paper considers a fleet of identical units where each unit consists of the same critical components. The degradation state of each critical component is assumed to be monitored by an on-board sensor. The paper presents a methodology for identifying the top-(the most reliable) units in a fleet using sensor-based prognostic information. Specifically, we develop a Prognostics-Based Ranking (PBR) algorithm that combines stochastic degradation models with computer science database ranking algorithms. The stochastic degradation modeling framework is used to compute and update, in real-time, residual life distributions (RLDs) of the critical components of each unit. Using a base case exponential degradation model, we identify conditions necessary to establish stochastic ordering among the RLDs of similar components. A preference relationship, consistent with the stochastic ordering results, is then used to sort the units of the fleet based on the RLDs of their respective components. A database ranking algorithm, known as the Threshold Algorithm (TA), is then used to identify the top-units without necessarily computing all the RLDs. The paper concludes with an illustrative example. Note to Practitioners-The Prognostics-Based Ranking Algorithm is well suited for maintenance planning and scheduling in large scale fleet management applications. The PBR algorithm uses sensor signals from identical components on different units in a fleet, and proceeds to rank these units based on the residual lives of these components. The amplitude of the signal and the corresponding operational time are used to make inferences of the statistical distribution of the residual life of the component that is being monitored. The degradation modeling framework presented herein can be used to model various types of degradation signals that can be characterized using parametric functional forms. In this paper, we present a base case model that is suitable for engineering applications where the sensor signals follow an exponential path.

Acceleration-Performance Optimization for Motors With Large Air Gaps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines	SEP 06-09, 2008	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL			Acceleration; large air gaps; magnetic levitation; permanent magnets; synchronous machines; yield optimization	ECCENTRICITY FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS; INDUCTION-MOTORS; DESIGN; MACHINE; DRIVES	This paper presents an optimization-procedure yielding for minimal acceleration times for different speed ranges using the example of a magnetically levitated slice motor with a large air gap. The optimization is based on a set of analytical equations together with selected 3-D finite element method simulations with the aim to optimize both the stator geometry and the number of drive turns. It is shown that the use of 3-D instead of 2-D simulation tools is obligatory for motors with large air gaps for achieving sufficient simulation accuracy. The relevant equations for the optimization are derived, and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified by measurements on a prototype system.

Particularly, the torsional vibration may attain a significant level at resonant frequencies which damage or cause additional lifetime consumption of mechanical parts. In this way, this paper proposes a noninvasive technique through the electromagnetic torque estimation of driving induction machine as a mean of mechanical torsional stresses monitoring. The lubrication loss is considered as a gear failure to demonstrate its influence on the vibration and on the electromagnetic estimated torque signatures. Then, it is shown that the information in the electromagnetic torque can be decomposed into high- and low-frequency bandwidths which are associated to induction machine and gearbox mechanical-related frequencies, respectively. A setup based on a 5.5-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor connected to a 4-kW wound-rotor induction generator via a one-stage gearbox has been used to validate the proposed method in both stationary and nonstationary conditions.

The theoretical developments lead one to display the influence of various phenomena on this magnetic field in a wide frequency range. It is shown that surface currents due to burrs at the external surface of the machine have an important contribution compared to the increase of eddy currents in the short-circuit volume. Finally, experimental measurements confirm this theory, and an online method of detection for large generators is proposed.

After a presentation of the state of the art about condition monitoring of vibration and motor current for the diagnostics of bearings, this paper illustrates the experimental results on four different types of bearing defects: crack in the outer race, hole in the outer race, deformation of the seal, and corrosion. The first and third faults have not been previously considered in the literature, with the latter being analyzed in other research works, even if obtained in a different way. Another novelty introduced by this paper is the analysis of the decrease in efficiency of the motor with a double purpose: as alarm of incipient faults and as evaluation of the extent of energy waste resulting from the lasting of the fault condition before the breakdown of the machine.

A Stator-Core Quality-Assessment Technique for Inverter-Fed Induction Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society	OCT 05-09, 2008	Edmonton, CANADA	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		AC machine; condition monitoring; core loss; diagnostics; eddy-current loss; hysteresis loss; induction motor; interlaminar-insulation failure; inverter; stator core		Localized heating caused by damage in the laminations or interlaminar insulation of the stator core increases the core losses and can lead to machine failure. Therefore, it is important to monitor the quality of the stator core for reliable and efficient operation of the machine. The methods currently available for core quality assessment are inconvenient since they require an outage and the machine to be disassembled or operated under no-load conditions. In this paper, a new method for monitoring the quality of the stator core for inverter-fed machines without motor disassembly or operation is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to apply a set of test signals to assess the quality of the core whenever the motor is at standstill. A set of high-frequency pulsating magnetic fields is produced using the inverter, and the power loss is observed as a function of field circumferential position to detect core problems. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction motor verifies that local interlaminar core faults can be detected with high sensitivity. The proposed technique is expected to provide a simple solution for frequent stator-core quality assessment without motor disassembly, motor operation, or additional hardware for reliable and efficient operation of inverter-fed induction machines.

Dynamic analysis of mixed eccentricity signatures at various operating points and scrutiny of related indices for induction motors	IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article							UNBALANCED MAGNETIC PULL; AIRGAP-ECCENTRICITY; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BROKEN BARS; ROTOR; COMBINATION; SIMULATION; HARMONICS; MACHINES; SLOT	Load variation along with static and dynamic eccentricities degrees is one of the major factors affecting the dynamic behaviours of eccentricity signatures which is utilised for precise mixed eccentricity fault diagnosis. Without taking the effect of load variation into account properly and just by considering the change in the static and dynamic eccentricity degrees, inaccurate fault detection is acquired. This is of noticeable effects that load variations have on side-band components that are used as fault detection indices. These indices are extracted from the current spectrum of healthy and faulty motor. In this paper, all these factors are dealt in a unified framework by analysing various combinations both theoretically and experimentally. An incisive approach is developed to recognise mixed eccentricity and determine the static and dynamic eccentricities degrees individually at different load levels literally. In order to evaluate the impact of load-dependent indices on eccentricity detection and fault-severity estimation, a systematic relation between each other and eccentricity degree is proposed. Correlation coefficient and mutual information are applied to assess abilities of the obtained indices for eccentricity detection in terms of their relation to static and dynamic eccentricities, their degrees and dependency on the load of motor. The classification results indicate that the elicited indices estimate the eccentricity type and degree exactly. Since, the accuracy of calculated stator current, computed from simulated motor, has considerable effects on precise fault diagnosis, time-stepping finite element method (TSFEM) is employed to model the healthy and faulty induction motor.

This technique is very sensitive to many types of defects inside the material. We show in this study that it can be used to probe ceramic based ball bearings, part of a tooling machine. A model taking into account both the dielectric properties of the balls and the mechanical conditions at the interface between the balls and other parts of the machine is proposed. The model allows an electrical representation of the mechanical state of the machine. We finally show how the transition to the probabilistic language through Fokker-Planck's dynamics allows to predict the ball bearings impedance and the way it is influenced by the fatigue and/or defect processes. Routes to the building of a linear estimation tool (Wiener-Hopf filtering) are described with the final goal of a predictive maintenance tool.

Most of the industrial machinery often includes this kind of elements. Because of that, it is important to devise predictive maintenance tools in order to detect defects in the bearings and to avoid failure of the machinery. The number of rolling elements and their positions in the load zone change with bearing rotation, producing a periodical variation of the total stiffness of the bearing assembly. Hence, the bearing generates vibrations. When a bearing has a defect, these vibrations are increased In this paper, a detection and classification system of fault bearings is presented This system is based on the frequency domain response and the application of a Neuro-Fuzzy method. In the literature, different approaches in the frequency domain have been proposed. In this paper, a particular Neuro-Fuzzy approach has been chosen, given its learning properties and its capability of expressing the resultant detection and classification system by rules A certain amount of trials have been carried out and it has been concluded that several Neuro-Fuzzy systems in a cascade configuration is a better option to solve the classification problem than other classification methods. In addition to, the results of these initial trials have determined the modifications of the learning phase suggested in this paper.

To achieve planned aircraft trajectory and complete landing safely, the uncertainties in vehicle parameters of the damaged aircraft need to be learned and incorporated at the level of motion planning Uncertainty is a very important concern in recovery of damaged aircraft since it can cause false diagnosis and prognosis that may lead to further performance degradation and mission failure The mathematical and statistical approaches to analyzing uncertainty are first presented. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematics model The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties under a damage assessment process and post-failure trajectory planning are presented and classified. The decision-making process for an emergency motion planning to landing site is developed via the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The objective of the trajectory planning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft under uncertain conditions. Simulations are presented for an emergency motion planning and landing that takes into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision.

S	Yadav, SK; Kalra, PK		Pratihar, DK; Jain, LC		Yadav, Sandeep Kumar; Kalra, Prem Kumar			Condition Monitoring of Internal Combustion Engine Using EMD and HMM	INTELLIGENT AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS: FOUNDATIONS AND APPLICATIONS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DAMAGE DETECTION	The acoustic signature of an internal combustion (IC) engine contains valuable information regarding the functioning of its components. It could be used to detect the incipient faults in the engine. Acoustics-based condition monitoring of systems precisely tries to handle the questions and in the process extracts the relevant information from the acoustic signal to identify the health of the system. In automobile industry, fault diagnosis of engines is generally done by a set of skilled workers who by merely listening to the sound produced by the engine, certify whether the engine is good or bad, primary owing to their excellent sensory skills and cognitive capabilities. It would indeed be a challenging task to mimic the capabilities of those individuals in a machine. In the fault diagnosis setup developed hereby, the acoustic signal emanated from the engine is first captured and recorded; subsequently the acoustic signal is transformed on to a domain where distinct patterns corresponding to the faults being investigated are visible. Traditionally, acoustic signals are mainly analyzed with spectral analysis, i.e., the Fourier transform, which is not a proper tool for the analysis of IC engine acoustic signals, as they are non-stationary and consist of many transient components. In the present work, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)- based approach for IC engine is proposed. EMD is a new time-frequency analyzing method for nonlinear and non-stationary signals. By using the EMD, a complicated signal can be decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the local characteristics time scale of the signal. Treating these IMFs as feature vectors HMM is applied to classify the IC engine acoustic signal. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used as a tool in intelligent autonomous system for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of IC engine.

A predictive maintenance strategy can reduce the amount of such costly incidents by suggesting the driver to schedule a visit to the dealer once the failure probability within certain time period exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The condition of each subsystem in a car can be monitored onboard vehicle telematics systems, which become increasingly available in modern cars. In this paper, we apply a multi-target probability estimation algorithm (M-IFN) to an integrated database of sensor measurements and warranty claims with the purpose of predicting the probability and the timing of a failure in a given subsystem. The multi-target algorithm performance is compared to a single-target probability estimation algorithm (IFN) and reliability modeling based on Weibull analysis.

In this paper, via combining Sparse Coding and Self-Organizing Map, a new model (SC-SOM) is proposed for robust visual monitoring of machine condition. Following the model, a Machine Condition Map (MCM) representing the machine condition space is formulated offline with the historical signals; then, during the online monitoring, the machine condition can be determined by mapping the monitoring signals onto the MCM. The application of the SC-SOM model for bearing condition monitoring verifies that the bearing condition can be correctly determined even with some disturbances. Furthermore, novel bearing conditions can also be detected with this model.

As the key point of the approach, the unsupervised clustering module for detecting a novel fault is specified in this paper. Incorporating with prior information in the historical data, a constrained clustering method is developed based on the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm. The clustering method is validated through experimental case studies on the bearing fault diagnosis. The results show that the clustering method has the self-learning abilities to detect the novel faults and with the evolving abilities of the proposed approach, one can start with just the normal condition data and continue building the diagnosis scheme as the new fault events occur.

Efficient incipient faults detection and accurate faults diagnosis are therefore critical to machinery normal operation. The use of mechanical vibration signals for fault diagnosis is significant and effective due to advances in the progress of digital signal processing techniques. Through virtual prototype simulation analysis and experimental study, a novel method for gear multi-faults diagnosis was presented in this paper based on the wavelet-Autoregressive (AR) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The virtual prototype simulation and the experimental test were firstly carried out and the comparison results prove that the traditional Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) analysis is not appropriate for the gear fault detection and identification. Then the wavelet-AR model was applied to extract the feature sets of the gear fault vibration data. In this procedure, the wavelet transform was used to decompose and de-noise the original signal to obtain fault signals, and the fault type information was extracted by the AR parameters. In order to eliminate the redundant fault features, the PCA was furthermore adopted to fuse the AR parameters into one characteristic to enhance the fault defection and identification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method based on the wavelet-AR model and PCA is feasible and reliable in the gear multi-faults signal diagnosis, and the isolation of different gear conditions, including normal, single crack, single wear, compound fault of wear and spalling etc., has been effectively accomplished.

Industrial application of a multitooth tool breakage detection system using spindle motor electrical power consumption	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Tool breakage detection; Multitooth tools; Change detection; Electrical power consumption	CUTTING FORCES; PREDICTION	This paper describes a multitooth tool diagnosis application to be used in the car industry. The main focus is on the optimal variable selection (noise, vibration, temperature, and tool drives electrical power consumption) of the tool's environment, and the signal processing by means of the segmentation of the electrical power consumption signals into groups of inserts according to the type of tools studied. The fault detection algorithms are based on statistical analysis of the spindle tool power consumption. Different statistical parameters are used in a change detection algorithm, while keeping in mind the need for a reliable and low-cost fault diagnosis system. Multitooth tools add an important degree of difficulty to the fault detection problem as opposed to simple tools because of the complexity introduced by the high number of inserts that the workpiece is machining at the same time, for different kinds of finishing and operations.

A Matlab (R) tool for introducing basics of induction motor current signature (IMCS) analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						fault diagnosis; induction motor; laboratories; student experiments	FAULTS; MACHINE	Induction machines are among the most widely used devices in industrial processes because they are robust and well suited for a wide range of applications. This critical role underscores the level of attention given to the early detection of potentially damaging faults. Given this important role, one would expect that undergraduate curricula in electrical engineering would devote some attention to the subject, but this is typically not the case. This paper presents an innovative way of presenting induction motor current signature (IMCS) analysis to undergraduate students within very limited time constraints. The signature analysis tool is developed in Matlab (R) and features two diagnostic methods. It offers electrical engineering undergraduates a very convenient environment in which to learn the basics of induction motor fault diagnosis.

Detection of stator-winding turn-to-turn faults in induction motors, based on virtual instrumentation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						fault detection; high-frequency carrier-signal injection; induction motor; stator winding; virtual instrument	FREQUENCY SIGNAL INJECTION; AC MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS	A virtual instrumentation system for stator turn-to-turn winding-fault detection is presented in this paper. The system can be adopted for industry and academy as a useful tool to prevent unexpected downtime or severe damage to induction motors. The high-frequency carrier-signal injection technique is used to obtain information on machine stator winding. Measurements of the resulting negative-sequence current are used to detect turn-to-turn faults. Since the stator windings are fixed in space, a turn-to-turn fault gives rise to a stationary saliency which appears as a DC component in the spectrum of the negative-sequence carrier-signal current. The proposed virtual instrument shows the relationship of the magnitude of the DC component to the grade of failure of the stator winding.

J	Nguyen, NT; Lee, HH				Nguyen, Ngoc-Tu; Lee, Hong-Hee			Induction motor fault diagnosis based on the k-NN and optimal feature selection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						k-nearest neighbour; fault diagnosis; induction motor; genetic algorithm; vibration signal	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ROTATING MACHINERY; ROLLER BEARING; DECISION TREE; COMBINATION	The k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) rule is applied to diagnose the conditions of induction motors. The features are extracted from the time vibration signals while the optimal features are selected by a genetic algorithm based on a distance criterion. A weight value is assigned to each feature to help select the best quality features. To improve the classification performance of the k-NN rule, each of the k neighbours are evaluated by a weight factor based on the distance to the test pattern. The proposed k-NN is compared to the conventional k-NN and support vector machine classification to verify the performance of an induction motor fault diagnosis.

ONLINE FAULT IDENTIFICATION AND FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL OF A MULTI-MODULE MANIPULATOR	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION			English	Article						Fault detection; machine health monitoring; diagnosis; Kalman filter; robotic manipulators; redundant kinematics; multi-module deployable manipulator system		This paper presents a technique for online identification of faults in a multi-module deployable manipulator system (MDMS) and for task execution in the presence of faults. The MDMS consist of a chain of :nodules, having a prismatic joint and a revolute joint in each module. A nonlinear modal of the MDMS is developed, which is cast in a discrete-time state-space form for use in the failure identification method. Bayes hypothesis testing is employed in the failure identification scheme. First, a possible set of failure modes is defined, and a hypothesis is associated with each failure mode. The most likely hypothesis is selected depending on the observations of the manipulator response and a suitable test. The test used here minimizes the maximum risk of accepting a false hypothesis, and accordingly the identification methodology is considered optimal. A bank of discrete Kalman filters is used for the coin imitation of the hypothesis-conditioned information about the MDMS, which is required in the decision logic. Through this approach, the MD:MS, using kinematic redundancy and control, is able to satisfactorily execute a task even in the presence of a failure. Computer simulations of one-module and two-module manipulators are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology for identification of three types of faults: sensor failure, locked joint, and free-wheeling joint; and for controlled manoeuvring in the presence of a locked joint. In particular, it is demonstrated that a two-module manipulator is able to successfully complete a targeting and pointing task in the presence of a joint failure.	[de Silva, C.

However in the present experimental studies such observations have not seen, but any fault either in the stator or the rotor may distort the sinusoidal response of the motor RPM and the main frequency so the MCSA response may contain number of harmonics of the motor RPM and the mains frequency. Hence the use of the higher order spectrum (HOS), namely the bisepctrum of the MCSA has been proposed here. Additionally, the bispectra with the unwrapped phase angle along its frequency has been applied to analyze motor faults. Thus, this paper proposes bispectrum relates both amplitude and phase of a signal. It has been observed that it not only detects the early fault but also indicate the severity of the fault to some extent.				juggrapong@yahoo.com					Aroquiadassou Gerard, 2007, IEEE Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED), P52; Ayhan B, 2005, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V20, P336, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2004.842393; Bachir S, 2006, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V53, P963, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2006.874258; Barut M, 2007, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V54, P272, DOI 10.1109/TIE.2006.885123; Bellini A, 2001, IEEE T IND APPL, V37, P1248, DOI 10.1109/28.952499; Bellini A, 2000, IEEE T IND APPL, V36, P1318, DOI 10.1109/28.871280; Cardoso AJM, 1999, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V14, P595, DOI 10.1109/60.790920; Collis W.

Preventive maintenance needs data to be supplied in order to plan the maintenance schedule. On-line condition based monitoring offered by AE technology, provides a complimentary assessment of the current condition of machines whereby outage schedules can be planned for proactive maintenance. Research into the feasibility and viability of AE technology at Cranfield University, which was started in 1984, on rotating elements has shown encouraging results and it is evident that AE technology can be employed as a tool for defect detection, on-line condition monitoring, diagnosis and prognosis. All these capabilities of AE are of benefit to the process and management of maintenance in industries.

J	Sadoughi, A; Jafarboland, M; Tashakkor, S				Sadoughi, Alireza; Jafarboland, Mehrdad; Tashakkor, Soheil			A Practical Bearing Fault Diagnosing System Based on Vibration Power Signal Autocorrelation	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-IREE			English	Article						Apparatus; Autocorrelation; Bearing; Fault Diagnosis; Intelligent; Vibration		Bearings are important parts of rotating machines. To avoid unscheduled outputs due to bearing defect, it is important to detect an upcoming fault as soon as possible. Fault in a great number of bearings commences from a single point defect. Therefore; research on this category of faults has shared a great deal in predictive diagnosis literature. Single point defects cause certain frequencies, which appear in vibration spectrum. Traditionally, data extracted from frequency spectrum are used to identify damaged part. Because of impulsive nature of fault strikes, and complex modulations present in vibration signal, a simple spectrum analysis may result in erroneous conclusions. When a shaft rotates at constant speed, strikes due to a single point defect repeat at constant intervals. Each strike shows a high energy distribution around it. This paper considers the time intervals between successive impulses in auto-correlated vibration power signals. The most frequent interval between successive impulses determines the period of defective part. This period is related to fault frequency. According to the proposed method, an apparatus is designed. Introducing the structure of this apparatus, the circuits, hardware, and software is one of the objectives of this paper. The apparatus has shown its effectiveness in laboratory and field tests.

Often the equipment may not have any macro-indicators of damage such as cracks or delamination. Quantification of thermal environments during use-life is often not feasible because of the data-capture and storage requirements, and the overhead on core-system functionality. There is need for tools and techniques to quantify damage in deployed systems in absence of macro-indicators of damage without knowledge of prior stress history. The presented PHM framework is targeted towards high reliability applications such as avionic and space systems. In this paper, Sn3.0Ag0.5Cu alloy packages have been subjected to multiple thermal cycling environments including -55 to 125C and 0 to 100C. Assemblies investigated include area-array packages soldered on FR4 printed circuit cards. The methodology involves the use of condition monitoring devices, for gathering data on damage pre-cursors at periodic intervals. Damage-state interrogation technique has been developed based on the Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm in conjunction with the microstructural damage evolution proxies. The presented technique is applicable to electronic assemblies which have been deployed on one thermal environment, then withdrawn from service and targeted for redeployment in a different thermal environment. Test cases have been presented to demonstrate the viability of the technique for assessment of prior damage, operational readiness and residual life for assemblies exposed to multiple thermo-mechanical environments. Prognosticated prior damage and the residual life show good correlation with experimental data, demonstrating the validity of the presented technique for multiple thermo-mechanical environments.

However, making a critical analysis of these plans before real-world implementation is not possible. We propose a different approach as part of a strategy to validate these plans. This will use a decision support tool based on machine learning concepts to generate prognosis of satellite states for assisting experts in evaluating the performance of the plan. To build the tool, a comparative study of performance between classic data mining classifiers is accomplished to determine the classification model that provides greater accuracy to predict satellite future states.

In 2004, breast cancer caused 519,000 deaths worldwide. In order to reduce the cancer deaths and thereby increasing the survival rates an automatic approach is necessary to aid physicians in the prognosis of breast cancer. This paper investigates the prognosis of breast cancer using a machine learning approach, in particular genetic programming, whereas earlier work has approached the prognosis using linear programming. The genetic programming method takes a digitized image of a patient and automatically generates the prediction of the time to recur as well as the disease-free survival time. The breast cancer dataset from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository was used for this study. The evaluation shows that the genetic programming approach outperforms the linear programming approach by 33 %.

This technique allows direct analysis of chemical changes within the degrading coatings and has the potential to evaluate service lifetime when coupled with advanced statistical analysis methods (chemometrics). The degradation environment monitoring sensors are embodied in a profluorescent environment-sensitive witness patch that may be analysed in-service by a field-deployable fluorescence spectrometer. Accelerated ageing for both the paint and the witness patches has been undertaken and their capabilities as aircraft paint degradation monitors assessed.

The vibration signals due to impact and friction are always non-stationary which includes the rub-impact signal, the background signal and the noise signal. Local wave decomposition (LW D) is based upon the local characteristic time scale of signal and could decompose the complicated signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). However, because the weak rub-impact signal is always submerged in the background and noise signals. The LWD procedure would generate the components redundancy. In order to solve the problem, a novel method combining with independent component analysis (ICA) and LWD is proposed. ICA was introduced into LWD, so that the components are orthogonal to each other and the components redundancy can be removed. In the end, a much better decomposition performances can be obtained.

To date, Envelope detection is always used to identify faults occurring at the Bearing Characteristic Frequencies (BCF). However, because the impact vibration generated by a bearing fault has relatively low energy, it is often overwhelmed by background noise and difficult to identify. Combined the results of extensive experiments performed in a series of bearings with artificial damage, this research investigates the effect of many influencing factors, such as demodulation methods, sampling frequency, variable machine speed and the signals collected in different directions, on the effectiveness of demodulation and the implications for bearing fault detection. By understanding these effects, a more skillful application of the envelope detection in condition monitoring and diagnosis is achieved.

A model for a variable speed open vertical display cabinet was constructed using preprocessing techniques for measured data, including the elimination of outlying data points by the use of an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA). Using dynamic loss coefficient adjustment, the adaptation of the SVM for use in this application was achieved. From there, the object function for energy use per unit of display area total energy consumption (TEC)/total display area (TDA) was constructed and solved using the ASVM method. When compared to the results achieved using a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model, the ASVM model for the refrigerated display cabinet was characterized by its simple structure, fast convergence speed and high prediction accuracy. The ASVM model also has better noise rejection properties than that of original SVM model. It was revealed by the theoretical analysis and experimental results presented in this paper that it is feasible to model of the display cabinet built using the ASVM method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, YX; He, ZJ; Zi, YY				Wang, Yanxue; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang			Enhancement of signal denoising and multiple fault signatures detecting in rotating machinery using dual-tree complex wavelet transform	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Dual-tree complex wavelet transform; Signal denoising; Compound faults; Rotating machinery; Health monitoring; Feature extraction	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; PAIRS; DESIGN; SCHEME; SCALE	In order to enhance the desired features related to some special type of machine fault, a technique based on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) is proposed in this paper. It is demonstrated that DTCWT enjoys better shift invariance and reduced spectral aliasing than second-generation wavelet transform (SGWT) and empirical mode decomposition by means of numerical simulations. These advantages of the DTCWT arise from the relationship between the two dual-tree wavelet basis functions, instead of the matching of the used single wavelet basis function to the signal being analyzed. Since noise inevitably exists in the measured signals, an enhanced vibration signals denoising algorithm incorporating DTCWT with NeighCoeff shrinkage is also developed. Denoising results of vibration signals resulting from a crack gear indicate the proposed denoising method can effectively remove noise and retain the valuable information as much as possible compared to those DWT- and SGWT-based NeighCoeff shrinkage denoising methods. As is well known, excavation of comprehensive signatures embedded in the vibration signals is of practical importance to clearly clarify the roots of the fault. especially the combined faults. In the case of multiple features detection, diagnosis results of rolling element bearings with combined faults and an actual industrial equipment confirm that the proposed DTCWT-based method is a powerful and versatile tool and consistently outperforms SGWT and fast kurtogram, which are widely used recently. Moreover, it must be noted, the proposed method is completely suitable for on-line surveillance and diagnosis due to its good robustness and efficient algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Subrahmanya, N; Shin, YC; Meckl, PH				Subrahmanya, Niranjan; Shin, Yung C.; Meckl, Peter H.			A Bayesian machine learning method for sensor selection and fusion with application to on-board fault diagnostics	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Sensor selection; Condition monitoring; Feature-group selection; Hierarchical Bayes; Empirical Bayes; Diesel engine fault detection	REGRESSION; SHRINKAGE	In applications like feature-level sensor fusion, the problem of selecting an optimal number of sensors can lead to reduced maintenance costs and the creation of compact online databases for future use. This problem of sensor selection can be reduced to the problem of selecting an optimal set of groups of features during model selection. This is a more complex problem than the problem of feature selection, which has been recognized as a key aspect of statistical model identification. This work proposes a new algorithm based on the use of a Bayesian framework for the purpose of selecting groups of features during regression and classification. The hierarchical Bayesian formulation introduces grouping for the parameters of a generalized linear model and the model hyper-parameters are estimated using an empirical Bayes procedure. A novel aspect of the algorithm is its ability to simultaneously perform feature selection within groups to reduce over-fitting of the data. Further, the parameters obtained from this algorithm can be used to obtain a rank order among the selected sensors. The performance of the algorithm is first tested on a synthetic regression example. Finally, it is applied to the problem of fault detection in diesel engines (30,000 data records from 43 sensors, 8 classes) and used to compare the misclassification rates with a varying number of sensors.

Automated diagnosis of rolling bearings using MRA and neural networks	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Wavelets; Artificial networks; Fault diagnosis; Predictive maintenance; Pattern classification	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DESIGN	Any industry needs an efficient predictive plan in order to optimize the management of resources and improve the economy of the plant by reducing unnecessary costs and increasing the level of safety. A great percentage of breakdowns in productive processes are caused by bearings. They begin to deteriorate from early stages of their functional life, also called the incipient level. This manuscript develops an automated diagnosis of rolling bearings based on the analysis and classification of signature vibrations. The novelty of this work is the application of the methodology proposed for data collected from a quasi-real industrial machine, where rolling bearings support the radial and axial loads the bearings are designed for. Multiresolution analysis (MRA) is used in a first stage in order to extract the most interesting features from signals. Features will be used in a second stage as inputs of a supervised neural network (NN) for classification purposes. Experimental results carried out in a real system show the soundness of the method which detects four bearing conditions (normal, inner race fault, outer race fault and ball fault) in a very incipient stage.

Early detection and diagnosis of incipient faults are desirable for interactive evaluation over the running condition, product quality guarantee, and improved operational efficiency of induction motors. The main difficulty in this task is the lack of accurate analytical models to describe a faulty motor. This paper proposes a dynamic model to analyze electrical and mechanical faults in induction machines and includes net asymmetries and load conditions. The model permits to analyze the interactions between different faults in order to detect possible false alarms. Simulations and experimental results were performed to confirm the validity of the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we have implemented a systematic method that can improve cancer classification. By extracting significant samples (which we refer to as support vector samples because they are located only on support vectors), we allow the back propagation neural networking (BPNN) to learn more tasks. The proposed method named as the multi-task support vector sample learning (MTSVSL) technique. We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our MTSVSL method yield superior classification performance with application to leukemia and prostate cancer gene expression datasets. Our proposed MTSVSL method is a novel approach which is expedient and perform exceptionally well in cancer diagnosis and clinical outcome prediction. Our method has been successfully applied to cancer type-based classifications on microarray gene expression datasets, and furthermore. MTSVSL improves the accuracy of traditional BPNN technique.

The score produced by the classifier can be used to aid in diagnosis as it quantifies the degree of pathology. Using anatomically meaningful features computed from the DTI data we train a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) pattern classifier. The method begins with high dimensional elastic registration of DT images followed by a feature extraction step that involves creating a feature by concatenating average anisotropy and diffusivity values in anatomically meaningful regions. Feature selection is performed via a mutual information based technique followed by sequential elimination of the features. A non-linear SVM classifier is then constructed by training on the selected features. The classifier assigns each test subject with a probabilistic abnormality score that indicates the extent of pathology. In this study, abnormality classifiers were created for two populations; one consisting of schizophrenia patients (SCZ) and the other with individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A clear distinction between the SCZ patients and controls was achieved with 90.62% accuracy while for individuals with ASD, 89.58% classification accuracy was obtained. The abnormality scores clearly separate the groups and the high classification accuracy indicates the prospect of using the scores as a diagnostic and prognostic marker.

The majority of patients sustain mild TBI, and a significant number suffer persistent neuropsychological problems. Conventional neuroimaging methods (CT, MRI) do not reveal abnormalities consistent with the cognitive symptoms. Imaging methods offering prognostic information in acutely injured patients are therefore required. Here we applied advanced quantitative MRI techniques (T(1), T(2) mapping and diffusion tensor MRI) in 24 mild TBI patients and 20 matched controls. We applied a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the quantitative MRI data. Univariate classification was ineffective due to overlap between patient and control values, however multi-parametric classification achieved sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 75%. Future work incorporating neuropsychological outcome into SVM training is expected to improve performance. These results indicate that SVM analysis of multi-parametric MRI. data is a promising approach for predicting prognosis following mild TBI.	[Aribisala, Benjamin S.; Cowie, Christopher J.

Dynamic eccentricity produces low frequency air gap flux components, however they can be observed in stator current only under mixed eccentricity. Unlike MCSA (motor current signature analysis), described method allows to detect purely dynamic eccentricity or to detect dynamic eccentricity under mixed eccentricity with a minimal effect of static eccentricity. Although many papers have been focused on external magnetic field analysis, they have usually decribed other types of faults. In this paper the amplitudes of characteristic frequency components are predicted using FEM and some obtained results are verified by measurement. Both purely dynamic and mixed eccentricities are taken into account as well as saturation of magnetic circuit due to its significant influence on calculated spectrum.

J	Cui, JA; Wang, YR				Cui, Jiang; Wang, Youren			A NOVEL APPROACH OF ANALOG FAULT CLASSIFICATION USING A SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES CLASSIFIER	METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						analog circuits; fault classification; Support Vector Machines Classifier; Neural Networks; wavelet packet decomposition	ELECTRONIC-CIRCUITS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUZZY APPROACH; DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET	In order to make the analog fault classification more accurate, we present a method based on the Support Vector Machines Classifier (SVC) with wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) as a preprocessor. In this paper, the conventional one-against-rest SVC is resorted to perform a multi-class classification task because this classifier is simple in terms of training and testing. However, this SVC needs all decision functions to classify the query sample. In our study, this classifier is improved to make the fault classification task more fast and efficient. Also, in order to reduce the size of the feature samples, the wavelet packet analysis is employed. In our investigations, the wavelet analysis can be used as a tool of feature extractor or noise filter and this preprocessor can improve the fault classification resolution of the analog circuits. Moreover, our investigation illustrates that the SVC can be applicable to the domain of analog fault classification and this novel classifier can be viewed as an alternative for the back-propagation (BP) neural network classifier.

Second harmonic generation in human ovarian neoplasias	MULTIPHOTON MICROSCOPY IN THE BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Multiphoton Microscopy in the Biomedical Sciences X	JAN 24-26, 2010	San Francisco, CA	SPIE, Becker & Hickl, Boston Elect, Carl Zeiss Inc, Coherent, Inc, High Q Laser Prod GmbH, Newport Spectra Phys, Chroma Technol Corp, Omega Opt		SHG; ovarian cancer; extracellular matrix; collagen; carcinogenesis; multiphoton microscopy	COLLAGEN; IMAGES	Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients; it requires a complex process of tumor cell dissemination, extra cellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cell invasion and tumor-host interactions. Collagen is the major component of ECM; its fiber polymerization or degradation evolves in parallel with the evolution of the cancerous lesions. This study aimed to identify the collagen content, spatial distribution and fiber organization in biopsies of benign and malignant human ovarian tissues. Biopsies were prepared in slides without dyes and were exposed to 800nm Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, 100 fs pulse duration, 800mW average power, 80MHz repetition rate). The obtained images were recorded at triplets, corresponding to clear field, multiphoton and second harmonic generation (SHG) mycroscopy. Data showed considerable anisotropy in malignant tissues, with regions of dense collagen arranged as individual fibers or in combination with immature segmental filaments. Radial fiber alignment or regions with minimal signal were observed in the high clinical grade tumors, suggesting degradation of original fibers or altered polymerization state of them. These findings allow us to assume that the collagen signature will be a reliable and a promising marker for diagnosis and prognosis in human ovarian cancers.	[Lamonier, L.; de Thomaz, A.

HSP70 expression profiles in white muscles of riverine catfish Rita rita show promise as biomarker for pollution monitoring in tropical rivers	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA			English	Article						Biomarker; 2-D immunoblot; Freshwater catfish Rita rita; HSP70; Muscle proteome map; Pollution monitoring; Tropical rivers	SKELETAL-MUSCLE; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; STRESS PROTEINS; ELECTROPHORESIS	The precise measurements of proteins are essential for static and dynamic as well as descriptive and predictive biological research as some of them prove to be useful as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. The heat shock proteins 70 (HSP 70) are important biomarkers in stress response; the constitutive HSP70 is crucial for the chaperonine functions of unstressed cells, where as the inducible HSP70 is important for allowing cells to cope with acute stress, especially those affecting the protein machinery. HSP70 in molluscs has been widely used as a biomarker in marine environmental monitoring. In the present study HSP70 expression profiles in different tissues of the riverine catfish Rita rita was evaluated as a biomarker for monitoring pollution in the riverine environment. Protein expression was detected in muscle, liver, kidney and gill tissues by 1-dimensional (1-D) immunoblot analysis using monoclonal anti-HSP70 antibody. 2-D immunoblot analysis of soluble white muscle protein extract revealed some interesting patterns. In many samples a single spot was seem however, in some cases two spots and in few cases a third light spot was seen. Presence of HSP70 protein patterns in the tropical fish Rita rim white muscles, similar to those reported in marine mussels from temperate regions makes us believe that HSP70 can be a potential biomarker for aquatic pollution monitoring of the tropical rivers and thus merits further investigation.

J	Xian, GM; Zeng, BQ				Xian, Guang-ming; Zeng, Bi-qing			AN EFFECTIVE AND NOVEL FAULT DIAGNOSIS TECHNIQUE BASED ON EMD AND SVM	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; empirical mode decomposition; support vector machine; intrinsic mode function; machinery; RBF kernel function	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; CLASSIFICATION; TIME	An effective and novel roller bearing fault diagnosis technique based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) energy entropy and support vector machine (SVM) is put forward in this article. The vibration signal of roller bearing is decomposed by EMD and the first 5 intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained. SVM served as a fault diagnosis classifier and the extracted energy features of the first 5 IMFs are taken as network input vectors, and then the fault bearing and the normal bearing can be distinguished. An technique for fault of roller bearing by SVM is evaluated against a series of fault diagnosis methods that are widely used in machinery, with particular regard to the effect of training set size on fault diagnosis accuracy. We trained the SVM using RBF kernel function. We compare our experimental results with the existing results given by SMO and SVM-light algorithms. It can be seen that the fault diagnosis method based on SVM-light is superior to that based on SMO in diagnosis accuracy of roller bearing. In addition to the SVM, the same datasets were classified using RBF NN and Hopfield NN.

This paper presents an assessment of the state of practice in prognostics and health management of information and electronics-rich systems. While there are two general methods of performing PHM model-based and data-driven methods these methods by themselves have some key disadvantages. This paper presents a fusion prognostics approach, which combines or "fuses together" the model-based and data-driven approaches, to enable markedly better prognosis of remaining useful life.

In these critical applications, diagnostic approaches are required to monitor the health and predict the reliability of these devices to prevent system downtime and costly failures. In this study, Mahalanobis distance (MD) was used for anomaly detection for non punch through (NPT) IGBTs. The IGBTs were aged by electrical-thermal stress under a resistive load until their failure. Monitored collector-emitter voltage and collector-emitter currents were used as input parameters to calculate the Mahalanobis distance (MD). The MD values obtained from the healthy data were transformed using a Box-Cox transform and three sigma limits were obtained from the transformed data. The upper three sigma limit of the transformed MD healthy data was used as a threshold to detect degradation in the IGBTs. The MD anomaly detection approach allowed for detection time of anomalies in NPT IGBTs up to 77% before failure.

Herein, the machine learning and statistical approach are adopted along with thermal image signal to machine condition diagnosis. Using thermal images, the information of machine condition can be investigated more simply than other conventional methods of machine condition monitoring. In this work, the behaviour of thermal image is investigated with different conditions of machine. A test-rig that represents the machine in industry was set up to produce thermal image data in the experiment. Some significant features have been extracted and selected by means of principal component analysis, and independent component analysis, and other irrelevant features have been discarded. The aim of this study is to retrieve thermal images by means of selecting a proper feature to recognise the fault pattern of the machine. The result shows that the classification process of thermal image features by support vector machine and other classifiers can serve machine fault diagnosis.

Such degradation is influenced by the response of coatings to environmental factors such as high temperatures and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, as well as chemical factors. However, the effect of loading and load history on coating durability has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in determining failure sites (such as joints) and the rate of degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints, and the nature of the strains experienced by coatings in locations influenced by in-service loads. It is first step in assessing the complex strain history at joint strain concentration locations as part of developing a prognostic capability for the service life of aircraft coatings. The configuration of coating layers at different joints is important and this research has considered a simplification of a butt strap joint from a RAAF military aircraft and a generic lap joint; predictions of critical movements/displacements have been made using finite element analysis; the predictions will be tested later as part of an experimental program associated with a full-scale fatigue test.

Analysis of dissolved gases content in power transformer oil is a complicated problem due to its nonlinearity and the small quantity of training data. Support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully employed to solve classification problem of nonlinearity and small sample. However, SVM has rarely been applied to diagnosis transformer fault by analysis the dissolved gases content in power transformer. In this study, support vector machine is proposed to analysis dissolved gases content in power transformer oil, among which cross-validation is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine. The experimental data from the electric power company in Sichuan are used to illustrate the performance of proposed SVM model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed SVM model can achieve very good diagnosis accuracy under the circumstances of small sample. Consequently, the SVM model is a proper alternative for diagnosing power transformer fault.

Such failure can result in costly downtime and catastrophic consequence, especially for aircraft propulsion systems. Therefore bearing health estimation based on vibration signals is critical to increased safety and reductions in life-cycle cost. Despite the success in indicating the incipient bearing fault and inferring the bearing fault type, current fault diagnosis algorithms fail to effectively estimate the bearing fault severity due to complex failure modes and changing operating conditions. The bearing dynamic response to damage determines the resulting vibration pattern, and consequently the bearing vibration pattern change exhibits the bearing fault progression. Therefore incorporating the temporal information of the bearing vibration pattern is vitally important to indicate the bearing damage level. In order to achieve improved accuracy for bearing health estimation, the paper presents a procedure for bearing fault diagnosis through incorporating the dimension-temporal information of multiple vibration features extracted from vibration signals by both time and frequency domain techniques. The procedure effectively combines the mutually complementary dimension information of multiple vibration features with the temporal information obtained by trending analysis from these features. The bearing fault progression data from bearing experiments validates that the proposed procedure is effective and robust to indicate the bearing health condition.

Signal Decomposition for Symptom Enhancement : A journey from Fourier analysis through time/frequency analysis to blind source separation	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2010 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING INCLUDING USD2010			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)/Conference of USD	SEP 20-22, 2010	Leuven, BELGIUM	Dept Mech Engn, Katholieke Univ Leuven			INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OPERATIONAL MODAL-ANALYSIS; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; VIBRATION SIGNALS; MIMO SYSTEMS; CEPSTRUM; DIAGNOSTICS; CYCLOSTATIONARITY; ALGORITHM	In the last 45 or more years there have been many and considerable improvements in the application of signal processing techniques to machine vibration signals for the purpose of extracting diagnostic information about their condition. A great leap forward was made with the publication of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in 1965, since for rotating machines most important fault symptoms can be linked to certain frequencies (eg toothmeshing frequencies) and even today, advances are being made with respect to the accuracy with which frequency patterns can be distinguished. The FFT was also applied quite early to obtain the cepstrum, giving information about periodic structure in the log spectrum, and information about echoes, as well as separation of source and transmission path effects. Other spectrum analysis methods such as AR modelling give advantages in certain situations, but for machines such as diesel engines, a time/frequency decomposition of the signal is often useful. There is still a debate about whether this is best done using the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) or its derivatives (including the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT)), or wavelet analysis. A relatively recent discovery was that many machine signals are cyclostationary, rather than periodic, and that gives the possibility of separation into three basic categories; deterministic, stationary random, and cyclostationary random; in the latter case with a further separation of components with different cyclic frequencies. Most recently there has been considerable interest in blind source separation (BSS) to divide a measured signal into its components coming from each important source, which has to be done blind (on the basis of statistical independence of the sources). This has a strong potential to greatly improve diagnostic and prognostic capability in the future.

Damage detection in vibration signals using non parametric time-frequency representations	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2010 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING INCLUDING USD2010			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)/Conference of USD	SEP 20-22, 2010	Leuven, BELGIUM	Dept Mech Engn, Katholieke Univ Leuven				The vibration analysis is the most used tool for fault detection in rotating machines, thereby its low cost in comparison with others tool as ultrasound. This tool accomplished of digital signal processing is very powerful for make decisions and faults identification. Time-frequency (TF) representations are one of the most popular characterization methods for non-stationary vibration signals. Despite of their potential advantages, these representations suffer of large quantity of redundant and irrelevant data which makes them difficult to use for classification purposes. In this work, a methodology for reduction of irrelevant and redundant data is explored. This approach consists on removing irrelevant data, applying a relevance measure on the t-f plane that measures the dependence of each t-f point with the class labels. Results shows that the relevance measures increase the performance classification and the faults are totally differentiable.

Comparison of subspace analysis methods for fault detection in industrial systems	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2010 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING INCLUDING USD2010			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)/Conference of USD	SEP 20-22, 2010	Leuven, BELGIUM	Dept Mech Engn, Katholieke Univ Leuven		KPCA; NSA; subspace; condition monitoring; statistics	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS	In the field of structural health monitoring or machine condition monitoring, the activation of nonlinear dynamic behavior complicates the procedure of damage or fault detection. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is known as an efficient method for damage diagnosis. However, two drawbacks of PCA are the assumption of the linearity of the system and the need of many sensors. This article presents industrial applications of two possible extensions of PCA: Null subspace analysis (NSA) and Kernel PCA (KPCA). The advantages of NSA rely on its rapidity of use and its reliability. The KPCA method, through the use of nonlinear kernel functions, allows to introduce nonlinear dependences between variables. The objective is to address the problem of fault detection in mechanical systems using subspace-based methods. The detection is achieved by comparing the subspace features between the reference and a current state through statistics. Industrial data are used as illustration of the methods.

Shaft crack detection in a steam turbine: experimental evidences and model-based simulations	PROCEEDINGS OF ISMA2010 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING INCLUDING USD2010			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA)/Conference of USD	SEP 20-22, 2010	Leuven, BELGIUM	Dept Mech Engn, Katholieke Univ Leuven				Fault symptom analysis techniques can be used to obtain an early detection of shaft cracks on the basis of the analysis of rotating machine vibrations. In this paper, the main results of the analysis of monitoring data collected in a combined cycle power plant, whose steam turbine was affected by a shaft crack propagation, are shown. Owing to the annular shape of this transverse crack, whose angular extension was 360, the amplitude of the twice per revolution vibrations of the shaft was rather low both in on-load condition and during runups and coastdowns, although the average depth of the crack was nearly 50% of the nominal radius. Therefore, contrary to the usual for transverse cracks, the main symptom of the crack propagation was only a significant sensitivity of the synchronous vibration to the turbine thermal state. This made non-trivial the detection of the crack that, moreover, originated in a not accessible cross-section. This paper shows the successful results obtained with an uncommon fault symptom analysis along with those provided by some preliminary investigations carried out by means of mathematical models.

For answering to cycle time problem, a two levels architecture is proposed. The first one permits first level fault detection. Only in suspicious cases, a second level fault detection is executed. In faulty cases, fault diagnosis (isolation and identification) is performed with expert analysis. Algorithms permit the detection of machining and assembly faults.

The smooth operation and high efficiency of gears are necessary for normal running of machinery. Therefore, gear crack damage detection is a main topic in the field of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Due to the intrinsic dynamic characteristics and complicated ambient excitations, the on-site measured gear torsional vibration signals are frequently characterized by complexity and non-stationary. For example, the tooth meshing effect, amplitude and phase modulation phenomena inherent with gear pair transmission; the multiple signal components originated from different excitations, complicated propagation, and dynamic coupling between mechanical components, the time averaging characteristics due to operation and conditions; and especially the transient impulses induced by gear crack damage. This paper presents an experimental technique by which the geared system torsional vibration responses can be monitored and used with the high order statistics of RMS averages and Kurtosis value for fault diagnosis. A single-stage gearbox with helical gears is used, where the vibration signal is considered stationary waveform. The results indicate that significant diagnostic information can be gained from this study, which allow the diagnostic information be controlled and consequently used for Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) regime.

Most online monitoring systems are based on conventional vibration measurement devices for gear transmissions or bearings in mechanical components. In this paper, we propose an alternative way of bearing condition monitoring based on the instantaneous angular speed measurement. By the help of a large experimental investigation on two different applications, we prove that localized faults like pitting in bearing generate small angular speed fluctuations which are measurable with optical or magnetic encoders. We also emphasize the benefits of measuring instantaneous angular speed with the pulse timing method through an implicit angular sampling which ensures insensitivity to speed fluctuation. A wide range of operating conditions have been tested for the two applications with varying speed, load, external excitations, gear ratio,. The tests performed on an automotive gearbox or on actual operating vehicle wheels also establish the robustness of the proposed methodology. By the means of a conventional Fourier transform, angular frequency channels kinematically related to the fault periodicity show significant magnitude differences related to the damage severity. Sideband effects are evidently seen when the fault is located on rotating parts of the bearing due to load modulation. Additionally, slip effects are also suspected to be at the origin of enlargement of spectrum peaks in the case of double row bearings loaded	[Renaudin, L.; Remond, D.] Univ Lyon, CNRS, UMR5259, INSA Lyon,LaMCoS, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France		Renaudin, L (corresponding author), Univ Lyon, CNRS, UMR5259, INSA Lyon,LaMCoS, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.	didier.remond@insa-lyon.fr	REMOND, Didier/M-1993-2013	REMOND, Didier/0000-0002-5635-9480			Antoni J, 2002, J SOUND VIB, V257, P815, DOI 10.1006/jsvi.5062; Bonnardot F, 2005, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V19, P766, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2004.05.001; BONNARDOT F, 2004, INT J ACOUSTICS VIBR, V9; BRAUN SG, 1979, J SOUND VIB, V65, P37, DOI 10.1016/0022-460X(79)90526-1; Fyfe KR, 1997, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V11, P187, DOI 10.1006/mssp.1996.0056; Gu FS, 2006, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V20, P1444, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2005.02.001; KONG X, 1987, THESIS U WISCONSIN M; Loughlin PJ, 1997, SIGNAL PROCESS, V60, P153, DOI 10.1016/S0165-1684(97)00069-8; Mahfoudh J., 2003, ASME INT GAS TURBINE, V1, P345; Randall R.B., 1981, AM SOC MECH ENG, P9; Remond D, 2005, SHOCK VIB, V12, P149, DOI 10.1155/2005/205291; Remond D, 1998, MEAS SCI TECHNOL, V9, P347, DOI 10.1088/0957-0233/9/3/006; Samuel PD, 2005, J SOUND VIB, V282, P475, DOI 10.1016/j.jsv.2004.02.058; Sawalhi N, 2008, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V22, P1924, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2007.12.001; Stander CJ, 2005, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V19, P817, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2004.10.006; Stander CJ, 2002, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V16, P1005, DOI 10.1006/mssp.2002.1479; Yang JG, 2001, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V15, P549, DOI 10.1006/mssp.2000.1344	17	0	0	0	3	KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN, DEPT WERKTUIGKUNDE	HEVERLEE	CELESTIJNENLAAN 300B, HEVERLEE, B-3001, BELGIUM			978-90-73802-87-2				2010							2949	2964					16	Engineering, Mechanical	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BZT50	WOS:000302905400219					2022-02-14

Vibration measurements in both time and frequency domains have been used for the detection of localized defects. In this research, particular attention is given to different wear evolution. In case of generalized roughness (due to contaminations, lack or loss of lubrication, corrosion, humidity, etc.), classical spectral analysis of the vibration signal does not exhibit characteristic frequencies but only unpredictable broadband changes. Furthermore, when direct-drive motors are employed - e.g. in the packaging machines - to provide complex laws of motion, interactions between different parts of the bearings are not periodic, so the detection of failures cannot be performed in the frequency domain. A wavelet based decomposition of the stator current is here proposed for the detection of generalized roughness of bearings in direct-drive motors. Stator current energy, computed at each node of the decomposition, is proposed as fault indicator and the most sensitive frequency band to the degradation process is identified. Experimental results are presented for different motors with different working hours, operating in an industrial environment. In particular, the analysis of the energy distribution among bandwidths in the wavelet decomposition is performed. A comparison between the energy levels in the healthy and faulty cases completes the paper. The results are normalized with respect to the energy of a healthy motor.

The need to optimize the maintenance effort has been increasing the interest in creating automated mechanisms of analysis when it comes to the condition of machines and equipment. Microphone-array-based methods are known as alternatives for noise source identification in machines. In this work, the monitoring of the changes in system conditions is based on the measured noise data starting from continuous signals produced by a microphone array. The "Beamforming" technique is used to visualize the directionality pattern of the noise emitted by the machinery. For the recognition of changes in the directionality patterns, in monitoring and diagnosis of the flaws in machines, the transformation algorithm Karhunen-Loeve, also known as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, will be used.

Among the different applications, this technique can be used in the advanced fault identification of gear failure in rotating machinery. Normally all frequencies in a specific range are studied. The common assumption is that the results obtained are more precise in this way. However, a draw back to this method is the use of large frequency spectra, thus reducing the efficiency of computational calculations. This paper introduces a different approach to vibration analysis, using a pre-selection of the scope of frequencies that will be under study, aimed to produce an optimisation of time employed and also in results. The selected frequencies can carry as much information as possible with a limited number of frequencies. The vibration signals for damaged gear teeth were obtained from an experimental gears test rig. Typical gear tooth faults were simulated on the pinion gear tooth by a suitable process in the lab. The resulting spectra corresponding to tested gears were dealt with a method based on optimal frequency selection, which estimates the frequencies that have an effect in the characterization of the state of the gears. Finally, different analysis techniques were applied on the selected frequencies and the results of a number of tests carried out are presented and compared with traditional methods.

In the present paper, the use of the bispectrum has been proposed for the fault diagnosis in rotating machines. It is because it may possibly reduce the number of vibration transducers at each bearing pedestal in rotating machines in future. The paper presents the comparison of the bispectrum results for three cases, namely; Healthy, Misaligned shaft and Shaft Rub on an experimental rig consisting of two rigidly coupled shafts supported through 4 ball bearings. Only one accelerometer at each bearing pedestal has been used for this purpose and the initial results observed to be encouraging.

So, recently many kinds of NDT were applied for CM. Acoustic Emission (AE) is widely used for the early detection of faults in rotating machinery. Because its sensitivity is higher than normal accelerometers, and it can detect low energy vibration signals. And crack is considered one of severe fault in the rotating machine. In this paper, therefore, early detection has done by AE about the shaft of low speed rotating machine. There is a seeded initial crack on the shaft, and then AE signal had been measured with low speed rotation and application of load-condition. Features were calculated using the pre-processed signals by envelope analysis and wavelet transform. The trend of crack growth had found out by the features, such as the peak, skewness, kurtosis, crest factor, frequency center value (FC), variance frequency value (VF) and so on used in the mechanical vibration field generally.

Many theoretical models have been established to describe the relationship between the vibration signals and the existence of damage. In this research, the application of statistical analysis, as a tool for damage identification and health monitoring in rotating machinery, is investigated. The statistical properties of vibration spectra are studied, and the hypothesis tests are performed accordingly. Due to the complexity of the statistical model, critical values for the hypothesis tests are obtained via Monte-Carlo simulation. Such a statistical model provides a screening technique to detect other damage types. Experimental vibration data were collected from different fault types to validate the statistical model.

More specifically, a conditional probability hierarchically reflecting various types of correlation information is theoretically derived by introducing an expression on the multi-dimensional probability distribution in orthogonal expansion series form.

But this method is heavily confined to maneuverability, safety and massive operations when applied to large scale. Contrary to the traditional methods, "outer detection" method (or non-invasive method) has its advantages. This method uses a certain non-invasive detecting method to measure the vibration and the noise of a machine, thus to obtain information as much as it can without any breakage and modification to the structure. The work described in this paper is aimed at the development of an outer detecting and analyzing system. The system uses a piezoelectric sensor as the detector, a sound card of PC as an A/D converter, a software analyzing system. It has a number of new characteristics: full functions on real-time data processing and recording; automatic fault detection and alert; multi-spectrum extended analysis functions. These mean a simpler detection method, no breakage on machine chambers, high mobility. Some faults examining experiments are completed. Especially the research is done on rotor rubbing, bearing friction and unusual multi-harmonic. Detecting methods of these faults are developed, such as fractal geometry, weight center of frequency, peak tracing and peak searching, etc. Based on the experiments, these detecting and analyzing methods have shown to be of practical use. Other features of the system include less CPU time, very suitable for real-time examinations. It is concluded that even there are many difficulties in rotating machines non-invasive method, we can still obtain some useful results.

The noise present in the measured condition variables may adversely affect the prognostic results. Reported work to address this problem includes removing the effects of noise from the observations of condition variables before prediction and modeling actual observations in a statistical way, which is, however, usually not user-friendly. In this work, support vector machine (SVM) is used directly for machine condition prognosis. As SVM is a parametric method, it has potential to achieve good denosing and predicting results simultaneously by appropriately adjusting its model parameters. An optimization model is developed for selecting the parameters, which is solved by adopting genetic algorithms.

To solve this problem, a new method based on frequency space subdivision (FSS) in wavelet transform (WT) is proposed and applied in this paper. Meanwhile, a processing approach of engine data stream is introduced, which makes further waveform analysis possible. This method is applied to an injector-pulse-width waveform analysis. As for the No. 12 fault analysis, firstly a biorthogonal wavelet base with good characteristics is selected, then three-layer wavelet decomposition is used to analyze injector-pulse-width in both time domain and frequency domain, and finally the accurate fault band is located through calculation of the sum of the difference between fault and normal wavelet coefficients. The result obtains that the fault comes from the oxygen sensor, which is completely coincident with the experimental fault hypothesis. Injector-pulse-width waveform of No. 1, 8, 11 and 19 faults are also analyzed similarly. The results show that the proposed waveform analysis method improves the accuracy of the engine fault diagnosis. This method provides a supplement for the known non-disintegration engine fault diagnosis and supplies a good reference for fault diagnosis of the other large machines.

A method combining the Morlet wavelet and Correlation Filtering, named Cyclic Morlet Wavelet Correlation Filtering (CMWCF), is proposed for identifying both the impulse response parameters and the cyclic period. Simulation study on cyclic impulse response signal with different SNR showed that CMWCF is effective in identifying the impulse response parameters and the cyclic period. Applications in gearbox vibration parameter identification for localized fault diagnosis showed that CMWCF is effective in identifying the parameters, and thus provides a feature detection method for gearbox fault diagnosis.

First of all, the adaptive lifting wavelet is constructed to mach the signal local characteristics. The original signal is decomposed into approximation signal and detail signal. Secondly, 32 time-domain statistical features are evaluated and some salient features are selected from them by applying the distance evaluation technique. Finally, multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is applied. The testing classification accuracy with salient features of the proposed model reaches to 98.32%, which is 5.32% and 5.04% higher than classification with the salient features of original signal and the salient features of approximation signal and detail signal decomposed by second generation wavelet. It shows that the proposed model can effectively lock signal local characteristics, recognize different fault categories and enhance classification accuracy.

In DC-DC power converter systems electrolytic capacitors and MOSFET's have higher failure rates among the components. Degradation in the capacitors under varying operating conditions leads to high ripples output voltages and currents affecting downstream components leading to cascading faults. For example, in avionics systems where the power supply drives a GPS unit, ripple currents can cause glitches in the GPS position and velocity output, and this may cause errors in the Inertial Navigation (INAV) system, causing the aircraft to fly off course The work in this paper proposes a detail experimental and systematic study on analyzing the degradation phenomenon is electrolytic capacitors under high stress operating conditions. The output degradation is typically measured by an increase in ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and decrease in the capacitance value.. We present the details of our accelerated ageing methodology along with analysis and comparison of the results.

In the developed approach, multiple sensors acquire vibration and sound signals from a machine and the signals are represented using the Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). A "wrapper" feature selection procedure is used to reduce the size of the feature set without sacrificing the classification accuracy. The performance of a Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) is compared with that of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) by simulating and monitoring machine and sensor faults in an industrial fish cutting machine. Initial results show an 85% reduction in feature set size for an RBFN and a 92.5% reduction in feature set size for a SVM.

An aircraft systems model with hydraulic actuators for control surfaces is developed in SIMULINK and is connected with a model for predicting degradation of an actuator. An LQR based feedback control is employed to compensate for changes in the plant dynamics and a feedforward controller is used to achieve better performance through set-point tracking, while taking into account the current actuator degradation rate. The advantage of the combination of feedback and feedforward control strategies is then demonstrated through reduction of degradation of the actuator while achieving a minimum loss of performance using constrained optimization.

In order to improve quality of braided structures the effects of yarn tension and resulting braid formation position must be understood and controlled. This paper reports the effect of yarn tension on braid formation (braid point) motion along with the radial and longitudinal motion of the braid point in the initial, transient, and final positions. Visual observations utilizing low cost webcams are also presented as well as a diagnostic tool which can recognize the onset of defects and provide some insight into what might be causing the fault. Optimal braid performance is observed which serves as the baseline for comparing the behavior of faults. Radial fluctuation of braid point position is a good indicator of mechanical faults of the tensioning mechanisms. The experiments performed will provide the foundation for further work with applications for improving braiding quality in ropes, tethers, and structural composites. Finally, this experimental study and dynamic characterization will be useful for assessing future passive and active control methods, along with sensing.

The system developed allows for the modular mounting of instruments in differing configurations on an industry-standard tool post, which was developed in collaboration with a first-year graduate class in sensors and signals at the Colorado School of Mines. Data acquisition and the development of an interactive data analysis tool used for post-processing is discussed using results from a case study obtained by turning 304 stainless steel on a shop lathe. It is shown that chatter can be detected using a novel hi-level FFT approach at low computational cost. Potential future applications for the developed system are introduced, including real-time tool condition analysis and the development of a fully instrumented machine shop.

FUNCTION-BASED ANALYSIS AND REDESIGN OF A FLYABLE ELECTROMECHANICAL ACTUATOR TEST STAND	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, DETC 2010, VOL 3, A AND B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences / Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 15-18, 2010	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Design Engn Div, Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Comp & Informat Engn Div		Electromechanical actuator; function-based design; data analysis assumptions	DESIGN	Critical faults prevent electromechanical actuators (EMAs) from controlling primary flight surfaces aboard commercial and military human air/spacecraft. However, the efficiency and simplicity of the EMAs makes them appealing for use. For successful implementation, diagnostic and prognostic techniques identifying these critical faults must be optimized. This paper builds the foundation for the design of a second-generation test stand whose aim is to inject known EMA faults and record the data output while onboard an aircraft. First, an overview of faults is presented. Next, functional modeling is introduced as an effective system level representation to implement early design changes. Specifically, functional modeling is proposed to isolate functions of the test stand that can affect faulted and nominal actuator data collection through violations of post-processing statistical assumptions. The data collected from the EMA test stand will be used for actuator prognostic purposes and therefore must closely represent a full-scale actuator installation. This methodology will increase experiment validity, verifiable conclusions made regarding actuator remaining useful life, and overall system reliability.

However, if its design and manufacturing is inappropriate, the use of rotor-fluid film bearing system will suffers from some problem such as violent vibration. Although the checking calculation has been carried out during the design process, nominal value of design parameters is usual used to prognosis the vibration characteristics of rotor-fluid film bearing system. However, in practice, these parameters always vary within a certain range due to manufacturing tolerances and variation of working environment. In this paper, a model for simulating the performance of rotor-fluid film bearing system has been established. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of manufacturing tolerances and variation of working environment on the rotor vibration. In the end, a uncertainty analysis is carried out to demonstrate which of the factors has the greatest effect on the rotor vibration at different rotational speed.

The vibration response of healthy bearings and bearings with various component defects such as outer race, inner race, balls and their combination have been analyzed. From the obtained vibration spectrum, it is clearly seen that a discrete peak of excitation appeared for the specific defect of bearings. In this paper, various faults of the bearings has been simulated and classified. The process includes, data acquisition, feature extraction from time response and a knowledge based system to classify faults. Features defining feature vectors are formed using statistical techniques and are fed as input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Knowledge based system developed for classification can be used for automatic recognition of machinery faults based on feature vector.	[Bhavaraju, Kalyan M.; Kankar, P.

Hence, the vibration signatures can be used as a feature for the fault diagnosis. This paper presents the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based fault analysis, which is used to classify various known faults using the features extracted from the vibration signals. The vibration signals from the piezoelectric accelerometers are being measured for the following conditions- No defect (NOD), Outer race defect (ORD), Inner race defect (IRD), Ball fault (BF) and Combination of above (COMB). The features are extracted from the time domain using the statistical method. These features are filtered using wavelet filter & kernel filter and compiled as the input vectors. The multilayer neural network is trained by these input vectors. The training and testing results show that wavelet and kernel filter can be effective tool in the diagnosis of ball bearing faults using ANN. Results obtained from the ANN predict that the wavelet filter provides good accuracy with reduction in the training time.	[Bhatnagar, Aashish; Kankar, P. K.; Sharma, Satish C.; Harsha, S.

These problems cause malfunctions in rotating machinery since they create strange vibrations coming from impact and friction. However, non-linear and non-stationary signals due to impact and friction are difficult to identify. Therefore, exact time and frequency information are needed for identifying these signals. For this purpose, a newly developed time-frequency analysis method, HHT(Hilbert-Huang Transform), is applied to the signals of partial rub and looseness from the experiment RK-4 rotor kit. Conventional signal processing methods such as FFT, STFT and CWT were compared to verify the effectiveness of fault diagnosis using HET. The results showed that the impact signals were generated regularly when partial rub occurred but that intermittent impact and friction occurred irregularly when looseness occurred. The time and frequency information was represented exactly by using Hi HT in both cases, which makes clear fault diagnosis between partial rub and looseness.

Therefore, it is a key step to trace machinery health condition for CBM. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to establish a health evaluation index named automatic evaluation index (AEI) and its corresponding dynamic threshold using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and Hidden Markolv Model (HMM). In this process, WPT is used to decompose signal into detail signals and exhibits prominent gear fault features. In addition, HMM employed here is to recognize two concerned states of gear in the whole life validation, including normal gear state and early gear fault state. It is also important to build a dynamic threshold to differentiate the two states automatically. The proposed dynamic threshold not only renews by itself according to the history values of AEI but also easily and automatically detects occurrence of gear early fault. Finally, a set of whole life time data ending in gear failure is used to verify the proposed method effectively. Further, some related parameters included in this method are discussed and the obtained results show that condition monitoring performance of the proposed method is excellent in detection of gear failure.

An efficient fault diagnostic method is proposed to identify the locations and amounts of faults based on the vibration responses of the rotor without prior knowledge of the numbers and locations of the faults. The proposed method achieves fast diagnosis by orderly searching the possible locations of faults, avoiding exploring all possible combinations of faults, and fully utilizing previous search results. Based on the unique search strategy, the proposed method is suitable for on-line monitoring and diagnosis of the gradual variations of shaft-bow and unbalance of large rotating machinery of fixedly rotating speeds, like steam turbine-generators of power plants.

With EEMD, the components with physical meaning can be extracted from the signal. The bispectrum, a third-order statistic, helps identify phase-coupling effects, which are useful for detecting faults in rotating machinery. Combining the advantages of EEMD and bispectrum, this paper proposes a new method for detecting such faults. First, the original vibration signals collected from rotating machinery are decomposed by EEMD and a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is produced. Then, the IMF's are reconstructed into new signals using the weighted reconstruction algorithm developed in this paper. Finally, the reconstructed signals are analyzed via the bispectrum to detect faults. Both simulation examples and gearbox experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can detect gear faults more clearly than can directly performing bispectrum analysis on the original vibration signals.

The machine vibration signals are processed using morphological signal processing (MSP) to extract a novel entropy based health index (HI) characterizing the signal shape-size complexity. The evolution of HI is approximated as a nonlinear state space model using a computational intelligence (Cl) technique. PF is used to estimate the progression of HI in presence of observation and process noise. The PF based approach is illustrated for estimation of state and parameters of a chaotic system. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through vibration dataset of a helicopter drive-train system gearbox. The results help understand the relationship of the system condition, the corresponding HI, the level of degradation and its progression in a stochastic environment using Bayesian learning.

However, most techniques presently available require a good level of expertise in order to apply them successfully. Therefore, there is a demand for techniques that can make decisions on the running health of a machine automatically and without the need for a specialist to examine the data and diagnose the problem. Artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy c-means (FCM), hierchical and partitional clustering, and support vector machines (SVM) have been applied in automated detection and diagnosis of machine conditions. Most of these methods require training based on experimental data both from the healthy as well as the defective machine. This fact significantly diminishes their practical applicability. For this reason, the well established K-means clustering partitional method is proposed in this paper, due to its ease of programming and because it accomplishes a good trade-off between achieved performance and computational complexity. The first step in K-means clustering is finding a set of initial centers. The algorithm is significantly sensitive to the initial randomly selected clusters' centers. In this paper, in order to overcome this limitation, the initial centers are selected by features extracted from signals simulating the dynamic behavior of bearings under normal condition or under special types of defects (outer or inner race defect). After the selection of the centers of the clusters, the method can be directly implemented to signals measured from the industrial environment. As shown in three different industrial cases, each containing a set of 5 successive measurements following the evolution of a defect, the method is able to identify and appropriately classify the bearing defect. Critical to the success of the method is the type of features extracted from the signals. Some features seem to be irrelevant and redundant in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, resulting to low diagnosis accuracy. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness and improve the simplicity of the procedure, a set of features is proposed in this paper, able to clearly characterize the existence and the type of the defect. These features are mostly based on appropriately selected frequency domain parameters. Comparing the proposed frequency domain features to traditional time domain statistical features, indicates the relevance and superiority of the proposed feature set, resulting in 100% success in all 15 measurements of all 3 test cases.

Successful implementation of CBM relies on observation of actual health condition of machinery. Therefore, it is crucial to perform condition monitoring in CBM. This paper focuses on quantifying health condition of machinery. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to decompose signal and extract dominant signatures, which could reflect health condition variation of machinery. Then, a novel index called Health Index (HI) is proposed to describe condition development trends. In order to detect occurrence of early faults, a dynamic threshold is also proposed. In case occurrence of early fault, HI should be higher than its corresponding threshold. This novel condition monitoring method is more appropriate for on-line health monitoring and detection of incipient fault. Two sets of data collected from gearboxes are used to validate the proposed method. The analysis results show that the proposed method is effective in condition monitoring, especially the detection of early faults.

In order to get a feature containing different fault signatures, this paper uses Wavelet Transform (WT), Wavelet Lifting Scheme (WLS) and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), respectively, to decompose signal into different frequency bands. Then, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized to extract intrinsic characteristic of signal from obtained matrix. These singular value vectors are regarded as inputs to Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for identification of machinery health condition. In this research, the fault diagnosis system is validated by motor bearing data, including normal bearings, inner race fault bearings, outer race fault bearings and roller fault bearings. Analysis results show that this method is effective in bearing fault diagnosis and its classification rate is excellent.

In order to justify an initial license extension for the 40-60 year period, new non-destructive examination (NDE) approaches have been developed and deployed by NPP operators in their Aging Management Programs (AMPs). However, to achieve the goals of even longer term operation, and specifically for the USA in looking at methodologies to support subsequent license renewal periods (i.e., 60-80 years, and beyond), it is necessary to understand the capabilities of current NDE methods to detect, monitor and trend degradation and hence enable timely implementation of appropriate corrective actions. This paper discusses insights from past experience, the state-of-the-art, and current activities in the move towards providing a capacity for proactive management of materials degradation (PMMD) to support NPP LTO.

They can operate at very high temperatures, require no lubrication supply (oil pumps, seals, etc), exhibit very long life with no maintenance, and once operating airborne, have very low power loss. The use of gas foil bearings in high-speed turbomachinery has been accelerating in recent years, although the pace has been slow. One of the contributing factors to the slow growth has been a lack of analysis tools, benchmarked to measurements, to predict gas foil bearing behavior in rotating machinery. To address this shortcoming, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has supported the development of analytical tools to predict gas foil bearing performance. One of the codes has the capability to predict rotordynamic coefficients, power loss, film thickness, structural deformation, and more. The current paper presents an assessment of the predictive capability of the code, named XLGFBTH (c). A test rig at GRC is used as a simulated case study to compare rotordynamic analysis using output from the code to actual rotor response as measured in the test rig. The test rig rotor is supported on two gas foil journal bearings manufactured at GRC, with all pertinent geometry disclosed. The resulting comparison shows that the rotordynamic coefficients calculated using XLGFBTH (c) represent the dynamics of the system reasonably well, especially as they pertain to predicting critical speeds.

To avoid failure of the rotating systems due to these cracks, the system needs to be continuously monitored.. The reliability of the machinery can be enhanced. with the fault identification at the early stages of their occurrence. Model based methods are used for crack identification in. rotating systems successfully. Model based methods are of different types. One of the methods, the equivalent loads minimization method is studied here. It has a limitation that the error in identified crack depth increases with decrease in number of measured vibrations. In the present work, the theoretical fault model loads used in least squares minimization algorithm are transformed using modal expansion to reduce error in the identified fault parameters. The crack is identified accurately even in the case of less number of measured vibrations. The method is applied for crack identification in a centrifugal pump rotor using transverse vibrations. The results presented are obtained purely from FEM simulations.	[Sudhakar, G. N. D. S.; Sekhar, A.

It is possible by the new technologies and information systems. In a previous research work, the authors developed a Remote Condition Monitoring System (RCM) applied to the critical element of the infrastructure point machine. In this paper is presented a new Fault Detection and Diagnostic (FDD) analysis system for RCM, based on a dynamic B-spline interpolation function that allows the definition of a piecewise tolerance region. These regions are used to generate some simple rules for detection and verification of a failure or fault. Once the fault is detected the FDD of the system is analysed by Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) via Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). FTA is a graphical representation of logical relationships between events, where every events has a fault probability associated, and BDD is a method which determines the output value of the function by examining the inputs The BDD method does not analyse the FTA directly, but converts the tree to a BDD that represents the Boolean equation for the top event. This conversion presents several problems, where the variable ordering scheme chosen for the construction of the BDD has a crucial effect on its resulting size and it is solved in this paper employing different methods.

Numerical and experimental investigation of the vibration of rotors with loose discs	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						loose rotating disc; rotor dynamics; finite-element model; machine diagnostic; fault simulator		In this study, the energy method has been used to develop a finite-element code for Studying the effects of loose rotating discs on the rotor-bearing systems' response. A mathematical model of the loose disc has resulted in terms similar to unbalance and gyroscopic effects in the equation of motion of the system. Results of this Study show that rotor response and beating phenomena are a function of measurement location, loose disc mass and inertia, ratio of rotating speed to the speed of loose disc, and clearance between the loose disc and shaft considering constant speed for loose disc and shaft. The developed finite-element model can numerically give the response of rotors with any number of loose discs at any location with isotropic or orthotropic supports. Results of numerical calculation have been verified by experimental tests.

However, a problem arises from setting optimal parameters for SVM so as to obtain optimal diagnosis result. This article presents a fault diagnosis method based on SVM with parameter optimization by ant colony algorithm to attain a desirable fault diagnosis result, which is performed on the locomotive roller bearings to validate its feasibility and efficiency. The experiment finds that the proposed algorithm of ant colony optimization with SVM (ACO-SVM) can help one to obtain a good fault diagnosis result, which confirms the advantage of the proposed ACO-SVM approach.

An investigation into machine pattern recognition based on time-frequency image feature extraction using a support vector machine	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						pattern recognition; time-frequency image; Hilbert time-frequency spectrum; cyclostationarity; gravity central; information entropy; support vector machine	EFFECTIVE VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CYCLOSTATIONARITY	In this article, a new method of pattern recognition for machine working conditions is presented that is based on time-frequency image (TFI) feature extraction and support vector machines (SVMs). In this study, the Hilbert time-frequency spectrum (HTFS) is used to construct TFIs because of its good performance in non-stationary and non-linear signal analysis. Cyclostationarity signal analysis is a pre-processing method for improving the performance of the HTFS in the construction of TFIs. Feature extraction for TFIs is investigated in detail to construct a feature vector for pattern recognition. Gravity centre and information entropy of TFIs are used to construct the feature vector for pattern recognition. SVMs are used for different working conditions classification by the constructed feature vector because of its powerful performance even for small samples. In the end, rolling bearing pattern recognition is used as an example to testify the effectiveness of this method. According to the result analysis, it can be concluded that this method will contribute to the development of preventative maintenance.

Applying improved multi-scale entropy and support vector machines for bearing health condition identification	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						fault diagnosis; bearing; multi-scale entropy; membership function; support vector machines	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CORRELATION DIMENSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION	Considering the non-linearity existing in bearing vibration signals as well as the scarcity of fault samples, this paper presents a method for bearing health condition identification based on improved multi-scale entropy (IMSE) and support vector machines (SVMs). IMSE refers to the calculation of improved sample entropies (i.e. fuzzy sample entropies across a sequence of scales). Applying IMSE to mechanical vibration signals can take into account not only the non-linearity but also the interactions and coupling between mechanical components, thus providing much more information regarding the machine health condition than traditional single-scale entropy can be expected to. In engineering practice, the amount of fault samples is often limited for training a classifier, which thus decreases the performance of traditional classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANNs). SVMs are derived from statistical learning theory, which is different from the conventional statistical theory on which ANNs are based. SVMs provide a favourable solution to small sample-sized problems. In this study, IMSE and SVMs are employed as fault feature extractor and classifier, respectively. The experimental results verify that the proposed method has potential applications in bearing health condition identification.

J	Lei, Y; Zuo, MJ; Hoseini, M				Lei, Y.; Zuo, M. J.; Hoseini, M.			The use of ensemble empirical mode decomposition to improve bispectral analysis for fault detection in rotating machinery	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						ensemble empirical mode decomposition; weighted reconstruction algorithm; bispectrum; rotating machinery; fault detection	DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTRUM	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been widely applied to analyse signals for the detection of faults in rotating machinery. However, sometimes, it cannot reveal signal characteristics accurately because of the mode mixing problem. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was developed recently to alleviate the mode mixing problem of EMD. With EEMD, components that are physically meaningful can be extracted from the signals. Bispectrum, a third-order statistic, helps identify phase coupling effects, which are useful for detecting faults in rotating machinery. Utilizing the advantages of EEMD and bispectrum, this article proposes a joint method for detecting such faults. First, original vibration signals collected from rotating machinery are decomposed by EEMD and a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is produced. Then, the IMFs are reconstructed into new signals using the weighted reconstruction algorithm developed in this article. Finally, the reconstructed signals are analysed via bispectrum to detect faults. The simulation experiments and the physical experiments of two gears with a chipped tooth and a cracked tooth, respectively, demonstrate that the proposed method can detect faults more clearly than can directly performing bispectrum on the original vibration signals.

Research on the order selection of the autoregressive modelling for rolling bearing diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						autoregressive model; order selection; fault diagnosis; rolling bearing	SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; MACHINE; SIGNAL; GEAR	The article does a research on the order selection of the autoregressive (AR) model for the rolling element bearings. First, the model of the signal that matches the one introduced by McFadden is considered. To clearly describe it, here it is called the resonance damping model. It is shown that the impulses generated by a fault will cause structure resonance and soon decay with a periodic mode. As the AR process based on the prediction theory has an ability to recognize the periodic (quasi-periodic) part, it is possible to pick out the damping part that is a quasi-periodic component. Because of the background noise, the damping part cannot be recognized if the component decays to be buried into noise absolutely. Hence the optimal order should be the number of points contained by the process, which is the maximum length of the periodic damping part that the AR model can recognize. That is to say, the process should last until the resonance damping part is buried into noise completely. Then an experiment to validate the method is carried out and success is achieved in the fault diagnosis of real rolling bearings. In the end, it is concluded that the optimal order has a high ability for noise cancellation for rolling element bearing diagnosis.

Voltage, current, displacement, and pressure signals were then monitored at barriers on five sites in the UK, and both upper and lower thresholds were calculated for the purpose of condition monitoring and fault detection. The approach was found to detect around one-third of the total failures.	[Roberts, C.; Tobias, A.

Fault diagnosis based on optimized node entropy using lifting wavelet packet transform and genetic algorithms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bearing fault diagnosis; wavelet; lifting scheme; support vector machines; neural networks	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CORRELATION DIMENSION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; SCHEME; TOOL	The current paper presents a novel scheme for bearing fault diagnosis based on lifting wavelet packet transform (LWPT), sample entropy (SampEn), support vector machines (SVMs), and genetic algorithms (GAs). In the proposed scheme, bearing vibration signals were first decomposed into different frequency sub-bands through a four-level LWPT, resulting in a total of 31 node signal components throughout all layers of the LWPT decomposition tree. The SampEns of all 31 components were then calculated as an original feature pool to characterize the complexity of the bearing vibration signals within the corresponding frequency bands. For selecting the most informative features thus reducing the number of features, a GA was applied to simultaneously pick out the salient features and optimize the parameters of SVMs so as to avoid the curse of dimensionality, alleviate computational burden, and improve the subsequent classification. Experiments were conducted on an induction motor with respect to various bearing faults and a range of fault severities. As an example here, three salient features were selected from the original 31 features, with the dimension of features reduced dramatically. The selected three features were then presented into the optimized SVM to identify various bearing conditions. The scheme was compared with the widely used WPT-Energy method and with a neural network classifier with respect to feature extractions and fault classifications, respectively. The results are in favour of the proposed scheme in terms of the feature dimension, number of support vectors, robustness to the data partition, and classification rate.

Changes in rolling surfaces occur due to plastic deformation, rolling contact wear, and rolling contact fatigue. Wear particles can be formed and mixed into the lubricant. Increased levels of vibrations due to surface degradation can be monitored by sensors. Rolling contact wear and rolling contact fatigue during rolling bearing operation can be diagnosed by combining measured and interpreted condition monitoring data with theory, and conclusions drawn thereof can support a continuous prognosis for the remaining bearing life. In the present work, connections between bearing diagnostics and tribological mechanisms are outlined.

New decision support system based on operational risk assessment to improve aircraft operability	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						decision support; operational risk assessment; reliability; operability; availability; prognostics; Bayesian networks		This paper details a new decision support that adds a proactive function to the actual line aircraft maintenance turn-around-time (TAT) process, where next-flight decisions are assisted by the health assessment function of the integrated vehicle health management (IVHM) of an aircraft. The 'operational risk assessment' concept appears an extended function supported on the IVHM information for calculating and evaluating the operational risk for aircraft and fleet operations. It creates or reshapes maintenance plans based on predictions of the future maintenance relevant events (e.g. component-degradation-driven repair or replacement events) and its impact on the operational planning of the aircraft/fleet. 'Operational risk assessment' makes it possible to turn the scheduled line maintenance into a proactively defined maintenance. The paper also illustrates the first step involved in this approach: 'condition view' function, which is responsible for the provision of the remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of a health managed component. This function provides the basis for the operational risk estimation on the aircraft in order to identify maintenance actions that can be deferred.

PROGNOSTICS; SOLDER	Reliability concerns in state-of- the-art electronic systems have led researchers and engineers to develop innovative real- time prognostics and adaptive health management methods to assure desired availability. Prognostics techniques described here use a novel concept of canaries, along with data analysis, failure mechanism models and integrated fusion techniques to determine the remaining useful life of a system. A canary is a device that provides data to generate early warning of functional degradation and impending functional failure. Three types of canaries are discussed. Expendable canaries experience accelerated degradation (compared to functional degradation) by design, so that early warning of impending failure can be generated. Sensory canaries provide early warning by observing nonfunctional manifestation of functional degradation. Conjugate-stress canaries provide measurement of life- cycle stress history so that failure models can be used to estimate consumed life and remaining life. This paper focuses on expendable canaries, in particular, and provides three examples to illustrate the underlying design concepts.

FEM ANALYSIS OF ANGULAR MISALIGNMENT FAULT IN SRM MAGNETOSTATIC CHARACTERISTICS	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							SWITCHED RELUCTANCE MACHINE; FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; ROTOR ECCENTRICITY; ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING; SIMULATION; OBJECTS; MOTOR	This paper proposes magnetostatic analysis of Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) under angular misalignment fault to evaluate the performance of the motor under different operating conditions. In this analysis three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) is used to simulate reliable and precise model by considering the complex motor magnetic geometry, end effects, axial fringing effects as well as nonlinear properties of the magnetic materials. The FE analysis is performed to obtain the static magnetic characteristics of SRM including flux density, flux linkages, terminal inductance and mutual inductance profile under different rotor positions for different varying degree of faults. Consequently, it presents assessing the features of mutual inductance in inactive phases to study the variations of diagnosis index. The results obtained present useful information regarding the detection of fault and its direction as well as the amount of angular misalignment fault in the motor. To the best knowledge of the authors, such an analysis has not been carried out previously.

Much attention has been focused on reliably assessing the condition of PCCP mains. However, assessment of embedded prestressing wire is difficult. Continuous acoustic monitoring can provide a means of locating problematic pipe sections. In this paper the application of support vector machine (SVM) in acoustic signal detection is proposed. And the effect of this method is investigated. Some key parameters of SVM and kernel functions are surveyed. SVM methods are more effective, especially for the case of lack of training samples. The experiment shows that the SVM method has good classification ability and robust performances. The techniques can provide the opportunity to identify problematic pipe sections and repair the pipe prior to failure. Therefore it can help to prolong the life of a suspect pipeline while minimizing the potential for catastrophic failure.

Adopt micro-machined technique two deep groove are corroded on the silicon plate, and two cantilever beams of metal heated hot wire is set up at each deep groove. Semicircle airtight space forms sense elements. Through two Wheatstone bridge, we get the tilt output voltage of x axis and y axis. To overcome environmental factors, a series of signal processing methods are proposed,such as: zero temperature compensation, sensitive temperature compensation and linear compensation. The test about the sensor showed the sensor's performance is as follow: resolution<0.05 degrees, nonlinear<0.1%, the working temperature is enlarged. One-dimensional sensor can be used to test the angle of objects relative to the horizontal plane, we know that this device can be tested by one-dimensional slant angle sensor when it slants to a certain detection. In real practices, we can not predict where a object slants. Two- dimension level posture sensor can give us the tested object's tilt angle relative to two specified Orthogonal reference axis. Therefore, two-dimension slant angle sensor has very good application prospects.(such as being used outside or Marine engineering). The usual level posture has solid pendulum, liquid pendulum,(13 because of two pendulums level posture has these faults which include complicated structure, bad shock-resistance function and long respond time. especially when it is combined with another one-dimension sensor to test two-dimension sensor, it's volume is too huge and costs too much, it also has large cross coupling.([2]) These gas tilt Angle sensor makes gas as sensitive quality. Two -dimension gas slant sensor with gas pendulum is made with Therefore it has higher shock-resistance and ability of vibration, existing two-dimension gas tilt sensor with pendulums is made in traditional machining process, Which has huge volume and can not be used in microsatellite, robot, headpiece, camera and car, these territory need small sensor. Sensitive components also have bad consistency, temperature compensation and the consistency of the linear compensation should be one-on-one to debug and compensate. Software compensation is too difficult and complicated to do batch production. In order to solve the existing gas tilting Angle sensor's huge volume and the problem of batch product consistency performance, this paper presents micro mechanical gas flow two-dimensional horizontal posture sensors made by a micro mechanical processing technology. It describes signal processing technology of sensitive components and the main properties of sensors are tested on the analysis of the structure.

It is therefore crucial for engineers and researchers to monitor the gear conditions in time in order to prevent the malfunctions of the plants. In this paper, a condition monitoring and faults identification technique for rotating machineries based on independent component analysis (ICA) and fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FKNN) is described. In the diagnosis process, the ICA was initially employed to separate characteristic vibration signal and interference vibration signal from the parallel time series obtained from multi-channel accelerometers mounted on different positions of the gearbox. The wavelet transform (WT) and autoregressive (AR) model method then were performed as the feature extraction technique to attain the original feature vector of the characteristic signal. Meanwhile, the ICA was used again to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature vector. Hence, the useless information in the feature vector could be removed. Finally, the FKNN algorithm was implemented in the pattern recognition process to identify the conditions of the gears of interest. The experimental results suggest that the sensitive fault features can be extracted efficiently after the ICA processing, and the proposed diagnostic system is effective for the gear multi-faults diagnosis, including the gear crack failure, pitting failure, gear tooth broken, compound fault of wear and spalling, etc. In addition, the proposed method can achieve higher performance than that without ICA processing with respect to the classification rate.

We investigate our generic fault diagnosis method on 2000 examples of real-world vibrational signals obtained from operational faulty industrial machines. The diagnostic system detects each considered fault in an input pattern using an ensemble of classifiers, which is composed of accurate classifiers that differ on their predictions as much as possible. The ensemble is built by first using complementary feature selection techniques to produce a set of candidate classifiers, and finally selecting an optimized subset of them to compose the ensemble. We propose a novel ensemble creation method based on feature selection. We work with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. As the performance of a SVM strictly depends on its hyperparameters, we also study whether and how varying the SVM hyperparameters might increase the ensemble accuracy. Our experiments show the usefulness of appropriately tuning the SVM hyperparameters in order to increase the ensemble diversity and accuracy.

The registered waveforms of the stator current, voltage and shaft flux are first transformed to the frequency spectrum using FFT. These harmonics are the potential candidates to be the features on the basis of which the SVM classifier is able to localize the faulty bars. The selection of the optimal set of harmonics is done in two-step approach. In the first step the wide set of harmonics is identified on the basis of comparison their values for two classes of data. In the second step the forward and backward regressive selection is applied to eliminate the strongly correlated features and to leave only the features well correlated with the recognized classes. The results of numerical experiments are presented and discussed in the paper.

However, a balance should be considered between the software cost and the cost of its technical support and reliability. In this article, a maintenance system for wind farms will be presented. It is connected to an information system for maintenance, called SNIFF (Terology Integrated Modular System) as a general base to manage the assets and as a support strategic line to the evolution of this system, which incorporates on-condition maintenance modules, and the support to the research and development done around this theme. The SMIT system is based on a TCP/IP network, using a Linux server running a PostgreSQL database and Apache web server with PHP, and Octave and R software for numerical analysis. Maintenance technicians, chiefs, economic and production management personnel can access SMIT database through SMIT clients for Windows. In addition, this maintenance system for wind systems uses also special low cost hardware for data acquisition on floor level. The hardware uses a distributed TCP/IP network to synchronize SMIT server master clock through Precision Time Protocol. Usually, the manufactures construct, deploy and give the means for the suppliers to perform the wind system's maintenance. This is a very competitive area, where companies tend to hide the development details and implementations. Within this scenario, the development of maintenance management models for multiple wind equipments is important, and will allow countries to be more competitive in a growing market. For on-condition monitoring, the algorithms are based on Support Vector Machines and time series analysis running under Octave and R open-source software's.

These are the key points presented in this paper, which also emphasizes the very recent contribution of 3D models in aiding fault diagnosis and terology in general. The way to achieve the above-mentioned objectives is through on-condition maintenance in two main fields, wind farms and Diesel engines. In wind farms, maintenance is done through the control of variables, such as vibration signals and the balance of electrical currents. As for Diesel engines, on-condition variables are the emissions of PM10, NOx, CO, HC and CO2. However, there are problems in both situations, namely, in the first case, the distance and accessibility of the generators and, in the second case, the problems associated with the fact that the equipment is not static. Another common problem in both situations is the measuring and transmission of the values of the on-condition variables, because, in the case of wind farms, the machine is placed on top of the tower and, in the case of Diesel engines, the vehicles are in operation most of the time and most of the measurements need be made while the vehicles are running. Also, although the two situations seem different, they have many issues in common, such as those above-mentioned, for which we will propose convergent solutions that have an Integrated Modular System for Terology (SMIT - Sistema Modular Integrado de Terologia) as a base platform. In addition, to collect, transmit and manage data, we also propose low-cost hardware devices and open-source software, with time series, Hidden Markov Models and genetic algorithms incorporated into them, to enable the prediction of new maintenance interventions. Another important development that is mentioned, with the objective of achieving a more effective terology system, is the implementation of 3D models to aid fault diagnosis and maintenance interventions in general. All these subjects are treated in this paper in a cohesive and synergistic way in order to achieve more effective terology management with an environmental perspective.

J	Zio, E; Di Maio, F				Zio, Enrico; Di Maio, Francesco			A data-driven fuzzy approach for predicting the remaining useful life in dynamic failure scenarios of a nuclear system	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Prognostics; Residual useful life; Recovery time; Emergency accident management; Operator support system; Nuclear power plant; Lead Bismuth Eutectic eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (LBE-XADS); Pointwise fuzzy similarity analysis	IDENTIFICATION; SIMILARITY	This paper presents a similarity-based approach for prognostics of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system, i.e. the lifetime remaining between the present and the instance when the system can no longer perform its function. Data from failure dynamic scenarios of the system are used to create a library of reference trajectory patterns to failure. Given a failure scenario developing in the system, the remaining time before failure is predicted by comparing by fuzzy similarity analysis its evolution data to the reference trajectory patterns and aggregating their times to failure in a weighted sum which accounts for their similarity to the developing pattern. The prediction on the failure time is dynamically updated as time goes by and measurements of signals representative of the system state are collected. The approach allows for the on-line estimation of the RUL. For illustration, a case Study is considered regarding the estimation of RUL in failure scenarios of the Lead Bismuth Eutectic eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (LBE-XADS).

S	Bjork, S		Eiseltova, M		Bjork, Sven			Treatment of Overgrown Shallow Lakes Through Macrophyte Control: The Case Study of Lake Hornborga, Sweden	RESTORATION OF LAKES, STREAMS, FLOODPLAINS, AND BOGS IN EUROPE: PRINCIPLES AND CASE STUDIES	Wetlands Ecology Conservation and Management		English	Article; Book Chapter						Accumulation of coarse detritus; Perennial macrophytes; Raising of the water level; Root-felt; Water level lowering		A great number of lowered shallow lakes have become overgrown by perennial macrophytes. Because their ornithological and other environmental values have become lost, efforts are made to restore them. The most serious damage on the ecosystems is caused by the development of a rhizome and root felt and the accumulation of huge masses of coarse detritus. Removal of macrophyte detritus and biomass (including the root-felt) necessitates access to a variety of technical equipment in order to clean the bottom before the water level is raised in a lowered, overgrown lake. One such example is Lake Hornborga (30 km(2)), before degradation following water-level lowering and drainage, once ranked as one of the most valuable waterfowl lakes in northwestern Europe. After drainage the lake had become almost completely overgrown by reed and sedge. After the Swedish Government had decided to investigate the possibilities to restore the lake, limno-logical, ornithological and other field studies started in 1967. Ecotechnical restoration methods and prognoses for a restored lake were presented in 1972. The project goal was to transform the reed areas to open water (about 11 km(2)) and to keep the sedge-covered part (about 18 km(2)) for emergent vegetation. In 1982, the Parliament unanimously accepted the restoration plan including a raise of the water level by 1.4 m. The implementation of the plan was, however, delayed by drawn-out discussions about dikes and water depths most suitable for birds. Not until 1995 was the water level finally raised by 0.8 m. The long-term development of the ecosystem is being documented.	Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden		Bjork, S (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Ecol, SE-22362 Lund, Sweden.

A method using fuzzy preference based rough set model and principle component analysis (PCA) is proposed to generate such an indicator. The fuzzy preference based rough set model is employed to evaluate the monotonic trends of features reflecting machinery conditions. PCA is used to condense the informative features and generate an indicator which can represent the development of machine health condition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested for damage level detection of an impeller in a slurry pump.

In this paper, vibration signal multifractal method was researched. multifractal on time-frenquency domain was an energy fractal method and the signal feature extraction was based on the analysis of its energy distributing. The method analysed signal on time-frequency domain to characterize the distributing of its frequency or energy, and the signal's feature was extracted by fractal dimension. After the signal was changed to time-frequency domain by Hilbert-Huang transform, general dimension Dq would be calculated from the signal in time-frequency domain by least square method. In the end, examples of emulator and practical application proved that this integrated method was feasible.

The benefits from applying a sound and systematic maintenance policy are emerging both in the minimisation of unnecessary downtime as well as in the increase of operational capability. In this paper, a novel predictive maintenance strategy is demonstrated, combining the existing ship operational and maintenance tasks with the advances stemming from new applied techniques. The initial step for the application of the above-mentioned strategy is also shown regarding the machinery space of a cruise ship. Well-known tools are applied such as Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). Outcomes of this study are the identification of the critical components of the system, the estimation of the reliability of the overall system and sub-systems, the prioritisation of the maintenance tasks and finally the availability of the specific end events/items.

So an intelligent fault aware control methodology is highly research motivated area, which can effectively identify the early fault of a motor from its signal characteristics. The signal classification and the control strategy with a hybrid technique are proposed in this paper. This classifier can classify the original signal and the fault signal. The performance of the system is validated by applying the system to induction motor faults diagnosis. According to our experiments in BLDC motor controller results, the system has potential to serve as an intelligent fault diagnosis system in other hard real time system application. To make the system more robust we make the controller more adaptive that give the system response more reliable.

The availability of information about damage dimension is essential for a risk evaluation. Information about the damage growth delivers the input for degradation prognostics. Together with data from the individual usage and loads monitoring, a remaining life assessment is possible. This assessment is part of an integrated health monitoring system. Basic functionalities and an approach for the architecture will be described. This paper shows the results of component tests for hot spot monitoring using imaging ultrasonic sensors. Objectives of the tests are the information growth in durability, reliability of the sensor system and system validation. Automatic signal processing and damage size quantification are further objectives of the tests. The interface to the integrated health monitoring system will be highlighted. Referring to this test experience, the benefit of the hot spot monitoring will be presented and the requirements for further development on a modern SHM-System and its implementation into integrated health monitoring system will be discussed.

A second order divided difference filter is used to identify an internal leakage fault in an electro-hydraulic actuator found in the aircraft elevator. The identified fault information is then utilized in the formulation of an aircraft systems model for prognosis-based control. An optimization based reconfiguration strategy is presented to minimize degradation of the fault in presence of performance, actuation, and mission constraints. The strategy is then validated through Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulations.			Mahulkar, V (corresponding author), 1500 Kepner Dr, Lafayette, IN 47905 USA.

Piezo Paint Acoustic Emission Sensor and Its Application to Online Structural Health Prognosis	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2010	Structural Health Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	5th European Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	JUN 28-JUL 04, 2010	Naples, ITALY	AleniaAeronautica, CIRA, DAppolonia S p A, US AF Off Sci Res, Univ Pavia, Natl Res Council, Inst Composite & Biomed Mat				This paper presents recent work on flexible piezo paint sensor and a probabilistic fracture mechanics based framework for on-line assessment and updating of the remaining fatigue life of steel bridges. The piezo paint sensor can be adhesively bonded to curved structural surfaces like a tape. Piezo paint acoustic emission sensor passively monitors the stress wave released by crack propagation in structures and offers a promising new approach to online fatigue crack length measurement. One of the salient features of the piezo paint sensor is its ability of broadband stress-wave sensing in the ultrasonic frequency range up to 1 MHz. Broadband sensor that has less signal distortion in the specified frequency range is essential to waveform-based signal interpretation for damage detection. is also proposed here. This paper also describes a sensor-data driven structural health prognosis procedure based on acoustic emission data collected by piezo paint sensors. Field test of piezo paint sensors on a steel box-girder bridge in South Korea is briefly described. Data collected from a testbed bridge provides useful information for demonstrating the concept of the proposed piezo-paint based online bridge diagnosis and prognosis system.

Main issues related to the construction and demolition waste management in Romania	SUSTAINABLE CITY VI: URBAN REGENERATION AND SUSTAINABILITY	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	Sustainable City 2010: 6th International Conference on Urban Regeneration and Sustainability	APR 14-16, 2010	A Coruna, SPAIN	Univ Siena, Wessex Inst Technol		waste management; environmental protection; construction and demolition waste; recovery; recycling		The risk of environmental pollution is a real problem, as humanity is alarmingly close to the moment of environment degradation irreversibility. An important contribution to environment pollution is construction and demolition waste. Romania, and particularly big Romanian cities, are facing asphalt works, changing curbs, residential construction/renewal, chaotic urban development and construction and demolition debris that cannot be ignored any longer and thrown away on the wayside. According to The Romanian National Institute of Statistics, in 2006 the amount of municipal waste collected by the salubrity companies in Romania was about 6.8 mil. tonnes, out of which 6.96% represents construction and demolition waste. The amount seems lower than the European average (25-30%) because the construction companies are developing their activity on sites all over the country and do not have a centralised waste record. On the other hand, construction and demolition waste is eliminated without being weighed on old landfills or free spaces. Following this observation a consortium of three universities (The Academy of Economic Studies, The Technical University of Civil Engineering and The University of Medical and Pharmaceutical Studies) and two research institutes (The Institute for Computers and The Institute of Prognosis) elaborated a research proposal that was accepted to be financed by The Romanian National Research Authority. The project has several goals. One of them is to create a database containing analytical forms for every material/equipment used in construction and demolition, which can be considered potential waste. Another goal would be to elaborate new solutions regarding waste storage in the urban environment, according to EU regulations and to develop a regional distribution map of the existent storage solutions and of the necessary ones at the moment of the analysis. The paper will reflect the research results of this project up to that point.

In this paper, a comparative study using ANN, LS-SVM and DGA for the incipient fault detection in power transformers is presented. The artificial neural network and least squares support vector machines approaches results are compared with the DGA results obtained from analysis of the traditional methods already consolidated in the technical literature.

The abstraction gathers into equivalence classes states from which the same set of operation behaviors can be activated, computed using constraint solving techniques. This abstraction is then used to generate model-based tests using an online test generation technique in which the model animation is guided by the exploration of the abstraction. We apply this approach on the B abstract machines formalism, and compare with a commercial tool, named Leirios Test Generator. We show that our approach makes it possible to achieve a wider variety of test cases, by exploiting the knowledge of the model topology, resulting in an improved fault detection capability.

When no automated oracle is available, or when testing must be performed on actual hardware or a restricted-access network, for example, only a small set of test cases can be executed and evaluated. However. MBT techniques usually generate large sets of test cases when applied to real systems, regardless of the coverage criteria. Therefore, one needs to select a small enough subset of these test cases that have the highest possible fault revealing power. In this paper, we investigate and compare various techniques for rewarding diversity in the selected test cases as a way to increase the likelihood of fault detection. We use a similarity measure defined on the representation of the test cases and use it in several algorithms that aim at maximizing the diversity of test cases. Using an industrial system with actual faults, we found that rewarding diversity leads to higher fault detection compared to the techniques commonly reported in the literature: coverage-based and random selection. Among the investigated algorithms, diversification using Genetic Algorithms is the most cost-effective technique.

The main objective of this work is to use Acoustic Emission (AE) as a non-destructive and non-intrusive monitoring test in a cemented prosthesis. The femoral component was sinusoidally loading in a fatigue machine. Experimental data collected during acoustic emission test was treated and analysed by Wavelet Transform and allowed to locate a crack in cement mantle of femoral component. Other complementary diagnostic tests were used to confirm the existence of a fault (crack). One of them was penetrating liquids in different cut sections of femoral component. The other one was microscopic analysis that allowed observing the existence of a crack which location is pointed out by the results of AE answer The AE sources locations are situated inside the crack observed in the optical microscope The Wavelet Transform (WT) AE signals demonstrated the accuracy of damage location in bone cement and thus becoming useful in other orthopedics studies.

Its role in cancer is controversial because autophagy can be either protective or destructive to tumor cells, depending on individual genetic signatures and treatment conditions. Hypoxia is common in solid tumors, correlating with chemoresistance and poor prognosis. We have detected autophagic cell death in hypoxic cancer cells occuring independently of apoptosis through a mechanism involving the hypoxia-inducible protein, Bcl-2/E1B-nineteen kilodalton interacting protein (BNIP3). Loss of BNIP3 was protective against hypoxia-induced autophagy and cell death. Unexpectedly, BNIP3 ablation also caused differential cell cycle progression in vitro and increased cellularity in vivo. Collectively, these results support the emerging theory that autophagy could be effectively targeted as an alternative cell death pathway in hypoxic and/or apoptosis-resistant tumors. Furthermore, our data suggest that BNIP3 may be a potential target molecule in this pathway.

DIAGNOSIS OF GEARBOX FAULTS IN AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY USING ENERGY OF TRANSIENT FEATURES	TRENDS IN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING 2010			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Trends in Agricultural Engineering	SEP 07-10, 2010	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Gear mechanisms are widely used in agricultural and other kind of machinery. For this reason, gear health monitoring has been the subject of intensive investigation and research. Among several other methods, vibration measurement and analysis is considered as a practical means for fault detection in gearboxes. In this work, a hypothesis is made that local faults appear as transient signals in the vibration time-series. The energy content of these transient features increases as the magnitude of damage increases. Data were collected from an experimental rig that consists of two electrical machines, a pair of spur gears, a power supply unit and the necessary speed control electronics. The vibration signal generated by the gearbox was picked up by an accelerometer bolted to the pinion body and the electrical signal was transferred to an external charge amplifier through slip rings and recorded by a PCMCIA acquisition card. The time-series was then analyzed with the newly proposed Empirical Mode Decomposition scheme [1], in which the signal is decomposed to a group of oscillatory functions called the intrinsic mode functions. The instantaneous energy is shown to obtain high values when defected teeth are engaged and therefore it can be directly related to damage magnitude. By using the results of these experiments, an online diagnostic system could be built resulting in improved reliability and reduced maintenance cost.

Accordingly, in order to increase reliability and reduce loss of production, condition monitoring of bearings has become more and more important in recent years. The use of vibration signals is quite common in the field of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of bearings. Vibration analysis is based on the use of acceleration measurements from bearings in order to assess their health status. Advanced signal processing is used to construct a number of informative features that are sensitive to specific bearing faults and fault locations. The fusion of specific statistical features and the introduction of new features enable the accurate discrimination of faults based on their location. The capability of neural networks to visualize high-dimensional data is well known. They map nonlinear statistical relationships among variables of high dimensional input data on a low dimensional network, in a topology preserving fashion. The presented work concerns a neural network based diagnostic system architecture for monitoring the topology of extended faults in bearings. A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) based approach has been used to map time series of feature data produced by acceleration sensors in order to capture the process dynamics. The evolution of system states following the bearing health trend has been shown to successfully identify different bearing faults according to their location.

The nominal power curves differ by manufacturers and types. The actual power curve will deviate from the nominal one because of the turbulence in the incoming wind, turbine health, etc. Power curve is widely used for visual inspection and performance evaluation, but there is no et a quantified approach to use it for diagnostic purpose. We propose an inverse transformation based change detector, called Inverse Diagnostic Curve Detector (IDCD), to track the variation of power curve over time for diagnostics. IDCD is adaptable to different wind turbine types. We use two example wind turbine types to illustrate the adaptation procedure. We select the Gaussian CDF (cumulative density function) in the inverse data transformation method for its fitting accuracy and one-to-one mapping property in its inversion. The dynamic fitting is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. IDCD simplifies abnormality detection with a scaler decision threshold. Some failures are predictable such as some major component failure, which causes degradation; other failures are not predictable from turbine information alone such as lightning strike, which happens suddenly and quickly. Early detection of either degradation or sudden faults is beneficial. After a deviation pattern is discovered by comparing it with historical data, the pattern can be used for prognostics to help predict the remaining useful life of a turbine and create an optimal schedule for maintenance and repair tasks.

One of the drawbacks of these methods, is the necessity to know a precise model of the considered system in order to design an appropriate fault detection/diagnosis system. This strong assumption can not be fulfilled for all cases. Additionally, different models have to be defined for distinguishing different states of machines operation. Qualitative model-based methods and also signal-based methods avoid this problem due to their different principle concepts of modeling. This contribution deals with the idea of combining qualitative model-based methods using fuzzy logic and statistical methods describing signal properties. The desired goal is to design a condition monitoring system based on suitable available signals, related measurements experiments, and classifying information of the system to be monitored. The key idea of this contribution is the generation of a set of features to distinguish related different states of the system. For validation of the developed method, experimental data is used from a test rig to study friction and wear processes of a metal surface allowing the distinction of different wear states. The developed method shows good ability to distinct the related states of wear.

On the basis of extreme learning machine (ELM), a data-based nonlinear model is first adopted to capture the batch process characteristics aiming to obtain superior predictive accuracy. Subsequently, due to the model-plant mismatch in real batch processes, an ILC algorithm with adjusting input trajectory by means of error feedback is employed focusing on the improvement of the final product quality. In order to cope with the problems of the unknown disturbances and process variations from batch to batch, when a batch run is completed, OS-ELM is utilized to update the model weights so as to guarantee the precision of the model for optimal control, which corresponds to a nonlinear updating procedure. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated via the application to a simulated bulk polymerization of the styrene batch process, and the simulation results show superior performance.

Changes in the system dynamics due to a fault are detected using nonlinear models, namely, nonlinear functions of the measurable variables . At the core of the fault detection and diagnosis system are artificial neural networks and a new neural network structure designed to capture temporal information in the input data. Difficulties such as voltage unbalance, measurement noise, and variable loads, commonly found in practice, are overcome by the system addressed in this paper. Because false alarms are significantly reduced and the system is robust to parameter variations, high detection and diagnosis performance are achieved during both, learning and testing phases. Experimental results using actual data are included to show the effectiveness of the realtime fault detection system developed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Material state changes as a basis for prognosis in aeronautical structures	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							NONLINEAR BEHAVIOR; DAMAGE; IDENTIFICATION	The long-term performance of aeronautical structures is typically discussed in terms of concepts such as structural integrity, durability, damage tolerance, fracture toughness, etc. These familiar concepts are usually addressed by considering balance equations, crack growth relationships, and constitutive equations with constant material properties, and constant or cyclically applied load conditions. Loading histories are represented by changing stress (or strain) states, only. But for many situations, especially associated with high performance aircraft, the local state of the material may also change during service, so that the properties used in those equations are functions of time and history of applied conditions. For example, local values of stiffness, strength, and conductivity are altered by material degradation to create 'property fields' that replace the global constants, and introduce time and history into the governing equations. The present paper will examine a small set of such problems and offer a construct for using related solutions to estimate future performance based oil history of use and current material state, a concept typically called prognosis.

J	Muenchhof, M; Beck, M; Isermann, R				Muenchhof, Marco; Beck, Mark; Isermann, Rolf			Fault-tolerant actuators and drives-Structures, fault detection principles and applications	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL			English	Review						Sensor and actuator faults; Structural analysis; Aerospace applications; Automotive applications; Electro-mechanical applications; Other applications	MOTOR; MACHINES	As fault detection and fault diagnosis methods are more and more finding their way into modern industrial mechatronic products, it is now time to take the next step. Based on the research efforts for fault detection and diagnosis, a status report has been prepared for research on fault management, i.e. automatic reactions of the system to continue operation after the detection of faults. These reactions may employ hardware redundancy (i.e. switching from a faulty actuator to another, intact one) or analytical redundancy (i.e. switching from a faulty sensor to a "model sensor" or "soft sensor"). A total fault-tolerance concept must encompass all components of a system, i.e. the actuators and drives, the process itself, the sensors as well as the controller and communication. in many cases. a degradation of functions has to be accepted after a fault has appeared. Concentrating on some widespread actuation principles, the paper will focus on electric drives and hydraulic actuators. First, a review is given on fault-tolerance principles and general structural considerations, e.g. hot-standby and cold-standby, focusing on the scheme of an overall fault-tolerant control system. Then, fault statistics for existing actuators and drives will be presented. These fault statistics give hints on the parts of the actuators which are most susceptible to faults. Different designs of fault-tolerant actuators and drives, which have been realized as laboratory prototypes or even on an industrial scale, shall be presented and evaluated with respect to their capabilities of withstanding faults. Finally, an outlook for fault-tolerant mechatronic systems will be given. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kawamura, S; Suzuki, M; Zahid, HM; Minamoto, H				Kawamura, Shozo; Suzuki, Makoto; Zahid, Hossain Md.; Minamoto, Hirofumi			A modeling concept of a mechanical system having a piecewise linear spring property for its diagnosis	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Diagnosis; Rotating machinery; Connecting part; Nonlinear restoring property; Nonlinear vibration; Sub-harmonic oscillation; Impact phenomenon	FREQUENCY-RESPONSE; CLEARANCE NONLINEARITY; OSCILLATOR; VIBRATION; STABILITY; CHAOS	Machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery are very important because of the wide use of rotating machinery in industry. Couplings and gears are used in many mechanical systems to connect elements and transmit power. The system is usually modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom system with a piecewise linear spring property, where the mass of main machine is only considered. In the present study, the dynamic behavior of a system with an unsymmetrical nonlinearity and a significant mass of the connecting part was investigated both experimentally and by numerical simulation. In the experiment, a 1/3 sub-harmonic oscillation was observed, but this oscillation was not found in the simulation using a single-degree-of-freedom system, in which the mass of the connecting part was ignored. However, when a two-degrees-of-freedom system was used that considered both the mass of the connecting part and the impact property, the 1/3 sub-harmonic oscillation was observed. Thus it is recognized that an adequate mathematical model for diagnosis in the early stage of abnormality must be selected on the basis of the mass ratio between the connecting part and the main body.

J	Xian, GM; Zeng, BQ				Xian, Guang-Ming; Zeng, Bi-Qing			An intelligent fault diagnosis method based on wavelet packer analysis and hybrid support vector machines	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Wavelet packet analysis; Hybrid support vector machines; Multi-fault diagnosis; 1-v-r approach	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; SIGNAL; MOTOR	In this paper, a new intelligent method for the fault diagnosis of the rotating machinery is proposed based on wavelet packet analysis (WPA) and hybrid support machine (hybrid SVM). In fault diagnosis for mechanical systems, information about stability and mutability can be further acquired through WPA from original signal. The faulty vibration signals obtained from a rotating machinery are decomposed by WPA via Dmeyer wavelet. A new multi-class fault diagnosis algorithm based on 1-v-r SVM approach is proposed and applied to rotating machinery. The extracted features are applied to hybrid SVM for estimating fault type. Compared to conventional back-propagation network (BPN), the superiority of the hybrid SVM method is shown in the success of fault diagnosis. The test results of hybrid SVM demonstrate that the applying of energy criterion to vibration signals after WPA is a very powerful and reliable method and hence estimating fault type on rotating machinery accurately and quickly.

J	Oztekin, A; Delen, D; Kong, ZY				Oztekin, Asil; Delen, Dursun; Kong, Zhenyu (James)			Predicting the graft survival for heart-lung transplantation patients: An integrated data mining methodology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Survival analysis; Combined heart-lung transplantation; Classification; Data mining; Cox proportional hazards models	RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION; NETWORK; MODEL; PROGNOSIS; SINGLE; TIME	Background: Predicting the survival of heart-lung transplant patients has the potential to play a critical role in understanding and improving the matching procedure between the recipient and graft. Although voluminous data related to the transplantation procedures is being collected and stored, only a small subset of the predictive factors has been used in modeling heart-lung transplantation outcomes. The previous studies have mainly focused on applying statistical techniques to a small set of factors selected by the domain-experts in order to reveal the simple linear relationships between the factors and survival. The collection of methods known as 'data mining' offers significant advantages over conventional statistical techniques in dealing with the latter's limitations such as normality assumption of observations, independence of observations from each other, and linearity of the relationship between the observations and the output measure(s). There are statistical methods that overcome these limitations. Yet, they are computationally more expensive and do not provide fast and flexible solutions as do data mining techniques in large datasets. Purpose: The main objective of this study is to improve the prediction of outcomes following combined heart-lung transplantation by proposing an integrated data-mining methodology. Methods: A large and feature-rich dataset (16,604 cases with 283 variables) is used to (1) develop machine learning based predictive models and (2) extract the most important predictive factors. Then, using three different variable selection methods, namely, (i) machine learning methods driven variables-using decision trees, neural networks, logistic regression, (ii) the literature review-based expert-defined variables, and (iii) common sense-based interaction variables, a consolidated set of factors is generated and used to develop Cox regression models for heart-lung graft survival. Results: The predictive models' performance in terms of 10-fold cross-validation accuracy rates for two-multi-imputed datasets ranged from 79% to 86% for neural networks, from 78% to 86% for logistic regression, and from 71% to 79% for decision trees. The results indicate that the proposed integrated data mining methodology using Cox hazard models better predicted the graft survival with different variables than the conventional approaches commonly used in the literature. This result is validated by the comparison of the corresponding Gains charts for our proposed methodology and the literature review based Cox results, and by the comparison of Akaike information criteria (AIC) values received from each. Data mining-based methodology proposed in this study reveals that there are undiscovered relationships (i.e. interactions of the existing variables) among the survival-related variables, which helps better predict the survival of the heart-lung transplants. It also brings a different set of variables into the scene to be evaluated by the domain-experts and be considered prior to the organ transplantation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Prognostics of Machine Condition Using Energy Based Monitoring Index and Computational Intelligence	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						computational intelligence; energy index; machine fault prognostics; neural networks; neurofuzzy systems; support vector regression	DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS APPROACH; DAMAGE EVOLUTION TRACKING; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FAULT-DETECTION; MODEL; DIAGNOSTICS	A study is presented on applications of computational intelligence (CI) techniques for monitoring and prognostics of machinery conditions. The machine condition is assessed through an energy-based feature, termed as "energy index," extracted from the vibration signals. The progression of the "monitoring index" is predicted using the CI techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). The proposed procedures have been evaluated through benchmark data sets for one-step-ahead prediction. The prognostic effectiveness of the techniques has been illustrated through vibration data set of a helicopter drivetrain system gearbox. The prediction performance of SVR was better than RNN and ANFIS. The improved performance of SVR can be attributed to its inherently better generalization capability. The training time of SVR was substantially higher than RNN and ANFIS. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of damage or degradation, and their progression.

However, extraction of fault signatures from a collected signal in a practical working environment is always a great challenge. This paper proposes an improved combination of the Hilbert and wavelet transforms to identify early bearing fault signatures. Real rail vehicle bearing and motor bearing data were used to validate the proposed method. A traditional combination of Hilbert and wavelet transforms was employed for comparison purpose. An indicator to evaluate fault detection capability of methods was developed in this research. Analysis results showed that the extraction capability of bearing fault signatures is greatly enhanced by the proposed method.

Fault detection and diagnosis in process data using one-class support vector machines	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL			English	Article						Fault detection; Fault diagnosis; Support vector machines	DISTURBANCE DETECTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS	In this paper, a new approach for fault detection and diagnosis based on One-Class Support Vector Machines (I-class SVM) has been proposed. The approach is based on a non-linear distance metric measured in a feature space. just as in principal components analysis (PCA) and dynamic principal components analysis (DPCA), appropriate distance metrics and thresholds have been developed for fault detection. Fault diagnosis is then carried out using the SVM-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) feature selection method. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by applying it on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman problem and on an industrial real-time Semiconductor etch process dataset. The algorithm has been compared with conventional techniques such as PCA and DPCA in terms of performance measures such as false alarm rates, detection latency and fault detection rates. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperformed PCA and DPCA both in terms of detection and diagnosis of faults. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Defect Diagnosis for Rolling Element Bearings Using Acoustic Emission	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						acoustic emission; acoustic emission testing; acoustic measurement; deformation; rolling bearings; structural acoustics; vibrations	VIBRATION	Rolling element bearings are very common components in rotating machinery. Hence, condition monitoring and the detection of defects are very important for the normal and safe running of these machines. Vibration based techniques are well established for the condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, although they are not so effective in detecting incipient defects in the bearing. Acoustic emission (AE) is receiving increasing attention as a complementary method for condition monitoring of bearings as AE is very sensitive to incipient defects. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate the AE characteristics of bearing defect and validates the relationship between various AE parameters and the operational condition of rolling element bearings. To analyze the characteristic vibration frequency of the bearing using the AE signal, short-time rms and autocorrelation functions are integrated to extract the actual characteristic frequency. The AE signal is then analyzed using standard parameters of the signals to explore the source characteristics and sensitivity of typical rolling element bearing faults. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective to extract the actual characteristic frequency of the bearing by AE signal. Furthermore the AE parameters are always sensitive to the running and fault conditions, which have a strong influence on the strain and deformation within the bearing material.

J	Lei, YG; Zuo, MJ				Lei, Yaguo; Zuo, Ming J.			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery using an improved HHT based on EEMD and sensitive IMFs	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ensemble empirical mode decomposition; sensitive intrinsic mode function; Hilbert-Huang transform; fault diagnosis; rotating machinery	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; SPECTRUM; CRACK	A Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is a time-frequency technique and has been widely applied to analyzing vibration signals in the field of fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. It analyzes the vibration signals using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted using empirical mode decomposition (EMD). However, EMD sometimes cannot reveal the signal characteristics accurately because of the problem of mode mixing. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was developed recently to alleviate this problem. The IMFs generated by EEMD have different sensitivity to faults. Some IMFs are sensitive and closely related to the faults but others are irrelevant. To enhance the accuracy of the HHT in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, an improved HHT based on EEMD and sensitive IMFs is proposed in this paper. Simulated signals demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved HHT in diagnosing the faults of rotating machinery. Finally, the improved HHT is applied to diagnosing an early rub-impact fault of a heavy oil catalytic cracking machine set, and the application results prove that the improved HHT is superior to the HHT based on all IMFs of EMD.

J	Hong, JH; Lee, MS; Hwang, DH				Hong, Jin-Hyuk; Lee, Myeong-Soo; Hwang, Do-Hyun			Computerized procedure system for the APR1400 simulator	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article								The ShinKori Unit 3&4 which is the reference plant for APR1400 simulator plans to utilize various display devices and computerized Human Machine Interface (HMI) as well as many kinds of digitalized instrumentation and control. The operating crew will be given a lot of information on display devices in order to diagnose the system states and control devices. And with the limitations of paper-based procedure (PBP) including lack of interactive capabilities between the PBP and sophisticated systems, and the high volume and cost associated with paper manuals used in complex and technically demanding environments, the computerized procedure system (CPS) is developed as a part of computerized systems for APR1400 simulator. The developed CPS covers all operating procedures including normal, abnormal and emergency, and provides information through workstation consoles using flowchart and tree structure and also has automatic checking capabilities of step logic including continuously applied steps. The CPS consists of Procedure eXecution System (PXS), and Engineering System (ES) including procedure editor (PED) and Non-Integrated System Test System (NUS). The PXS is the execution system for the procedure provided to the operators and has the following functions. 1) Display of the plant status information necessary for the instructions and executions for the procedure, 2) auto-check functions instead of manual monitoring based on the paper-based procedures, 3) detection and recovery functions of operators' faults, 4) generation function of the LCP (Logged Computerized Procedure) to search the results of the procedure execution, 5) generation function of the Log Paper Procedure supporting the continued operation using the paper procedure when the CPS fails. The ES (Engineering System) is the environment provided to the writer and maintainer of the CP (Computerized Procedure), the application program loaded in the PXS. The CP is frequently revised in the plant, and related to the safety of the plant. Therefore, the CP is provided to secure the quality and convenience of the developed procedure. For the verification, among the implemented computerized procedures by using PED, a procedure for the LOCA (Loss-Of-Coolant Accident) is selected for testing the integrity of the CPS including communication between CPS and other systems for APR1400 simulator, which is proved to be well implemented. Currently, the implemented CPS is being used to the Preliminary Validation Phase II Test hosted by NETEC (Nuclear Environment TEChnology Institute) in Korea. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Morphological signal processing and computational intelligence for engineering system prognostics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						computational intelligence; morphological operations; pattern spectrum entropy; prognostics and health management	DAMAGE EVOLUTION TRACKING; FAULT-DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSTICS; MODEL; REPRESENTATION; ENTROPY	A computational intelligence (CI)-based approach is presented for prognostics of machine conditions using morphological signal processing (MSP). The machine vibration signals are processed using MSP to extract a novel entropy-based health index (HI) characterizing the signal shape-size complexity for system prognostics. The progression of HI is predicted using Cl techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). Both single- and multi-step ahead predictions were evaluated through benchmark datasets of non-linear, non-stationary, and chaotic time series solutions of Mackey-Glass and Lorenz equations. The prognostic effectiveness of the CI techniques was illustrated using a vibration dataset of a helicopter drive-train system gearbox. For each Cl predictor, both training datasets gave almost similar prediction performance. In training, the performance of ANFIS was the best, followed by SVR and RNN. In test, the best performance was obtained with SVR for both single- and multi-step ahead predictions. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship between the system conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of degradation, and their progression.

Identification of damaged shafts using active sensing-Simulation and experimentation	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							CRACKED ROTOR; VIBRATION	Rotating machines are susceptible to fatigue failures if transverse cross-sectional cracks form in shafts. Early detection of cracks is essential to avoid a catastrophic event and the associated costs. In this work, a detailed physics-based three-dimensional model of an experimental Machinery Fault Simulator (R) apparatus is developed using ANSYS (R) with beam elements based on Timoshenko beam theory. Different kinds of faults such as transverse cracks, imbalance, misalignment, bent shafts, and combinations thereof are considered. Off-line and on-line experimental tests are carried out. Different types of external excitation with piezoelectric actuators are introduced and the vibration responses in several dimensions are measured. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that there are only subtle changes in the passive vibration natural frequencies and mode shapes due to cracks in the shaft; therefore, active sensing is necessary to detect damage. It is also shown that torsional and axial responses that are measured using active vibration sensing are highly sensitive to cracks in the shaft. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Model based fault diagnosis of a rotor-bearing system for misalignment and unbalance under steady-state condition	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							COUPLING MISALIGNMENT; FAILURE-DETECTION; DESIGN	Vibration monitoring is one of the primary techniques of condition monitoring of rotating machines. Shaft misalignment and rotor unbalance are the main sources of vibration in rotating machines. In this study a model based technique for fault diagnosis of rotor-bearing system is described. Using the residual generation technique, residual vibrations are generated from experimental results for the rotor bearing system subject to misalignment and unbalance, and then the residual forces due to presence of faults are calculated. These residual forces are compared with the equivalent theoretical forces due to faults. The fault condition and location of faults are successfully detected by this model based technique.

J	McBain, J; Timusk, M				McBain, Jordan; Timusk, Markus			Fault detection in variable speed machinery: Statistical parameterization	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							NOVELTY DETECTION; VIBRATION; REGRESSION	Variable speed machinery presents a particular challenge to automated condition-monitoring systems: changes in speed have a strong relation to the vibration response collected by accelerometers-the effect of which may mask fault conditions in standard condition monitoring techniques. In order to account for the effects of this measurable variable, the vibration response will be segmented into speed bins with a small range of speed. The mean and covariance matrix for the feature vectors in each speed bin will be computed in order to derive a statistical novelty boundary for that bin. Each component of these statistical parameters can then be interpolated or regressed in order to derive boundaries for speed segments where no training data is available. A comparison of the use of a statistical decision boundary and support vector boundaries, whose inputs have been centralized and whitened with these statistical parameters, will reveal a stronger classification approach. These methods were validated on data gathered from an experimental gearbox and motor apparatus operating at variable speeds; the results indicate a high degree of separability between data from healthy and faulted states-providing exceptional classification error.

J	Zhang, YW				Zhang, Yingwei			Actuator fault-tolerant control for discrete systems with strong uncertainties	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Actuator fault; Reliable control; Fault compensation; Strong uncertainties; Three-tank system; Winding machine	SAFE-PARKING; DESIGN; ACCOMMODATION; COMPENSATION; DIAGNOSIS; STABILITY	In this paper, a reliable control method is first proposed for discrete systems with strong uncertainties. Actuator fault compensation is also investigated based on state feedback controller. The reliable control approach uses analytical redundancy and does not need duplicated actuators. Fault compensation controller is designed using accommodation mechanism which compensates the fault effects. The closed-loop stability is established based on Lyapunov's sense. The novelty of this paper is in controller design part. This reliable control approach is applied to three-tank system. The fault compensation method is applied to winding machine in continuous annealing process systems. Applications of the proposed design indicate that the method is effective for three-tank system and continuous annealing process systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Brain Stem Death as the Vital Determinant for Resumption of Spontaneous Circulation after Cardiac Arrest in Rats	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ROSTRAL VENTROLATERAL MEDULLA; SYSTEMIC ARTERIAL-PRESSURE; CONFERS CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTION; ACUTE MEVINPHOS INTOXICATION; TIME SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; SIGNALS; HEAT-SHOCK-PROTEIN-70; APOPTOSIS; ONLINE	Background: Spontaneous circulation returns to less than half of adult cardiac arrest victims who received in-hospital resuscitation. One clue for this disheartening outcome arises from the prognosis that asystole invariably takes place, after a time lag, on diagnosis of brain stem death. The designation of brain stem death as the point of no return further suggests that permanent impairment of the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery precedes death. It follows that a crucial determinant for successful revival of an arrested heart is that spontaneous circulation must resume before brain stem death commences. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that maintained functional integrity of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a neural substrate that is intimately related to brain stem death and central circulatory regulation, holds the key to the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation. Methodology/Principal Findings: An animal model of brain stem death employing the pesticide mevinphos as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rats was used. Intravenous administration of lethal doses of mevinphos elicited an abrupt cardiac arrest, accompanied by elevated systemic arterial pressure and anoxia, augmented neuronal excitability and enhanced microvascular perfusion in RVLM. This period represents the vital time-window between cardiac arrest and resumption of spontaneous circulation in our experimental model. Animals with restored spontaneous circulation exhibited maintained neuronal functionality in RVLM beyond this critical time-window, alongside resumption of baseline tissue oxygen and enhancement of local blood flow. Intriguingly, animals that subsequently died manifested sustained anoxia, diminished local blood flow, depressed mitochondrial electron transport activities and reduced ATP production, leading to necrotic cell death in RVLM. That amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic failure in RVLM by coenzyme Q10, the mobile electron carrier in mitochondrial respiratory chain, or oxygenation restored spontaneous circulation further established a causal relationship between functionality of RVLM and resumed spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that whereas necrotic cell death because of bioenergetic failure triggered by anoxia in RVLM, which precipitates brain stem death, negates resuscitation of an arrested heart, maintained functional integrity of this neural substrate holds the key to resumption of spontaneous circulation after cardiac arrest in rats.

J	Stajduhar, I; Dalbelo-Basic, B; Bogunovic, N				Stajduhar, Ivan; Dalbelo-Basic, Bojana; Bogunovic, Nikola			Impact of censoring on learning Bayesian networks in survival modelling	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian networks; Structure learning; Survival analysis; Censoring; Prognostic models in medicine; Medical decision support	BREAST-CANCER PATIENTS; NEURAL-NETWORK; STATISTICAL-DATA; PROGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; REGRESSION; SEPARATION; LYMPHOMA; MEDICINE; SURGERY	Objective: Bayesian networks are commonly used for presenting uncertainty and covariate interactions in an easily interpretable way. Because of their efficient inference and ability to represent causal relationships, they are an excellent choice for medical decision support systems in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Although good procedures for learning Bayesian networks from data have been defined, their performance in learning from censored survival data has not been widely studied. In this paper, we explore how to use these procedures to Learn about possible interactions between prognostic factors and their influence on the variate of interest. We study how censoring affects the probability of learning correct Bayesian network structures. Additionally, we analyse the potential usefulness of the learnt models for predicting the time-independent probability of an event of interest. Methods and materials: We analysed the influence of censoring with a simulation on synthetic data sampled from randomly generated Bayesian networks. We used two well-known methods for learning Bayesian networks from data: a constraint-based method and a score-based method. We compared the performance of each method under different levels of censoring to those of the naive Bayes classifier and the proportional hazards model. We did additional experiments on several datasets from real-world medical domains. The machine-learning methods treated censored cases in the data as event-free. Results: We report and compare results for several commonly used model evaluation metrics. On average, the proportional hazards method outperformed other methods in most censoring setups. As part of the simulation study, we also analysed structural similarities of the learnt networks. Heavy censoring, as opposed to no censoring, produces up to a 5% surplus and up to 10% missing total arcs. It also produces up to 50% missing arcs that should originally be connected to the variate of interest. Conclusion: Presented methods for learning Bayesian networks from data can be used to learn from censored survival data in the presence of light censoring (up to 20%) by treating censored cases as event-free. Given intermediate or heavy censoring, the learnt models become tuned to the majority class and would thus require a different approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gketsis, ZE; Zervakis, ME; Stavrakakis, G				Gketsis, Zacharias E.; Zervakis, Michalis E.; Stavrakakis, George			Detection and classification of winding faults in windmill generators using Wavelet Transform and ANN	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Winding fault detection; Fault classification; Automatic feature extraction; Daubechies wavelets; Backpropagation Neural Network	INDUCTION-MOTORS; ROTOR FAULTS; MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; ORIENTATION; STANDSTILL; INTERTURN; BARS	This paper exploits the Wavelet Transform (WT) analysis along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the diagnosis of electrical machines winding faults. A novel application is presented exploring the problem of automatically identifying short circuits of windings, which often appear during machine manufacturing and operation. Such faults are usually resulting from electrodynamics forces generated during the flow of large short circuit currents, as well as forces occurring when the machines are transported. The early detection and classification of winding failures is of particular importance, as these kinds of defects can lead to winding damage due to overheating, imbalance, etc. Application results and investigations of windmill generator winding turn-to-turn faults between adjacent winding wires are presented. The ANN approach is proven effective in detecting and classifying faults based on WT features extracted from high frequency measurements of the admittance, current, or voltage responses.

In this paper we present an interdisciplinary work based on an ambulatory blood pressure study and the development of a new classification algorithm named REMED. We focused on the discovery of new patterns for abnormal blood pressure variability as a possible cardiovascular risk factor. We compared our results with other classification algorithms based on Bayesian methods, decision trees, and rule induction techniques. In the comparison, REMED showed similar accuracy to these algorithms but it has the advantage of being superior in its capacity to classify sick people correctly. Therefore, our method could represent an innovative approach that might be useful in medical decision support for cardiovascular disease prognosis.

J	Xu, ZB; Xuan, JP; Shi, TL; Wu, B; Hu, YM				Xu, Zengbing; Xuan, Jianping; Shi, Tielin; Wu, Bo; Hu, Youmin			A novel fault diagnosis method of bearing based on improved fuzzy ARTMAP and modified distance discriminant technique	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Modified distance discriminant technique; Improved fuzzy ARTMAP; Yu's norm; Bootstrap method; Fault diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROTATING MACHINERY; VIBRATION; SIGNALS	This paper presents a novel intelligent diagnosis method based on multiple domain features, modified distance discrimination technique and improved fuzzy ARTMAP (IFAM). The method consists of three steps. To begin with, time-domain, frequency-domain and wavelet grey moments are extracted from the raw vibration signals to demonstrate the fault-related information. Then through the modified distance discrimination technique some salient features are selected from the original feature set. Finally, the optimal feature set is input into the IFAM incorporated with similarity based on the Yu's norm in the classification phase to identify the different fault categories. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing. and the test results show that the IFAM identify the fault categories of rolling element bearing more accurately and has a better diagnosis performance compared to the FAM. Furthermore, by the application of the bootstrap method to the diagnosis results it can testify that the IFAM has more capacity of reliability and robustness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past, the maintenance using tradition sensors is money-cost, which limits wide application in industry. To develop a cost-effective maintenance technique, this paper presents a novel research using smart sensor systems for machine fault diagnosis. In this paper, a smart sensors system is developed which acquires three types of signals involving vibration, current, and flux from induction motors. And then, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests algorithm are employed as classifiers for fault diagnosis. The parameters of these classifiers are optimized by using cross-validation method. The experimental results show that smart sensor system has the similar performance for applying in intelligent machine fault diagnosis with reduced product cost. Developed smart sensors have feasibility to apply for intelligent fault diagnosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study includes steady-state condition and speed transients in motor operation. The stator current is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which generates a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Quadratic time-frequency (TF) distributions such as smoothed pseudo-Wigner-Ville and Zhao-Atlas-Marks are applied on the more significant IMFs for fault detection. Simulations and experimental laboratory tests validate the algorithms and demonstrate that this kind of TF analysis can be applied to detect and identify short-circuit failures in PMSM.

J	Stefani, A; Bellini, A; Filippetti, F				Stefani, Andrea; Bellini, Alberto; Filippetti, Fiorenzo			Diagnosis of Induction Machines' Rotor Faults in Time-Varying Conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; induction motor drives; time-varying systems	SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; BARS	Motor current signature analysis is the reference method for the diagnosis of induction machines' rotor faults; however, in time-varying conditions, it fails as slip and speed vary, and, thus, sideband components are spread in a bandwidth that is proportional to the variation. Variable speed drive applications are common in the aerospace, appliance, railway, and automotive industries and also in electric generators for wind turbines. In this paper, a simple and effective method is presented that allows the diagnosis of rotor faults for induction machine drives in time-varying conditions. It is tailored to direct rotor flux field-oriented controlled drives, where the control system provides suitable signals that are exploited for the demodulation to a constant frequency of time-varying signatures related to the rotor faults. Simulations and experiments are reported to validate the proposed method on a critical speed transient.

The proposed approach is valid for induction machines started at constant frequency and consists of extracting the instantaneous frequency (IF) of the left sideband harmonic (LSH) from the start-up current (LSHst), via the Hilbert transform. It is shown that, in the case of machines with one or several broken bars, the IF of the LSHst exhibits a very characteristic and easy to identify pattern, which is physically justified. This paper also shows that, if the IF of the LSHst is represented against the slip, a universal fault indicator (nondependent neither on the machine characteristics nor on the starting conditions) can be defined. This fault indicator consists of the correlation between the experimental IF of the LSHst and its theoretical evolution. This approach is theoretically introduced and experimentally validated by testing a commercial motor in faulty and healthy conditions, under different operating conditions.

Separating Broken Rotor Bars and Load Oscillations on IM Fault Diagnosis Through the Instantaneous Active and Reactive Currents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Broken rotor bar; fault diagnosis; induction motor (IM); instantaneous active and reactive currents; load oscillations	INDUCTION-MOTORS; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; STATOR	A new method for broken rotor bars and load oscillation diagnosis on induction motors is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the decomposition of the stator currents into their instantaneous active and reactive current components. Such components allow the decoupling of the effects produced by rotor asymmetries from those produced by oscillating loads. This allows not only the proper fault detection but also a correct fault diagnosis. Simulation and experimental results, both from laboratory and industrial cases, are presented to validate the proposal.

Special attention is focused on the effect of both space distribution of rotor bars and rotor dissymmetry on the mechanism of generation of diagnosis signatures with consideration of voltage supply unbalance and speed ripples. Generalized and new formulas are proposed, where we can draw a conclusion on the state of the machine.

The Use of the Instantaneous-Reactive-Power Signature Analysis for Rotor-Cage-Fault Diagnostics in Three-Phase Induction Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault-severity factor; induction motors (IMs); instantaneous-reactive-power signature analysis (IRPSA); rotor-cage-fault diagnosis	ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; BAR DETECTION; SYSTEMS; STATOR; MACHINES; MODEL	In this paper, a new detection technique based on the instantaneous-reactive-power signature analysis is proposed for the diagnosis of rotor-cage faults (RCFs) in operating three-phase induction motors (IMs). This technique has been tested through the simulation of two different IMs using a mathematical model based on the winding-function approach. In order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed tool for rotor-condition monitoring, these simulations are complemented by the experimental results obtained from two IMs with several faulty rotors, powered from sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal supply voltages. The results obtained by the fast-Fourier-transform algorithm and the Welch method show the merits of the proposed approach for the detection of RCFs. A suitable fault-severity factor is also proposed as an indicator of the motor condition. Moreover, the inductive reactive effect of RCFs is underlined to demonstrate the effectiveness and convenience of this new technique for the diagnosis of RCFs in three-phase IMs.	[Drif, M'hamed; Marques Cardoso, A.

These signatures are given by the complex spectrum modulus of line current. In order to make the diagnostic, a genetic algorithm is used to keep the amplitude of all faulty lines. Moreover, a fuzzy logic approach allows us to conclude to the load level operating system and to inform the operator of the rotor fault severity. Several experimental results prove the performance of this method under various load levels and various fault severities. Notwithstanding, this approach requires a steady-state operating condition. The conclusion resulting from this paper is highlighted by experimental results which prove the efficiency of the suggested approach.

Analysis and Diagnostics of Adjacent and Nonadjacent Broken-Rotor-Bar Faults in Squirrel-Cage Induction Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Broken-rotor-bar fault; fault diagnostics; induction motor; magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) modeling; nonadjacent rotor faults	MOTORS	In this paper, faults associated with the rotor of an induction machine are considered. More specifically, effects of adjacent and nonadjacent bar breakages on rotor fault diagnostics in squirrel-cage induction machines are studied. It is shown that some nonadjacent bar breakages may result in the masking of the commonly used fault indices and, hence, may lead to a possible misdiagnosis of the machine. A discussion of the possible scenarios of these breakages as well as some conclusions regarding the types of squirrel-cage induction machines (number of poles, number of squirrel-cage bars, etc.) that may be more prone to these nonadjacent types of failures are presented. This discussion is supported through both simulation and experimental results. It is also shown that secondary fault effects can be used to diagnose such nonadjacent bar breakages.

Based on the estimated stator-winding temperature via dc-signal injection, the cooling capability of the motor can be monitored online using only voltage and current sensors. The thermal parameters of a simplified thermal model of the induction motor are identified using an extended Kalman filter approach, as an indication of the motor cooling capability. The proposed scheme can warn the users for proactive inspection and maintenance in the case of cooling-condition deterioration. The proposed method has been validated from experimental results under three different cooling conditions and variable-load conditions. The errors of thermal-parameter identification are within 3%. The proposed cooling-condition monitoring scheme, combined with the stator-winding-temperature monitoring scheme, can provide complete thermal protection for soft-starter-connected induction motors.

Online Model-Based Stator-Fault Detection and Identification in Induction Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Detection; identification; induction motors (IMs); model based; observer; short circuit; stator faults	TURN INSULATION; WINDING FAULTS; MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; INTERTURN; OBSERVER	In this paper, a model-based strategy for stator-interturn short-circuit detection on induction motors is presented. The proposed strategy is based on the generation of a vector of specific residual using a state observer. The vectorial residual is generated from a decomposition of the current estimation error. This allows for a fast detection of incipient faults, independently of the phase in which the fault occurs. Since the observer includes an adaptive scheme for rotor-speed estimation, the proposed scheme can be implemented for online monitoring, by measuring only stator voltages and currents. It is shown that the proposed strategy presents very low sensitivity to load variations and power-supply perturbations. Experimental results are included to show the ability of the proposed strategy for detecting incipient faults, including a low number of short-circuited turns and low fault current.

J	Kia, SH; Henao, H; Capolino, GA				Kia, Shahin Hedayati; Henao, Humberto; Capolino, Gerard-Andre			Torsional Vibration Effects on Induction Machine Current and Torque Signatures in Gearbox-Based Electromechanical System	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Condition monitoring; current measurement; frequency domain analysis; frequency tracking; gearbox-based system; induction machine; mechanical systems; motor current signature analysis (MCSA); torque estimation; torque oscillation	FAULT-DETECTION; FLUX OBSERVER; MOTORS; PAIR	The monitoring of heavy-duty electromechanical systems is crucial for their preventive maintenance planning. In these systems, the mechanical anomalies such as load troubles, great torque dynamic variations, and torsional oscillations lead to shaft fatigue and aging of other mechanical parts such as bearings and gearboxes. In this paper, a gearbox-based electromechanical system is investigated. Initially, a simple gearbox dynamic model is used to show the effects of rotating input, output, and mesh frequency components on the electromagnetic torque and consequently on the stator current signature. By this model, the influence of transmission error, eccentricities of pinion/wheel, and teeth contact stiffness variation is demonstrated for a healthy gearbox. Then, it is shown that the electrical machine can be considered as a torque sensor through electromagnetic torque estimation for torsional vibration monitoring without any extra mechanical sensor. A test-rig based on a 5.5-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor connected to a wound-rotor 4-kW induction generator via a one-stage gearbox has been used to validate the proposed method.

J	Trajin, B; Regnier, J; Faucher, J				Trajin, Baptiste; Regnier, Jeremi; Faucher, Jean			Comparison Between Stator Current and Estimated Mechanical Speed for the Detection of Bearing Wear in Asynchronous Drives	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Automatic energy extraction; bearing wear; Luenberger speed observer; mechanical analysis; stator-current spectral analysis	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; INDUCTION; MOTORS	This paper deals with the detection of worn rolling bearings in asynchronous machines using electrical measurements and estimated mechanical variables. These two approaches are based on the use of the available electrical quantities, e. g., the machine stator currents, which are often already measured for control and protection purposes. Considering that bearing faults induce load-torque oscillations, a theoretical stator-current model, in case of load-torque oscillations, is recalled. Then, a theoretical estimated rotor flux and estimated speed model demonstrates the presence of harmonics related to load-torque oscillations. Phase-modulation components on stator current and harmonics on estimated speed can be used for detection purposes. The frequency behavior of monitored quantities with regard to the load-torque oscillation frequency is particularly investigated. Fault detectors are then proposed on monitored variables. The efficiency of the indicators is studied for different operating points considering the frequency behavior of the system. Finally, the use of detectors is discussed regarding the supply-frequency range usable for the detection.

It produces a frequency spreading of the characteristic fault frequencies, thus making it difficult to detect with spectral or envelope analysis. A statistical analysis of typical bearing faults is proposed here in order to identify the spreading bandwidth related to specific conditions, relying on current or vibration measurements only. Then, a diagnostic index based on the computation of the energy in the previously defined bandwidth is used to diagnose bearing faults. The proposed method was validated experimentally with vibration signals, with robust and reliable results. The same procedure can be extended to current signals.

J	Faiz, J; Ojaghi, M				Faiz, Jawad; Ojaghi, Mansour			Instantaneous-Power Harmonics as Indexes for Mixed Eccentricity Fault in Mains-Fed and Open/Closed-Loop Drive-Connected Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Affecting factors; cage induction motor; experimental investigation; instantaneous-power harmonics; mixed-eccentricity index	PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; AIRGAP-ECCENTRICITY; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE	In this paper, a comprehensive definition of eccentricity fault in cage induction motor is introduced, and instantaneous power is considered as eccentricity-fault index. In addition to the line current, the stator line voltage influences the instantaneous power of the motor; therefore, harmonics of this power can be employed as a fault-diagnosis index when the motor is supplied by a closed-loop control method. It is theoretically shown that the frequencies of harmonics of the instantaneous power due to mixed eccentricity fault are the same for the mains-fed and open/closed-loop drive-connected motors, although the number of factors affecting the amplitudes of the harmonics is relatively large when closed-loop drive connected. A flexible test rig is described, which was established to carry out various measurements on the eccentric motor with different eccentricity degrees, under different supply and control methods, varying load, and variable speeds. The experimental results indicate that the amplitudes of the dominant instantaneous-power harmonics depend on the degrees of mixed-eccentricity static and dynamic components, although these amplitudes are influenced by the supply methods, load level, and speed of the motor.

J	Ebrahimi, BM; Faiz, J; Roshtkhari, MJ				Ebrahimi, Bashir Mahdi; Faiz, Jawad; Roshtkhari, Mehrsan Javan			Static-, Dynamic-, and Mixed-Eccentricity Fault Diagnoses in Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Amplitude of sideband components (ASBC); artificial neural network (ANN); dynamic eccentricity (DE) and mixed eccentricity (ME); fault diagnosis; Gaussian noise; pattern recognition; permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous motor (PMSM); static; time-stepping finite-element (FE) method (FEM) (TSFEM)	ROTOR ECCENTRICITY; PERFORMANCE; IPM	Mixed-eccentricity (ME) fault diagnosis has not been so far documented for permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous motors (PMSMs). This paper investigates how the static eccentricity (SE), dynamic eccentricity (DE), and ME in three-phase PMSMs can be detected. A novel index for noninvasive diagnosis of these eccentricities is introduced for a faulty PMSM. The nominated index is the amplitude of sideband components with a particular frequency pattern which is extracted from the spectrum of stator current. Using this index makes it possible to determine the occurrence, as well as the type and percentage, of eccentricity precisely. Meanwhile, the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM during a large span is inspected, and the ability of the proposed index is exhibited to detect eccentricity in faulty PMSMs with different loads. A novel theoretical scrutiny based on a magnetic field analysis is presented to prove the introduced index and generalize the illustrated fault recognition method. To show the merit of this index in the eccentricity detection and estimation of its severity, first, the correlation between the index and the SE and DE degrees is determined. Then, the type of the eccentricity is determined by a k-nearest neighbor classifier. At the next step, a three-layer artificial neural network is employed to estimate the eccentricity degree and its type. After all, a white Gaussian noise is added to the simulated current, and the robustness of the proposed index is analyzed with respect to the noise variance. In this paper, the PMSM under magnetic fault (demagnetization) and electrical faults (short and open circuits) is modeled, and the current spectrum of the faulty PMSM under demagnetization, short circuit, and open circuit faults is analyzed. It is demonstrated that the proposed index, due to eccentricity fault, is not generated in the current spectrum due to magnetic and electrical faults. Indeed, it is exposed that the introduced index is only created due to eccentricity fault and it is not sensitive to other faults. To model the PMSM eccentricities, a time-stepping finite-element method, which takes into account all geometrical and physical characteristics of the machine components, nonuniform permeance of the air gap, and nonuniform characteristics of the PM material, is employed. This model facilitates the access to the demanded signals in order to have accurate processing. A comparison of simulation and experimental results validate the proposed index.

In this paper, we provide a formal decision software tool to extract the dominant features enabling tool wear prediction. This decision tool is based on a formal mathematical approach that selects dominant features using the singular value decomposition of real-time measurements from the sensors of an industrial cutting tool. Selection of dominant features is important, as retaining only essential features allows reduced signal processing or even reduction in the number of required sensors, which cuts costs. It is shown that the proposed method of dominant feature selection is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the least-squares estimation error. The identified dominant features are used with the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to identify parameters in forecasting the time series of cutting tool wear. Experimental results on an industrial high-speed milling machine show the effectiveness in predicting the tool wear using only the dominant features.

Therefore, this paper focuses on introducing a new method for dresser contact detection, which takes into account sensor and data acquisition system costs, computational limitations of an embedded detection system, and noise robustness issues associated with shop floor implementation. This paper also discusses the way in which the monitoring algorithm directly interfaces with the machine control in real time in order to ensure that system faults are avoided. Furthermore, the new algorithm is compared with more traditional methods for change detection by applying each algorithm to the signal output from a dresser horsepower sensor. In an industrial application, the new algorithm is shown to provide zero missed detections, zero false alarms, and a sufficiently fast response time.

J	Satti, T; Young, K; Grover, S				Satti, Teysseer; Young, Ken; Grover, Samuel			Detecting catastrophic failure events in large-scale milling machines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						CNC milling; Failure detection; Machine protection; Contingency management	BREAKAGE DETECTION; TOOL; POWER; TRANSFORM; FORCES	Catastrophic failure in milling machines is a major concern for manufacturers employing these processes in the production of vital parts. Tool chipping or breakage can lead to machine breakdown, which is a costly consequence in today's highly demanding industry. This paper introduces a novel and practical concept for the detection of failure events in milling. Using the historic data of the machining process (a collection of average spindle power signals) the detection algorithm computes discrete probability distributions representing the power consumption profile along finite synchronous process segments. These distributions play a central role in identifying failure: an unexpected occurrence in the process.

J	Huang, YX; Liu, CL; Zha, XF; Li, YM				Huang, Yixiang; Liu, Chengliang; Zha, Xuan F.; Li, Yanming			An enhanced feature extraction model using lifting-based wavelet packet transform scheme and sampling-importance-resampling analysis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Condition monitoring; Sampling-importance-resampling algorithm; Wavelet packet; Lifting-based scheme; Support vector machine	PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; CLASSIFICATION; MAINTENANCE	The efficiency of data processing is critical for the on-line monitoring applications of industrial components and systems, both from the viewpoints of the rapid adaptation to the non-stationary signals and the cost of information storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose an enhanced feature extraction model for machinery performance assessment, which is based on the lifting-based wavelet packet transform (WPT) and sampling-importance-resampling methods. The lifting-based WPT decomposes the signals. Then the sampling-importance-resampling procedure is applied in the wavelet domain to extract the distribution information and compose the feature vectors. Finally, a support vector machine is used to assess the normal or abnormal condition based on these extracted features. To validate the proposed new model, an endurance test of pressure regulators has been carried out. Compared to the traditional wavelet packet method, the new model can not only keep the precision level but also improve the efficiency by over 60%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, M; Xu, JW; Yang, JH; Yang, DB; Wang, DD				Li, Min; Xu, Jinwu; Yang, Jianhong; Yang, Debin; Wang, Dadong			Multiple manifolds analysis and its application to fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Multiple manifolds analysis; Fault clustering; Trend analysis; Roller bearing; Fault diagnosis	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; STATISTICAL MOMENTS	A novel approach to fault diagnosis is proposed using multiple manifolds analysis (MMA) to extract manifold information from the vibration signals collected from a mechanical system. The basic idea of MMA is to reconstruct a manifold by embedding time series into a high-dimensional phase space. The tangent direction of the neighborhood for each point is then used to approximate its local geometry. The variation of the multiple manifolds representing different states of the mechanical system can be revealed by performing multi-way principal component analysis. The vibration signals acquired from roller bearings are employed to validate the proposed algorithms. Test results show that the proposed MMA-based approach can interpret different machine conditions and is effective to the fault diagnosis, and the MMA-based fault clustering and trend analysis algorithms have outperformed the conventional fault diagnosis methods.

According to machine models, mechanical faults lead to amplitude and/or phase modulations of the measured stator current with possibly time varying carrier frequency. The modulation diagnosis requires a univocal definition of the instantaneous phase and amplitude. This is performed by associating a complex signal to the real measured one. For a convenient separate modulation diagnosis, the complex signal instantaneous phase and amplitude are expected to carry, respectively, information about the phase and amplitude modulations. The complex signal is classically obtained through the Hilbert transform. Under Bedrosian conditions, the so-called analytic signal allows a separate modulation diagnosis. However, mechanical faults may also produce fast modulations violating the Bedrosian conditions. This study proposes an alternative complex signal representation which takes advantage of the three stator current measurements available in a three-phase machine. From two stator current measurements, the Concordia transform builds a complex vector, the so-called space vector, which unconditionally allows separate modulation diagnosis. This paper applies and compares the Hilbert and Concordia transforms, theoretically and in case of simulated and experimental signals with various modulation frequency ranges. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gunal, S; Ece, DG; Gerek, ON				Gunal, Serkan; Ece, Dogan Goekhan; Gerek, Omer Nezih			Induction machine condition monitoring using notch-filtered motor current	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Induction machine; Condition monitoring; Notch-filter; Skewness; Kurtosis	BROKEN ROTOR BAR; FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS	This paper presents a new approach to induction motor condition monitoring using notch-filtered motor current signature analysis (NFMCSA). Unlike most of the previous work utilizing motor current signature analysis (MCSA) using spectral methods to extract required features for detecting motor fault conditions, here NFMCSA is performed in time-domain to extract features of energy, sample extrema, and third and fourth cumulants evaluated from data within sliding time window. Six identical three-phase induction motors were used for the experimental verification of the proposed method. One healthy machine was used as a reference, while other five with different synthetic faults were used for condition detection and classification. Extracted features obtained from NFMCSA of all motors were employed in three different and popular classifiers. The proposed motor current analysis and the performance of the features used for fault detection and classification are examined at various motor load levels and it is shown that a successful induction motor condition monitoring system is developed. Developed system is also able to indicate the load level and the type of a fault in multi-dimensional feature space representation. In order to test the generality and applicability of the developed method to other induction motors, data acquired from another healthy induction motor with different number of poles and rated power is also incorporated into the system.

A hybrid model for bearing performance degradation assessment based on support vector data description and fuzzy c-means	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						performance degradation assessment; Support vector data description; fuzzy c-means; accelerated bearing life test	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; FAULT-DETECTION; MACHINE; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM; SCHEME	Bearing performance degradation assessment is more effective than fault diagnosis to realize condition-based maintenance. In this article, a hybrid model is proposed for it based on a support vector data description (SVDD) and fuzzy c-means (F-CM). SVDD, which holds excellent robustness to Outliers. is used to obtain the clustering centre of normal state. The subjection of tested data to normal state is defined as a degradation indicator, which is computed by a FCM algorithm with final failure data. The results of applying this hybrid model to an accelerated bearing life test show that it can effectively assess bearing performance degradation. Furthermore, it is robust to the outliers in the training set and IS not influenced by the Gaussian kernel parameter.	[Pan, Y. N.; Chen, J.; Dong, G.

J	Xu, ZG; Ji, YD; Zhou, DH				Xu ZhengGuo; Ji YinDong; Zhou DongHua			Real-time reliability prediction for dynamic systems with both deteriorating and unreliable components	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						reliability; failure prognostics; dynamic systems; fault prediction; particle filtering; interacting multiple model; exponential smoothing; predictive maintenance	INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS; DEGRADATION SIGNALS; PARTICLE FILTER; MODEL; MAINTENANCE	As an important technology for predictive maintenance, failure prognosis has attracted more and more attentions in recent years. Real-time reliability prediction is one effective solution to failure prognosis. Considering a dynamic system that is composed of normal, deteriorating and unreliable components, this paper proposes an integrated approach to perform real-time reliability prediction for such a class of systems. For a deteriorating component, the degradation is modeled by a time-varying fault process which is a linear or approximately linear function of time. The behavior of an unreliable component is described by a random variable which has two possible values corresponding to the operating and malfunction conditions of this component. The whole proposed approach contains three algorithms. A modified interacting multiple model particle filter is adopted to estimate the dynamic system's state variables and the unmeasurable time-varying fault. An exponential smoothing algorithm named the Holt's method is used to predict the fault process. In the end, the system's reliability is predicted in real time by use of the Monte Carlo strategy. The proposed approach can effectively predict the impending failure of a dynamic system, which is verified by computer simulations based on a three-vessel water tank system.

J	Yasrebi, H; Sperisen, P; Praz, V; Bucher, P				Yasrebi, Haleh; Sperisen, Peter; Praz, Viviane; Bucher, Philipp			Can Survival Prediction Be Improved By Merging Gene Expression Data Sets?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; MICROARRAY DATA; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; HISTOLOGIC GRADE; MARKER GENES; SIGNATURE; PLATFORM; CLASSIFICATION; CARCINOMAS; SUBTYPES	Background: High-throughput gene expression profiling technologies generating a wealth of data, are increasingly used for characterization of tumor biopsies for clinical trials. By applying machine learning algorithms to such clinically documented data sets, one hopes to improve tumor diagnosis, prognosis, as well as prediction of treatment response. However, the limited number of patients enrolled in a single trial study limits the power of machine learning approaches due to over-fitting. One could partially overcome this limitation by merging data from different studies. Nevertheless, such data sets differ from each other with regard to technical biases, patient selection criteria and follow-up treatment. It is therefore not clear at all whether the advantage of increased sample size outweighs the disadvantage of higher heterogeneity of merged data sets. Here, we present a systematic study to answer this question specifically for breast cancer data sets. We use survival prediction based on Cox regression as an assay to measure the added value of merged data sets. Results: Using time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) and hazard ratio as performance measures, we see in overall no significant improvement or deterioration of survival prediction with merged data sets as compared to individual data sets. This apparently was due to the fact that a few genes with strong prognostic power were not available on all microarray platforms and thus were not retained in the merged data sets. Surprisingly, we found that the overall best performance was achieved with a single-gene predictor consisting of CYB5D1. Conclusions: Merging did not deteriorate performance on average despite (a) The diversity of microarray platforms used. (b) The heterogeneity of patients cohorts. (c) The heterogeneity of breast cancer disease. (d) Substantial variation of time to death or relapse. (e) The reduced number of genes in the merged data sets. Predictors derived from the merged data sets were more robust, consistent and reproducible across microarray platforms. Moreover, merging data sets from different studies helps to better understand the biases of individual studies and can lead to the identification of strong survival factors like CYB5D1 expression.

Inductive data mining based on genetic programming: Automatic generation of decision trees from data for process historical data analysis	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (ESCAPE-18)	JUN 01-04, 2008	Lyon, FRANCE			Process historical data analysis; Decision trees; Decision forest; Genetic programming; Wastewater treatment plant; Inductive data mining	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT-DETECTION; MULTIDIMENSIONAL VISUALIZATION; RULE EXTRACTION; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; DISCRETIZATION; SYSTEM; MODEL; WWTP	An inductive data mining algorithm based on genetic programming, GPForest, is introduced for automatic construction of decision trees and applied to the analysis of process historical data. GPForest not only outperforms traditional decision tree generation methods that are based on a greedy search strategy therefore necessarily miss regions of the search space, but more importantly generates multiple trees in each experimental run. In addition, by varying the initial values of parameters, more decision trees can be generated in new experiments. From the multiple decision trees generated, those with high fitness values are selected to form a decision forest. For predictive purpose, the decision forest instead of a single tree is used and a voting strategy is employed which allows the combination of the predictions of all decision trees in the forest in order to generate the final prediction. It was demonstrated that in comparison with decision tree methods in the literature, GPForest gives much improved performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liao, LX; Lee, J				Liao, Linxia; Lee, Jay			A novel method for machine performance degradation assessment based on fixed cycle features test	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; PROGNOSTICS; TRANSFORM; FAULTS	This paper presents a novel machine performance degradation scheme based on fixed cycle features test (FCFT). Instead of monitoring the machine under constant working load, FCFT introduces a new testing method which obtains data during the transient periods of different working loads. A novel performance assessment method based on those transient data without failure history is proposed. Wavelet packet analysis (WPA) is applied to extract features which capture the dynamic characteristics from the non-stationary vibration data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the feature space. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is utilized to approximate the density distribution of the lower-dimensional feature space which consists of the major principal components. The performance index of the machine is calculated based on the overlap between the distribution of the baseline feature space and that of the testing feature space. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used to determine the number of mixtures for the GMM and a density boosting method is applied to achieve better accuracy of the distribution estimation. A case study for a chiller system performance assessment is used as an example to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dharmaraju, N; Rao, AR				Dharmaraju, N.; Rao, A. Rama			Wavelet De-noising Technique for Roller Bearing Fault Detection	ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bearing fault; Wavelets; De-noising	TRANSFORM	Bearings are the most important and frequently replaced component in vast majority of rotating machines. The vibration signature of a damaged bearing consists of exponentially decaying impact response that occurs periodically at the characteristic defect frequencies. At the early stages of bearing failures, these defect frequencies are masked by high amplitude machine noise hindering its detection by conventional diagnostic technique. The use of wavelet analysis to diagnose faults in roller bearing is examined in the present paper. Applying the wavelet transform to time signal obtained from the sensor placed on a bearing housing gives the information about the bearing defect frequencies even at very low signal to noise ratio. In the present paper, use of wavelet transform technique has been illustrated through numerically simulated bearing faults and experimental signal from faulty bearing in order demonstrate the effectiveness of technique in detecting bearing faults. The wavelets transform technique has been compared with the spectrum analysis method.

Gas turbine performance prognostic for condition-based maintenance	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Gas turbine; Engines; Performance prognostics; Remaining useful life; Regression	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ENGINE	Gas turbine engines experience degradations over time that cause great concern to gas turbine users on engine reliability, availability and operating costs. Gas turbine diagnostics and prognostics is one of the key technologies to enable the move from time-scheduled maintenance to condition-based maintenance in order to improve engine reliability and availability and reduce life cycle costs. This paper describes a prognostic approach to estimate the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines before their next major overhaul based on historical health information. A combined regression techniques, including both linear and quadratic models, is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines. A statistic "compatibility check" is used to determine the transition point from a linear regression to a quadratic regression. The developed prognostic approach has been applied to a model gas turbine engine similar to Rolls-Royce industrial gas turbine AVON 1535 implemented with compressor degradation over time. The analysis shows that the developed prognostic approach has a great potential to provide an estimation of engine remaining useful life before next major overhaul for gas turbine engines experiencing a typical soft degradation.

J	Fei, SW; Zhang, XB				Fei, Sheng-wei; Zhang, Xiao-bin			Fault diagnosis of power transformer based on support vector machine with genetic algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Support vector machine; Genetic algorithm; Power transformer	INCIPIENT FAULTS; IMAGES	Diagnosis of potential faults concealed inside power transformers is the key of ensuring stable electrical power supply to consumers. Support vector machine (SVM) is a new machine learning method based on the statistical learning theory, which is a powerful tool for solving the problem with small sampling, non-linearity and high dimension. The selection of SVM parameters has an important influence on the classification accuracy of SVM However, it is very difficult to select appropriate SVM parameters. In this study, support vector machine with genetic algorithm (SVMG) is applied to fault diagnosis of a power transformer, in which genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select appropriate free parameters of SVM. The experimental data from several electric power companies in China are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed SVMG model. The experimental results indicate that the SVMG method can achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than IEC three ratios, normal SVM classifier and artificial neural network. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper includes the study, design, and implementation of a Rogowski-coil current sensor without the integrator circuit that is typically used. The circuit includes an autotuning block able to adjust to different motor speeds. Equalizing the amplitudes of the fundamental and fault harmonics leads to higher precision current measurements. The resulting compact sensor is used as a current probe for fault detection in induction motors through motor current signal analysis. The use of a Rogowski coil without an integrator allows a better discrimination of the fault harmonics around the third and fifth main harmonics. Finally, the adaptive conditioning circuit is tested over an induction machine drive. Results are presented, and quantitative comparisons are carried out.

In this paper, a voltage-oriented doubly fed induction generator, which is often used in wind turbines, is examined. Furthermore, current, voltage, and position sensor fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration are presented. Machine operation is not interrupted. A bank of observers provides residuals for fault detection and replacement signals for the reconfiguration. Control is temporarily switched from closed loop into open-loop to decouple the drive from faulty sensor readings. During a short period of open-loop operation, the fault is isolated using parity equations. Replacement signals from observers are used to reconfigure the drive and reenter closed-loop control. There are no large transients in the current. Measurement results and stability analysis show good results.

Multiclass Classification Based on Extended Support Vector Data Description	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Multiclass classification; nearest neighbor; negative samples; spherically shaped boundary; support vector data description (SVDD); target class	FEATURE-SELECTION; NEURAL NETWORKS; FAULT-DETECTION; MACHINE; GENERATION; ALGORITHMS	We propose two variations of the support vector data description (SVDD) with negative samples (NSVDD) that learn a closed spherically shaped boundary around a set of samples in the target class by involving different forms of slack vectors, including the two-norm NSVDD and nu-NSVDD. We extend the NSVDDs to solve the multiclass classification problems based on the distances between the samples and the centers of the learned spherically shaped boundaries in a kernel-defined feature space by using a combination of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and nearest-neighbor (NN) rule. Extensive simulations are developed with one real-world data set on the automatic monitoring of roller bearings with vibration signals and eight benchmark data sets for both binary and multiclass classification. The benchmark testing results show that our proposed methods provide lower classification error rates and smaller standard deviations with the cross-validation procedure. The two-norm NSVDD with the LDA-NN rule recorded a test accuracy of 100.0% for the binary fault detection of roller bearings and 99.9% for the multiclass classification of roller bearings under six conditions.

Expression of Hsp90 chaperome proteins in human tumor tissue	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES			English	Article						Hsp90; Cochaperone; Protein expression; Geldanamycin	MOLECULAR CHAPERONE; ATPASE ACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; CANCER; AHA1; MACHINERY; COMPLEX; STRESS; DOMAIN; TPR2	The activity of many oncogenic proteins depends on the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Recent studies indicate that tumorigenesis is associated with increased expression of chaperones, such as Hsp90. However, little is known about the isoform dependence and cochaperone contribution on tumor formation. Here we report the first systematic expression profiling for Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta, the cochaperones Aha1, Cdc37, p23, Tpr2, and the Hsp90 dependent transcription factor HSF1 in a set of different tumor tissue samples. We find that in 10 out of 17 human tumors the expression level of at least one Hsp90 or Hsp90 cochaperone protein is significantly elevated. However, individual tumors show unique patterns of expression. Furthermore, Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta expression levels are not related. Our results suggest that expression profiling of Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta and its cochaperone proteins may be useful for cancer diagnosis and prognosis as well as for tailoring of drugs that interfere with the Hsp90 system in a tumor specific manner.

In this paper, we present a decoupled tracking and thermal monitoring system which can be used on non-stationary targets of closed systems such as machine tools. There are three main contributions from the paper. First, a vision component is developed to track moving targets under a monitor. Image processing techniques are used to resolve the target location to be tracked. Thus, the system is decoupled and applicable to closed systems without the need for a physical integration. Second, an infrared temperature sensor with a built-in laser for locating the measurement spot is deployed for non-contact temperature measurement of the moving target. Third, a predictive motion control system holds the thermal sensor and follows the moving target efficiently to enable continuous temperature measurement and monitoring. (C) 2009, ISA.

We divide the motor vibration signal, obtain the corresponding cepstrum coefficients, and classify the motor systems through ANN models. Utilizing the proposed method, one can identify the characteristics hiding inside a vibration signal and classify the signal, as well as diagnose the abnormalities. To evaluate this method, several tests for the normal and abnormal conditions were performed in the laboratory. The results show the effectiveness of cepstrum and ANN in detecting the bearing condition. The proposed method successfully extracted the corresponding feature vectors, distinguished the difference, and classified bearing faults correctly.

J	Li, H; Zhang, YP; Zheng, HQ				Li, Hui; Zhang, Yuping; Zheng, Haiqi			Gear fault detection and diagnosis under speed-up condition based on order cepstrum and radial basis function neural network	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Order cepstrum; Radial basis function; Neural network; Gearbox; Fault diagnosis; Signal processing	NONSTATIONARY ROTATIONAL SPEED; WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; MACHINERY VIBRATIONS; RECURSIVE FILTERS; TRACKING; BEARING; DRIVES	Varying speed machinery condition detection and fault diagnosis are more difficult due to non-stationary machine dynamics and vibration. Therefore, most conventional signal processing methods based on time invariant carried out in constant time interval are frequently unable to provide meaningful results. In this paper, a study is presented to apply order cepstrum and radial basis function (RBF) artificial neural network (ANN) for gear fault detection during speedup process. This method combines computed order tracking, cepstrum analysis with ANN. First, the vibration signal during speed-up process of the gearbox is sampled at constant time increments and then is re-sampled at constant angle increments. Second, the re-sampled signals are processed by cepstrum analysis. The order cepstrum with normal, wear and crack fault are processed for feature extracting. In the end, the extracted features are used as inputs to RBF for recognition. The RBF is trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANN is tested by using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated with the experimental vibration data of a gearbox. The results show the effectiveness of order cepstrum and RBF in detection and diagnosis of the gear condition.

Light and short arc rubs in rotating machines: Experimental tests and modelling	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Rotordynamics; Rub; Experimental tests; Modelling	TO-STATOR RUB; AUXILIARY BEARING CONTACT; ROTOR VIBRATION; PART 1; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; WHIRL	Rotor-to-stator rub is a non-linear phenomenon which has been analyzed many times in rotordynamics literature, but very often these studies are devoted simply to highlight non-linearities, using very simple rotors, rather than to present reliable models. However, rotor-to-stator rub is actually one of the most common faults during the operation of rotating machinery. The frequency of its occurrence is increasing due to the trend of reducing the radial clearance between the seal and the rotor in modern turbine units, pumps and compressors in order to increase efficiency. Often the rub occurs between rotor and seals and the analysis of the phenomenon cannot set aside the consideration of the different relative stiffness. This paper presents some experimental results obtained by means of a test rig in which rub conditions of real machines are reproduced. In particular short arc rubs are considered and the shaft is stiffer than the obstacle. Then a model, suitable to be employed for real rotating machinery, is presented and the simulations obtained are compared with the experimental results. The model is able to reproduce the behaviour of the test rig. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Patel, TH; Darpe, AK				Patel, Tejas H.; Darpe, Ashish K.			Experimental investigations on vibration response of misaligned rotors	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Misalignment; Full-spectrum analysis; Fault diagnosis		Misalignment is one of the most commonly observed faults in rotating machines. However, there have been relatively limited research efforts in the past to understand its effect on overall dynamics of the rotor system. In the existing literature, there is confusing spectral information on the rotor vibration characteristics of misalignment. The present study is aimed at understanding the dynamics of misaligned rotors and reducing the ambiguity so as to improve the reliability of the misalignment fault diagnosis. Influence of misalignment and its type on the forcing characteristics of flexible coupling is investigated followed by experimental investigation of the vibration response of misaligned coupled rotors supported on rolling element bearings. Steady-state vibration response at integer fraction of the first bending natural frequency is investigated. Effects of types of misalignments, i.e. parallel and angular misalignments, are investigated. The conventional Fourier spectrum (i.e. FFT) has limitations in revealing the directional nature of the vibrations arising out of rotor faults. In addition, it has been observed that several other rotor faults generate higher harmonics in the Fourier spectrum and hence there could be a level of uncertainty in the diagnosis when other faults are also suspect. The present work through use of full spectra has shown possibility of diagnosing misalignment through unique vibration features exhibited in the full spectra (i.e. forward/backward whirl). This provides an important tool to separate faults that generate similar frequency spectra (e.g. crack and misalignment) and lead to a more reliable misalignment diagnosis. Full spectra and orbit plots are efficiently used to reveal the unique nature of misalignment fault not clearly brought out by the previous studies, and new misalignment diagnostics recommendations are proposed.

J	Jiang, QS; Jia, MP; Hu, JZ; Xu, FY				Jiang, Quansheng; Jia, Minping; Hu, Jianzhong; Xu, Feiyun			Machinery fault diagnosis using supervised manifold learning	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Supervised manifold learning; Pattern classification; Laplacian eigenmaps	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION	Fault diagnosis is essentially a kind of pattern recognition. How to implement feature extraction and improve recognition performance is a crucial task. In this paper, a new supervised manifold learning. algorithm (S-LapEig) for feature extraction is proposed first. Via combining preserving the consistency of local neighbor information and class labels information, S-LapEig can not only gain a perfect approximation of low-dimensional intrinsic geometric structure within the high-dimensional observation data, but also enhance local within-class relations. Based on S-LapEig, a novel fault diagnosis approach is proposed. The approach extracts the intrinsic manifold features from high-dimensional fault data by directly learning the data, and translates complex mode space into a low-dimensional feature space, in which pattern classification and fault diagnosis are carried out easily. Comparing with other feature extraction methods such as PCA, LDA and Laplacian eigenmaps, the proposed method obviously improves the classification performance of fault pattern recognition. The experiments on benchmark data and engineering instance demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the new approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Different statistical approaches have been used to detect and diagnose insert breakage in multitooth tools based on the analysis of electrical power consumption of the tool drives. Great effort has been made to obtain a robust method, able to avoid any needed re-calibration process, after. for example, a maintenance operation. From the point of view of maintenance costs, these multitooth tools are the most critical part of the machine tools used for mass production in the car industry. These tools integrate different kinds of machining operations and cutting conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detection of combined faults in induction machines with stator parallel branches through the DWT of the startup current	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Startup transient; Rotor asymmetries; Mixed eccentricities; Inter-turn short-circuits	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS; MOTOR; VIBRATION	The main objective of this paper is to diagnose the presence of combined faults in induction machines. For this purpose, a methodology based on the application of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the stator startup current is used. This approach was applied in previous works with success to the diagnosis of rotor asymmetries and mixed eccentricities in motors with different sizes and conditions. However, as most of the diagnosis methods hitherto developed, the application of the proposed approach was circumscribed to situations in which a single fault was present in the machine. In addition, the influence of other phenomena such as load torque oscillations or voltage fluctuations was studied, but without considering the combination of these phenomena and the fault in the machine. This work is intended, first, to apply the proposed transient-based methodology to several cases in which different faults (rotor asymmetries, mixed eccentricities and inter-turn and inter-coil stator short-circuits) are simultaneously present in the machine and, second, to apply it to cases regarding faults combined with other phenomena making difficult the diagnosis, such as load torque oscillations. Interesting considerations regarding the preponderance of the effects of some of the faults are also done in the paper. The application of the methodology is focused on induction machines with stator parallel branches; in this sense, the suitability of the use either of the phase current or of the branch current for the diagnosis of each particular fault is analysed. The results look promising with regard to the validity of the methodology for the reliable discrimination of simultaneous electromechanical faults and the diagnosis of faults combined with other phenomena.

Here we report on such a diagnostic procedure for narrowing down maintenance tasks and shortening system downtime. A web-based FDS is developed based on case-based reasoning (CBR) from previous maintenance experience, for an injection moulding machine (IMM). The techniques of fault tree analysis (FTA) and information flow analysis are introduced to systematically clarify possible faults and symptoms shown by a system. A logical process is introduced to determine the correlation between the possible faults and the symptoms for computing case similarity while progressing CBR diagnosing. Some frontpages are developed for the CBR diagnosis using an ASP program in cooperation with a Microsoft Access database. The resultant FDS achieves good results with the potential for supporting remote IMM maintenance.

Predicting radiotherapy outcomes using statistical learning techniques	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 11-13, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE SMC, Calif State Univ, Bakersfield, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat			RADIATION PNEUMONITIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; DOSE-VOLUME; SALIVARY FUNCTION; PROSTATE-CANCER; LUNG-CARCINOMA; THERAPY; RISK; PARAMETERS; RTOG-9311	Radiotherapy outcomes are determined by complex interactions between treatment, anatomical and patient-related variables. A common obstacle to building maximally predictive outcome models for clinical practice is the failure to capture potential complexity of heterogeneous variable interactions and applicability beyond institutional data. We describe a statistical learning methodology that can automatically screen for nonlinear relations among prognostic variables and generalize to unseen data before. In this work, several types of linear and nonlinear kernels to generate interaction terms and approximate the treatment-response function are evaluated. Examples of institutional datasets of esophagitis, pneumonitis and xerostomia endpoints were used. Furthermore, an independent RTOG dataset was used for 'generalizabilty' validation. We formulated the discrimination between risk groups as a supervised learning problem. The distribution of patient groups was initially analyzed using principle components analysis (PCA) to uncover potential nonlinear behavior. The performance of the different methods was evaluated using bivariate correlations and actuarial analysis. Over-fitting was controlled via cross-validation resampling. Our results suggest that a modified support vector machine (SVM) kernel method provided superior performance on leave-one-out testing compared to logistic regression and neural networks in cases where the data exhibited nonlinear behavior on PCA. For instance, in prediction of esophagitis and pneumonitis endpoints, which exhibited nonlinear behavior on PCA, the method provided 21% and 60% improvements, respectively. Furthermore, evaluation on the independent pneumonitis RTOG dataset demonstrated good generalizabilty beyond institutional data in contrast with other models. This indicates that the prediction of treatment response can be improved by utilizing nonlinear kernel methods for discovering important nonlinear interactions among model variables.

TB TrDNA Consortium	Implications of Storing Urinary DNA from Different Populations for Molecular Analyses	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background: Molecular diagnosis using urine is established for many sexually transmitted diseases and is increasingly used to diagnose tumours and other infectious diseases. Storage of urine prior to analysis, whether due to home collection or bio-banking, is increasingly advocated yet no best practice has emerged. Here, we examined the stability of DNA in stored urine in two populations over 28 days. Methodology: Urine from 40 (20 male) healthy volunteers from two populations, Italy and Zambia, was stored at four different temperatures (RT, 4 degrees C, -20 degrees C & -80 degrees C) with and without EDTA preservative solution. Urines were extracted at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 28 after storage. Human DNA content was measured using multi-copy (ALU J) and single copy (TLR2) targets by quantitative real-time PCR. Zambian and Italian samples contained comparable DNA quantity at time zero. Generally, two trends were observed during storage; no degradation, or rapid degradation from days 0 to 7 followed by little further degradation to 28 days. The biphasic degradation was always observed in Zambia regardless of storage conditions, but only twice in Italy. Conclusion: Site-specific differences in urine composition significantly affect the stability of DNA during storage. Assessing the quality of stored urine for molecular analysis, by using the type of strategy described here, is paramount before these samples are used for molecular prognostic monitoring, genetic analyses and disease diagnosis.

Meanwhile, diagnosability is the capability of a system in terms of diagnosing dimensional variation and root cause identification. In order to obtain enough sensing data, special attention should be taken to the sensor allocation optimization within the framework of ensuring system diagnosability, which can lower sensing cost and reduce time to diagnosis. This paper investigates both theoretically and experimentally the effect of sensor allocation optimization on the diagnosability of a multistation manufacturing system (MMS). The design for diagnosability (DFD) is formulated and implemented in the early design phase. Three indices, namely detectability, locatability, and isolability, are proposed to measure the system diagnosability. A two-step process of diagnosing variation sources is presented to specify the variation transmission between stations and variation diagnosis within a station. An optimal methodology of sensor allocation is then proposed. A typical machining process is demonstrated as an example of the analytical procedure and reference for sensor allocation in practice. Four sensing strategies are conducted for performance comparison. Results indicate that the optimal sensor allocation yields less sensing cost and shorter time to diagnosis without loss of diagnosability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Consequently, in spite of a large number of research reports in this area, the problem of PQ event classification remains to be an important engineering problem. Several feature construction, pattern recognition, analysis, and classification methods were proposed for this purpose. In spite of the extensive number of such alternatives, a research on the comparison of "how useful these features with respect to each other using specific classifiers" was omitted. In this work, a thorough analysis is carried out regarding the classification strengths of an ensemble of celebrated features. The feature items were selected from well-known tools such as spectral information, wavelet extrema across several decomposition levels, and local statistical variations of the waveform. The tests are repeated for classification of several types of real-life data acquired during line-to-ground arcing faults and voltage sags due to the induction motor starting under different load conditions. In order to avoid specificity in classifier strength determination, eight different approaches are applied, including the computationally costly "exhaustive search" together with the leave-one-out technique. To further avoid specificity of the feature for a given classifier, two classifiers (Bayes and SVM) are tested. As a result of these analyses, the more useful set among a wider set of features for each classifier is obtained. It is observed that classification accuracy improves by eliminating relatively useless feature items for both classifiers. Furthermore, the feature selection results somewhat change according to the classifier used. This observation shows that when a new analysis tool or a feature is developed and claimed to perform "better" than another, one should always indicate the matching classifier for the feature because that feature may prove comparably inefficient with other classifiers.

This paper focuses on two specific operating modes: 1) machines operated from inverters in the overmodulation region and 2) machines operated from soft-starters during startup. In both cases, high-frequency (in the range of the hundred hertz) voltage components at well-defined frequencies are created. The negative-sequence currents induced from these high-frequency voltages are shown to contain accurate information on the level of asymmetry (fault) in the machine. This information is significantly richer than exists in other modes of operation, i.e., inverters working in the linear modulation region or soft-starters in the steady state, and provides interesting opportunities to complement other diagnostic methods.

A Critical Comparison Between DWT and Hilbert-Huang-Based Methods for the Diagnosis of Rotor Bar Failures in Induction Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society	SEP 23-27, 2007	New Orleans, LA	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Fault diagnosis; Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT); rotor asymmetries; startup transient; wavelet analysis	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SPECTRUM; MOTORS; BEARING; SYSTEM	In this paper, a cutting-edge time-frequency decomposition tool, i.e., the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), is applied to the stator startup current to diagnose the presence of rotor asymmetries in induction machines. The objective is to extract the evolution during the startup transient of the left sideband harmonic (LSH) caused by the asymmetry, which constitutes a reliable evidence of the presence of the fault. The validity of the diagnosis methodology is assessed through several tests developed using real experimental signals. Moreover, in this paper, an analytical comparison with an alternative time-frequency decomposition tool, i.e., the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), is carried out. This tool was applied in previous works to the transient extraction of fault-related components, with satisfactory results, even in cases in which the classical Fourier approach does not lead to correct results. The results of the application of the HHT and DWT are analyzed and compared, obtaining novel conclusions about their respective suitability for the transient extraction of asymmetry-related components, as well as the equivalence, with regard to the LSH extraction, between their basic components, namely: 1) intrinsic mode function, for the HHT, and 2) approximation signal for the DWT.

Logistic regression models for outcome prediction may be cumbersome to apply in clinical practice. Objective: To use machine learning techniques to build a model of outcome prediction that makes the knowledge discovered from the data explicit and communicable to domain experts. Material and methods: A derivation cohort (n = 441) of nonselected SAH cases was analyzed using different classification algorithms to generate decision trees and decision rules. Algorithms used were C4.5, fast decision tree learner, partial decision trees, repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction, nearest neighbor with generalization, and ripple down rule learner. Outcome was dichotomized in favorable [Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) = I-II] and poor (GOS = III-V). An independent cohort (n = 193) was used for validation. An exploratory questionnaire was given to potential users (specialist doctors) to gather their opinion on the classifier and its usability in clinical routine. Results: The best classifier was obtained with the C4.5 algorithm. It uses only two attributes [World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) and Fisher's scale] and leads to a simple decision tree. The accuracy of the classifier [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.84; confidence interval (CI) = 0.80-0.88] is similar to that obtained by a logistic regression model (AUC = 0.86; CI = 0.83-0.89) derived from the same data and is considered better fit for clinical use.

Energy-Based Feature Extraction for Defect Diagnosis in Rotary Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Continuous wavelet transform (CWT); defect diagnosis; feature extraction; noise reduction; signal enveloping	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; BEARING FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION SIGNALS; TOOL	This paper presents an energy-based approach to defect diagnosis in rotary machines and machine components, which enhances the ability of the continuous wavelet transform in feature extraction from vibration signals. Specifically, the energy content of the wavelet coefficients of vibration signal measured on rolling bearings has been evaluated for selecting appropriate base wavelet and decomposition scale such that identification of defect-induced signal features is significantly improved. Through subsequent envelope spectral analysis of the extracted signal features, the location of structural defect in the bearing being monitored can be identified. An experimental study performed on two ball bearings has shown that the developed approach is more effective in diagnosing bearing defects than using the traditional techniques.

J	Camci, F				Camci, Fatih			System Maintenance Scheduling With Prognostics Information Using Genetic Algorithm	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Condition based maintenance; genetic algorithms; maintenance optimization; maintenance planning; maintenance scheduling; prognostics; remaining useful life	PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE; OPTIMIZATION; POLICIES; STRATEGIES; INSPECTION; EQUIPMENT; FAILURES; OPTIONS; MODEL; PLANT	Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) aims to balance two extreme sides (i.e., Corrective Maintenance ( CM), and Preventive Maintenance ( PM)) by observing and forecasting the real time health of machines. Recent developments in CBM revealed promising technologies for advanced fault detection, and forecasting. Traditional maintenance scheduling in CBM is based on the threshold setting on forecasted failure probability, or remaining useful life (RUL) for individual components. However, this approach may not give the best result for the system, because individual components are inter-related, and mutually dependent. It is not uncommon in systems that turning off a machine due to failure or maintenance causes other machinery or components to be turned off. Designing a comprehensive tool that optimizes availability & cost of the whole system incorporating prognostics information is crucial to fully benefit from CBM. The goal of this paper is to emphasize this need by demonstrating scenarios in CM, PM, and CBM; and to present a solution that optimizes system availability, and cost with system-maintenance constraints using genetic algorithms. The proposed tool acquires the forecasted failure probability of individual components from the prognostics module, and their reliability expectations after maintenance. The tradeoff between maintenance & failure is quantified in risk as the objective function to be minimized. The risk is minimized utilizing genetic algorithms for the whole system rather than individual components. The results of the proposed tool are compared with PM, CM, and CBM in which prognostics information of components are analyzed individually.

Broken Rotor Bar Detection via Wavelet Packet Decomposition of Motor Current	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-IREE			English	Article						Induction Motors; Wavelet Packet Decomposition; Motor Current Signature Analysis; Broken Rotor Bars	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; BEARING DAMAGE DETECTION; INDUCTION MACHINES; FAULT-DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; STATOR; DIAGNOSIS; METHODOLOGY; SENSORLESS; TRANSFORM	In this paper, discrete wavelet packet decomposition (DWPD) of induction motor current is proposed for detecting broken rotor bar conditions. Good frequency separation is essential for accurate detection of broken rotor bars since it is difficult to separate the rotor bar frequency components from the fundamental supply frequency component at rated speeds. The proposed method provides good frequency separation at a very low computational complexity. The motor current signal is first notch filtered to suppress the power system fundamental frequency. Then, the motor current is decomposed into equally spaced frequency bands by using all-pass implementation of elliptic IIR half-band filter. Next, baseline shifting of wavelet packet coefficients (WPCs) is applied to remove the filtering distortion caused by other harmonics. Finally, energy level of each frequency band is calculated by determining rms values from WPCs of associated frequency bands. The changes in the energy levels of frequency bands in which broken rotor bar related current frequencies lie are monitored to defect motor fault conditions.

J	Guo, L; Chen, J; Li, XL				Guo, Lei; Chen, Jin; Li, Xinglin			Rolling Bearing Fault Classification Based on Envelope Spectrum and Support Vector Machine	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; rolling bearing; envelope spectrum; support vector machine	ELEMENT BEARINGS; DIAGNOSIS; FREQUENCY; SIGNAL	Based upon Hilbert envelope spectrum and support vector machine (SVM), a method for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearing is proposed in this paper. Targeting the modulation characteristics of rolling bearing fault vibration signals, the Hilbert transform based envelope spectrum analysis is used to extract fault bearing features. In the envelope spectrum, character frequencies are quite clear and can be used as a reliable source of information for bearing diagnosis. Basic SVM is originally designed for two-class classification problem, while bearing fault diagnosis is multi-class case. A new bearing fault diagnosis system based on "one to others" SVM algorithm is presented to solve the multi-class recognition problems. Practical vibration signals measured from rolling bearings with ball fault, inner race fault and outer race fault are analyzed by the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method provides accurate diagnosis and good diagnostic resolution.

Nonlinear and parametric coupled vibrations of the rotor-shaft system as fault identification symptom using stochastic methods	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Crack rotor dynamics; Nonlinear and parametric vibrations; Hybrid modeling; Monte Carlo simulation; Crack identification methods		In the paper several stochastic methods for detection and identification of cracks in the shafts of rotating machines are proposed. All these methods are based on the Monte Carlo simulations of the rotor-shaft lateral-torsional-longitudinal vibrations mutually coupled by transverse cracks of randomly selected depths and locations on the shaft. For this purpose there is applied a structural hybrid model of a real cracked rotor-shaft. This model is characterized by a high practical reliability and great computational efficiency, so important for hundreds of thousands numerical simulations necessary to build databases used in solving the inverse problem, i.e. crack parameter identifications. In order to ensure a good identification accuracy, for creating the Monte Carlo samples of data points there are proposed special probability density functions for locations and depths of the crack. Such an approach helps in enhancing databases corresponding to the most probable faults of the rotor-shaft system of the considered rotor machine. In the presented study six different database sizes are considered to compare identification efficiency and accuracy of considered methods. A sufficiently large database enables us to estimate almost immediately (usually in less than one second) the crack parameters with precision that is in most of the cases acceptable in practice. Then, as a next stage, one of the proposed fast improvement algorithms can be applied to refine identification results in a reasonable time. The proposed methods seem to provide very convenient diagnostic tools for industrial applications.

J	Wu, TY; Chung, YL				Wu, T. Y.; Chung, Y. L.			Misalignment diagnosis of rotating machinery through vibration analysis via the hybrid EEMD and EMD approach	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ROTOR SYSTEM SUBJECT; COUPLING MISALIGNMENT; THEORETICAL-MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; UNBALANCE	The objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing the hybrid method of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and pure empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to efficiently decompose the complicated vibration signals of rotating machinery into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), so that the fault characteristics of the misaligned shaft can be examined in the time-frequency Hilbert spectrum as well as the marginal Hilbert spectrum. The intrawave frequency modulation (FM) phenomenon, which indicates the nonlinear vibration behavior of a misaligned shaft, can be observed in the time-frequency Hilbert spectrum through the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) technique. The fault characteristic of shaft misalignment is also featured in terms of the amplitude modulation (AM) phenomenon in the information-containing IMF components that are extracted by the significance test. Through performing the envelope analysis on the information-containing IMF, the marginal Hilbert spectrum of the envelope signal of this IMF component exhibits that the level of shaft misalignment is presented by the level of AM in the IMF. A test bed of a rotor-bearing system is performed experimentally to illustrate both the parallel and angular shaft misalignment conditions as well as the healthy condition. The analysis results show that the proposed approach is capable of diagnosing the misaligned fault of the shaft in rotating machinery and providing a more meaningful physical insight compared with the conventional methods.

Online Wind Turbine Fault Detection through Automated SCADA Data Analysis	WIND ENERGY			English	Article						wind turbine; Online Fault Detection; SCADA Analysis; Multi-Agent System; Anomaly Detection; Normal Behaviour Modelling	MONITORING-SYSTEM; DESIGN	This paper describes a set of anomaly-detection techniques and their applicability to wind turbine fault identification. It explains how the anomaly-detection techniques have been adopted to analyse supervisory control and data acquisition data acquired from a wind farm, automating and simplifying the operators' analysis task by interpreting the volume of data available. The techniques are brought together into one system to collate their output and provide a single decision support environment for an operator. The framework used is a novel multi-agent system architecture that offers the opportunity to corroborate the output of the various interpretation techniques in order to improve the accuracy of fault detection. The results presented demonstrate that the interpretation techniques can provide performance assessment and early fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their machines.

J	Guo, Y; Tan, KK				Guo, Yu; Tan, Kok Kiong			Order-crossing removal in Gabor order tracking by independent component analysis	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SHAFT-SPEED INFORMATION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; REPRESENTATION; EXPLORATION; ALGORITHMS; ROBUST; SIGNAL	Order-crossing problems in Gabor order tracking (GOT) of rotating machinery often occur when noise due to power-frequency interference, local structure resonance, etc., is prominent in applications. They can render the analysis results and the waveform-reconstruction tasks in GOT inaccurate or even meaningless. An approach is proposed ill this paper to address the order-crossing problem by independent component analysis (ICA). With the approach, accurate order analysis results can be obtained and the waveforms of the order components of interest can be reconstructed or extracted from the recorded noisy data series. In addition, the ambiguities (permutation and scaling) of ICA results are also solved with the approach. The approach is amenable to applications in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The evaluation of the approach is presented in detail based on simulations and an experiment on a rotor test rig.

The estimation of the degrees of unbalance and misalignment in flexible coupling-rotor system is discussed. The model-based approach is employed to solve this problem. The models of the equivalent external loads for unbalance and misalignment are derived and analyzed. Then, the degrees of unbalance and misalignment are estimated by analyzing the components of the equivalent external loads of which the frequencies are equal to the I and 2 times running frequency respectively. The equivalent external loads are calculated according to the dynamic equation of the original rotor system and the differences between the dynamical responses in normal case and the vibrations when the degree of unbalance or misalignment or both changes. The denoise method based on bandpass filter is used to decrease the effect of noise on the estimation accuracy. The numerical examples are given to show that the proposed approach can estimate the degrees of unbalance and misalignment of the flexible coupling-rotor system accurately.

Higher survival rates have been observed only in patients with ventricular fibrillation who were fortunate enough to have basic and advanced life support initiated early after cardiac arrest. The ability to predict outcomes of cardiac arrest would be useful for resuscitation chains. Levels of EtCO(2)in expired air from lungs during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may serve as a non-invasive predictor of successful resuscitation and survival from cardiac arrest. Six different supervised learning classification techniques were used and evaluated. It has been shown that machine learning methods can provide an efficient way to detect important prognostic factors upon which further emergency unit actions are based. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Diagnosis of rotor asymmetries in induction motors based on the transient extraction of fault components using filtering techniques	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Induction machines; Filtering techniques; Discrete wavelet transform; Transient analysis	BAR DETECTION; BROKEN BARS	The aim of this paper is to present and validate a methodology for diagnosing rotor asymmetries in cage motors, based on the analysis of the stator startup current. The method consists of the extraction of a harmonic component introduced by this fault - the left sideband component - from the stator startup current. Two alternative techniques developed by different research groups are proposed for the transient extraction of this component; the digital low-pass filtering (DLPF) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Both approaches are applied to three different industrial motors ranging from 1.1 to 450kW. A detailed explanation of the physical basis of the method and comments related to the application scope of the approach are also given. The results show the robustness of both approaches for the reliable diagnosis of the fault and suggest a clear potentiality for extending the methodology to the detection of other types of faults introducing components dependant on the slip.

In this method, WPT and EMD are, respectively, used to preprocess vibration signals to mine fault characteristic information more accurately. Then, dimensionless parameters in time domain are extracted from each of the original vibration signals and preprocessed signals to form a combined feature set. Moreover. the distance evaluation technique is utilised to calculate evaluation factors of the combined feature set. Finally, according to the evaluation factors, the corresponding sensitive features are selected and input into the RBF network to automatically identify different machine operation conditions. An experiment of rolling element bearings is carried out to test the performance of the proposed method. The experimental result demonstrates that the method combining WPT, EMD, the distance evaluation technique and the RBF network may accurately extract fault information and select sensitive features, and therefore it may correctly diagnose the different fault categories occurring in the bearings. Furthermore, this method is applied to slight rub fault diagnosis of a heavy oil catalytic cracking unit, the actual result shows the method may be applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery effectively.

Shaft coupling model-based prognostics enhanced by vibration diagnostics	INSIGHT			English	Article								Flexible power transmission couplings are a vital part in the drive train of rotorcraft, conventional aircraft and other land, sea and marine propulsion systems. These components are generally subject to high torque, rotational speeds and temperatures, which result in high static and dynamic loads that make them susceptible to degradation and failure. Additionally, couplings can experience accelerated failures, mainly driven by high cyclic stresses induced by extreme shaft misalignment and secondary causes such as improper assembly, fastener damage and lubricant loss. Damage to other drive train components can also lead to increased vibration and misalignment which, in turn, induces coupling failure. As with many complex: systems, the service life of a shaft is randomly distributed and can be modelled by a stochastic deterioration process that allows approximation of remaining useful life (RUL). However, in such an approach, knowledge of actual shaft damage (ie current crack Size) is still required. In practical health monitoring applications, actual damage is estimated via inference, as it is nearly impossible to be measured directly. To address this critical need, a shaft and shaft coupling prognostics and health management (PHM) system was developed that integrates vibration diagnostics, finite element stress analysis and material fatigue modelling to predict RUL of helicopter drive shafts and flexible shaft couplings. This modelling and prediction approach was developed and validated against actual sub-scale failure testing that included the requisite measurement of the I ground truth' damage level. Data from a scaled drive shaft/coupling test stand was used to validate the approach. The results indicated a cumulative prognostic accuracy of 80% over the last 25 minutes of the coupling life. Vibration-based diagnostics helped to improve the accuracy to over 95% once a crack had initiated and been detected over the last five minutes of coupling life. The application of these technologies will establish an economical, safe and effective maintenance-scheduling regime for helicopter shafts and couplings by scheduling maintenance towards the end of actual component life, increasing availability by preventing unscheduled maintenance and reducing inspections.

Fault diagnosis of an electro-pump in a marine ship using vibration condition monitoring	INSIGHT			English	Article						Vibration analysis; condition monitoring; electro-pump; predicting and diagnosing faults		Changes in the health, or condition, of a machine often produce changes in the machines vibration. Even a perfectly healthy machine produces some degree of vibration, as it is virtually impossible to have perfect balance and alignment. Additionally, the machine itself may produce vibration as part of its process or work. Condition monitoring monitors for a change in the vibration that a machine normally produces. The vibration technique in a machine condition monitoring programme provides useful reliable information, bringing significant cost benefits to industry. In this research, the vibration analysis was initially run under regular intervals during the electro-pump life. A series of tests were then conducted under the operating hours of the electro-pump. Vibration data was regularly collected and the overall vibration data produced by vibration analysis was compared with previous data. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis was compared with the vibration spectra of a healthy electro-pump, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results of this paper provide more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis ill predicting and diagnosing electro-pump faults.

Automated Operating Mode Classification for Online Monitoring Systems	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	SEP 04-07, 2007	Las Vegas, NV	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div			INSTANTANEOUS POWER SPECTRUM; VARYING LOAD CONDITIONS	Transient operation of machinery can greatly complicate the task of vibration-based online condition monitoring. Because the operating mode of a machine affects the physical response and hence the diagnostic parameters, real-time information regarding the operating mode is likely to improve the performance of an online fault detection system. This paper proposes a method for automated operating mode classification to augment the performance of vibration-based online condition monitoring systems for applications such as gearboxes, motors, and their constituent components. Experimental work has been carried out on the swing machinery of an electromechanical excavator, which demonstrates how such a method might function on actual dynamic signals gathered from an operating machine. Several variations of the system have been tested and found to be successful.

J	He, W; Jiang, ZN; Feng, K				He, Wei; Jiang, Zhi-Nong; Feng, Kun			Bearing fault detection based on optimal wavelet filter and sparse code shrinkage	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Wavelet filter; Differential evolution; Sparse code shrinkage; Parameter optimization; Rolling element bearing; Fault diagnosis		The presence of periodical impulses in vibration signals often indicates the occurrence of machine faults. However, it is difficult to detect the impulses at the early stage of fault because they are rather weak and often overwhelmed by heavy noise and higher-level macro-structural vibrations. Therefore, a proper signal processing method is needed. In this paper, to extract the impulsive features buried in the vibration signal, a hybrid method which combines Morlet wavelet filter and sparse code shrinkage (SCS) is proposed. First, the wavelet filter is optimized by differential evolution (DE) to eliminate the interferential vibrations and obtain the fault characteristic signal. Then, to further enhance the impulsive features and suppress residual noise, SCS which is a soft-thresholding method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is applied to the filtered signal. The results of simulated experiments and real bearing vibration signal analyses verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in extracting impulsive features from noisy signal.

Restoration of a temporal indicator specific to each vibratory sources for a predictive maintenance	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Vibratory analysis; Predictive maintenance; RMS value; Inverse problems	QUANTIFICATION; FORCES	The monitoring of rotating machinery is increasingly important for industry. Partly, it is made from indicators given by vibration analysis. These indicators give only the overall state of operation of the studied machine. Indeed, the piezoelectric sensors, which are used for vibration analysis, record the vibrations generated by the various components of the machine. Numerous studies have developed techniques for locating and quantifying the vibration sources from the recorded signals. Thus, it is legitimate to believe that these sources can give us an indicator which should be characteristic of the damage of each critical component and which should allow to follow the severity of a defect. This paper studies the feasibility (i) firstly, to restore an indicator (RMS value) for each component, (ii) secondly, to monitor the evolution of this indicator through the severity of the defect.

The start-up transient current signal is selected as features source for fault diagnosis. Preprocessing of transient current signal is performed using smoothing and discrete wavelet transform to highlight the salient features of faults. In this work, independent component analysis, principal component analysis and their kernel are performed to reduce the dimension of features and to extract the optimal features for classification process. In this work, the influence of the number of component analysis towards diagnosis accuracy is also studied. SVM multi-class classification using one against all strategy is selected for classification tool due to good generalization properties. Performance of the system is validated by applying the system to induction motor faults diagnosis. According to the result, the system has potential to serve an intelligent fault diagnosis system in real application. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Continuous impact/abrasion testing: influence of testing parameters on wear behaviour	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY			English	Article						impact/abrasion testing; wearfacing alloy; abrasion; impact; wear	FE-CR-C; CARBIDES; ALLOYS	In many fields of industry, erosion is the dominant wear mechanism that reduces the lifetime of costly machine parts such as crushers, hammer bars, or cutting edges. Particles of specific mechanical and geometrical properties hit the surface with a certain energy and, under different angles of impact, cause abrasion and surface fatigue, or, in the case of high single particle impact energy, immediate damage by exceeding the rupture strength. Different types of wearfacing alloy layers applied through welding are used to protect exposed surfaces. The structure of state-of-the-art welding alloys is always based on multi-phase systems containing effective hard phases based mainly on borides and carbides of W Cr, Nb, and others. Within this work the so-called continuous impact abrasion test was established to compare different wearfacing alloys as described above and to develop a relation between parameters of the tribological system and properties of multi-phase materials. In the first step, morphology, energy, and size of the abrasive particles were varied and applied onto two different Fe-based wearfacing alloys. Observations on the phenomena of wear on the test samples accompanied by a quantitative evaluation of volumetric wear loss finally resulted in defining a model that enables a prognosis oriented consideration of wear. It was found within this study that wear phenomena in the microstructure have to be clearly differentiated according to the total energy applied and the impact energy of a single particle.

J	Wang, D; Miao, Q; Kang, R				Wang, Dong; Miao, Qiang; Kang, Rui			Robust health evaluation of gearbox subject to tooth failure with wavelet decomposition	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSTICS; TRANSFORM	Machinery condition monitoring is a key step to perform condition-based maintenance (CBM) policy. In this paper, a novel health evaluation method based on wavelet decomposition is proposed. In the process of wavelet decomposition, a new index is defined to choose the optimal detail signal. After that, frequency spectrum growth index (FSGI) is proposed to serve as a quantitative description of machine health condition. This index is helpful for maintenance decision-making. At the same time, a semi-dynamic threshold criterion that can be used to check the existence of fault is established. In order to demonstrate the performance of this index with its semi-dynamic threshold, a comprehensive study with three sets of vibration data collected from a mechanical diagnostics test bed is conducted to validate this method. The analysis results indicate that the proposed method is insensitive to the selection of wavelet function and wavelet decomposition level, which means that FSGI has excellent performance in gear early fault detection.

Towards Smart Machinery	ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							SINGLE RUN-DOWN; FLEXIBLE ROTATING MACHINE; IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETERS; BEARINGS; UNBALANCE; MODEL; LOAD	Over recent years there has been substantial research into the development of 'Smart' structures but relatively little work on 'Smart' machinery even though this would seem to be a natural development. This paper discusses some recent work and shows how work in several areas can contribute to the development of 'Smart' machines. After discussing the problems of identification in rotating machines and automatic fault diagnosis, attention is given to the use a variety of techniques to obtain insight into the operation on individual machines. Finally some initial attempts to apply corrective forces are discussed.

Transient detection of eccentricity-related components in induction motors through the Hilbert-Huang Transform	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Induction machines; Hilbert-Huang Transform; Mixed eccentricity; Wavelet transform	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SYSTEM	The identification and extraction of characteristic patterns are proposed in this work for the diagnosis and evaluation of mixed eccentricities in induction electrical machines with parallel stator branches. Whereas the classical diagnosis approaches, deeply spread in the industrial environment, are based on the Fourier analysis of the steady-state current, the basis of the proposed methodology consist of analysing the current demanded by the machine during the connection process (startup transient); the objective is to extract the characteristic evolution during the transient of some harmonic components created by the fault; this evolution is caused by the dependence of these components on the slip (s), a quantity varying during the startup transient from 1 to almost 0. For this feature extraction. the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is proposed. An analysis of the-behaviour of this transform in comparison with another time-frequency approach used in other works, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), is also presented in the paper. The results show the usefulness of the methodology for the reliable diagnosis of the mixed eccentricity fault and for the correct discrimination against other types of failures.

J	Wu, JD; Chan, JJ				Wu, Jian-Da; Chan, Jian-Ji			Faulted gear identification of a rotating machinery based on wavelet transform and artificial neural network	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Rotating machinery; Fault diagnosis; Continuous wavelet transform; Artificial neural network; Sound emission	CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS; DEFECTS	In this paper, a condition monitoring and faults identification technique for rotating machineries using wavelet transform and artificial neural network is described. Most of the conventional techniques for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in rotating machinery are based chiefly on analyzing the difference of vibration signal amplitude in the time domain or frequency spectrum. Unfortunately, in some applications, the vibration signal may not be available and the performance is limited. However, the sound emission signal serves as a promising alternative to file fault diagnosis system. In the present study, the sound emission of gear-set is used to evaluate the proposed fault diagnosis technique. lit the experimental work, a continuous wavelet transform technique combined with a feature selection of energy spectrum is proposed for analyzing fault signals in a gear-set platform. The artificial neural network techniques both using probability neural network and conventional back-propagation network are compared in the system. The experimental results pointed out the sound emission can be used to monitor the condition off the gear-set platform and the proposed system achieved a fault recognition rate of 98% in the experimental gear-set platform.

J	Zhang, ZW; Shi, Y; Gao, GX				Zhang, Zhiwang; Shi, Yong; Gao, Guangxia			A rough set-based multiple criteria linear programming approach for the medical diagnosis and prognosis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Data mining; Rough set; Multiple criteria linear programming; Classification	FEATURE-SELECTION	It is well known that data mining is a process of discovering unknown, hidden information from a large amount of data, extracting valuable information, and using the information to make important business decisions. And data mining has been developed into a new information technology, including regression, decision tree, neural network, fuzzy set, rough set, and support vector machine. This paper puts forward a rough set-based multiple criteria linear programming (RS-MCLP) approach for solving classification problems in data mining. Firstly, we describe the basic theory and models of rough set and multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and analyse their characteristics and advantages in practical applications. Secondly, detailed analysis about their deficiencies are provided, respectively. However, because of the existing mutual complementarities between them, we put forward and build the RS-MCLP methods and models which sufficiently integrate their virtues and overcome the adverse factors simultaneously. In addition. we also develop and implement these algorithm and models in SAS and Windows system platforms. Finally, many experiments show that the RS-MCLP approach is prior to single MCLP model and other traditional classification methods in data mining, and remarkably improve the accuracy of medical diagnosis and prognosis simultaneously.

In this study, the number of available observations and the number of predicted steps are initially determined by using false nearest neighbor method and auto mutual information technique, respectively. These values are subsequently utilized as inputs for prediction models to forecast the future values of the machines' operating conditions. The performance of the proposed approach is then evaluated by using real trending data of low methane compressor. A comparative study of the predicted results obtained from CART and ANFIS models is also carried out to appraise the prediction capability of these models.

J	Barua, A; Sinha, P; Khorasani, K				Barua, Amitabh; Sinha, Purnendu; Khorasani, Khashayar			A Diagnostic Tree Approach for Fault Cause Identification in the Attitude Control Subsystem of Satellites	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article								Space and Earth observation programs demand stringent guarantees ensuring smooth and reliable operations of space vehicles and satellites. Due to unforeseen circumstances and naturally occurring faults, it is desired that a fault-diagnosis system be capable of detecting, isolating, identifying, or classifying faults in the system. Unfortunately, none of the existing fault-diagnosis methodologies alone can meet all the requirements of an ideal fault-diagnosis system due to the variety of fault types, their severity, and handling mechanisms. However, it is possible to overcome these shortcomings through the integration of different existing fault-diagnosis methodologies. In this paper, a novel learning-based, diagnostic-tree approach is proposed which complements and strengthens existing efficient fault detection mechanisms with an additional ability to classify different types of faults to effectively determine potential fault causes in a subsystem of a satellite. This extra capability serves as a semiautomatic diagnostic decision support aid to expert human operators at ground stations and enables them to determine fault causes and to take quick and efficient recovery/reconfiguration actions. The developed diagnosis/analysis procedure exploits a qualitative technique denoted as diagnostic tree (DX-tree) analysis as a diagnostic tool for fault cause analysis in the attitude control subsystem (ACS) of a satellite. DX-trees constructed by our proposed machine-learning-based automatic tree synthesis algorithm are demonstrated to be able to determine both known and unforeseen combinations of events leading to different fault scenarios generated through synthetic attitude control subsystem data of a satellite. Though the immediate application of our proposed approach would be at ground stations, the proposed technique has potential for being integrated with causal model-based diagnosis and recovery techniques for future autonomous space vehicle missions.

Incipient Bearing Fault Detection via Motor Stator Current Noise Cancellation Using Wiener Filter	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	SEP 06-08, 2007	Cracow, POLAND	IEEE		Bearings (mechanical); fault diagnosis; motor current signature analysis; noise cancellation; sensorless condition monitoring; vibration; Wiener filter	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; INDUCTION-MOTORS; DAMAGE DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS	Current-based monitoring can offer significant economic savings and implementation advantages over traditional vibration monitoring for bearing fault detection. The key issue in current-based bearing fault detection is to extract bearing fault signatures from the motor stator current. Since the bearing fault signature in the stator current is typically very subtle, particularly when the fault is at an incipient stage, it is difficult to detect the fault signature directly. Therefore, in this paper, the bearing fault signature is detected alternatively by estimating and removing nonbearing fault components via a noise cancellation method. In this method, all the components of the stator current that are not related to bearing faults are regarded as noise and are estimated by a Wiener filter. Then, all these noise components are cancelled out by their estimates in a real-time fashion, and a fault indicator is established based on the remaining components which are mainly caused by bearing faults. Machine parameters, bearing dimensions, nameplate values, and the stator current spectrum distribution are not required in the method. The results of online experiments with a 20-hp induction motor under multiple load levels have confirmed the effectiveness of this method.

The frequency-domain methods, which are commonly used, need speed information or accurate slip estimation for frequency-component localization in any spectrum. Nevertheless, the fault frequency bandwidth can be well defined for any squirrel-cage induction machine due to numerous previous investigations. The proposed approach consists in the energy evaluation of a known bandwidth with time-scale analysis using the discrete wavelet transform. This new technique has been applied to the stator-current space-vector magnitude and the instantaneous magnitude of the stator-current signal for different broken-bar fault severities and load levels.

The mechanical study using the vibration signal analysis has been well studied before. Recently, some works have been performed to observe the vibration components of the mechanical part in the stator current spectrum for an induction machine but without any theoretical development. This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on torque oscillations due to the characteristic torsional vibrations in a gearbox, and the source of mesh and rotating frequency components in the stator current is presented. To verify the theoretical development, a test bed based on a 5.5-kW three-phase squirrel-cage machine connected to a gearbox has been used.

The system provides a feature representation of multiple frequency resolutions for faulty modes and accurately differentiates between healthy and faulty conditions, and its main applicability is to dynamic time-variant signals experienced in induction motors during run time. The algorithm analyzes rotor bar faults by WPD of the induction motor stator current. The extracted features with different frequency resolutions, together with the slip speed, are then used by a neural network trained for the detection of faults. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to detect the faulty conditions with high accuracy.

Online Ringing Characterization as a Diagnostic Technique for IGBTs in Power Drives	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						AC machines; aging; diagnostic; insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs); inverters; power devices	FAULT-DETECTION; RELIABILITY; IMPEDANCE	Embeddable features that are easily incorporated in traditional power drive systems are identified for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems. The proposed novel feature takes advantage of the original pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform produced by the inverter that is already available in the system as a succession of step functions to study the system's response at high frequencies. The high-order oscillatory responses (ringing) present in the voltages and currents of the system are a reflection of the interaction among the internal parametric components of the power devices, allowing device characterization. Evaluating the change over time of these parameters characterized from ringing becomes a key novel feature to assess the aging status of the power electronic circuit and electric machine with respect to transistor degradation. We propose the use of a low-cost bandpass analog filter centered at a high frequency, which is relevant as a feature input capable of aging tracking. The simplified model supporting ringing as a feature to evaluate component aging and its experimental evaluation are presented with experimental data, corroborating its viability as a practical real-time power device health-state indicator.

J	Huang, PW; Lee, CH				Huang, Po-Whei; Lee, Cheng-Hsiung			Automatic Classification for Pathological Prostate Images Based on Fractal Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Classification; fractal dimension; Gleason grading; prostatic carcinoma; prostate image	CANCER DIAGNOSIS; TEXTURE ANALYSIS; SEGMENTATION; WAVELET; SIMILARITY	Accurate grading for prostatic carcinoma in pathological images is important to prognosis and treatment planning. Since human grading is always time-consuming and subjective, this paper presents a computer-aided system to automatically grade pathological images according to Gleason grading system which is the most widespread method for histological grading of prostate tissues. We proposed two feature extraction methods based on fractal dimension to analyze variations of intensity and texture complexity in regions of interest. Each image can be classified into an appropriate grade by using Bayesian, k-NN, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers, respectively. Leave-one-out and k-fold cross-validation procedures were used to estimate the correct classification rates (CCR). Experimental results show that 91.2%, 93.7%, and 93.7% CCR can be achieved by Bayesian, k-NN, and SVM classifiers, respectively, for a set of 205 pathological prostate images. If our fractal-based feature set is optimized by the sequential floating forward selection method, the CCR can be promoted up to 94.6%, 94.2%, and 94.6%, respectively, using each of the above three classifiers. Experimental results also show that our feature set is better than the feature sets extracted from multiwavelets, Gabor filters, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix methods because it has a much smaller size and still keeps the most powerful discriminating capability in grading prostate images.

Predictive Maintenance Management Using Sensor-Based Degradation Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Condition monitoring (CM); degradation models; manufacturing; predictive maintenance; prognostics; reliability; simulation	PROPORTIONAL-HAZARDS MODEL; RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; PRODUCTION SYSTEM; DETERIORATING SYSTEMS; MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; INSPECTION INTERVALS; PRODUCTION CYCLE; FAILURES; POLICIES; REPLACEMENT	This paper presents a sensory-updated degradation-based predictive maintenance policy (herein referred to as the SUDM policy). The proposed maintenance policy utilizes contemporary degradation models that combine component-specific real-time degradation signals, acquired during operation, with degradation and reliability characteristics of the component's population to predict and update the residual life distribution (RLD). By capturing the latest degradation state of the component being monitored, the updating process provides a more accurate of the remaining life. With the aid of a stopping rule, maintenance routines are scheduled based on the most recently updated RLD. The performance of the proposed maintenance policy is evaluated using a simulation model of a simple manufacturing cell. Frequency of unexpected failures and overall maintenance costs are computed and compared with two other benchmark maintenance policies: a reliability-based and a conventional degradation-based maintenance policy (without any sensor-based updating).

Dual Features Functional Support Vector Machines for Fault Detection of Rechargeable Batteries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						Attribute sampling plans; data mining; feature selection; process monitoring; secondary rechargeable battery; support vector machine	QUALITY	The early detection of faulty batteries is a critical work in the manufacturing processes of a secondary rechargeable battery. Conventional approaches use original performance degradation profiles of remaining capacity after recharge in order to detect faulty batteries. However, original degradation profiles with right-truncated test duration may not be effective in detecting faulty batteries. In this correspondence, we propose dual features functional support vector machine approach that uses both first and second derivatives of degradation profiles for early detection of faulty batteries with the reduced error rate. The modified floating search algorithm for the repeated feature selection with newly added degradation path points is presented to find a few good features for the enhanced detection while reducing the computation time for online implementation. After that, an attribute sampling plan considering time-varying classification errors is presented to determine the optimal number of test cycles and sample sizes by minimizing our proposed cost function. The real-life case study is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology and show its improved performance compared to existing approaches. The proposed method can be applied in a wide range of manufacturing processes to assess time-dependent quality characteristics.

In this paper, a signal processing-based motor fault-diagnosis scheme in detail is presented. The practicability and reliability of the proposed algorithm are tested on rotor asymmetry detection at zero speed, i.e., at startup and idle modes in the case of a vehicle. Regular rotor asymmetry tests are done when the motor is running at a certain speed under load with stationary current signal assumption. It is quite challenging to obtain these regular test conditions for long-enough periods of time during daily vehicle operations. In addition, automobile vibrations cause nonuniform air-gap motor operation that directly affects the inductances of electric motors and results in a noisy current spectrum. Therefore, it is challenging to apply conventional rotor fault-detection methods while examining the condition of electric motors as part of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain. The proposed method overcomes the aforementioned problems by simply testing the rotor asymmetry at zero speed. This test can be achieved at startup or repeated during idle modes, where the speed of the vehicle is zero. The proposed method can be implemented at no cost using the readily available electric motor inverter sensor and microprocessing unit. Induction motor fault signatures are experimentally tested online by employing the drive-embedded master processor [TMS320F2812 digital signal processor (DSP)] to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Solving the problem of feature and kernel parameter selection is a difficult task in machine learning and of high practical relevance in blurred fault diagnosis. We explored the feasibility of applying an artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-layer SVM with feature and radial basis function (RBF) kernel parameter selection to diagnose incipient fault in power transformers by combining a clonal selection algorithm (CSA). Experimental results of practical data demonstrate the effectiveness and improved efficiency of the proposed approach, quickens operations, and also increases the accuracy of the classification.

This method first represents a given signal in the time-scale domain through CWT and then maps the resulted wavelet coefficients into the polar diagram using the given potential periods. Transient features would thus be synchronously enhanced at a certain area if the mapping time period matches that of the transient vibrations. The simulation study and the applications in the gearbox and bearing fault diagnosis verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting the periodical transient vibrations.	[Zhu, Z.

J	Treetrong, J; Sinha, JK; Gu, FS; Ball, A				Treetrong, Juggrapong; Sinha, Jyoti K.; Gu, Fengshu; Ball, Andrew			Bispectrum of stator phase current for fault detection of induction motor	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA); Motor fault; Higher Order Spectrum (HOS); Bi-spectrum	ROTOR FAULTS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; BARS	A number of research studies has shown that faults in a stator or rotor generally show sideband frequencies around the mains frequency (50 Hz) and at higher harmonics in the spectrum of the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). However in the present experimental studies such observations have not been seen, but any fault either in the stator or the rotor may distort the sinusoidal response of the motor RPM and the mains frequency so the MCSA response may contain a number of harmonics of the motor RPM and the mains frequency. Hence the use of a higher order spectrum (HOS), namely the bispectrum of the MCSA has been proposed here because it relates both amplitude and phase of number of the harmonics in a signal. It has been observed that it not only detects early faults but also indicates the severity of the fault to some extent. (C) 2009 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The identification of mathematical models typically nonlinear systems is vital in many fields of engineering. The developed mathematical models can be used to study the behavior of the underlying system as well as for supervision, fault detection, prediction, estimation of unmeasurable variables, optimization and model-based control purposes. A variety of system identification techniques are applied to the modeling of process dynamics. Recently, the identification of nonlinear systems by genetic programming (GP) approaches has been successfully applied in many applications. GP is a paradigm of evolutionary computation field based on a structure description method that applies the principles of natural evolution to optimization problems and its nature is a generalized hierarchy computer program description. GP adopts a tree structure code to describe an identification problem. Unlike the traditional approximation methods where the structure of an approximate model is fixed, the structure of the GP tree itself is modified and optimized and, thus, there is a possibility that GP trees could be more appropriate or accurate approximate models. This paper focuses the GP method for structure selection in a system identification applications. The proposed GP method combines different techniques for tuning of crossover and mutation probabilities with an orthogonal least-squares (OLS) algorithm to estimate the contribution of the branches of the tree to the accuracy of the discrete polynomial Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (NARX) model. The nonlinear system identification procedure, based on a NARX representation and GP, is applied to empirical case study of an experimental ball-and-tube system. The results demonstrate that the GP with OLS is a promising technique for NARX modeling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, J; He, ZJ; Zi, YY; Lei, YG; Li, Z				Yuan, Jing; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang; Lei, Yaguo; Li, Zhen			Adaptive multiwavelets via two-scale similarity transforms for rotating machinery fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Adaptive multiwavelets; Two-scale similarity transforms; Fault diagnosis	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET	Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is very important and critical to avoid serious accidents. However, the complex and non-stationary vibration signals with a large amount of noise make the fault detection to be challenging. especially at the early stage. Based on the inner product principle, fault detection using wavelet transforms is to match fault features most correlative to basis functions, and its effectiveness is determined by the construction and choice of wavelet basis function. In this paper, a new method based on adaptive multiwavelets via two-scale similarity transforms (TSTs) is proposed. Multiwavelets can offer multiple wavelet basis functions and so have the possibility of matching various fault features preferably. TSTs are simple and straightforward methods to design a series of new biorthogonal multiwavelets with some desirable properties. Using TSTs, a changeable and adaptive multiwavelet library is established so as to provide various ascendant multiple basis functions for inner product operation. By the rule of kurtosis maximization principle, optimal multiwavelets most similar to the fault features of a given signal are searched for. The applications to a rolling bearing of outer-race fault and a flue gas turbine unit of rub-impact fault show that the proposed method is an effective approach to detecting the impulse feature components hidden in vibration signals and performs well for rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

Use of autocorrelation of wavelet coefficients for fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Fault detection and diagnosis; Pattern recognition; Wavelet; Autocorrelation; Sinusoidal approximation; Mother wavelet; Daubechies; Gearbox; db44	GEARBOX; TRANSFORM; VIBRATION; SIGNAL; AMPLITUDE; HILBERT	This paper presents a novel time-frequency-based feature recognition system for gear fault diagnosis using autocorrelation of continuous wavelet coefficients (CWC). Furthermore, it introduces an original mathematical approximation of gearbox vibration signals which approximates sinusoidal components of noisy vibration signals generated from gearboxes, including incipient and serious gear failures using autocorrelation of CWC. First, the drawbacks of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) have been eliminated using autocorrelation function. Secondly, the autocorrelation of CWC is introduced as an original pattern for fault identification in machine condition monitoring. Thirdly, a sinusoidal summation function consisting of eight terms was used to approximate the periodic waveforms generated by autocorrelation of CWC for normal gearboxes (NGs) as well as occurrences of incipient and severe gear fault (e.g. slight-worn, medium-worn, and broken-tooth gears). In other words, the size of vibration signals can be reduced with minimal loss of significant frequency content by means of the sinusoidal approximation of generated autocorrelation waveforms of CWC as reported in this paper.

Intelligent condition-based prediction of machinery reliability	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Condition-based maintenance; Condition monitoring; Prognostics; Reliability; Suspended data	PROGNOSTICS; SYSTEM	The ability to forecast machinery failure is vital to reducing maintenance costs, operation downtime and safety hazards. Recent advances in condition monitoring technologies have given rise to a number of prognostic models that attempt to forecast machinery health based on condition data. This paper presents a novel approach for incorporating population characteristics information and suspended condition trending data of historical units into prognosis. The population characteristics information extracted from statistical failure distribution enables longer-range prognosis. The accurate modelling of suspended data is also found to be of great importance, since in practice machines are rarely allowed to run to failure and hence data are commonly suspended. The proposed model consists of a feed-forward neural network whose training targets are asset survival probabilities estimated using a variation of the Kaplan-Meier estimator and a degradation-based failure probability density function (PDF) estimator. The trained network is capable of estimating the future survival probabilities of an operating asset when a series of condition indices are inputted. The output survival probabilities collectively form an estimated survival curve. Pump vibration data were used for model validation. The proposed model was compared with two similar models that neglect suspended data, as well as with a conventional time series prediction model. The results support our hypothesis that the proposed model can predict more accurately and further ahead than similar methods that do not include population characteristics and/or suspended data in prognosis.

Damage identification in vibrating rotor-shaft systems by efficient sampling approach	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Rotor-shaft system; Dynamic diagnostics; Crack identification; Monte Carlo simulation; Coupled vibration analysis		In the paper a stochastic method for fault detection and identification in the shafts of rotating machines is proposed. This approach is based on the Monte Carlo simulations of rotor-shaft lateral-torsional-longitudinal vibrations mutually coupled by transverse cracks of various possible and randomly selected depths and locations on the shaft. For this purpose the structural hybrid model of a real faulty object is applied. This model is characterized by a high practical reliability and great computational efficiency, so important for many hundred thousand single numerical simulations necessary for a creation of the databases applied for inverse problem solution finally leading to crack identification. These databases are created with an arbitrary assumed probability densities of crack parameters which ensures appropriate spread of the dynamic responses of the considered faulty mechanical system. A sufficiently large database determined for the investigated object enable us to estimate almost immediately, i.e. within less than 1 s, the crack depth and axial position with identification errors not exceeding 9% and 5%, respectively. Thus, the proposed method seems to be a very convenient diagnostic tool for engineering applications in the industry. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

So in this paper, the cone-shaped kernel distributions (CKD) of vibration acceleration signals acquired from the cylinder head in eight different states of valve train were calculated and displayed in grey images. Meanwhile, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was used to decompose multivariate data, and neural network ensemble (NNE), which is of better generalization capability for classification than a single neural network, was used to perform intelligent diagnosis without further fault feature (such as eigenvalues or symptom parameters) extraction from time-frequency distributions. it is shown by the experimental results that the faults of diesel valve trains can be accurately classified by the proposed method.

The object of this research was to choose and to investigate the best oil for Dump Truck HD325-5, used for transportation of minerals, by oil condition monitoring. This was achieved by analysing different oil samples after use in Dump Truck HD325-5. The oil analyses were initially carried out at regular intervals during life. A series of tests were then conducted during the operating hours of the machine. Oil samples were regularly collected. Numerical data produced by oil analyses were compared with those from another sample in order to quantify the effectiveness of the results of oil condition monitoring technique. The results from this article have enhanced understanding on the dependent and independent roles of oil analyses in predicting which oil is more suitable for a machine in working condition.

In such a case, the problem should better be analyzed in hierarchical levels. At each level, some temporary solutions are obtained; then a suitable decision fusion technique is used to merge the temporary solutions for the next level. The hierarchical framework proposed in this study depends on reutilization or elimination of previous level local agents that together perform the decisions due to a decision-fusion technique: a performance criterion is set for local agents. The criterion checks the success of agents in their local regions. An agent satisfying this criterion is reutilized in the next level, whereas an agent not successful enough is removed from the agent pool in the next level. In place of a removed agent, a number of new local agents are developed. This framework is applied on a fault detection problem.

J	Wang, GF; Li, YB; Luo, ZG				Wang, Guo Feng; Li, Yu Bo; Luo, Zhi Gao			Fault classification of rolling bearing based on reconstructed phase space and Gaussian mixture model	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS	Rolling bearings are common and vital elements in rotating machinery and vibration signal is a kind of effective mean to characterize the status of rolling bearing fault and its severity. In this paper, a novel method is introduced to realize Classification of fault signal without extracting feature vector preliminarily. By estimating the time delay and embedding dimension of time series, vibration signal is reconstructed into phase space and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is established for every kind of fault signal in the reconstructed phase space. After these models are built, classification of fault signal is accomplished by computing the conditional likelihoods of the signal under each learned GMM model and selecting the model with the highest likelihood. By testifying of vibration signal under different kinds of bearing status, it is proved that this method is effective for classifying not Only fault types but also fault severity. Moreover, all parameters needed in this method could be obtained by analyzing the time series directly so it is very suitable for industry application. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A regularized pairwise multi-classification knowledge-based machine and applications	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Creativity and Innovation in Decision Making and Decision Support	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2006	London Sch Econ, London, ENGLAND		London Sch Econ	Knowledge-based model; Linear classification; Tikhonov regularization	SUPPORT; FLOW; PATTERNS	This paper presents a novel knowledge-based linear classification model for multi-category discrimination of sets or objects with prior knowledge. The prior knowledge is in the form of multiple polyhedral sets belonging to one or more categories or classes and it is introduced as additional constraints into the formulation of the Tikhonov linear least squares mttlti-class support vector machine model. The resulting formulation leads to a least squares problem that can be solved using matrix methods or iterative methods. Investigations include the development of a linear knowledge-based classification model extended to the case of multi-categorical discrimination and expressed as a single unconstrained optimization problem. Advantages of this formulation include explicit expressions for the classification weights of the classifier(s) and its ability to incorporate and handle prior knowledge directly to the classifiers. In addition it can provide fast solutions to the optimal classification weights for multi-categorical separation without the use of specialized solver-software. To evaluate the model, data and prior knowledge from the Wisconsin breast cancer prognosis and two-phase flow regimes ill pipes were used to train and test the proposed formulation.

J	Mao, YF; Qin, SR; Qin, Y				Mao Yongfang; Qin Shuren; Qin Yi			Demodulation Based on Harmonic Wavelet and Its Application into Rotary Machinery Fault Diagnosis	CHINESE JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						harmonic wavelet transform; time-frequency spectrum; demodulation; rotary machinery; fault diagnosis		The harmonic wavelet transform(HWT) and its fast realization based on fast Fourier transform(FFT) are introduced. Its ability to maintain the same amplitude-frequency feature is revealed. A new method to construct the time-frequency(TF) spectrum of HWT is proposed, which makes the HWT TF spectrum able to correctly reflect the time-frequency-amplitude distribution of the signal. A new way to calculate the HWT coefficients is proposed. By zero padding the data taken out, the non-decimated coefficients of HWT are obtained. Theoretical analysis shows that the modulus of the coefficients obtained by the new calculation way and living at a certain scale are the envelope of the component in the corresponding frequency band. By taking the cross section of the new TF spectrum, the demodulation for the component at a certain frequency band can be realized. A comparison with the Hilbert demodulation combined with band-pass filtering is done, which indicates for multi-components, the method proposed here is more suitable since it realizes ideal band-pass filtering and avoids pass band selecting. In the end, it is applied to hearing and gearbox fault diagnosis, and the results reflect that it can effectively extract the fault features in the signal.

Different coupling strategies to reconstruct a multi-class classifier from binary SVM classifiers are compared with application to fault diagnosis of transmission line. Majority voting, a mixture matrix and self-organizing map (SOM) network are compared in reconstructing the global classification decision. In order to evaluate the method's efficiency, one-against-all, decision directed acyclic graph (DDAG) and decision-tree (DT) algorithm based SVM are compared too. The comparison is done with Simulations and the best method is validated with experimental data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully employed to solve regression problem of nonlinearity and small sample. However, the practicability of SVM is effected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a new optimization method, which is motivated by social behaviour of organisms such as bird flocking and fish schooling. The method not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, the proposed PSO-SVM model is applied to forecast dissolved gases content in power transformer oil in this paper, among which PSO is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine. The experimental data from several electric power companies in China is used to illustrate the performance of proposed PSO-SVM model. The experimental results indicate that the PSO-SVM method can achieve greater forecasting accuracy than grey model, artificial neural network under the circumstances of small sample.

Application of two non-linear prediction tools to the estimation of tunnel boring machine performance	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Artificial neural networks; Non-linear multiple regression; Rock properties; TBM prognosis; Tunneling	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; UNIAXIAL COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; TBM PERFORMANCE; FUZZY MODEL; ROCK; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MODULUS; STRATEGIES	Predicting tunnel boring machine (TBM) performance is a crucial issue for the accomplishment of a mechanical tunnel project, excavating via full face tunneling machine. Many models and equations have previously been introduced to estimate TBM performance based on properties of both rock and machine employing various statistical analysis techniques. However, considering the nature of the problem, it is relatively difficult to estimate tunnel boring machine performance by linear prediction models. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and non-linear multiple regression models have great potential for establishing such prediction models. The purpose of the present study is the construction of non-linear multivariable prediction models to estimate TBM performance as a function of rock properties. For this purpose, rock properties and machine data were collected from recently completed TBM tunnel project in the City of New York, USA and consequently the database was established to develop performance prediction models utilizing the ANN and the non-linear multiple regression methods.

J	Lebaroud, A; Clerc, G				Lebaroud, A.; Clerc, G.			Accurate diagnosis of induction machine faults using optimal time-frequency representations	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Diagnosis; Induction motor; Time-frequency; Classification; Mahalanobis distance	CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a new diagnosis method of induction motor faults based on time-frequency classification of the current waveforms. This method is composed of two sequential processes: a feature extraction and a rule decision. In the process of feature extraction, the time-frequency representation (TFR) has been designed for maximizing the separability between classes representing different faults. The diagnosis is realised in two levels: the first one allows the detection of different faults-bearing fault, stator fault and rotor fault. The second one refines this detection by the determination of severity degree of faults, which are already identified on the previous level. The diagnosis is independent of the level of load. This method is validated on a 5.5 kW induction motor test bench. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An efficient condition-monitoring scheme is capable of providing warnings and predicting the faults at early stages. Usually, this task is executed by humans, but the logical progression of the condition-monitoring technologies is the automating the diagnosis process. To this end, intelligent diagnosis systems are used. Many researchers have explored artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose failures in general. However, all papers found in literature are related to a specific problem that can appear in many different machines. In real applications, when the expert analyzes a machine, not only one problem appears, but more than one problem may appear together. So, it is necessary to propose new methods to assist diagnosis, looking for a set of occurring faults. In this work, we describe methods to support motor pump failure diagnoses based on parametric net model and ANNs committees, and we propose methods to combine them. We describe a case study realized with a real dataset. The results obtained with these methods are encouraging.

The majority of these systems only produce bare predictions, without any indication of how reliable each of these predictions is. An indication of this kind however, is highly desirable especially in the medical field. In this paper we address this problem with the use of a recently developed technique, called conformal prediction, for accompanying the predictions of traditional machine learning algorithms with measures of their accuracy and reliability. We apply conformal prediction based on a Neural Network classifier to the problem of acute abdominal pain diagnosis and obtain predictions which have a high level of accuracy and are complemented with well-calibrated and practically useful confidence measures.

Thus, these two elements must be taken into account in order to provide a relevant diagnosis of these electrical systems. In this context, the paper presents a diagnosis method based on a multidimensional function and pattern recognition (PR). Traditional formalism of the PR method has been extended with some improvements such as the automatic choice of the feature space dimension or a "nonexclusive" decision rule based on the k-nearest neighbors. Thus, we introduce a new membership function, which takes into account the number of nearest neighbors as well as the distance from these neighbors with the sample to be classified. This approach is illustrated on a 5.5 kW inverter-fed asynchronous motor, in order to detect supply and motor faults. In this application, diagnostic features are only extracted from electrical measurements. Experimental results prove the efficiency of our diagnosis method.

The IGBT were subjected to thermal over-stress tests using a transistor test board until device latch-up. The collector-emitter current, transistor case temperature, transient and steady state gate voltages, and transient and steady state collector-emitter voltages were monitored in-situ during the test. Pre- and post-aging characterization tests were performed on the IGBT. The aged parts were observed to have shifts in capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements as a result or trapped charge in the gate oxide. The collector-emitter ON voltage V-CE(ON) showed a reduction with aging. The reduction in the V-CE(ON) was found to be correlated to die attach degradation, as observed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) analysis. The collector-emitter voltage, and transistor turn-off time were observed to be precursor parameters to latch-up. The monitoring of these precursor parameters will enable the development of a prognostic methodology for IGBT failure. The prognostic methodology will involve trending precursor data, and using physics of failure models for prediction of the remaining useful life of these devices.

J	Chan, JC; Tse, PW				Chan, Jeffery C.; Tse, Peter W.			A Novel, Fast, Reliable Data Transmission Algorithm for Wireless Machine Health Monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Data compression; empirical mode decomposition; machine health monitoring; wireless communication	HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ECG SIGNAL COMPRESSION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Vibration-based machine health monitoring is a well-known technique that is commonly used in machine fault diagnosis applications. In conjunction with existing wireless technologies, even machines that are operated in a hazardous or moveable environment can be monitored wirelessly. However, to facilitate a reliable machine health assessment, various sensory data, particularly the vibration signals, must be acquired at a high sampling rate, generating large packets of data. These requirements are impractical in a wireless data transmission context due to the usual low transmission rate, and lengthy transmission time. One possible solution is to compress the captured numerous sensory data before wireless transmission commences. This paper presents a novel data compression algorithm that combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM). EMD is effective in decomposing and identifying any instantaneous changes in non-linear, and non-stationary signals that are caused by anomalous operation of machines. After the data have been decomposed and compressed by EMD, the DPCM is applied to further compress the data through the use of linear predictor and quantizer prior to wireless transmission. A pair of Bluetooth based wireless devices was tailor-made to host the EMD and DPCM for performing wireless communication. The effectiveness of the new algorithm has been verified using real machines, operating in a noisy environment. The results prove that the algorithm provides much faster wireless data transmission by significantly reducing the size of sensory data. Nevertheless, it maintains the integrity of sensory data with negligible reconstruction error at the receiving end of the wireless device.

A Methodology for Determining the Return on Investment Associated With Prognostics and Health Management	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management	OCT 06-09, 2008	Denver, CO	IEEE		Avionics; cost modeling; electronics prognostics and health management; prognostics and health management; return on investment	PHM	Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) provides opportunities for lowering sustainment costs, improving maintenance decision-making, and providing product usage feedback into the product design and validation process. However, support for PHM is predicated on the articulation of clear business cases that quantify the expected cost and benefits of its implementation. The realization of PHM requires implementation at different levels of scale, and complexity. The maturity, robustness, and applicability of the underlying predictive algorithms impact the overall efficacy of PHM within an enterprise. The utility of PHM to inform decision-makers within tight scheduling constraints, and under different operational profiles likewise affects the cost avoidance that can be realized. This paper discusses the calculation of Return on Investment (ROI) for PHM activities, and presents a study conducted using a stochastic discrete event simulation model to determine the potential ROI offered by electronics PHM. The case study of a multifunctional display in a Boeing 737 compares the life cycle costs of a system employing unscheduled maintenance to the same system using a precursor to failure PHM approach.

J	Randall, RB				Randall, Robert B.			The Application of Fault Simulation to Machine Diagnostics and Prognostics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACOUSTICS AND VIBRATION			English	Article							VIBRATION; MODEL; GEAR	The early development of machine diagnostics and condition monitoring was based on measurements from actual failures, but these cannot be predicted or arranged to occur when and where desired. In recent years it has become possible to make simulation models of a machine, such as a gearbox or engine, including the simulation of various faults of different types, severity, and location. There are a number of benefits from doing this, the first being to be able to produce sufficient representative signals to train automated fault recognition algorithms, such as artificial neural networks, as it is not economically viable to experience the number of actual failures required. Being able to produce signals from faults of different sizes and locations can be useful in the development of diagnostic and prognostic procedures the latter, for example, by being able to develop appropriate trend parameters. Finally, the effects of faults in complex machines are often based on nonlinear interactions, which are difficult to foresee, and the simulation modelling of the whole machine can be very useful to obtain a physical understanding of these complex interactions. This paper illustrates these principles using examples of rolling element bearings, gears, geared systems (including bearings), and internal combustion engines, with favourable results in all aspects.

Feature Extraction for the Prognosis of Electromechanical Faults in Electrical Machines through the DWT	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						electric machines; fault diagnosis; wavelet transform; broken bars; eccentricities	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; INDUCTION MACHINES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; FAILURES	Recognition of characteristic patterns is proposed in this paper in order to diagnose the presence of electromechanical faults in induction electrical machines. Two common faults are considered; broken rotor bars and mixed eccentricities. The presence of these faults leads to the appearance of frequency components following a very characteristic evolution during the startup transient. The identification and extraction of these characteristic patterns through the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) have been proven to be a reliable methodology for diagnosing the presence of these faults, showing certain advantages in comparison with the classical FFT analysis of the steady-state current. In the paper, a compilation of healthy and faulty cases are presented; they confirm the validity of the approach for the correct diagnosis of a wide range of electromechanical faults.

Wavelet analysis has been the most important non-stationary signal processing tool today, and popular in machining sensor signal analysis. Based on the nature of monitored signals, wavelet approaches are introduced and the superiorities of wavelet analysis to Fourier methods are discussed for TCM. According to the multiresolution, sparsity and localization properties of wavelet transform, literatures are reviewed in five categories in TCM: time-frequency analysis of machining signal, signal denoising, feature extraction, singularity analysis for tool state estimation, and density estimation for tool wear classification. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the current work on wavelet approaches to TCM and also proposes two new prospects for future studies in this area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, various faults can Occur, such as stator short-circuits and rotor failures. Traditionally the diagnosis machine is done through a sinusoidal power supply, in the present paper we study experimentally the effects of the rotor failures, Such as broken rotor bars in function of the ac supplying, the load and show the impact of the converter from diagnosis of the machine. The technique diagnosis used is based on the spectral analysis of stator Currents or stator voltages respectively according to the types of induction motor ac supplying. So, four different ac supplying are considered: the IM is directly by the balanced three-phase network voltage source, the IM is fed by a Sinusoidal current source given the controlled by hysteresis, the IM is fed (in open loop) by a scalar control imposing through ratio V/f=constant, the IM is controlled through a vector control using space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) technique inverter with an Outer speed loop.

J	Nugent, C; Doyle, D; Cunningham, P				Nugent, Conor; Doyle, Donal; Cunningham, Padraig			Gaining insight through case-based explanation	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Case-based explanation	LOCAL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; ORIENTED RETRIEVAL; CONFIDENCE; PROGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Traditional explanation strategies in machine learning have been dominated by rule and decision tree based approaches. Case-based explanations represent an alternative approach which has inherent advantages in terms of transparency and user acceptability. Case-based explanations are based on a strategy of presenting similar past examples in support of and as justification for recommendations made. The traditional approach to such explanations, of simply supplying the nearest neighbour as an explanation, has been found to have shortcomings. Cases should be selected based on their utility in forming useful explanations. However, the relevance of the explanation case may not be clear to the end user as it is retrieved using domain knowledge which they themselves may not have. In this paper the focus is on a knowledge-light approach to case-based explanations that works by selecting cases based on explanation utility and offering insights into the effects of feature-value differences. In this paper we examine to two such a knowledge-light frameworks for case-based explanation. We look at explanation oriented retrieval (EOR) a strategy which explicitly models explanation utility and also at the knowledge-light explanation framework (KLEF) that uses local logistic regression to support case-based explanation.

A real-time print-defect detection system for web offset printing	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Web offset; Color image; Web printing; Non-uniformities; Defect identification; Correlation		This paper presents a detailed description of a vision system developed to detect and locate the non-uniformities that appear on the web offset printing machine. Specifically, the system is capable of monitoring the high-speed web offset printing in a real-time environment and alerting the operator of any events (e.g., structural faults, color variations, missing characters, ink splashes, streaks, etc.) that disrupt the uniformities in the web offset printing. Such events are thought to affect crucial printing properties, resulting in non-uniformities in printing and impacting its quality and printability. This paper describes the vision system in terms of its hardware modules, as well as the image processing algorithms that it utilizes to scan the color images and locate areas of defect from the printing web. Basically, the system utilizes high-speed image scanning algorithms to detect edges and boundaries using linear and non-linear filters of dynamic size, threshold and transformation for further analysis. In addition to being tested in a laboratory environment, a prototype of this system was constructed and deployed to a web printing system, where its performance was evaluated under realistic conditions. The system was installed on a Flexo gravure-print-press machine for testing, and it was found that the vision system was able to successfully monitor and detect non-uniformities.

J	Bozchalooi, IS; Liang, M				Bozchalooi, I. Soltani; Liang, Ming			Parameter-free bearing fault detection based on maximum likelihood estimation and differentiation	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						bearing fault detection; high-frequency resonance; maximum likelihood estimation; differencing; signal to interference ratio	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; WAVELET FILTER; PROGNOSTICS; DIAGNOSIS; AMPLITUDE	Bearing faults can lead to malfunction and ultimately complete stall of many machines. The conventional high-frequency resonance (HFR) method has been commonly used for bearing fault detection. However, it is often very difficult to obtain and calibrate bandpass filter parameters, i.e. the center frequency and bandwidth, the key to the success of the HFR method. This inevitably undermines the usefulness of the conventional HFR technique. To avoid such difficulties, we propose parameter-free, versatile yet straightforward techniques to detect bearing faults. We focus on two types of measured signals frequently encountered in practice: (1) a mixture of impulsive faulty bearing vibrations and intrinsic background noise and (2) impulsive faulty bearing vibrations blended with intrinsic background noise and vibration interferences. To design a proper signal processing technique for each case, we analyze the effects of intrinsic background noise and vibration interferences on amplitude demodulation. For the first case, a maximum likelihood-based fault detection method is proposed to accommodate the Rician distribution of the amplitude-demodulated signal mixture. For the second case, we first illustrate that the high-amplitude low-frequency vibration interferences can make the amplitude demodulation ineffective. Then we propose a differentiation method to enhance the fault detectability. It is shown that the iterative application of a differentiation step can boost the relative strength of the impulsive faulty bearing signal component with respect to the vibration interferences. This preserves the effectiveness of amplitude demodulation and hence leads to more accurate fault detection. The proposed approaches are evaluated on simulated signals and experimental data acquired from faulty bearings.	[Bozchalooi, I.

Computer-aided evaluation of neuroblastoma on whole-slide histology images: Classifying grade of neuroblastic differentiation	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Quantitative image analysis; Microscopy images; Neuroblastoma prognosis; Grade of differentiation; Multi-resolution pathological image analysis; Machine learning	TUMORS	Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most frequently occurring cancerous tumors in children. The current grading evaluations for patients with this disease require pathologists to identify certain morphological characteristics with microscopic examinations of tumor tissues. Thanks to the advent of modern digital scanners, it is now feasible to scan cross-section tissue specimens and acquire whole-slide digital images. As a result, computerized analysis of these images can generate key quantifiable parameters and assist pathologists with grading evaluations. In this study, image analysis techniques are applied to histological images of haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides for identifying image regions associated with different pathological components. Texture features derived from segmented components of tissues are extracted and processed by an automated classifier group trained with sample images with different grades of neuroblastic differentiation in a multi-resolution framework. The trained classification system is tested on 33 whole-slide tumor images. The resulting whole-slide classification accuracy produced by the computerized system is 87.88%. Therefore, the developed system is a promising tool to facilitate grading whole-slide images of NB biopsies with high throughput. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multifractal features of vibration signals obtained from machine state monitoring are extracted by multifractal spectrum analysis and generalized fractal dimensions. Considering the situation of mass samples of normal mechanical running state and few fault states, the feature parameters corresponding to different mechanical running states are further optimized by a statistical method, based on which incipient faults are subsequently identified and diagnosed accurately. Experimental results proved that the method combining multifractal theory and MTS can be used for incipient fault state recognition effectively during the mechanical running process, and the accuracy of fault state identification is improved.

The early detection of faults like fatigue cracks in rotor shafts are very important to prevent catastrophic failure of the rotor system. Vibration monitoring during start up or shut-down is as important as during steady state operation to detect cracks especially for machines such as aircraft engines which start and stop quite frequently and run at high speeds. So, the transient data of the cracked rotor has been transformed using the wavelet transforms for crack detection. Most of the works quoted in the literature used 1D wavelets or 2D wavelets (Continuous Wavelet Transform-CWT) for crack detection. The crack detectors in the signals are both time as well as frequency dependent. So, the use of 2D wavelets is also not enough to detect the crack. In the present work a 3D wavelet (CWT) has been utilized which clearly indicates both the time and frequency features of the crack. The presence of sub-criticals in the CWT may be a best crack indicator but it is not always reliable. The addition of noise to the signal may sometimes lead to inaccurate results. So, there is a need to identify a parameter in addition to the sub-criticals. The phase angle between the two signals (cracked and un-cracked) or two transverse vibrations can be a better crack indicator because it is very less sensitive to noise disturbance. So, to extract the above phase angle a new transform has been applied called Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT). The XWT is exploited for the first time to a rotor fault detection system in the present work. Some interesting results have been obtained using the same. The advantage of the XWT is that both, the phase angles between the transverse signals and also the amplitudes of sub-criticals are viewed in a single plot. Parametric analysis is also carried out by varying crack depth and crack position for diagnostic purposes. The inverse problem of crack identification (i.e. determining the crack parameters through known vibration data) has also been carried out using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

A particle-filtering approach for on-line fault diagnosis and failure prognosis	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						failure prognosis; fault detection; fault identification; particle filtering		This paper introduces an on-line particle-filtering (PF)-based framework for fault diagnosis and failure prognosis in non-linear, non-Gaussian systems. This framework considers the implementation of two autonomous modules. A fault detection and identification (FDI) module uses a hybrid state-space model of the plant and a PF algorithm to estimate the state probability density function (pdf) of the system and calculates the probability of a fault Condition in real-time. Once the anomalous condition is detected, the available state pdf estimates are used as initial conditions in prognostic routines. The failure prognostic module, on the other hand, predicts the evolution in time of the fault indicator and computes the pdf of the remaining useful life (RUL) of the faulty subsystem, using a non-linear state-space model (with unknown time-varying parameters) and a PF algorithm that updates the current state estimate. The Outcome of the prognosis module provides information about the precision and accuracy of long-term predictions, RUL expectations and 95% confidence intervals for the condition under study. Data from a seeded fault test for a UH-60 planetary gear plate are used to validate the proposed approach.

However, designing in engine fault diagnostic system with the desired performance is a challenging task, because of several characteristics associated with aircraft engines. Geared towards achieving the highest possible performance of fault diagnosis, this paper explores strategies on improving diagnosis performance. Specifically, we introduce flight regime mapping and a two-level multiple classifier system as mean,, to improve classification performance. By designing a real-world aircraft fault diagnostic system, we demonstrate that the strategies adopted in this Study are effective in improving the performance of aircraft engine fault diagnostic systems.

J	Saha, B; Goebel, K; Christophersen, J				Saha, Bhaskar; Goebel, Kai; Christophersen, Jon			Comparison of prognostic algorithms for estimating remaining useful life of batteries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL			English	Article						autoregressive integrated moving average; battery prognostics; extended Kalman filtering; particle filter; relevance vector machine; remaining useful life; uncertainty management	LEAD-ACID-BATTERIES; STATE-OF-CHARGE; HEALTH	The estimation of remaining useful life (RUL) of a faulty component is at the centre of system prognostics and health management. It gives operators a potent tool in decision making by quantifying how much time is left Until functionality is lost. RUL prediction needs to contend with multiple sources of errors, like modelling inconsistencies, system noise and degraded sensor fidelity, which leads to unsatisfactory performance from classical techniques like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and extended Kalman filtering (EKF). The Bayesian theory of uncertainty management provides a way to contain these problems. The relevance vector machine (RVM), the Bayesian treatment of the well known support vector machine (SVM), a kernel-based regression/classification technique, is Used for model development. This model is incorporated into a particle filter (PF) framework, where statistical estimates of noise and anticipated operational conditions are used to provide estimates of RUL in the form of a probability density function (pdf). We present here a comparative study of the above-mentioned approaches on experimental data collected from Li-ion batteries. Batteries were chosen as an example of a complex system whose internal state variables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure under operational conditions. In addition, battery performance is strongly influenced by ambient environmental and load conditions.

PoF is an approach that utilizes knowledge of a product's life cycle loading and failure mechanisms to perform reliability design and assessment. PoF-based prognostics permit the assessment of product reliability under its actual application conditions. It integrates sensor data with models that enable in situ assessment of the deviation or degradation of a product from an expected normal operating condition (ie, the product's 'health') and the prediction of the future state of reliability. A formal implementation procedure, which includes failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis, data reduction and feature extraction from the life cycle loads, damage accumulation, and assessment of uncertainty, is presented. Then, applications of PoF-based prognostics are discussed.

J	Karacay, T; Akturk, N				Karacay, Tuncay; Akturk, Nizami			Experimental diagnostics of ball bearings using statistical and spectral methods	TRIBOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Vibrations; Ball bearing; Condition monitoring; Spectral analysis; Defects	ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARING; VIBRATION; MACHINERY; DEFECTS; PROGNOSTICS	Vibration measurements and signal analysis is widely used for condition monitoring of ball bearings as their vibration signature reveals important information about the defect development within them. Time domain analysis of vibration signature such as peak-to-peak amplitude, root mean square, Crest factor and kurtosis indicates defects in ball bearings. However, these measures do not specify the position and/or nature of the defects. Each defect produces characteristic vibrations in ball bearings. Hence, examining the vibration spectrum may deliver information on the type of defects. In this paper a test rig is designed and a pair of brand new commercial ball bearings is installed. The bearings run throughout their lifespan under constant speed and loading conditions. Vibration signatures produced are recorded and statistical measures are calculated during the test. When anomalies are detected in the statistical measures, vibration spectra are obtained and examined to determine where the defect is on the running surfaces.

These random changes ill the measured signal may be due to the random vibrations that call be related to the health of the machine for some faults such as dry bearing fault or bearing ageing. The presence of dry bearing fault, which is caused by the lack of lubricant, increases the level of random vibrations as compared to those obtained in healthy bearing machine. If these random vibrations could be isolated from the measured signal, useful information about bearing health may be obtained. Therefore, in this paper, signals (three line to line voltages, three currents, two vibration Signals, four temperatures and one speed signal) obtained from the monitoring system are treated and analyzed using wavelet transform to correlate it to the dry bearing faults in induction machine. In this study, on-line analysis of the acquired signals has been performed Using C(++), while MATLAB has been used to perform the off-line analysis. (c) 009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At first, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to detect a discontinuity of currents due to the fault, and then the features for fault diagnosis are extracted. Next, these features are employed as inputs for the SVM training. After training, the SVM produces an optimized boundary which is used identifying the fault. Finally, the fault classification is performed online with instantaneous features. The experimental results have verified the validity of the proposed estimation algorithm.

J	Magro, MC; Pinceti, P				Magro, Micaela Caserza; Pinceti, Paolo			A confirmation technique for predictive maintenance using the Rough Set Theory	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Predictive maintenance; Rough Set Theory; Intelligent field device; Data mining; Knowledge discovery in database	DISCRETIZATION	This paper presents a technique to improve the accuracy of the predictions obtained using the Rough Set Theory (RST) in non-deterministic cases (rough cases). The RST is here applied to the data collected by the Intelligent Field Devices for identifying predictive diagnostic algorithms for machinery, plants, subsystems, or components. The data analysis starts from a historical data set recorded from the field instruments, and its final result is a set of "if-then" rules identifying predictive maintenance functions. These functions may be used to predict if a component is going to fail or not in the next future. The prediction is obtained by applying the rules extracted with the RST algorithm on the real-time values transmitted by the field device. It may happen that some diagnoses are uncertain, in the sense that it is not possible to take a certain decision (device sound or close to fail) with a given set of data. In this paper, a new algorithm for increasing the confidence in these uncertain cases is presented. To show an example, the proposed confirmation algorithm is applied to the predictive algorithms obtained for an intelligent pressure transmitter. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An improved model of induction motors for diagnosis purposes - Slot skewing effect and air-gap eccentricity faults	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Induction motor; MWFA; Space harmonics; Skew; Axial air-gap eccentricity; Diagnostic	PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; ROTOR SLOT; MACHINES; STATOR; EXTENSION	This paper describes an improved method for the modeling of axial and radial eccentricities in induction motors (IM). The model is based on an extension of the modified winding function approach (MWFA) which allows for all harmonics of the magnetomotive force (MMF) to be taken into account. It is shown that a plane view of IM gets easily the motor inductances and reduces considerably the calculation process. The described technique includes accurately the slot skewing effect and leads to pure analytical expressions of the inductances in case of radial eccentricity. in order to model the static, dynamic or mixed axial eccentricity, three suitable alternatives are explained. Unlike the previous proposals, the discussed alternatives take into account all the harmonics of the inverse of air-gap function without any development in Fourier series. Simulation results as well as experimental verifications prove the usefulness and the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ghoggal, A.; Zouzou, S.

The proposed method considers the effect of negative samples, which should be rejected by positive class, to the SVDD classifier. Firstly, we compute weights of training samples to the given positive class using the kernel PCM algorithm. Then according to weights, we select some meaning samples to construct a new training set, and train these samples with the proposed weighted SVDD algorithm.

Induction machine fault detection using clone selection programming	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Clone selection principle; Programming; Immune system; Classification; Induction machine fault detection	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; DISCOVERY; DESIGN; MODELS	A clonal selection programming (CSP)-based fault detection system is developed for performing induction machine fault detection and analysis. Four feature vectors are extracted from power spectra of machine vibration signals. The extracted features are inputs of an CSP-based classifier for fault identification and classification. In this paper, the proposed CSP-based machine fault diagnostic system has been intensively tested with unbalanced electrical faults and mechanical faults operating at different rotating speeds. The proposed system is not only able to detect electrical and mechanical faults correctly, but the rules generated is also very simple and compact and is easy for people to understand, This will be proved to be extremely useful for practical industrial applications.

J	Ananda, CM				Ananda, C. M.			General Aviation Aircraft Avionics: Integration & System Tests	IEEE AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article	26th Digital Avionics Systems Conference	OCT 21-25, 2007	Dallas, TX	IEEE, AIAA				The avionics of current-day aircraft is termed as modular integrated full glass cockpit. Unlike lots of dials and gauges, the pilot will interact with Multi-Function Displays (MFD). This means that the systems are coupled with multi-function displays, communication and navigation radios with control units, multi-mode interactive instruments for control and navigation, recording and fault management systems, airframes and health monitoring diagnostic capabilities. Pilot Vehicle Interface (PVI) is an important measure of good avionics and cockpit layout, which implies the optimization of man-machine interface, enhancement of the economy, and safety of flight operations. This presents the avionics architecture of a 14-seat Light Transport Aircraft (LTA) for general aviation, which has multi-role commuter capabilities. LTA is a twin turbo-prop, multi-role aircraft, with air taxi and commuter services as its primary roles. The avionics is built on the digital communication mode for both command and control with current requirements of TCAS, digital Autopilot, and AMLCD multi-purpose glass displays. The LTA Avionics suite is grouped into six major groups based on functionality: Display System, Communication System, Navigation System, Recording System, Radar System, and Engine instruments and other cockpit displays. This paper also covers details about the extensive tests carried out to prove the avionics design in terms of functionality, inter-operability, interference, and compatibility. Various practical integration,and flight-test issues, methodologies, and details of the scenarios is presented herein.

J	Neti, P; Nandi, S				Neti, Prabhakar; Nandi, Subhasis			Stator Interturn Fault Detection of Synchronous Machines Using Field Current and Rotor Search-Coil Voltage Signature Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society	OCT 08-12, 2006	Tampa, FL	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Interturn fault; modified winding function approach (MWFA); synchronous motor; winding function approach (WFA)	AIR-GAP ECCENTRICITY; INDUCTION MACHINES	Our recent observations suggested that harmonics in the field current are very promising to detect stator interturn faults in synchronous machines. So far, an increase in some of the even harmonics in the field current has been reported to detect such faults. However, no explanation has been provided for the cause of these harmonics. Moreover, the even harmonics can significantly increase with supply unbalance as well as time harmonics, which can lead to a serious confusion. Hence, in this study, an in-depth investigation was conducted to determine the origin of various harmonic components in the field current and their feasibility to detect stator faults. It was found that, owing to structural asymmetries of the field winding, some of these components clearly increased with stator interturn fault. The findings are helpful to detect faults involving few turns without ambiguity, in spite of the presence of supply unbalance and time harmonics. Both simulation and experimental results are presented in this paper. The diagnosis results have also been verified using a rotor-mounted search coil, which can also be used to detect even a one-turn stator fault very effectively.

J	Kim, T; Lee, HW; Kwak, S				Kim, Taehyung; Lee, Hyung-Woo; Kwak, Sangshin			The Internal Fault Analysis of Brushless DC Motors Based on the Winding Function Theory	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article						Brushless dc (BLDC) motor; internal fault; winding function	SHORT CIRCUITS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; LOCATION	This paper presents a new approach to analyze the stator inter-turn fault of a brushless de motor. It is essential to analyze the behavior of the machine under internal faults and design appropriate protection systems to avoid expensive failures that might occur to the machine in the near future. The winding functions and inductance change of stator windings under internal faults are explained in detail, and the informative simulation results, based on the winding function theory, are provided to analyze a current's abnormalities and torque pulsation under turn-to-turn faults. To verify the proposed analysis, the stator current, back-electromotive force, and resultant torque waveforms for both healthy and faulty machines are presented, utilizing both the finite-element method (FEM) and computer simulation based on dynamic equations.

Hierarchical Test Sequencing for Complex Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						Hierarchical test sequencing; manufacturing systems; semiconductor manufacturing industry; Tangram; test strategy	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Testing complex systems, such as the ASML TWINSCAN lithographic machine, is expensive and time consuming. In a previous work, a test sequencing method to calculate time-optimal test sequences has been developed. Because complex systems are composed of several subsystems, which are again composed of several modules, there exists a need to hierarchically model test sequencing problems. Such a hierarchical test sequencing problem consists of a high-level model that describes a test sequencing problem at the system level, and one or more low-level models that describe the test sequencing problems at the subsystem or module level. The tests at the system level correspond to the solutions of low-level problems. This paper describes a hierarchical test sequencing model and proposes two algorithms to compute an optimal test sequence. The benefits of hierarchically modeling a problem are less computational effort and less modeling effort, because not all relations are needed. This is illustrated by a small example. The industrial relevance of this method is illustrated on a case study related to a manufacturing testing phase of a lithographic machine.	[Boumen, R.; de Jong, I. S.

J	Yu, G; Li, CN; Kamarthi, S				Yu, Gang; Li, Changning; Kamarthi, Sagar			Machine fault diagnosis using a cluster-based wavelet feature extraction and probabilistic neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Wavelet; Feature extraction; Probabilistic neural networks	TRANSFORM; STATE	In this paper, a cluster-based feature extraction from the coefficients of a discrete wavelet transform and probabilistic neural networks are proposed for machine fault diagnosis. The proposed approach first divides the matrix of wavelet coefficients into clusters, which are centered around the discriminative coefficient positions identified by an unsupervised procedure, based on the entropy value of coefficients from a set of representative signals. The features that contain the informative attributes of the signals are computed from the energy content of the obtained clusters. Then, machine faults are diagnosed based on these feature vectors using a probabilistic neural network. The experimental results from the application on bearing fault diagnosis have shown that the proposed approach is able to effectively extract important intrinsic information content of the test signals and increase the overall fault diagnostic accuracy, as compared to conventional methods.

With those techniques, the working conditions of components, the trending of fault propagation, and the time-to-failure are precisely forecasted before they reach the failure thresholds. In this work, we propose the least square regression tree (LSRT) approach, which is an extension of the classification and regression tree (CART), in association with one-step-ahead prediction of time-series forecasting techniques to predict the future machine condition. In this technique, the number of available observations is first determined by using Cao's method and LSRT is employed as a prediction model in the next step. The proposed approach is evaluated by real data of a low methane compressor. Furthermore, a comparative study of the predicted results obtained from CART and LSRT are carried out to prove the accuracy. The predicted results show that LSRT offers the potential for machine condition prognosis.

Measurement and analysis of needle penetration forces in industrial high-speed sewing machine	JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE			English	Article						sewing; needle penetration; sewability; sewing parameters; monitoring; defect detection		This paper presents a system that allows the measurement of parameters of needle penetration during high-speed sewing. The system has been developed as a tool for analysis of the most important mechanical effects occurring during high-speed sewing. It allows the measurement of several sewing process variables, namely the needle penetration and withdrawal forces. The objective of this work is the development of real-time control and monitoring devices, as well as offline process planning tools for industrial sewing. The evaluation of needle penetration forces is a particularly critical aspect. A fault-free needle penetration depends mainly on the material's properties and needle choice. Needle penetration force is one of the variables whose measurement is important for the pre-screening analysis of quality problems ('sewability testing') and for real-time quality monitoring. This article describes the experimental results obtained and discusses potential applications in process planning tools and monitoring devices.

Detection of signal transients based on wavelet and statistics for machine fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Transients; Continuous wavelet transform; K-S test; Gear; Bearing; Fault diagnosis	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; GEAR; EXTRACTION	This paper presents a transient detection method that combines continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for machine fault diagnosis. According to this method, the CWT represents the signal in the time-scale plane, and the proposed "step-by-step detection" based on K-S test identifies the transient coefficients. Simulation study shows that the transient feature can be effectively identified in the time-scale plane with the K-S test. Moreover, the transients can be further transformed back into the time domain through the inverse CWT. The proposed method is then utilized in the gearbox vibration transient detection for fault diagnosis, and the results show that the transient features both expressed in the time-scale plane and reconstructed in the time domain characterize the gearbox condition and fault severity development more clearly than the original time domain signal. The proposed method is also applied to the vibration signals of cone bearings with the localized fault in the inner race, outer race and the rolling elements, respectively. The detected transients indicate not only the existence of the bearing faults, but also the information about the fault severity to a certain degree. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Output-only stochastic identification of a time-varying structure via functional series TARMA models	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Time-varying structures; Non-stationary vibration; Stochastic identification; Time-dependent ARMA models; Time-frequency representations; Structural identification; Modal identification	EARTHQUAKE GROUND MOTION; NONSTATIONARY SIGNALS; NATURAL FREQUENCIES; VIBRATION SIGNALS; FAULT-DETECTION; PART II; SYSTEMS; MACHINES	The problem of output-only stochastic identification of a Time-Varying (TV) laboratory structure is considered for the first time via a Functional Series Time-Dependent AutoRegressive Moving Average (FS-TARMA) approach. The approach is based on the modelling of a single non-stationary vibration response via a non-stationary parametric FS-TARMA model. The steps and facets of the identification procedure are presented, and the obtained model is used for structural characteristics recovery and vibration signal analysis. For purposes of comparison, multiple "frozen-configuration" stationary experiments are also carried out and a sequence of "frozen" stationary models are identified. The results of the study demonstrate the applicability, effectiveness, and high accuracy of the non-stationary FS-TARMA approach in capturing and analyzing the TV structural dynamics.

J	Wang, W; Kanneg, D				Wang, Wilson; Kanneg, Derek			An integrated classifier for gear system monitoring	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Integrated classifier; Neural fuzzy classifier; Fault diagnosis; Multi-step forecasting; Gear systems	FUZZY; NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS	A novel integrated classifier has been developed in this paper for real-time machinery health condition monitoring, specifically for gear systems. The diagnostic classification is performed by a neural fuzzy scheme; the diagnostic reliability is enhanced by integrating the (multi-step-ahead) future states of the dynamic system. An online hybrid training technique is adopted based on recursive Levenberg-Marquet and least-squares estimate (LSE) algorithms to improve the classifier convergence and adaptive capability to accommodate different machinery conditions. The viability of this new monitoring system is verified by experimental tests under different gear conditions. Test results show that the proposed integrated classifier provides a robust problem solving framework; it outperforms other related data-driven classification schemes, because of its efficient feature enhancement, formation integration, and system training. Furthermore, the integrated classifier has been implemented for condition monitoring in multistage printing machines; its effectiveness is verified by some primary application practices.

J	Lei, YG; He, ZJ; Zi, YY				Lei, Yaguo; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang			Application of the EEMD method to rotor fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Ensemble empirical mode decomposition; Empirical mode decomposition; Intrinsic mode function; Rotating machinery; Fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT SPECTRUM; EMD	Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a self-adaptive analysis method for nonlinear and non-stationary signals. It may decompose a complicated signal into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the local characteristic time scale of the signal. The EMD method has attracted considerable attention and been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery recently. However, it cannot reveal the signal characteristic information accurately because of the problem of mode mixing. To alleviate the mode mixing problem occurring in EMD, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is presented. With EEMD, the components with truly physical meaning can be extracted from the signal. Utilizing the advantage of EEMD, this paper proposes a new EEMD-based method for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. First, a simulation signal is used to test the performance of the method based on EEMD. Then, the proposed method is applied to rub-impact fault diagnosis of a power generator and early rub-impact fault diagnosis of a heavy oil catalytic cracking machine set. Finally, by comparing its application results with those of the EMD method, the superiority of the proposed method based on EEMD is demonstrated in extracting fault characteristic information of rotating machinery.

J	Eltabach, M; Antoni, J; Shanina, G; Sieg-Zieba, S; Carniel, X				Eltabach, Mario; Antoni, Jerome; Shanina, Galyna; Sieg-Zieba, Sophie; Carniel, Xavier			Broken rotor bars detection by a new non-invasive diagnostic procedure	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Non-invasive diagnostic; Broken rotor bars detection; Induction motor fault signatures; Signal processing; Rotating machinery	3-PHASE INDUCTION-MOTORS; CAGE FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS	A new technique of diagnosing data for broken rotor bars in induction motors derived from two of the three stator currents, the Beirut diagnostic procedure (BDP) is presented in this paper. The theoretical principles directly related to the application of this diagnostic technique are described, emphasizing the use of a severity factor in order to evaluate the extension of the fault. Defining the severity factor as the normalized amplitude of the fault characteristic frequency enables us to draw up a table of comparison of several usual electric diagnostic methods. Besides the traditional one-phase current spectrum analysis, values of the severity factor related to electrical signals like the instantaneous powers, the current space vector modulus and finally related to the new Beirut diagnostic method are analyzed with respect to the variation of the power factor angle and of the sum of the two current side-band angular displacement. The BDP offers several advantages over the usual motor current signature analyses (MCSA) methods: it is shown how the proposed severity factor applied to the new diagnostic technique is not dependent on motor parameters such as the power factor angle and the fault type which is not the case of the instantaneous powers. In addition, the BDP has the advantage of detecting easily fault characteristic frequencies, which is not possible via diagnostic methods that use the detection of two side-band components as in the simple current spectrum. By theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and laboratory experiments, it is shown that the new method enhances the reliability of diagnostics of broken rotor bars in induction motor.

J	Wang, HQ; Chen, P				Wang, Huaqing; Chen, Peng			Intelligent diagnosis method for a centrifugal pump using features of vibration signals	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intelligent diagnosis; Neural network; Rough sets; Wavelet transform; Vibration signal; Centrifugal pump	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SYSTEMS; FUZZY	In the field of machinery diagnosis, the utilization of vibration signals is effective in the detection of fault, because the signals carry dynamic information about the machine state. However, knowledge of a distinguishing fault is ambiguous because definite relationships between symptoms and fault types cannot be easily identified. This paper presents an intelligent diagnosis method for a centrifugal pump system using features of vibration signals at an early stage. The diagnosis algorithm is derived using wavelet transform, rough sets and a partially linearized neural network (PNN). ReverseBior wavelet function is used to extract fault features from measured vibration signals and to capture hidden fault information across optimum frequency regions. As the input parameters for the neural network, the non-dimensional symptom parameters that can reflect the characteristics of a signal are defined in the amplitude domain. The diagnosis knowledge for the training of the PNN can be acquired by using the rough sets. We also propose a diagnosis method based on the PNN, one which can deal with the ambiguity problem of condition diagnosis, and distinguish fault types on the basis of the possibility distributions of symptom parameters automatically. The decision method of optimum frequency region for extracting feature signals is also discussed using real plant data. Practical examples of diagnosis for a centrifugal pump system are shown in order to verify the efficiency of the method.

Exploring effective indices is crucial for it. In this study, rolling element bearing has been taken as a research object, spectral entropy is proposed to be as a complementary index for its performance degradation assessment, and its accelerated life test has been performed to collect vibration data over a whole lifetime (normal-fault-failure). Results of both simulation and experiment show that spectral entropy is an effective complementary index.	[Pan, Y.

J	He, ZJ; Cao, HR; Li, Z; Zi, YY; Chen, XF				He ZhengJia; Cao HongRui; Li Zhen; Zi YanYang; Chen XueFeng			The principle of second generation wavelet for milling cutter breakage detection	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES E-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						SGW; inner product algorithm; cutter breakage; machining quality	TOOL-BREAKAGE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; LIFTING SCHEME; TRANSFORM	Performance degradation or failure of manufacturing equipment will badly influence machining quality. Because of discontinuousness of the milling process, dynamic signals produced in the milling process become non-stationary. This paper indicates that the essence of SGW (second generation wavelet) transform in non-stationary signal processing is the mathematics principle of inner product transform of a dynamic signal with basis functions. Namely, by means of the inner product operation of a signal with basis functions containing scale function and wavelet function, signal decomposition and reconstruction are obtained. Acoustic emission signals generated in the milling processes of a CNC machine were analyzed by using the basis functions of SGW which are oscillation, decay and compact support. The features of end milling cutter breakage have been extracted, and the influences on machining surface quality have been identified effectively, which provide scientific bases for fault diagnosis, error tracing and quality control.

The following study was performed to assess the differences in the post-operative recovery of autonomic regulation after mitral valve (MV) and aortic valve (AV) surgery with a heart lung machine. Among the 43 consecutive male patients enrolled in a prospective study, 26 underwent isolated AV surgery and 17 isolated MV surgery. Blood pressure as well as ECG signals were recorded the day before, 24 hours after and one week after surgery. BRS was calculated according to the dual sequence method, and HRV was calculated using standard linear as well as nonlinear parameters. There were no major differences between the two groups in the pre-operative values. At 24 hours a comparable depression of HRV and BRS in both groups was observed, while at 7 days there was partial recovery in AV patients, which was absent in MV patients: p(AV versus MV) < 0.001. While the response of the autonomic system to surgery is similar in AV and MV patients, there is obviously a decreased ability to recover in MV patients, probably attributed to traumatic lesions of the autonomic nervous system by opening the atria. Ongoing research is required for further clarification of the pathophysiology of this phenomenon and to establish strategies to restore autonomic function.

J	Yang, WX; Tavner, PJ				Yang, Wenxian; Tavner, P. J.			Empirical mode decomposition, an adaptive approach for interpreting shaft vibratory signals of large rotating machinery	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; EMD METHOD; CORRELATION DIMENSION; BALL-BEARINGS; SPECTRUM; IDENTIFICATION; FEATURES; ROTOR	The Fourier transform (FT) has been the most popular method for analyzing large rotating machine shaft vibration problems, but it assumes that these vibration signals are linear and stationary. However, in reality this is not always true. Nonlinear and non-stationary shaft vibration signals are often encountered during the start-up and shut-down processes of the machines. Additionally, mechanical faults, for example rotor-to-stator rubbing, fluid excitation, part-loosening, and shaft cracking, are nonlinear. Owing to these reasons, an accurate analysis of shaft vibration cannot always be achieved by using the FT. An alternative tool, the wavelet transform (WT), is now being used to improve the situation. But the efficiency is a problem especially when applying the WT to the accurate analysis of a large-scale, lengthy data. In view of the powerful capability of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to process nonlinear/non-stationary signals, its algorithm efficiency and its satisfactory performance in minimizing energy leakage, the EMD is used in this paper to analyze the problem, the signals investigated are adaptively decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The principal IMFs, identified using an energy-distribution threshold, dominate the signals' oscillation. So, 'purified' shaft vibration signals can be reconstructed from these principal IMFs. To remove interference present in principal IMFs, an adaptive band-pass filter is designed, whose central frequency is automatically set to the frequency dominating the IMF being investigated. To facilitate the observation of transient shaft vibration, a transient shaft orbit (TSO) is constructed by introducing timescale into the orbit drawing process. Nine mathematical criteria are also proposed to evaluate the shaft vibrations exhibited in the IMFs and TSOs. The novelty of this approach is that the EMD provides an adaptive, effective, and efficient way to obtain 'purified' shaft vibration signals, which describe the transient shaft vibration more vividly and precisely, reducing misinterpretation of the machine running condition.

Fault masking by multiple timing faults in timed EFSM models	COMPUTER NETWORKS			English	Article						Conformance testing; Multiple timers; Fault modeling; Fault masking; Finite State Machine (FSM); Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM); Timed EFSM	TEST SEQUENCE GENERATION; FINITE-STATE MACHINES; SYSTEMS	Detection of multiple timing faults is a challenging task because these faults, although may be detectable individually, can mask each other's faulty behavior, making a faulty implementation under test (IUT) indistinguishable from a non-faulty one during testing. This phenomenon, called fault masking, is formally defined in this paper. It is proven that graph augmentation algorithms proposed for timed Extended Finite State Machines (EFSMs) with multiple timers can detect pairwise occurrences of classes of timing faults in an IUT and, hence, detects fault masking.

Use of Full Spectrum Cascade for Rotor Rub Identification	ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Rotor-stator rub; Fault diagnosis; Full spectrum analysis		Rotor-stator rub is a commonly observed phenomenon in rotating machinery. The rotor vibration response resulting due to rotor-stator rubs exhibit characteristics typical of any nonlinear systems. As there are other faults such as rotor crack which exhibits nonlinearities, it is essential to understand exact nature of nonlinear vibration response of rotor with rub from fault diagnosis point of view and to understand the unique nature of response due to rub. In this paper, steady state vibration analysis is carried out for the rotor stator contact phenomenon at different rotation speeds. Study includes investigations. related to different rotor rub regimes. The cascade full spectra have been effectively used to extract the distinctive directional features of rotor rub. The results indicate rotor stiffening and resonance shifting phenomena for the rub impacting rotors. Strong backward whirling 1X vibration motion is detected before the resonance. Superharmonics and subharmonics are found in the spectrum due to nonlinear rotor stator interactions. The vibration response near critical speed is found to be highly directional. The response at the certain supercritical speed range has been found to have stronger subharmonic frequency component (1/2X) that dominates the frequency spectrum. Response features such as pseudo resonance, stronger backward whirling 1X frequency component, subharmonics and their whirl nature distinctly observed from the cascade spectra can be conveniently used for diagnostic purposes.

The objective of this research was to investigate the correlation between vibration analysis and electromotor fault diagnosis. This was achieved by vibration analysis of an electromotor in Imam Khomaynei silo. The vibration analysis was initially run under regular interval during machine life. A series of tests were then conducted under the operating hours of electromotor. Vibration data was regularly collected. Overall vibration data produced by vibration analysis was compared with previous data. Numerical data produced by vibration analysis were compared with vibration spectra in standard condition of healthy electromotor, in order to quantify the effectiveness of the vibration condition monitoring technique. The results of this paper have given more understanding on the dependent roles of vibration analysis in predicting and diagnosing of electromotor faults.

Estimated repair times can be used to improve the reliability and time-to-market of software under development. This paper presents an empirical approach to predicting defect repair times by constructing models that use well-established machine learning algorithms and defect data from past software defect reports. We describe, as a case study, the analysis of defect reports collected during the development of a large medical software system. Our predictive models give accuracies as high as 93.44%, despite the limitations of the available data. We present the proposed methodology along with detailed experimental results, which include comparisons with other analytical modeling approaches.

Rotor cage fault diagnosis in three-phase induction motors based on a current and virtual flux approach	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Induction motor; Diagnosis; Fault detection; Stator currents; Virtual flux; Rotor cage fault	BAR DETECTION; PROTECTION	This paper focuses on the detection of a rotor cage fault in a three-phase PWM feed induction motor. In inverter-fed machines there are some difficulties for the detection of a rotor cage fault. These difficulties are due to the fault signature that will be contained in the currents or voltages applied to the machine. In this way, a new approach based on the current and a virtual flux is proposed. The use of the virtual flux allows the improving of the signal to noise ratio. This approach also allows the identification of a rotor cage fault independently of the type of control used in the ac drive. The theoretical principle of this method is discussed. Simulation and experimental results are presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Pires, Dulce F.; Pires, V.

A novel technique for selecting mother wavelet function using an intelligent fault diagnosis system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Signal processing; Vibration signal; Fault diagnosis; Neural network; Genetic algorithm; Mother wavelet; Gear; Piecewise cubic hermite interpolation; Daubechies	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; GENETIC ALGORITHM	This paper presents an optimized gear fault identification system using genetic algorithm (GA) to investigate the type of gear failures of a complex gearbox system using artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a well-designed structure suited for practical implementations due to its short training duration and high accuracy. For this purpose, slight-worn, medium-worn, and broken-tooth of a spur gear of the gearbox system were selected as the faults. In fault simulating, two very similar models of worn gear have been considered with partial difference for evaluating the preciseness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the processing of vibration signals has become much more difficult because a full-of-oil complex gearbox system has been considered to record raw vibration signals. Raw vibration signals were segmented into the signals recorded during one complete revolution of the input shaft using tachometer information and then synchronized using piecewise cubic hermite interpolation to construct the sample signals with the same length. Next, standard deviation of wavelet packet coefficients of the vibration signals considered as the feature vector for training purposes of the ANN. To ameliorate the algorithm, GA was exploited to optimize the algorithm so as to determine the best values for "mother wavelet function", "decomposition level of the signals by means of wavelet analysis", and "number of neurons in hidden layer" resulted in a high-speed, meticulous two-layer ANN with a small-sized structure. This technique has been eliminated the drawbacks of the type of mother function for fault classification purpose not only in machine condition monitoring, but also in other related areas. The small-sized proposed network has improved the stability and reliability of the system for practical purposes. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, JD; Bai, MR; Su, JC; Huang, CW				Wu, Jian-Da; Bai, Mingsian R.; Su, Ju-Cheng; Huang, Chin-Wei			An expert system for the diagnosis of faults in rotating machinery using adaptive order-tracking algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Signal processing; Fault diagnosis; Order-tracking; Adaptive RLS filter	SIGNALS	This paper describes an application of an adaptive order-tracking technique for the diagnosis of faults in rotating machinery. Conventional methods of order-tracking are primarily based on Fourier analysis with reference to shaft speed. Unfortunately, in some applications of order-tracking performance is limited, such as when a smearing problem arises and also in a multiple independent shaft system. In this study, the proposed fault diagnostic system is based on a recursive least-square (RLS) filtering algorithm. The problem is treated as the tracking of various frequency bandpass signals. Order amplitudes can be calculated with high-resolution in real-time implementation. The algorithm is implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP) platform for diagnosis and evaluated by experimental investigation. An experimental investigation is implemented to evaluate the proposed system in two applications of gear-set defect diagnosis and in the diagnosis of damaged engine turbocharger blades. The results of the experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective in fault diagnosis for both experimental cases. Furthermore, a characteristic analysis and experimental comparison of a vibration signal and a sound emission signal for the present algorithm are also presented in this report.

J	Fei, SW; Liu, CL; Miao, YB				Fei, Sheng-wei; Liu, Cheng-liang; Miao, Yu-bin			Support vector machine with genetic algorithm for forecasting of key-gas ratios in oil-immersed transformer	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Key-gas ratios forecasting; Support vector machine; Genetic algorithm; Power transformer	INCIPIENT FAULTS; GREY PREDICTION; ELECTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS	Failures of power transformer are related with key-gas ratios C2H2/C2H4, CH4/H-2 and C2H4/C2H6 strongly. Forecasting of these ratios of key-gas in power transformer oil is very significant to detect and identify incipient failures of transformer early. Forecasting of the ratios of key-gas in power transformer oil is a complicated problem due to its non-linearity and the small quantity of training data. In this study, support vector machine with genetic algorithm (SVMG) is proposed to forecast the ratios of key-gas in power transformer oil, among which genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine. The experimental results indicate that the SVMG method can achieve greater accuracy than grey model, artificial neural network under the circumstance of small training data. Consequently, the SVMG model is a proper alternative for forecasting of the ratios of key-gas in power transformer oil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A low speed test rig was developed to simulate various types of bearing defects associated with shaft speeds as low as 10 rpm under several loading conditions. The data was acquired from the low speed bearing test rig using acoustic emission (AE) and accelerometer sensors under a constant load with different speeds. The aim of this study is to address the problem of detecting an incipient bearing fault and to find reliable methods for low speed machine fault diagnosis. In this paper, two methods of multi-class classification techniques for fault diagnosis through RVM and SVM are presented and the effectiveness of using AE and vibration signals due to low impact rate for low speed diagnosis. In the present study, component analysis was performed initially to extract the features and to reduce the dimensionality of original data features. The classification for fault diagnosis was also conducted using original data feature and without feature extraction.

Prognostic Health Management of Aircraft Power Generators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS			English	Article								In this paper, prognostic tools are developed to detect the onset of electrical failures in an aircraft power generator, and to predict the generator's remaining useful life (RUL). Focus is on the rotor circuit since failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) studies indicate that it is a high priority candidate for condition monitoring. A signature feature is developed and tested by seeded fault experiments to verify that the initial stages of rotor faults are observable under diverse generator load conditions. A tracking filter is used to assess the damage state and predict generator RUL. This information helps to avoid unexpected failures while reducing the overall life-cycle cost of the system.

PLR: A Software Approach to Transient Fault Tolerance for Multicore Architectures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING			English	Article						Fault tolerance; reliability; transient faults; soft errors; process-level redundancy	DESIGN	Transient faults are emerging as a critical concern in the reliability of general-purpose microprocessors. As architectural trends point toward multicore designs, there is substantial interest in adapting such parallel hardware resources for transient fault tolerance. This paper presents process-level redundancy (PLR), a software technique for transient fault tolerance, which leverages multiple cores for low overhead. PLR creates a set of redundant processes per application process and systematically compares the processes to guarantee correct execution. Redundancy at the process level allows the operating system to freely schedule the processes across all available hardware resources. PLR uses a software-centric approach to transient fault tolerance, which shifts the focus from ensuring correct hardware execution to ensuring correct software execution. As a result, many benign faults that do not propagate to affect program correctness can be safely ignored. A real prototype is presented that is designed to be transparent to the application and can run on general-purpose single-threaded programs without modifications to the program, operating system, or underlying hardware. The system is evaluated for fault coverage and performance on a four-way SMP machine and provides improved performance over existing software transient fault tolerance techniques with a 16.9 percent overhead for fault detection on a set of optimized SPEC2000 binaries.

J	Shatnawi, O				Shatnawi, Omar			Discrete Time NHPP Models for Software Reliability Growth Phenomenon	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Software engineering; software testing; software reliability; software reliability growth model; nonhomogeneous poisson process; test occasions		Nonhomogeneous poisson process based software reliability growth models are generally classified into two groups. The first group contains models, which use the machine execution time or calendar time as a unit of fault detection/removal period. Such models are called continuous time models. The second group contains models, which use the number of test occasions/cases as a unit of fault detection period. Such models are called discrete time models, since the unit of software fault detection period is countable. A large number of models have been developed in the first group while there are fewer in the second group. Discrete time models in software reliability are important and a little effort has been made in this direction. In this paper, we develop two discrete time SRGMs using probability generating function for the software failure occurrence / fault detection phenomenon based on a NHPP namely, basic and extended models. The basic model exploits the fault detection/removal rate during the initial and final test cases. Whereas, the extended model incorporates fault generation and imperfect debugging with learning. Actual software reliability data have beet? used to demonstrate the proposed models. The results are fairly encouraging in terms of goodness-of-fit and predictive validity criteria due to applicability and flexibility of the proposed models as they can capture a wide class of reliability growth curves ranging from purely exponential to highly S-shaped.

Endmill Condition Monitoring and Failure Forecasting Method for Curvilinear Cuts of Nonconstant Radii	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ASME International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Engineering	OCT 15-18, 2007	Atlanta, GA	ASME, Mfg Engn Div		autoregressive processes; condition monitoring; cutting; cutting tools; failure analysis; optimisation; wear	SYSTEM	In this paper, an endmill condition monitoring technique is presented for curvilinear cutting. This algorithm operates without the need for prior knowledge of cutting conditions, tool type, cut curvature, cut direction, or directional rate of change. The goal of this method is an indirect measurement of the tool wear able to indicate when wear is accelerating without direct measurement of the tool. This technique is based on an autoregressive-type monitoring algorithm, which is used to track the tool's condition using a tri-axial accelerometer. Accelerometer signals are monitored due to the sensor's relatively low cost and since use of the sensor does not limit the machining envelope. To demonstrate repeatability, eight life tests were conducted. The technique discussed herein successfully delivers prognosis of impending fracture or meltdown due to wear in all cases, providing sufficient time to remove the tools before failure is realized. Furthermore, the algorithm produces similar trends capable of forecasting failure, regardless of tool type and cut geometry. Success is seen in all cases without requiring algorithm modifications or any prior information regarding the tool or cutting conditions.

J	Wang, XD; Zi, YY; He, ZJ				Wang, Xiaodong; Zi, Yanyang; He, Zhengjia			Multiwavelet construction via an adaptive symmetric lifting scheme and its applications for rotating machinery fault diagnosis	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						multiwavelet; adaptive symmetric lifting scheme; fault diagnosis	VIBRATION	Multiwavelets and the lifting scheme are two important developments of wavelet theory. Multiwavelets outperform scalar wavelets in many applications due to their better properties. The lifting scheme is a method to construct a new wavelet with prescribed properties. In this paper, multiwavelets are integrated with the lifting scheme, synthesizing their advantages. Due to multiple wavelet bases, the lifting scheme of multiwavelets is more flexible than that of scalar wavelets. With supplement of a symmetric condition, a novel adaptive symmetric lifting scheme of multiwavelets is presented. Kurtosis is chosen to be the performance measurement of lifting coefficients, and the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the free parameters in the lifting scheme. The proposed method, constructing a new multiwavelet via an adaptive lifting scheme, is applied to analyze the simulation of a rolling bearing and gearbox vibration signals. The results demonstrate that the adaptive symmetric lifting of multiwavelets is more effective in extracting fault features of rotating machinery than conventional diagnosis techniques with scalar wavelets and non-adaptive multiwavelets.

In this paper, we propose a new robust method for it based on improved wavelet packet decomposition (IWPD) and support vector data description (SVDD). A health index is designed based on general distance. Node energies of IWPD are used to compose feature vectors. Based on feature vectors extracted from normal signals, a SVDD model fitting a tight hypersphere around them is trained, the general distance of test data to this hypersphere is used as the health index. Research results of its application in a bearing accelerated life test show that this health index can reflect effectively bearing performance degradation comparing with many other parameters.

J	Liu, XF; Ma, L; Mathew, J				Liu, Xiaofeng; Ma, Lin; Mathew, Joseph			Machinery fault diagnosis based on fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral data fusion techniques	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fuzzy measures; Fuzzy integrals; Fuzzy c-means; Data fusion; Fault diagnosis	RECOGNITION	Fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral theory are an outgrowth of classical measure theory. Fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral theory take into account the importance of criteria and interactions among them, and have excellent potential for applications such as classification. This paper presents a novel data fusion approach for machinery fault diagnosis using fuzzy measures and fuzzy integrals. The approach consists of a feature-level data fusion model and a decision-level data fusion model. The fuzzy c-means analysis method was employed to identify the relations between a feature set and a fault prototype to establish mappings between features and given faults. Rolling element bearing and electrical motor experiments were conducted to validate the models. Different features were obtained from recorded signals and then fused at both feature and decision levels using fuzzy measure and fuzzy integral data fusion techniques to produce diagnostic results. The results showed that the proposed approach performs very well for bearing and motor fault diagnosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cempel, C				Cempel, Czeslaw			Generalized singular value decomposition in multidimensional condition monitoring of machines-A proposal of comparative diagnostics	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Machine condition; Multidimensional; Generalized SVD; Fault space; Observation space; Condition similarity	SYSTEMS; OPERATION	With the modern metrology, we can measure almost all variables in the phenomenon field of working machine, and many of measuring quantities can be symptoms of machine condition. On this basis, we can form the symptom observation matrix (SOM) for condition monitoring. From the other side we know that contemporary complex machines may have many modes of failure, so-called faults, which form the fault space. Even if we apply some modern tool like singular value decomposition (SVD) for the fault extraction purpose, this multidimensional problem is not a simple one. Therefore, the question remains if one can learn considering similar problem when having SOM of similar machine observed just before. In this way, we can consider the application of generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) to the machine condition monitoring problems, and uncover some new possibilities.

J	Feng, YH; Schlindwein, FS				Feng, Yanhui; Schlindwein, Fernando S.			Normalized wavelet packets quantifiers for condition monitoring	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Condition monitoring; Wavelet packets quantifier; Bearing fault; Contamination fault; Wavelet entropy; Acoustic Emission	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; DIAGNOSTICS; VIBRATION; ENTROPY	Normalized wavelet packets quantifiers are proposed and studied as a new tool for condition monitoring. The new quantifiers construct a complete quantitative time-frequency analysis: the Wavelet packets relative energy measures the normalized energy of the wavelet packets node; the Total wavelet packets entropy measures how the normalized energies of the wavelet packets nodes are distributed in the frequency domain; the Wavelet packets node entropy describes the uncertainty of the normalized coefficients of the wavelet packets node. Unlike the feature extraction methods directly using the amplitude of wavelet coefficients, the new quantifiers are derived from probability distributions and are more robust in diagnostic applications. By applying these quantifiers to Acoustic Emission signals from faulty bearings of rotating machines, our study shows that both localized defects and advanced contamination faults can be successfully detected and diagnosed if the appropriate quantifier is chosen. The Bayesian classifier is used to quantitatively analyse and evaluate the performance of the proposed quantifiers. We also show that reducing the Daubechies wavelet order or the length of the segment will deteriorate the performance of the quantifiers. A two-dimensional diagnostic scheme can also help to improve the diagnostic performance but the improvements are only significant when using lower wavelet orders.

C.; Mathew, Joseph			Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review						Condition-based maintenance; Condition monitoring; Prognostics; Reliability	RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; MAINTENANCE POLICY; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; RESIDUAL LIFE; PREDICTION; MODEL; SYSTEMS; AMPLITUDE; HAZARD; TESTS	Machinery prognosis is the forecast of the remaining operational life, future condition, or probability of reliable operation of an equipment based on the acquired condition monitoring data. This approach to modern maintenance practice promises to reduce downtime, spares inventory, maintenance costs, and safety hazards. Given the significance of prognostics capabilities and the maturity of condition monitoring technology, there have been an increasing number of publications on rotating machinery prognostics in the past few years. These publications covered a wide spectrum of prognostics techniques. This review article first synthesises and places these individual pieces of information in context, while identifying their merits and weaknesses. It then discusses the identified challenges, and in doing so, alerts researchers to opportunities for conducting advanced research in the field. Current methods for predicting rotating machinery failures are summarised and classified as conventional reliability models, condition-based prognostics models and models integrating reliability and prognostics. Areas in need of development or improvement include the integration of condition monitoring and reliability, utilisation of incomplete trending data, consideration of effects from maintenance actions and variable operating conditions, derivation of the non-linear relationship between measured data and actual asset health, consideration of failure interactions, practicability of requirements and assumptions, as well as development of performance evaluation frameworks.

J	Niu, G; Yang, BS				Niu, Gang; Yang, Bo-Suk			Dempster-Shafer regression for multi-step-ahead time-series prediction towards data-driven machinery prognosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Machinery prognosis; Dempster-Shafer regression; Time-series reconstruction; Multi-step-ahead prediction; Performance evaluation	EMBEDDING DIMENSION; DYNAMICS	Predicting a sequence of future values of a time series using the descriptors observed in the past can be regarded as the stand-stone of data-driven machinery prognosis. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel data-driven machinery prognosis strategy for industry application. First, the collected time-series degradation features are reconstructed based on the theorem of Takens, among which the reconstruction parameters. delay time and embedding dimension are selected by the C-C method and the false nearest neighbor method, respectively. Next, the Dempster-Shafer regression technique is developed to perform the task of time-series prediction. Moreover, the strategy of iterated multi-step-ahead prediction is discussed to keep track with the rapid variation of time-series signals during the data monitoring process in an industrial plant. The proposed scheme is validated using condition monitoring data of a methane compressor to predict the degradation trend. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have a low error rate; hence, it can be regarded as an effective tool for data-driven machinery prognosis applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To breach the above limits and raise the usability of LPSR, a novel method named frequency-shifted and re-scaling stochastic resonance (FRSR) is proposed in this paper. By shifting and re-scaling the frequency, FRSR provides a way to alleviate the contradiction between sampling frequency and the number of sample points. The proposed method is verified with simulated signals. The results show that this method is useful in weak fault diagnosis of mechanical systems which involve high feature frequencies. Compared with the existing LPSR models, FRSR just requires a lower sampling frequency, a smaller data length and has higher efficiency. Finally. the proposed method is applied to a milling machine toot fault diagnosis and an outer ring fault feature of the spindle bearing is found successfully. Thus, FRSR is a meaningful try for SR coming into practical use of mechanical fault diagnosis. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the blind source separation (BSS) technique is proposed to separate the vibrational features produced by several faults existing in a rotor. A statistic variable-based algorithm, decorrelation method, is employed to analyze the signals of the rotors with multi-faults, which are simulated by numerical and experimental methods. The separation results show that the typical feature components of the frequency spectrum of each fault are separated successfully. The investigation demonstrates that it is feasible and helpful to adopt BSS technique to diagnose the multi-faults of a rotor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, HQ; Chen, P				Wang, Huaqing; Chen, Peng			A Feature Extraction Method Based on Information Theory for Fault Diagnosis of Reciprocating Machinery	SENSORS			English	Article						Feature extraction; Information theory; Reciprocating Machinery; Fault diagnosis; Rolling element bearing; Envelope Analysis	VIBRATION SIGNAL; ROLLER BEARING; ENVELOPE; WAVELET; DEFECTS; TOOL	This paper proposes a feature extraction method based on information theory for fault diagnosis of reciprocating machinery. A method to obtain symptom parameter waves is defined in the time domain using the vibration signals, and an information wave is presented based on information theory, using the symptom parameter waves. A new way to determine the difference spectrum of envelope information waves is also derived, by which the feature spectrum can be extracted clearly and machine faults can be effectively differentiated. This paper also compares the proposed method with the conventional Hilbert-transform-based envelope detection and with a wavelet analysis technique. Practical examples of diagnosis for a rolling element bearing used in a diesel engine are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The verification results show that the bearing faults that typically occur in rolling element bearings, such as outer-race, inner-race, and roller defects, can be effectively identified by the proposed method, while these bearing faults are difficult to detect using either of the other techniques it was compared to.
