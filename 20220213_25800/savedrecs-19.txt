Based on this analytical solution of the differential equations, the influence of the motor parameters on the amplitude and the duration of the electrical transient is investigated. The exact knowledge of the transient current is necessary for the assessment of its potential impact on transient motor current signature analysis methods for fault diagnosis.	[Tsoumas, I.

The current study presents a preliminary analysis of stator-current measurements for electric motor fault detection and classification by means of the recurrence quantification theory. Firstly, a preliminary visual inspection of the recurrence plots of stator-current measurements for healthy and faulty electric motors is presented. Thereafter, the following RQ metrics are analyzed: the recurrence rate, the determinism, the divergence, the Shannon entropy, the laminarity and the trapping time. Then, the RQ metrics are used as predictors for fault detection and classification. The classification results (100% fault classification accuracy), which are presented using the linear support vector machine classifier, show that the RQA can be considered as a tool for motor current signature analysis.

Classical methods based on permanent regime are being complemented by recent approaches that rely on the analysis of the magnetic field during transient operation of the machine. Most of these approaches have been applied with success to detect failures in cage induction motors, but few works have dealt with their wound rotor counterparts. This paper proposes the analysis of the magnetic field in the vicinity of the machine to detect rotor failures in wound rotor induction motors. Classical methods based on the Fast Fourier transform of steady-state signals are compared with recent methods relying on the analysis of signals captured under starting. Different positions for the considered flux sensors are considered and novel indicators are presented for the determination of the level of fault severity.

Over several decades, many techniques and methodologies to assess the healthiness state of electrical motors have been proposed and implemented successfully. In this regard new advances in the signal processing field has taken a great importance since these emerging tools are used to accomplish fault diagnosis tasks in order to increase the reliability of such processes. So, it is very important to explore the use of new signal processing techniques to detect and diagnose in a timely manner faults in electrical motors. In this work, it is proposed to use the wavelet entropy of the stray flux signal captured by a coil sensor to estimate the winding insulation status of induction motors, a very common failure presented on this type of drives, that if not attended on time, it can end in a catastrophic and irreversible fault in a matter of minutes. The proposal uses suitable time-frequency decomposition (TFD) tools to isolate the studied fault. The results obtained show that the methodology proposed here can be considered as an excellent alternative for estimating the winding insulation healthiness state of an induction motor online and efficiently, as well as being possible to implement it in a programmable logic device.

Analysis of Li-ion battery degradation using self-organizing maps	45TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2019)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	45th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IECON)	OCT 14-17, 2019	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	IEEE, Univ Nova Lisboa, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Neural networks; Self-organizing maps (SOM); batteries; battery degradation; Remaining useful life (RUL)	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; PROGNOSTICS	This paper proposes a new methodology to identify the different degradation processes of Li-Ion battery cells. The goal of this study is to determine if different degradation factors can be separated by waveform analysis from aged cells with similar remaining capacity. In contrast to other works, the proposed method identifies the past operating conditions in the cell, regardless of the actual State of Health. The methodology is based on a data-driven approach by using a SOM (Self-organizing map), an unsupervised neural network. To verify the hypothesis a SOM has been trained with laboratory data from whole data cycles, to classify cells concerning their degradation path and according to their discharge voltage patterns. Additionally, this new methodology based on the SOM allows discriminating groups of cells with different cycling conditions (based on depth of discharge, ambient temperature and discharge current). This research line is very promising for classification of used cells, not only depending on their current static parameters (capacity, impedance), but also the battery use in their past life. This will allow making predictions of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a battery with greater precision.

Many conventional detection algorithms based on time or frequency analysis have been published. Recently, machine learning technics have been adapted to the arc fault detection task and give promising results. However, the use of machine learning is frequently limited to the classification part. Manual feature extraction part which requires time and effort is always needed before obtaining the optimized features. In this paper, we used stacked autoencoders to replace the feature extraction part. The method presented can distinguish normal state and series arc fault with good accuracies.

A fault of a current sensor should be detected in an early stage to avoid a critical failure, which would lead to breakdown of the vehicle. This paper focuses on the gain fault of a current sensor on a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) and proposes a data based diagnostic concept, which is able to detect the fault and its severity in short time. After analyzing simulation data in healthy and faulty conditions, several basic features of current signals in time domain are generated. Subsequently, the three most effective features for the fault detection are chosen with a proposed feature selection tool. Then, three different machine learning algorithms (linear regression, decision tree and neural network) are used to train models with the selected features. The performance and characteristics of each model are compared. The neural network model has the lowest prediction error on the severity of fault. For standstill condition, another well performed diagnostic concept is developed with the same approach. The advantage of the data based approach is to reduce the effort on searching appropriate features by using machine learning algorithm. Therefore, diagnostic concepts for new faults or machines can be quickly developed because the most work of a data based diagnostic concept can be done automatically.

In the open-circuit faults of the power switching devices, there are two groups of similar faults that are difficult to distinguish. To solve this problem, a secondary classification fault diagnosis strategy based on PCA-SVM is proposed. The first classification is used to make a preliminary fault diagnosis between all types of faults, the second classification is to make a further diagnosis of the two groups of similar faults. Finally, compared with other fault diagnosis strategies, the proposed strategy improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Winding failures in pitch motors are common due to high start-up loads and poor ventilation. This article presents a diagnostics scheme that can detect the stator winding failures in the pitch motors under time-varying speed and load conditions. The proposed approach based on three-phase motor currents can be directly integrated into the motor drive and can be used for induction as well as permanent magnet synchronous machines. The extended Park's vector calculated on the motor currents is order tracked based on the supply frequency from the drive using Vold-Kalman filter. The approach is shown to be robust under arbitrary load and speed variations in a laboratory setup of a pitch drive.

Usually, the power converters are subjected to a high failure frequency rate and lead to power system shut down. In an effort to predict power insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBTs) device aging, this paper proposes a remaining useful life estimation algorithm for degraded power IGBTs, which are exposed to high amplitude of thermal overstress, through the Gaussian Process regression technique. The benefits of the proposed prognostic method are also illustrated with real device accelerated aging database set under thermal overstress utilizing a DC at the gate.

The zero-sequence current offers some distinct advantages compared to traditional methods, one of which is that it is able to detect a variety of faults with a single analysis. Despite its numerous advantages, the zero-sequence current has one significant drawback; it can only be applied to delta-connected induction motors or star-connected with the stator neutral connected to the supply. However, in many industrial cases, the large induction motors are connected in star without the neutral connected, to avoid extra losses. In those cases, the zero-sequence current method cannot be applied as the zero-sequence current simply does not exist. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes for the first time the use of the zero-sequence stray flux for the detection of induction motor rotor electrical faults. It will be shown that the zero-sequence flux carries all the advantages of the zero-sequence current, while it can be applied to any 3-phase electrical machine independently from the stator winding configuration.

Its performance is compared to that of the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) based. A notch filter based Pearson correlation was developed and used to extract the dominant mode. Experimental results showed that the VMD outperformed in terms of statistical features. As a result, the VMD-based notch filter could be a promising methodology for bearing fault detection and degradation prediction.

Nevertheless, the durability and cost are two key barriers for their large-scale commercialization in light- duty vehicle transportation applications. It is necessary to predict the future State of Health (SoH) and future behaviors. Then the operating parameters can be optimized with time or Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) can be activated to extend its life. Prognostics have the ability to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) before the failure occurs. It seems to be a great solution to deal with the durable issue of PEMFCs. PEMFCs have wide range of applications. Besides, PEMFCs have the property of multi-physics, multi-scales, and nonlinearity. Moreover, the degradation phenomenon has a relationship with the mission profiles and the external disturbances. Then all the degradation mechanisms of the various fuel cells components can hardly be completely understood. Three kinds of prognostic methods are commonly distinguished: model-based, data-driven, and hybrid method. Developing novel and efficient methods to improve the prognostic accuracy, to decrease the computational burden, and to reinforce the robustness and dynamics are what should be done in the next steps.

In this context, we propose in this paper a multi-fault classification comparison between traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) solutions and wavelet SVM (WSVM). For this work several kernel and wavelet functions were considered in the Kullback Leibler Divergence (KLD) framework. First, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to preprocess vibration signals acquired from the rolling bearings elements. Second, a specific statistical analysis study is performed to select the most salient components from the different obtained Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Then, the KLD of the retained IMFs is calculated to carry out the classification of three bearing ball fault severities for several operating conditions. Thanks to four criteria, namely the classification accuracy rate average (ARA), the support vector average (SV A), the training time (T(r)t) and testing time (T(s)t), our results are derived to highlight the technique allowing to obtain the better results.

A useful set of techniques for examining these kinds of signals relies on the spectral representations of higher-order statistics (HOS), well-known as polyspectra. They describe statistical dependences of frequency components that are neglected by traditional spectral measures. The bispectrum is the most used HOS, and studying higher-order correlations provides more information about the electromechanical system's behavior. It helps in building more accurate diagnostic models. Based on this proper relationship the overall aim of the current work is the interpretation of the stator current tidal turbine bispectrum under imbalanced rotor blades condition. Based on this proper relationship, the overall aim of the current work is the interpretation of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based tidal current turbine (TCT) stator current bispectrum for the diagnosis of biofouling. The proposed bispectrum-based diagnosis method has been tested using experimental data issued from a TCT experiencing biofouling emulated by an attachment on the turbine rotor. The achieved results clearly indicate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method.

Fault Coverage of a Test Set on Structure-Preserving Siblings of a Circuit-Under-Test	2019 IEEE 28TH ASIAN TEST SYMPOSIUM (ATS)	Asian Test Symposium Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	28th IEEE Asian Test Symposium (ATS)	DEC 10-13, 2019	Kolkata, INDIA	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE, Intel, Synopsys, VLSI Soc India, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, Mentor Graph, Cadence, Sankalp Semiconductor, AMD, arm, IEEE Test Technol Tech Council		ATPG; Engineering Change Order (ECO); Fault Coverage (FC); Stuck-at Fault (SAF)	ATPG	Most of the Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) algorithms for digital circuits rely heavily on netlist description that comprises both network interconnect structure among logic gates and the functionality of each gate. The performance of an ATPG tool on a circuit-under-test (CUT) C is determined by the size of the test set T and its fault coverage (FC). Despite extensive research in the field of testing, the following question remains unanswered: Is the structure or the functionality of C dominant in determining FC of a test-set T for C? In this paper, we present empirical evidence in favour of the dominance of structure on FC by randomly selecting a logic gate from a synthesized netlist for C, and replacing it by a different type of gate. Our experiments provide an un-intuitive result that FC of a test-set T for C under the single stuck-at fault model remains nearly the same on other sibling circuits that have identical structure as of C but with different gate functionality, provided these have similar extent of fault redundancy. This observation supports the view that feeding structural information alone may suffice to train machine-learning models that are currently being used to expedite different problems of digital circuit testing and diagnosis.

In response to the ever-increasing complexities of the modern CPU designs, machine learning algorithms have been proposed to extract processor behavior from simulation data and help constrain ATPG to generate functionally-compatible patterns. However, these simulation-based approaches in general suffer sample inefficiency, i.e., only a small portion of the simulation traces are relevant to fault detection. Inspired by the recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL), we propose an RL-based test program generation technique for transition delay fault (TDF) detection. During the training process, knowledge learned from the simulation data is employed to tune the simulation policy; this close-loop approach significantly improves data efficiency, compared to previous open-loop approaches. Furthermore, RL is capable of dealing with delayed responses, which is common when executing processor instructions. Using the trained RL model, instruction sequences that bring the processor to the fault-sensitizing states, i.e., TDF test patterns, can be generated. The proposed test program generation technique is applied to a MIPS32 processor. For TDF, the fault coverage is 94.94%, which is just 2.57% less than the full-scan based approach.

A data-driven prediction model of low complexity and high accuracy is indispensable for on-broad and online application. In this paper, the combination of two computational efficient models, namely SVR and MLP, are studied for prediction accuracy elevation. By analyzing the prediction error distribution of the two models, an optimization objective function of the fusion model is designed to minimize the prediction noise. And an analytical form of the fusion protocol is derived when solving the optimization problem. The accuracy of the full life cycle is enhanced and training data size remains the same.

Due to IDF the fundamental component of the voltage reduce and the partial IDF cause additional even order harmonics in the input-voltage. In this study, the fundamental component and the even order harmonics are used as the fault indicators. Furthermore, the increase in the ratio of fundamental to fifth order harmonic due to IDF is used to train an artificial neural network based algorithm and estimate the severity of a relatively small degree of IDF in the IPMSM. The proposed method has the ability to cover most of the operating points of the benchmark IPMSM and also able to distinguish between IDF and eccentricity fault. Finite element method based simulation and experiment on a 400-watt IPMSM is performed to verify the proposed method.

DC arc faults could potentially create a fire hazard if not detected and isolated quickly. This paper introduces two ways to improve the predictive performance of existing conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms as an arc fault detection method. A semi-supervised ML ensures sufficient training data when there is a vast number of unlabeled data and limited labeled data. An ensemble ML method further superimposes on a conventional ML algorithm to create a better classifier, which reduces the bias and decision variance. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of both methods in de arc fault detection. Accuracy, precision, and recall scores are used as the key performance metrics. Finally, an experimental arc fault detection was conducted using a microcontroller Udoo X86 with detection latency time as a performance metric.

To ease the training process and improve the prediction accuracy under limited labeled training data, this paper proposes a data-driven RUL prediction method enhanced by the identified mechanism degradation model. With the Frisch Scheme based Bias Compensating Recursive Least Squares (FBCRLS) algorithm, the battery mechanism aging model parameters are identified under limited labeled data. The model is then used to generate labeled data in a full life cycle, which is used to enhance the training of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. Test results reveal that the proposed method can effectively reduce the requirement of measured data and ensure high prediction accuracy even under very limited training data.

Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) systems that analyze changes in the electromagnetic spectrum (E-PHM) of a circuit can be implemented to determine the health of the equipment under test. This research demonstrates the use of E-PHM techniques to measure the junction temperature of a silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET. The results show the feasibility of training machine learning algorithms to recognize this relationship and determine the junction temperature within 10 degrees C. This is accomplished, in situ, without interruption of device operation and without altering the system's performance.

It defines a critical insulation resistance at which the temperature in the faulted insulation region reaches the cut-through temperature of the insulation material and determines the minimum and maximum bounds of the critical resistance for all possible faulty insulation volumes by 3D thermal analysis. It suggests insulation resistance thresholds for fault detection and mitigation action in order to prevent complete insulation failure with serious consequences. Moreover, an example is given to show that the insulation deterioration process may begin from large insulation resistance and is accelerated when the insulation material resistivity decreases with increase in temperature. Finally, tests on a prototype machine drive are performed to validate the predicted EM behavior under turn-to-turn insulation deterioration leading to SC faults.

In this paper, this lengthy transient phenomenon is substantially reduced through the socalled "Virtual Blocked Rotor (VBR)" approach implemented here. This approach starts with an initial calculation of the motor permeabilities and skin effect corresponding to the operating condition of the induction motor. Such calculations are performed in an FE Eddy-Current frequency-domain solver reflecting the voltage supply magnitude, value of slip, type and degree of eccentricity fault. The calculated permeabilities are imported into the TSFE simulation of the faulty induction motor and the performance characteristics of the faulty motor are extracted for further analysis. In this paper, static and dynamic eccentricities are applied to the induction motor under study. It is observed here that this approach successfully solves the problem of a lengthy numerical transient response and saves computational time in the analysis process.

Machine-learning-based method is often used to predict battery RUL, an accurate prediction is dependent on a large amount of labeled data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper proposes a new method to train the data-model of battery RUL prediction with constraint derived from prior physical knowledge. The constraint specifies the nonlinear function between the battery RUL and energy-throughput. Box-Cox transformation (BCT) is utilized to optimize the constraint, and transform the nonlinear function into a linear one. Then the physical knowledge function between the energy-throughput and RUL is constructed to generate new labeled data, which are used to train Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to achieve the label-free supervision battery RUL prediction data-model.

Eccentricity in DSSR motors can lead to mechanical faults and vibrations. However, eccentricity fault detection method for DSSR AFIPMs have not been studied before. In this paper, three types of static eccentricity named angle, space and combination of angle and space eccentricity have been modeled in a DSSR AFIPM by using 3-D FE analysis. After that, the motor was simulated for different degrees of static eccentricity. Different performance parameters such as torque, air gap flux density and back electromotive force (BEMF) of the coils for all three types of static eccentricities have been analyzed for different eccentricity levels. This study indicates that the lower order harmonics of BEMF can be effectively used to identify and compare the types of static eccentricity present in the DSSR type AFIPMs.	[Bin Tarek, Md Tawhid; Das, Shuvajit; Sozer, Yilmaz] Univ Akron, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA		Bin Tarek, MT (corresponding author), Univ Akron, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Akron, OH 44325 USA.	mt106@zips.uakron.edu; sd178@zips.uakron.edu; ys@uakron.edu	Das, Shuvajit/AAZ-9725-2020; Bin Tarek, Tawhid/ABH-6300-2020	Sozer, Yilmaz/0000-0003-3971-3967; Das, Shuvajit/0000-0003-2219-5892			Ajily E, 2016, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V31, P486, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2015.2506819; Aydin M., 2004, P 2004 C REC SPEEDAM, P61; CAMPBELL P, 1975, IEEE T MAGN, V11, P1541, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.1975.1058822; Capponi FG, 2012, IEEE T IND APPL, V48, P2190, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2012.2226854; Chalmers BJ, 1999, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V14, P251, DOI 10.1109/60.766991; Emelianov S, 2008, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P2, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649075; Guo BC, 2016, J MAGN, V21, P554, DOI 10.4283/JMAG.2016.21.4.554; Hua W, 2015, ENERGIES, V8, P14361, DOI 10.3390/en81212434; Huang YK, 2017, INT J APPL ELECTROM, V53, P757, DOI 10.3233/JAE-160106; Huang YK, 2016, ENERGIES, V9, DOI 10.3390/en9110892; LEUNG WS, 1980, IEEE T POWER AP SYST, V99, P1679, DOI 10.1109/TPAS.1980.319594; Li J, 2014, 2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM), P502, DOI 10.1109/ICELMACH.2014.6960227; Marignetti F, 2015, ELECTR POW COMPO SYS, V43, P1039, DOI 10.1080/15325008.2015.1024356; Mirimani S.

PMAC machines always work together with controllers and the controller parameters will affect the machine performance and the fault diagnosis in turn. The effects from the current controller bandwidth are special interested. In a closed-loop control PMSM drive system, the behaviours of the second harmonics in currents and voltages, induced by inter-turn short-circuit, along with the bandwidth are investigated theoretically. To combine the fault information both in currents and voltages, an indicator based on Rayleigh quotient, is proposed and compared with one published indicators, the second harmonics in instantaneous reactive power. Validated by Co-simulation, the presented indicator is more robust with respect to the controller bandwidth.

As a result, fault aggravation and machine burning might happen unless adequate fault diagnosis and management are equipped. By limiting the copper loss by the ITF, the faulted motor could operate without aggravation till the adequate fault management action is performed. In this paper, an IPMSM (Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) ITF tolerant drive method by limiting internal copper loss is proposed. The copper loss by the ITF is made simple for the proposed method and analyzed with various current, speed, and output torque condition. By maximizing the output torque with minimum IPMSM copper losses, MTPL (Maximum Torque Per Loss) operation point is suggested. Compared with the MTPA (Maximum Torque Per Ampere) the MTPL is more efficient operation point with ITF. To verify the proposed method, experiment studies are performed with an IPMSM with an ITF. The results show the feasibility and practicality of the proposed method.

The power electronic systems are based on fast-switching power semiconductors, such as diodes, mosfets, igbts, etc. These power devices represent the fragile part in a power electronic converter. Thus, to ensure safety and reliability of the power conversion system, a fault detection method must be provided. When a failure occurs, the fault detection and protection system become the most important function of the converter control unit. If the fault management is not adequate, the entire converter can be totally destroyed, causing catastrophic effects on the entire power conversion system. Accordingly, fault detection, classification, and diagnoses for all power electronic converters, including three phase rectifiers, three phase inverters, DC-DC converters and AC-AC converters, have to be investigated. In this paper, the fault analysis of the 3-phase 5-level E-Type Converter (3 Phi 5L E-Type Converter) is addressed. The 3 Phi 5L E-Type Converter is proposed for grid connected applications. All possible converter semiconductor switches and diodes faults are theoretically analyzed. The fault effects, the detectability and the safety shutdown actions are identified and summarized. The analysis is covered by simulation results performed in MATLAB/Simulink. The control algorithm has been implemented in FPGA using LabVIEW environmental. The experimental tests have been performed on the 20kVA prototype multilevel converter in order to validate the proposed analysis.

In this work, a particle filter is demonstrated to accurately estimate the remaining useful lifetime of stator insulation that is experimentally degraded. The particle filter is shown to provide a prognosis that is robust to different initial conditions and adaptable to a changing rate of degradation in the experimental data. Accuracy and computational effort is compared between the particle filter and an extended Kalman filter algorithm.

It proposes a compact and robust sensor fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration of the system. The idea is to be able to install the modular structure of fault tolerant control (FTC) in the system closed loop, and to design the observer independently, allowing the reconfiguration of the speed/current in the case of the defect. For the latter, an adaptive super twisting and reduced number of adaptive observers has been designed. A simulation results have been provided thank to Matlab/Simulink environment to check the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a noninvasive method which combines radiomics and deep learning features to conduct glioma grading. By integrating radiomics features with high-level deep learning features, a more comprehensive representation of the images was constructed. First, different types of radiomics features were extracted from region of interest (ROI) of the image. A VGG-16 model pretrained on ImageNet was finetuned for the extraction of the deep learning features. Subsequent feature selection was performed to obtain three kinds of optimal feature subsets: radiomics features only, deep learning features only, and combined features. Finally, these feature subsets were used to train three classifiers including logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to predict the glioma grade. Our method was evaluated on an open dataset, BraTS 2018, which contains 285 subjects from multiple institutions. The proposed combination method exhibits the best AUC value of 94.4% when compared with that use only radiomics or deep learning features.

Based on multi-parametric MR imaging, clearing the purpose of this paper is obtaining the high-risk subregions in GBM and evaluating the GBM prognosis using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Methods A total of 104 GBM patients (57 in long-term and 47 in short-term survival group, separated by overall survival of 12 months) were selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), who underwent the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1W-CE), T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W) and FLAIR sequences. In this paper, a region segmentation pattern was presented to characterize the tumor heterogeneity based on machine learning. Combined with four imaging parameters, the GBM region is segmented into multiple subregions by K-means clustering. Extracting the features of co-occurrence matrix, run-length matrix, size zone, and histogram matrix about subregion for building multi-instance bag. A prognostic prediction model was proposed in virtue of the MIL method, using instances to establish a classifier of predicting the high-risk subregions and realizing the prognosis prediction. Finally, the performance of prognosis prediction using instance-based MIL in GBM is presented and the clinical significance is evaluated. Result Training the classifier using discovery cohorts (71 patients including 200 instances) and testing the validation cohorts (33 patients including 94 instances), with the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 81.82%, 76.92%, and 85.00%, respectively. This is superior to our previous results about prognosis prediction with the whole tumor region. Conclusion The prognosis prediction result of our GBM heterogeneity analysis pattern proving the feasibility of the intratumor segmentation using K-means clustering and the effectiveness of Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) method. It is of benefit to the analysis of GBM high-risk factor, with research value and clinical significance. The intratumor segmentation of the tumor region and the identification of high-risk subregions is benefit to prognosis prediction of GBM, which may be also suitable for other heterogenous tumor.

Aerial Bundled Cables (ABCs) is a combination of insulated phase conductors bundled tightly together. They have replaced conventional cables due to simplicity in installation and being less prone to pilferage. However insulation degradation is a very common problem with ABCs especially when subjected to coastal environments. Due to bundled structure, the moisture penetrates within the cables. During electrical loading of the cable, this moisture starts deteriorating the cable insulation which eventually results in the cable failure. Actual Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) data from the installed in-service cable is acquired at different time instants to study the phenomena of insulation degradation w.r.t. time. A Particle Filter (PF) based prognostic approach is proposed in this paper to predict the insulation degradation for future time instants so that the cable can be replaced before the failure occurs. The proposed method will help the electrical maintenance managers to plan the replacement activity well in time to ensure uninterruptible/smooth electrical supply.

To improve equipment reliability and availability, prolong service life and reduce O&M costs, gas path component diagnosis is an effective technique for detecting evolving deterioration. Although many diagnostic methods based on steady state or quasi-steady state have been obtained, but no complete scientific system of gas-path diagnosis has been formed yet. Aiming at the above problems, a research route of gas-path component fault diagnosis for gas turbine engine is proposed. The proposed research route provides a new solution for diagnosis for complex nonlinear thermodynamic systems.

We propose an importance measure that can be modeled using a weighted average function. The weight is measured with the relative scale of the permutation entropy from each fault feature variable. Compared with some other importance measures in data fusion, the proposed measure focuses on the degradation trend represented by the permutation entropy, instead of the information volume represented by the Shannon entropy. Then, a multiple fault feature variable fusion method based on the proposed importance measure is further proposed in the D-S evidence theory framework. Finally, a case study involving an oil analysis-based dataset from a power-shift steering transmission is carried out to investigate the superiority of the proposed method.

Detection and diagnosis of bearing faults is therefore pretty significant for health monitoring of mechanical equipment. The latest years has witnessed more and more attention to deep learning techniques for prediction and health management (PHM) of bearings. The degradation performance induced by vibration features can be predicted with less requirements on prior knowledge. However, many existing bearing RUL prediction methods have the following two shortcomings: (i) the effects of the entire bearings running time and continuous variation are often ignored; (ii) gradient vanishing or gradient explosion is often involved in learning long term dependency in traditional neural networks. To overcome these problems, a deep structure of bearing degradation prognosis based on staked convolutional and long-short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) has been proposed in the paper. Firstly, convolution neural networks are applied to extract features from the original vibration signals, and then the extracted features are fed to the stacked long-short-term memory networks through the connection layer. Finally, the bearing performance degradation trend is estimated. In this experiment, the bearing dataset of NASA is utilized to verify the prognosis performance of the proposed method.

However, most of the works are conducted based on the hypothesis that training and testing data subject to the same distribution. In engineering scenarios, machines usually work under variable operation conditions, which results in the data from different conditions subject to distribution discrepancy. Since transfer learning is able to reuse the related knowledge across different domains, a hybrid transfer learning method (HTLM) is proposed to utilize the diagnosis knowledge obtained from one operation condition to complete the diagnosis tasks under other conditions. In the method, transfer component analysis is firstly used to extract fault features with small distribution discrepancy from the cross-domain samples. After that, the features learned from the source domain help train a classifier by Tradaboost algorithm to improve its diagnosis accuracy on the target domain. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a set of laboratory bearing datasets, in which the data under one operation condition arc used to help identify the health states of bearings under another condition. The results indicate that the proposed HTLM is able to achieve a higher diagnosis accuracy than other diagnosis methods.

Thus, transfer component analysis (TCA) has been designed to reduce the distance of marginal distribution between domains. The joint distribution adaptation (JDA) was proposed to simultaneously reduced the difference between the conditional distribution and marginal distribution in source or target domains. However, these two distributions are often treated equally in these existing methods, which will lead to poor performance in practical applications. Therefore, a cross-domain feature extraction method based on balanced distribution adaptation algorithm(BDA) has been proposed, which can adaptively utilize the importance of difference between marginal distribution and conditional distribution. It should be noted that several existing cross domain feature extraction methods can be treated as special cases of BDA. As a new method in the field of transfer learning, BDA is an effective cross-domain feature extraction method. The validity of the BDA algorithm has been successfully evaluated in the actual data set in this paper.

Owing to the strong learning ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN), it integrates the feature extraction from raw data and classification as a complete learning process and makes the bearing fault diagnosis intelligent. In the published results, the inputs of the CNN may be the raw temporal waveform of vibration, its processed waveform or converted 2D images. In this paper, focusing on the diagnosis accuracy of rolling bearings, a comparative study is conducted among the inputs using the raw temporal waveform, the frequency spectrum, and the envelope spectrum of a vibration signal. First, an appropriate classification model based on the CNN is constructed. Then, experimental data from bearing with real damages are collected and then transformed and converted into some small gray pixel images for training and testing the CNN model. Finally, the classification accuracies using three signals are compared. The results indicate that the diagnosis performances using the above three signals are close when the trained CNN models are stable; among them the model using the frequency spectrum of the vibration signal is a little better than the models using the other two signals, which may be a reference for further investigating the deep learning used in the field of bearing diagnosis.

A fault diagnosis method based on echo state networks (ESN) for 3D printers is proposed in this paper. A low-cost attitude sensor installed on the 3D printer is employed to collect raw fault data. Subsequently, feature extraction is carried out on the raw fault data. Using these features, ESN, as a shallow learning network, is modeled to diagnose faults of 3D printers. Experimental results show that the fault diagnosis method based on ESN still effective for 3D printers in low-cost and small-sample, which can make the fault recognition accuracy of 3D printer reach to 97.26%. Furthermore, contrast results indicated that the fault diagnosis accuracy of ESN is higher and most stable when compare with support vector machine (SVM), locality preserving projection support vector machine (LPPSVM) and principal component analysis support vector machine (PCASVM).

Data-driven fault diagnosis methods for vibration-based analyses in bearings are studied widely. However, the success of fault classification is based on sophisticated and complete training data. In this paper, an intelligent classification method based on statistical analysis and recursive quantitative analysis (RQA) is designed, which is trained and tested by different data sets containing artificial or real damage. In addition, the use of statistical indexes and/or RQA indexes are also compared by calculating its classification accuracy. Two classification structures, i.e. a multi-class SVM classifier and a multi-level two-class SVM classifier, are also compared.

With the advancement of manufacturing technology and the improvement of the level of intelligence, the physical failure of the conventional equipment in the daily operation of the system is rare, but the quality of the work-in-progress (WIP) is unqualified frequently. Especially the hidden functional failures such as reliability degradation of the final product have become increasingly prominent. How to model and characterize the functional failure of manufacturing systems has become a bottleneck restricting the application and development of holistic PHM (Prognostic and Health Management) technology of manufacturing systems. Therefore, a novel functional failure modeling and diagnostic strategy for intelligent manufacturing systems based on RQR chain is proposed in this paper, which includes the manufacturing system reliability (R) data, manufacturing process quality (Q) data and the produced product reliability (R) data. Firstly, the definition of the functional degradation process and principle of manufacturing systems is clarified from the perspective of RQR chain. Secondly, based on the established RQR chain, the functional fault connotation of manufacturing systems is defined, and the KPCs (key product characteristics) in the Bayesian network of integrated manufacturing systems are utilized. Big data are analyzed to model and predict the functional fault state of the running manufacturing systems. Thirdly, based on the relationship of RQR chain from right to left, the holistic functional fault diagnosis strategy is given. Finally, a case study of a manufacturing system for cylinder head is presented to verify the proposed approach.

DSSC can use little training samples with labels or a lot of unlabeled samples with a little of labeled samples to achieve an accurate classification. But it is a simple deep architecture and the number of input features should be small. So, fault feature extraction is conducted based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and sample entropy. And the bearing fault diagnosis method is designed based on DSSC and VMD finally. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The influence of size of training set and labeled samples are discussed. The experiment results show that the proposed method can make full use of massive unlabeled samples and little labeled samples and achieve fast and accurate bearing fault diagnosis, which can be extended to the online mechanical fault diagnosis.

Accurate performance prognostics of their remaining useful performance (RUP) can effectively avoid the occurrence of faults. This paper proposes a performance prediction method based on the output signal of the circuit, which only needs to monitor the output response of the circuit without monitoring the nodes inside the circuit. The RUP can be predicted by continuous monitoring of the output voltage. Particle filter algorithm, as one of the algorithms often employed in prediction, is found to have the biggest problem of particle degradation, which will reduce the diversity of particles and then affect the final prediction accuracy. This method monitors circuit degradation by collecting historical degradation data. In addition, the kernel smoothing algorithm is integrated into the particle filter algorithm to ensure that the particle variance unchanged with the circuit performance prediction model during the recursive propagation process. The model can be updated after obtaining new measurements. The analysis of two DC-DC converter circuits shows that the proposed prognostics scheme has good prediction accuracy for nonisolated DC-DC converters.

The performance of RUL prediction is mainly decided by the development of an appropriate health indicator (HI), which can accurately indicate the degree of degradation of the equipment. Therefore, we proposed an unsupervised method for HI construction based on deep belief network (DBN) by using multisensory historical data. Firstly, DBN is employed to describe the hidden representation corresponding to the healthy state. With the running of the system, its performance will decrease over time and the corresponding potential characteristics tend to be different. The deviation degree of degraded state can be used to establish HI so as to estimate the RUL. Finally, a case study is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the new method, where it can be seen that the new approach achieves better performance compared to traditional methods.

These will lead to a high maintenance cost and a huge economic loss. Thus, health monitoring and fault prognosis for bearings becomes increasingly important. Developing an effective health index (HI) will do help in these works. Hence, three different HIs are developed by using root mean square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Mahalanobis distance to reflect bearings' online health conditions. Four degradation models are constructed to estimate bearings remaining useful life (RUL) by using particle filter algorithm.

And the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is the core of the PHM. The data-driven RUL prediction methods are more favored because they can be developed faster and cheaper. However, the existing data- driven prediction models usually can only be used under the same data domain (DD), and they require a lot of labeled data to retrain a new prediction model. So a domain adaptation prediction model is more desirable. In this paper, a domain adaptation RUL prediction model is proposed by integrating the adaptive batch normalization (AdaBN) into deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). The improved AdaBN-DCNN model can not only improve the accuracy of the prediction, but also adapt to the prognostic tasks under different DDs. The sliding time window (TW) and the improved piecewise linear RUL function are also used in this paper to improve the prediction capability of the model. The proposed RUL prediction model is validated using the C-MAPSS turbofan engine dataset provided by NASA. The prediction results show that the proposed model not only has a strong predictive power but also adapts to different DDs.

This approach is tested on measurements obtained from an industrial centrifugal pump. The prognostic framework consists of determination of predication start point, sensor selection and fusion, and prognostics steps that lead to accurate RUL prediction. This approach first applies the canonical variate analysis (CVA) method to the pump for determining the prediction start time. We also present an approach for constructing a single-valued prognostic health indicator through the fusion of fault root-case variables. Moreover, the particle filter (PF) algorithm is deployed to improve the metabolism grey forecasting model (MGFM) to realize the prediction of both RUL and uncertainties.

The proposed framework consists of automatic determination of predication start point, sensor fusion, and prognostics steps that lead to accurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimations. This approach first applies the canonical variate analysis (CVA) approach for determining the prediction start time and constructing the prognostic health indicators (HIs). The similarity-based method is then employed together with the model-based particle filter (PF) algorithm to improve the predictive performance in terms of reducing the uncertainty of RUL and improving the prediction accuracy. The proposed framework can automatically construct HIs that are suitable for RUL prediction and offer higher prediction accuracy and lower uncertainty boundaries than traditional model-based PF methods. Our proposed approach is successfully applied on aircraft turbofan engines RUL prediction.

As they work in complex conditions, faults will occur sometimes. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the faults early. Traditional bearing fault diagnosis methods are often based on mechanism analysis and feature selection, and the process is relatively complicated. Deep learning methods, however, have the ability to extract and select features automatically, which greatly reduces the workload. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been successfully used in many fields, such as computer vision, voice recognition, medical diagnosis. In this paper, the end-to-end fault methods based on deep learning are proposed. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network and One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) are used to build the deep learning network architecture respectively. A methodology is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, including data preprocessing, network modeling, training, validation and testing.

The existing conventional algorithms for diagnosing rolling bearings rely on artificial feature extraction requiring a wealth of knowledge of signal handling, expertise and human efforts, lacking adaptability. With the capacity for learning features from original signals automatically, deep learning methods can solve the shortcomings of conventional diagnosis methods. This paper puts forward a deep learning method for rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on two-dimensional convolutional neural network, called 2dCNN-FD. The method has the capability of automatic feature extraction and robust noise tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate that comparing with other traditional diagnosis algorithms, the 2dCNN-FD model achieves high diagnosis accuracy and better robustness under different noise conditions.

Once a fault occurs, it will develop rapidly and seriously threaten the safety of train operation. Therefore, fault pattern recognition of axle box bearing is of great significance. The traditional diagnosis method of axle box bearing is based on vibration signal processing technology and trackside acoustic diagnosis, while the axle box bearing of high-speed EMU in China has not been equipped with acceleration sensors and not every line has been equipped with trackside acoustic diagnosis equipment. Therefore, this paper establishes a fault pattern recognition method based on onboard real-time temperature data of axle box bearing, which can effectively recognize the abnormal condition of a high-speed EMU axle box bearing or an axle box bearing sensor failure.

First, the vibration signal characteristics of satellite flywheel bearing under different faults are studied. Second, the time-domain signal graphs are constructed by combining vibration signals under multiple rotational speeds and used as feature input maps.

In the process of using mechanical equipment, there is often a phenomenon of downtime and the most of the reasons is that the related parts are faulty. As one of the foremost tasks of prognostic and health management (PHM) and condition based maintenance (CBM), the prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) for mechanical equipment is receiving more and more attention. By knowing the RUL of the equipment, it can play an important role in maintaining related equipment in advance. It is more effective than the traditional regular maintenance and post-repair maintenance, thus avoiding the occurrence of malfunctions and the reduction of property loss.

It is important to find out the fault characteristics of oil film instability and make early diagnoses. Numerical simulation and test were carried out on the double-span rotor test-bed so as to simulate the oil film instability of the actual machine. In the numerical calculation, the dynamic model of the test-bed was established by using Zhang Wen unsteady non-linear bearing oil film force model, which is based on the finite element method. Effects of different eccentricities on the system response were compared and analyzed. The influence of different eccentricity on the dynamic response of the system was analyzed by test. The results show that oil film instability can induce higher amplitude oil film oscillation frequency. The low frequency components caused by oil film instability dominate in the high speed region. Alone with increasing eccentricity, the amplitude of oil film oscillation frequency decreases. It restrains the influence of oil film oscillation on system operation to a certain extent. The fault characteristics provide a practical basis for identifying oil film instability in the future.

Vibration response characteristics of the system were obtained by the method of Newmark-beta numerical integration. The results show that the phenomenon of frequency locking occurs in the rotor system after airflow excitation, accompanied by the characteristics of combination frequencies; when the bearing clearance is larger, the unstable vibration caused by the larger bearing clearance can be restrained to some extent by the airflow excitation force at lower rotating speed. The chaotic characteristics of the bearing end are gradually strengthened by the influence of the airflow excitation. In the absence of airflow force, the amplitude of rotor is increased by enhancing the bearing clearance and contact angle, and the amplitude is reduced by raising balls number properly. In the presence of airflow force, the number of balls, bearing clearance and contact angle have a little effect on the amplitude due to the influence of airflow excitation. Therefore, the factors such as bearing skidding and axial load are considered, in order to reduce vibration, it is necessary to properly improve the processing accuracy of the rotating shaft in the bearing installation and select the bearing type with smaller contact angle. The results provide a theoretical basis for fault diagnosis with airflow excited vibration and rolling bearings selection of this kind of rotating machinery.

The diagnosis result gotten with uncertain information will not be accurate. Multi-source information fusion and fault identification based on cloud model and D-S evidence theory is studied in this paper. The rough set theory is used to screen and reduce the multiple fault attribute, then get the fewest fault features which also satisfy the diagnosis. The multi-source information are fused by the calculation of cloud parameters and evidence theory. At last, two kinds of rolling bearing fault databases from experiments are performed, and the diagnosis results have proved the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.

It is a significant guarantee to enhance the security and economy of complex systems such as aircraft engines. A new approach for aircraft engines RUL prediction is proposed to fully assess the health status of the engines. Firstly, the health indicator model is constructed by liner regression. Secondly, the improved grey model GM(1,1) is constructed based on the health indicator (HI). Finally, the system RUL is obtained by the improved GM(1,1) model. A case study is performed on C-MAPSS aircraft engine datasets examining the validity of approach proposed by us.

As a powerful neural network structure, recurrent neural network (RNN) has achieved very good results in the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation problem, because of its extraction of long-term dependency information from the historical sensor signal. This work focuses on a two-step method containing two RNN models for RUL estimation. A series prediction model is trained for predicting subsequent signal series from existing sensor signal sequences, whereas another model is trained for estimating RUL from the combination of the existing signal sequences and the predicted signal series. Better results are obtained by this method on FD-001 and FD-003 in NASA C-MAPSS dataset.

To overcome this difficulty, this paper presents a weak fault feature enhancement method of acoustic data for rolling bearings based on variational mode decomposition (VMD). Firstly, the acoustic data is decomposed into some band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMF) by the optimized VMD. Then an adaptive signal-to-noise ratio (ASNR) estimation method is proposed to determine the optimal BLIMF. Finally, the fault types of rolling bearings are identified through Hilbert envelope transform. Experimental results show that the presented method can effectively enhance the feature for early weak fault in rolling bearings with acoustic data.

The failure of rolling bearings on spindle is main cause of machine tool faults. Therefore, the significant focus of health management of CNC machine tools and other rotating machines is fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. In terms of the fault diagnosis, it is the most critical task to extracting bearing fault characteristics from vibration signals of rolling bearings. As a result, a new fault diagnosis method for bearing fault classification is proposed in this paper, which is built on the hierarchical entropy and improved Cuckoo Search-Support Vector Machine(CS-SVM). Firstly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition(EEMD) is adopted to decompose time domain vibration signals, aiming at eliminating modal confusion in empirical mode decomposition(EMD) method. Afterwards, the hierarchical entropy is chosen as fault feature parameters compared with sample entropy to construct feature vectors. In addition, the classification algorithm of multiple SVM optimized by the improved CS algorithm is utilized to identify rolling bearing fault modes. Finally, the proposed method is verified through the data taken from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center. The result demonstrates that the proposed method has promising performance and achieves accurate fault classification accuracy in rolling bearing fault diagnosis in comparison with other methods.

Considering the correlation between different sensors, this paper proposes a novel approach used for the detection of changes in machine condition. First, a prediction model is established using multiple regression, where a novel data description and prediction strategy is developed to make full use of the correlation. Residual analysis is then implemented to quantify the anomaly of investigated machinery. At last, decision making is made based on hypothesis testing. The proposed approach is evaluated by a representative condition monitoring application. Encouraging experimental results demonstrate that proposed approach has great potential in practical applications.

This paper adopted a genetic algorithm (GA) based on the cloud model (CM) to optimize traditional SVM for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery with dual optimization levels. The first optimization level is to use the CM to optimize crossover operators in GA (CM-GA), so as to obtain a faster search process and achieve more effective optimization results. The second optimization level is using CM-GA to optimize SVM. In addition, we have proposed an optimized framework of SVM model based on CM-GA for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. In the end we used two kinds of rolling bearing fault database for experiments and the diagnosis results have proved the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.

Aiming at the difficulty in fault feature extraction of diesel engine, a visualized method based on the texture enhanced block non-negative matrix factorization (TE-BNMF) is proposed. The method firstly performs time-frequency analysis on the collected cylinder head vibration signals; then the local binary pattern (LBP) method is used to re-encode the vibration spectrum based on the gray distribution. After that, we use block non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (BNMF) to directly extract the feature parameters of the generated local binary feature map. By using a classifier to perform pattern recognition on the above-mentioned coding matrix, the automatic diagnosis of diesel engine faults is achieved. This method was applied to the fault diagnosis of 6 typical operating conditions of diesel engines, which can get high and stable fault recognition accuracy. The experiments show that the TE-BNMF diesel engine visualized fault diagnosis method proposed in this paper can discovery rich information contained in the spectrum image of diesel engine vibration deeply and diagnose the valve clearance fault of the diesel engine adaptively.

For the existing research of RUL prediction, the impact of random failure threshold (RFT) has not been analyzed. To solve this problem, an RUL prediction method based on the Kalman filter is proposed. Firstly, a nonlinear Wiener degradation model is built in this paper. Then, the parameters of the degradation model are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method and the distribution coefficients of RFT are calculated by the expected maximum (EM) algorithm. In addition, the Kalman filtering technique is applied to renewal the degradation states by obtaining condition monitoring (CM) data. Finally, the analytical expression of probability density function (PDF) for the RUL is derived by considering the RFT. The simulation example shows that the method in this paper has advantages of RUL prediction, and thus can have potentially engineering application value.

However, most of them still have two deficiencies. (1) Traditional methods extract and select features manually according to a specific issue, but these features may be not appropriate for other tasks, leading to performance degradation of fault diagnosis. (2) Many studies assume that the dataset for model learning obey the uniform distribution as the testing dataset do, which seldom accords with the practice. To remedy these problems, we devise a novel framework for bearing fault diagnosis. First, the raw condition monitoring data are converted to 2D images with continuous wavelet transform. Then the classification model is learned with these 2D images, during which the transfer learning scheme, deep adaptation networks, is introduced for adapting the deep model trained with source data for use in new but related target domain. The presented approach is demonstrated with bearing condition monitoring information, and the results indicate it can identify bearing faults effectively under different operational conditions and has a higher accuracy than conventional approaches.

This paper proposes new fault characteristic parameters based on VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition) and DE (Dispersion Entropy). Firstly, VMD is adopted to decompose the vibration signal and obtain a set of IMF (intrinsic modal function). Second, the signals is reconstructed by some IMFs according to the mutual information criterion. Third, dispersion entropy of the reconstructed signal is calculated. Finally, DE is input as a eigenvalue to the PSO-SVM (particle swarm optimization and support vector machine) classifier to implement fault pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the features proposed in this paper can distinguish the three states of normal gear, sun gear spall and planetary gear spall with 100% accuracy.

The rolling element bearing faults are supposed to be detected and identified in time to reduce maintenance cost and enhance reliability. The traditional way of fault diagnosis depends on experts' knowledge and experience on the collected machinery vibration data. However, it is becoming more and more difficult to diagnose the health states of the complicated modern machines Using the conventional methods. Currently, with the rapid development of data-driven methods such as deep learning, more accurate diagnosis results have been obtained. While the data-driven methods have been widely used in the basic tasks where the concerned data are from the same distribution, the cross-domain diagnostic tasks are still challenging where distribution discrepancy exists between two different kinds of data. In this paper, a novel network for diagnostics is designed based on domain adversarial neural network, where the diagnostic knowledge learned from the domain for source data is transferred to the domain for the target data. Conditional domain adaptation is proposed to improve data alignments between domains in the learned sub-space. The experimental results on the popular CWRU dataset validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the cross-domain fault diagnosis network in this paper.

The traditional incipient fault detection models are generally built on offline data and unable to update timely for matching the online data of target bearing. Moreover, when using the anomaly detection algorithm represented by support vector data description (SVDD) for incipient fault detection, it is easy to cause high false alarm rate due to slight and anomalous fluctuation of online data. To solve the above problems, an incremental weighted support vector data description (IW-SVDD) is proposed for incipient fault detection of rolling bearing. First, we train an initial SVDD detection model based on a small amount of online data that exists at initial stage, and use this model to pre-detect the sequentially-arrived online data. Second, in order to adapt the detection model to the anomalous fluctuations of online data, we design a strategy to determine the sample state. This strategy divides the fluctuation of online data into four states: abnormal appears, abnormal appears in succession, abnormal disappears and abnormal re-appears. Then we assign proper weights on the corresponding samples in each state. Finally, we update training set repeatedly by replacing the earliest samples in the training set with the same amount of samples which violates KKT condition in pre-detection results. In this way, the detection model is re-trained in incremental mode. Experiment results on IEEE PHM Challenge 2012 show that the proposed IWSVDD model can effectively reduce false alarm rate with ensuring detection accuracy.

Therefore, it is particularly essential for estimating the health of lithium-ion battery accurately, especially in important fields such as aerospace, rail transit and satellite. For lithium-ion battery, the battery capacity is a health index (HI) that best reflects its performance degradation. By estimating the battery capacity, the health status of the lithium-ion battery can be clearly identified. However, there are technical barriers to the direct measurement of battery capacity in engineering, and many characteristics and capacities of lithium-ion batteries have abrupt changes, so that it is difficult to calculate the battery capacity accurately by formula calculation. In this paper, a new method of genetic programming combined model is proposed, which can calculate the capacity of lithium-ion battery by formulating multiple monitored features with a certain precision. Therefore, the functional relationship between multiple features and HI is well measured, which lays a good foundation for the subsequent life prediction of battery.

Dc arc fault brings great harm to the safe operation of power supply system. Wavelet transform (WT) is suitable for analyzing nonstationary signal, and multi-scale fuzzy entropy (MFE) is of excellent performance in detecting the uncertainty and complexity of the signal. The random fluctuation and uncertainty of current will be greatly enhanced when arc faults occur. This paper aims to elevate the property of detection of dc arc faults, WT and MFE are utilized to construct the fault features. Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is employed to be as the classifier to make the detection of dc arc faults. The result of the experiment shows the availability of the method this paper proposed.

However, the traditional machine learning algorithms usually fail to generalize to new input distributions, which may cause the classification accuracy drops dramatically. To overcome this deficiency, domain adaptation techniques can be employed for transferring and adapting source domain to target domain. In this paper, an effective unsupervised domain adaptation approach called subspace distribution alignment (SDA) is applied to the defect diagnosis of gearbox. Firstly, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is adopted for preprocessing the raw vibration signals into the frequency domain. Then, SDA algorithm is employed for mapping the source and target domain into the same subspace. In addition, the z-score normalization is applied to the source and target subspace. At last, the different fault types of gearbox are classified by the softmax regression classifier. The detection results show that our approach outperforms the other intelligent fault detection approaches listed in this paper.

It leads to many attentions by engineers and scholars who expect to accurately diagnosis their faults as early as possible to prevent chain accident. Many diagnosis methods are reported to process the cases under the constant speed or load, while the reality on this is often harsh and variable, which limits the accuracy of bearing diagnosis. To address this problem, an intelligent fault diagnosis model is put forward by combining the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the convolutional neural network (CNN), the former of which is used to transform the vibration signal in time domain to time-frequency domain and further forms inputs of the latter. Experimental data accumulated from six bearings under two conditions are applied to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the diagnosis model. The damages on the bearing outer or inner race are actually generated during the accelerated life time tests and are still at the early stage, which are quite different from artificial damages and make the accurate diagnosis harder. Analyses and comparisons of the experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and higher diagnosis accuracy of the intelligent diagnosis model.

Through the industrial robot system status monitoring and health prognostics, when maintenance is needed, this strategy of condition-based maintenance (CBM) can reduce unnecessary maintenance operations effectively, and reduce the overall maintenance cost. The health prognostics usually consists of data acquisition and processing, health indicator (HI) construction and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Industrial robots are complex systems composed of sensors, reducers, motors, servo drivers and controllers. In this paper, the methods of health prognostics are summarized from two aspects: component level and system level.

However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods are mostly founded on the feature extraction methods requiring extensive domain knowledge and experience, compared with deep learning approaches that can learn hierarchical representations automatically from data. Recurrent neural network (RNN) which can learn features from sequential data directly without any feature engineering has been proved to be effective in the research area of machine failure diagnosis. Therefore, an innovative fault diagnosis method for the wheelset bearings in the HSTs using Deep Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Network (DBLSTM) is proposed in this paper. Long Short-term Memory Network (LSTM), as an improved framework of Recurrent Neural Network, is able to overcome the gradient vanishing or exploding problem, capturing long-term dependencies effectively. In the DBLSTM, the bidirectional structure is applied to enhance the performance of the LSTM Network by capturing temporal information from both future and past contexts of input sequential data. In addition, by stacking multiple Bidirectional LSTM layers to build the DBLSTM network, for the vibration signals measured under the complicated environment, more complex fault features can be effectively learned. With the increasement of the depth of the network, the regularization method using recurrent dropout technique is introduced to relieve the problem of overrating and enhance the generalization ability of the deep network. The DBLSTM is assessed on the dataset of the wheelset bearings of the HSTs under different operating states. The experimental results indicate that the DBLSTM can accurately diagnose the fault mode of the wheelset bearings of the HSTs under strong noise, outperforming five existing deep learning methods used in fault diagnosis.

Sparse information about the engine configuration is used to adapt a performance model which serves as a baseline for implementing optimum sensor selection, operating data correction, fault isolation, noise reduction and component health diagnostics using nonlinear Gas Path Analysis (GPA). Degradation models which describe the progression of faults until failure are then applied to the diagnosed component health indices from previous run-to-failure cases. These models constitute a training library from which fitness evaluation to the current test case is done. The final remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is obtained as a weighted sum of individually-evaluated RULs for each training case. This approach is validated using dataset generated by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) software, which comprises both training and testing instances of run-to-failure sensor data for a turbofan engine, some of which are obtained at different operating conditions and for multiple fault modes. The results demonstrate the capability of improved prognostics of faults in aircraft engine turbomachinery using models of system behaviour, with continuous health monitoring data.

J	Eker, OF; Camci, F; Jennions, IK				Eker, Omer F.; Camci, Fatih; Jennions, Ian K.			A New Hybrid Prognostic Methodology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							LIFE PREDICTION; DIAGNOSTICS; MODEL	Methodologies for prognostics usually centre on physics-based or data-driven approaches. Both have advantages and disadvantages, but accurate prediction relies on extensive data being available. For industrial applications this is very rarely the case, and hence the chosen method's performance can deteriorate quite markedly from optimal. For this reason, a hybrid methodology, merging physics-based and data-driven approaches, has been developed and is reported here. Most, if not all, hybrid methods apply physics-based and data-driven approaches in different steps of the prognostics process (i.e. state estimation and state forecasting). The presented technique combines both methods in forecasting, and integrates the short-term prediction of a physics-based model with the longer-term projection of a similarity-based data-driven model, to obtain remaining useful life estimation. The proposed hybrid prognostic methodology has been tested on two engineering datasets, one for crack growth and the other for filter clogging. The performance of the presented methodology has been evaluated by comparing remaining useful life estimations obtained from both hybrid and individual prognostic models. The results show that the presented methodology improves accuracy, robustness and applicability, especially in the case of minimal data being available.

Hence, there is a need to complement the present onboard diagnostics method with a more reliable diagnostics method for adequate condition monitoring of the heavy duty construction equipment in order to improve uptime. Major components of the driveline (such as the gearbox, torque converter, bearings and axles) are components necessary to monitor. A failure among any of these major components of the driveline may result in the machine standing still until a repair is scheduled. In this paper, vibration based condition monitoring methods are presented with the purpose to provide a diagnostic framework possible to implement onboard for monitoring of critical driveline parts in order to reduce service cost and improve uptime. For the development of this diagnostic framework, sensor data from the gearbox, torque converter, bearings and axles are considered. Further, the feature extraction of the data collected has been carried out using adequate signal processing methods, which includes: Adaptive Line Enhancer and Order Power Spectrum respectively. In addition, Bayesian learning was utilized for adaptive learning of the extracted features for deviation detection. Bayesian learning is a powerful prediction method as it combines the prior information with knowledge measured to make updates. The results indicate that the vibration properties of the gearbox, torque converter, bearings and axle are relevant for early fault detection of the driveline. Furthermore, vibration provides information about the internal features of these components for detecting deviations from normal behavior. In this way, the developed methods may be implemented onboard for the continuous monitoring of these critical driveline parts of the heavy duty construction equipment. Thus, if their health starts to degrade a service and/or repair may be scheduled well in advance of a potential failure and in that way the downtime of a machine may be reduced and costly replacements and repairs avoided.

Several sensor signals are available for monitoring the changes in system components. Vibration signal is one of the most extensively used technique for monitoring rotating components as it identifies faults before the system fails. Early fault detection is the significant factor for condition monitoring, where Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor signals have been applied for early fault detection due to their high sensitivity and high frequency. In this paper, vibration and acoustic emission signals are acquired under various simulated gear and bearing fault conditions from the synchromesh gearbox. Then the statistical features are extracted from vibration and AE signals and then the prominent features are selected using J48 decision tree algorithm respectively. The best features from the vibration and AE signals are then fused using feature-level fusion strategy and it is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) classifiers and it is compared with individual signals for fault diagnosis of the synchromesh gearbox. From the experiments, it is observed that the performance of the fault diagnosis system has been improved for the proposed feature level fusion technique compared to the performance of unfused vibration and AE feature sets.

This one aims at increasing the operational availability and reducing the life-cycle while increasing the reliability and life expectancy of industrial systems. This maintenance also called predictive maintenance is a part of an emerging philosophy called PHM 'Prognostics and Health Management'. In this paper, the PHM will be emphasized on the existing diagnostic methods used for fault isolation and identification. This depicts an important part of the PHM as it exploits the data given by the signal processing step and its output is treated by the prognostic part. The diagnostic is mainly classified in three categories that will be highlighted in this paper.

In general, PHM systems use real-time and historical state information of subsystems and components of the operating systems to provide actionable information, enabling intelligent decision-making for improved performance, safety, reliability, and maintainability. Every year, a substantial number of papers in this area including theory and practical applications, appear in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. This paper aims to summarize and review researches, developments and recent contributions in PHM for automotive- and aerospace industries. It can also be considered as the starting point for researchers and practitioners in general to assist them through PHM implementation and help them to accomplish their work more easily.

Among these infrastructure failures in urban rail transit systems, the vast majority of them are triggered by railway point machines. Thus, fault detection and diagnosis should be well concerned to ensure traffic safety. In this paper, we propose to employ dynamic time warping and spectral clustering to handle this problem. Firstly, the dynamic time warping method is used to compare unequal sequences with phase-shifted shape. Secondly, the spectral clustering method is applied to deal with the classification problem without training steps. At last, simulation results demonstrate well performance of the proposed scheme.

Routines used are based on machine learning algorithms, which have to be trained first. In this contribution, a strategy for improved training is developed to increase the reliability of the training process with respect to the relevant detection and fault alarm parameters. Four algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) are used as examples. Three lane changing behaviors (left/right lane change and lane keeping) are modeled as classifications, and simulated on a highway scene using driving simulator. To improve the prediction performance of the related models, design parameters, which are unknown and need to be set manually before training, are modified. Using the proposed training procedure the most suitable design parameters can be determined automatically to optimize the performance of the algorithms. Based on data achieved from 7 different drivers four improved models are validated. The finally obtained results show that the prediction performance of the four algorithms can be improved using the proposed optimized training procedure.

An Intelligent Toolkit for Benchmarking Data-Driven Aerospace Prognostics	2019 IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (IEEE-ITSC)	OCT 27-30, 2019	Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	IEEE, Intel, Griffith Univ, Auckland Tourism Events & Econ Dev			CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; PREDICTION	Machine Learning (ML) has been largely employed to sensor data for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft components with promising results. A review of the literature, however, has revealed a lack of consensus regarding evaluation metrics adopted, the state-of-the-art methods employed for performance comparison, the approaches to address data overfitting, and statistical tests to assess results' significance. These weaknesses in methodological approaches to experimental design, results evaluation, comparison and reporting of findings can result in misleading outcomes and ultimately produce less effective predictors. Arbitrary choices of approaches for novel method's evaluation, the potential bias that can be introduced, and the lack of systematic replication and comparison of outcomes might affect the findings reported and misguide future research. For further advances in this area, there is therefore an urgent need for appropriate benchmarking methodologies to assist evaluating novel methods and to produce fair performance rankings. In this paper we introduce an opensource, extensible benchmarking library to address this gap in aerospace prognosis. The library will assist researchers to conduct a proper and fair evaluation of their novel ML RUL predictive models. In addition, it will assist stimulating better practices and a more rigorous experimental design approach across the field. Our library contains 13 state-of-the-art ML methods, 12 metrics for algorithm performance evaluation and tests for statistical significance. To demonstrate the library's functionalities, we apply it to gas turbine engine prognostic datasets.

These predictions drive the decisions on the equipment Operation and Maintenance (O&M), and these in turn influence the equipment degradation evolution itself. In this paper, we propose a novel PHM framework based on Sequential Decision Problem (SDP), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows properly considering this feedback loop for optimal sequential O&M decision making. The framework is applied to a scaled-down case study concerning a real mechanical equipment equipped with PHM capabilities. A comparison of the proposed framework with traditional PHM is performed.

J	Chao, MA; Kulkarni, C; Goebel, K; Fink, O				Chao, Manuel Arias; Kulkarni, Chetan; Goebel, Kai; Fink, Olga			Hybrid deep fault detection and isolation: Combining deep neural networks and system performance models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								With the increased availability of condition monitoring data on the one hand and the increased complexity of explicit system physics-based models on the other hand, the application of data-driven approaches for fault detection and isolation has recently grown. While detection accuracy of such approaches is generally very good, their performance on fault isolation often suffers from the fact that fault conditions affect a large portion of the measured signals thereby masking the fault source. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid approach combining physical performance models with deep learning algorithms. Unobserved process variables are inferred with a physics-based performance model to enhance the input space of a data-driven diagnostics model. The resulting increased input space gains representation power enabling more accurate fault detection and isolation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we generate a condition monitoring dataset of an advanced gas turbine during flight conditions under healthy and four faulty operative conditions based on the Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid methodology in combination with two different deep learning algorithms: deep feed forward neural networks and Variational Autoencoders, both of which demonstrate a significant improvement when applied within the hybrid fault detection and diagnostics framework. The proposed method is able to outperform pure data-driven solutions, particularly for systems with a high variability of operating conditions. It provides superior results both for fault detection as well as for fault isolation. For the fault isolation task, it overcomes the smearing effect that is commonly observed in pure data-driven approaches and enables a precise isolation of the affected signal. We also demonstrate that deep learning algorithms provide a better performance on the fault detection task compared to the traditional machine learning algorithms.

Accurate real-time RUL predictions enable equipment health assessment and maintenance planning. In this work, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network combined with global Attention mechanisms to learn RUL relationships directly from time-series sensor data. We use the NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPPS) datasets to assess the performance of our proposed method. We compare our approach with current state-of-the-art methods on the same datasets and show that our results yield competitive results. Moreover, our method does not require previous degradation knowledge, and attention weights can be used to visualise temporal relationships between inputs and predicted outputs.

J	Ducoffe, M; Haloui, I; Sen Gupta, J				Ducoffe, Melanie; Haloui, Ilyass; Sen Gupta, Jayant			Anomaly Detection on Time Series with Wasserstein GAN applied to PHM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							ONE-CLASS SVM	Modern vehicles are more and more connected. For instance, in the aerospace industry, newer aircraft are already equipped with data concentrators and enough wireless connectivity to transmit sensor data collected during the whole flight to the ground, usually when the airplane is at the gate. Moreover, platforms that were not designed with such capability can be retrofitted to install devices that enable wireless data collection, as is done on Airbus A320 family. For military and heavy helicopters, HUMS (Health and Usage Monitoring System) also allows the collection of sensor data. Finally, satellites send continuously to the ground sensor data, called telemetries. Most of the time, fortunately, the platforms behave normally, faults and failures are thus rare. In order to go beyond corrective or preventive maintenance, and anticipate future faults and failures, we have to look for any drift, any change, in systems' behavior, in data that is normal almost all the time. Moreover, collected sensor data is time series data. The problem is then anomaly detection or novelty detection in time series data. Among machine learning techniques that can be used to analyze data, Deep Learning, especially Convolutional Neural Networks, is very popular since it has surpassed human capacities for image classification and object detection. In this field, Generative Adversarial Networks are a technique to generate data similar to a potentially high dimension original dataset. In our case, generate new data could be useful to enrich the learning dataset with generated abnormal data to make it less unbalanced. Yet we are more interested in the potential of such techniques to perform anomaly detection for high dimensional data, comparing newly observed data with data that could have been generated from a distribution built from normal examples.

As automated classifiers are increasingly used in industrial control systems and machinery, these adversarial errors could grow to be a serious problem. Despite numerous studies over the past few years, the field of adversarial ML is still considered alchemy, with no practical unbroken defenses demonstrated to date, leaving PHM practitioners with few meaningful ways of addressing the problem. We introduce turbidity detection as a practical superset of the adversarial input detection problem, coping with adversarial campaigns rather than statistically invisible one-offs. This perspective is coupled with ROC-theoretic design guidance that prescribes an inexpensive domain adaptation layer at the output of a deep learning model during an attack campaign. The result aims to approximate the Bayes optimal mitigation that ameliorates the detection model's degraded health. A proactively reactive type of prognostics is achieved via Monte Carlo simulation of various adversarial campaign scenarios, by sampling from the model's own turbidity distribution to quickly deploy the correct mitigation during a real-world campaign.

Condition monitoring methods that require manual feature extraction and analysis, become infeasible on an industrial scale. Machine learning algorithms can be used to automatically detect and classify faults, however, obtaining sufficient data for training is required for deep learning and other data-driven classification approaches. Data from healthy machine operation is generally available in abundance, while data from representative fault- and operating conditions is limited. This limits both development and deployment of deep learning-based CM systems on an industrial scale. This paper addresses both the challenges of automated analysis and lack of training data. A deep learning classifier architecture utilizing 1-dimensional dilated convolutions is proposed. Dilation of the convolution kernel allows for analysis of raw vibration signals while simultaneously maintaining the receptive field of the classifier enough to capture temporal patterns. The proposed method performs classification in time domain on signal segments of 1 second or shorter. With knowledge of the bearing specification, artificial vibration signals with similar characteristics as an actual bearing fault can be created. In this work, generated fault signals are combined with healthy operational data to obtain training data for a deep classifier. Parameters of the vibration model is chosen as distributions rather than fixed values. By using a range parameters in the vibration model, the classifier learns to recognize temporal features from the training data that generalize to unseen data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by training classifiers on generated data and testing on real signals from faulty bearings at both low and high speed. One dataset containing seeded faults and three run-to-failure tests are used for the demonstration.

A Paradigm Shift from Telemedicine to Autonomous Human Health and Performance for Long-Duration Space Missions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								This paper discusses a Prognostics and Health Management [PHM]-based approach to implementing Human Health & Performance [HH&P] technologies. Targeted specifically are NASA's "Autonomous Medical Decision" and "Integrated Biomedical Informatics" of "Human Health, Life Support, and Habitation Systems" in Technology Area 06 [TA 06] of NASA's integrated technology roadmap [April 2012]. The proposed PHM-based implementation is to bridge PHM, an engineering discipline, to the HH&P technology domain to mitigate space travel risks by focusing on efforts to reduce countermeasure mass and volume, and drive down risks to an acceptable level. NASA's Autonomous Medical Decision technology is based on wireless handheld devices and is a result of a necessary paradigm shift from telemedicine to HH&P autonomy. The Integrated Biomedical Informatics technology is based on Crew Electronic Health Records [CEHR], equipped with a predictive diagnostics capability developed for use by crew members rather than by healthcare professionals. This paper further explores the proposed PHM-based solutions for crew health maintenance in terms of predictive diagnostics to provide early and actionable real-time warnings to each crew member about health-related risks and impending health problems that otherwise might go undetected. The paper also discusses the paradigm's hypothesis and its innovation methodology, as implemented with computed biomarkers. The suggested paradigm is to be validated on the International Space Station [ISS] to ensure that crew autonomy in terms of the inherent predictive capability and two-fault-tolerance of the methodology become the dominant design drivers in sustaining crew health and performance.

We propose a novel deep learning based approach for Prognostics with Uncertainty Quantification that is useful in scenarios where: (i) access to labeled failure data is scarce due to rarity of failures (ii) inherent noise is present in the sensor readings. The two scenarios mentioned are unavoidable sources of uncertainty in the RUL estimation process, often resulting in unreliable RUL estimates. To address (i), we formulate RUL estimation as an Ordinal Regression (OR) problem and propose LSTM-OR: deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network-based approach to learn the OR function. We show that LSTM-OR naturally allows for the incorporation of censored operational instances in training along with the failed instances, leading to more robust learning. To address (ii), we propose a simple yet effective approach to quantify predictive uncertainty in the RUL estimation models by training an ensemble of LSTM-OR models. Through empirical evaluation on the publicly available turbofan engine benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that LSTM-OR is at par with commonly used deep metric regression-based approaches for RUL estimation when sufficient failed instances are available for training Importantly, LSTM-OR outperforms these metric regression-based approaches in the practical scenario where failed training instances are scarce, but sufficient operational (censored) instances are additionally available. Furthermore, our uncertainty quantification approach yields high-quality predictive uncertainty estimates while also leading to improved RUL estimates compared to single best LSTM-OR models.

In this paper, an intelligent perception system of CNC machine tools is designed and implemented based on human-machine collaboration. With the application of wearable and mobile smart devices, such as Google Glasses and mobile phones, the system makes the information acquisition and data analysis capabilities of site-operator improved further more. A light deep learning model MobileNetV2 is used in this system, which can identify the key parts of the machine tools observed by the site-operator with the Google Glass. The various sensing data of the machine tools can be displayed visually via the screen of the Google Glass, so that site-operator can monitor them more conveniently. Finally, a fault response method for CNC machine tools based on human-machine collaboration is presented. The method improves the sensing capability and responding speed of site-operator by the collaboration of the smart glasses.

To detect such symptom, for each subject, our algorithm only needs to analyze 3 slices around the center of a MRI DICOM volume, i.e., mid-brain area. In each slice, a window covering the SN becomes the region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. The ROIs are pre-processed by denoising and removing intensity non-uniformity. Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Histogram Oriented Gradient (HOG) are used for feature extraction. Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used as classifiers with Principle Component Analysis (PCA) as feature reduction method. For evaluation, we use MRI T2 scans from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data set. We conducted experiments to illustrate the different classification capabilities of LBP, HOG and the fusion of these features for PD prognosis.

The settings in the microbiome data preprocessing stage can lead to the great variability of the generated operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tables, reflected in the size and sparseness of this data matrix. As there are still no solid guidelines on the best practices, it is valuable to assess which machine learning algorithms provide higher stability of results under variable preprocessing settings. In this study, we have generated OTU tables using data from the Moving pictures of human microbiome study using two different reference databases (Greengenes and Silva) and four levels of the similarity threshold (ranging from 90 to 99%), processed in the QIIME bioinformatics package. The results of the two best-performing classification and clustering algorithms are presented in detail: Random Forest classifier (RF) and Spectral clustering (SC). The random forest classifier has outperformed spectral clustering in terms of accuracy. As the rate of data generation increases, while the cost of labeling remains high, further improvement of clustering performance and ensemble approaches should be explored.

The aim is to exploit very accurate, robust image processing algorithms and provide quantitative information about the phenotypic differences of cancer traits. By exploring the association between this quantitative information and patients' prognosis, AI algorithms are boosting the power of radiomics in the perspective of precision oncology. However, the choice of the most suitable AI method can determine the success of a radiomic application. The current state-of-the art methods in radiomics aim at extracting statistical features from biomedical images and, then, process them with Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Many works have been reported in the literature presenting various combinations of radiomic features and ML methods. In this preliminary study, we aim to analyse the performance of a radiomic approach to predict prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness from multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mp-MRI). Clinical mp-MRI data were collected from patients with histology-confirmed PCa and labelled by a team of expert radiologists. Such data were used to extract and select two sets of radiomic features; hence, the classification performances of five classifiers were assessed. This analysis is meant as a preliminary step towards the overall goal of investigating the potential of radiomic-based analyses.

Scale-space DCE-MRI radiomics analysis based on Gabor filters for predicting breast cancer therapy response	2019 IEEE 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (BIBE)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering		English	Proceedings Paper	19th Annual IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE)	OCT 28-30, 2019	Athens, GREECE	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Gabor filtering; DCE-MRI; Radiomics; neoadjuvant therapy; machine learning	INVARIANT TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; PATHOLOGICAL RESPONSE; CHEMOTHERAPY; FEATURES	Radiomics-based studies have created an unprecedented momentum in computational medical imaging over the last years by significantly advancing and empowering correlational and predictive quantitative studies in numerous clinical applications. An important element of this exciting field of research especially in oncology is multi-scale texture analysis since it can effectively describe tissue heterogeneity, which is highly informative for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. There are however, several concerns regarding the plethora of radiomics features used in the literature especially regarding their performance consistency across studies. Since many studies use software packages that yield multi-scale texture features it makes sense to investigate the scale-space performance of texture candidate biomarkers under the hypothesis that significant texture markers may have a more persistent scale-space performance. To this end, this study proposes a methodology for the extraction of Gabor multi-scale and orientation texture DCE-MRI radiomics for predicting breast cancer complete response to neoadjuvant therapy. More specifically, a Gabor filter bank was created using four different orientations and ten different scales and then first-order and second-order texture features were extracted for each scale-orientation data representation. The performance of all these features was evaluated under a generalized repeated cross-validation framework in a scale-space fashion using extreme gradient boosting classifiers.	[Manikis, G.

This paper proposes a novel bearing remaining useful life prediction approach which puts emphasis on deriving effective features from raw vibration data. To enhance the degradation feature extraction, a non-recursive method named variational mode decomposition (VMD) is adopted to decompose the raw vibration data into several principal modes, then feature smoothing with a local regression filter is performed and some suitable features are selected by evaluating feature fitness using monotonicity and correlation analysis. Based on the selected features, long short-term memory (LSTM) network is introduced for bearings RUL prediction. Numerical experiments with real bearing dataset exhibit the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach in comparison to other data-driven approaches.

Depression is a disorder that results from a complex interaction of biological, psychological, and social factors, and it is known for having difficulties in both diagnostics and prognostics. Machine Learning techniques are increasingly and often used to classify or characterize different profiles of diseases. This paper presents a study about major depressive disorder among Brazilian's children and adolescents by using decision trees classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Network. A discussion about the identified attributes is presented, including, for instance, the great relation of suicidal thoughts with elevated symptomatology. Beyond that, the value of the evaluation method F-Measure, the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall, was above 88% for both classes, high and low symptomatology for depression; which reached values above 95% when used Multilayer Perceptron and SMO algorithms, they are based in Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine, respectively.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) are the two most commonly used methods for process monitoring. Nevertheless, PCA cannot deal with nonlinear data and KPCA cannot be applied for large data sets. To tackle the above two problems, a novel fault detection and fault diagnosis method based on Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (GBRBM) is proposed in this paper. The key idea of our approach is using GBRBM as a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique and applying the reconstruction error to establish monitoring SPE statistic. The upper limit of the SPE is estimated by kernel density estimation (KDE). If the SPE statistic of an online sample exceeds the control limit, then the fault is detected and the contribution plot is utilized to diagnose the fault. Tennessee Eastman (TE) process is applied to evaluate the fault detection and diagnosis performance of the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed GBRBM monitoring method is improved by saving significant memory requirement while obtaining the highest average false detection rate and comparable fault diagnosis reliability, relative to PCA and KPCA techniques.

In this research, more than one hundred literatures, relating to applying deep learning (DL) methodologies in advanced computer visions (2010 similar to 2018), are reviewed and analyzed. The objective is to discover the state-of-the-art DL methods, topics, and trends for CV and their practical applications. DL algorithms aim at representing multilevels of distributed neural networks. Because of the enhancement of high speed computational power, DL modeling, based on accumulated big data analytics, has found practical applications for non-supervised intelligent decision supports, such as detection of product defects and prognosis of machine malfunctions based on real-time signal or feature data analyses. There are a vast number of literature, describing DL related researches, developments, and implementations for problem solving. For the comprehensive mining of the related literature, we integrate Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), K-means (Clustering), and normalized term frequency-inverse document frequency (NTF-IDF) approaches to discover, or called technology mining, of the major trends in DL for computer visions, specifically for key applications in object detection, semantic segmentation, image retrieval, and human pose estimation.

Understanding the role of a Digital Twin in Integrated Vehicle Health Management (IVHM)	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 06-09, 2019	Bari, ITALY	IEEE			PROGNOSTICS	Integrated Vehicle health Management (IVIIM) aims to support Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) by monitoring, diagnosing, and prognosing the health of the host system. One of the technologies required by IVIIM to carry out its objectives is the means to emulate the functioning of the host system, and the concept of a Digital Twin (DT) was introduced in aerospace IVIIM to represent the functioning of such a complex system. This paper aims to discuss the role played by DT in the field of IVIIM. A DT is the virtual representation of any physical product, that is used to project the functioning of the product at a given instance. The DT is used across the lifecycle of any product, and its output can be customized depending upon the area of application. The DT is currently popular in industry because of the technologies like sensors, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, and advanced software, which enabled its development. This paper discusses what encompasses a DT, the technologies that support the DT, its applications across industries, and its development in academia. This paper also talks about how a DT can combine with IVHM technology to assess the health of complex systems like an aircraft. Lastly, this paper presents various challenges faced by industry during the implementation of a DT and some of the possible opportunities for future growth.

By applying standard supervised machine learning algorithms on raw sensor data along with non-standard semantic-based reasoning services, this approach enables resource-constrained components to produce rich and meaningful representations of real-world environments and events as in a log. The acquired knowledge is progressively enriched during object's lifetime and exposed to the outside world as in a blog, in order to trigger complex interactions through an advanced resource discovery. A case study of predictive maintenance and early results support the feasibility of the proposal to Industrial Internet of Things settings.

In order to solve the waste of performance data, in this study, a belief rule-based inference methodology using the evidential reasoning (RIMER) based RUL estimation process is proposed. Firstly, we take the principal component analysis (PCA) and the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to optimize the structure and parameter of the belief rule base (BRB), and then estimate the RUL of aero-engine through evidential reasoning (ER) algorithm. The practical case is investigated to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results show the RIMER based RUL estimation of aero-engine can support decision-making in the fields of aircraft prognostic and health management.

The approach relies on a physics of failure (PoF) model based on expert knowledge and data. The model can be represented as a multi-state Petri Net where different failure mechanisms have been discretized using physical degradation states. Each physical state can be detected by a unique combination of symptoms that are measurable using diagnostic tools. Based on actual diagnostic information, a diagnostic algorithm is used to identify active failure mechanisms and estimate their propagation using the Petri Net technique. Specific maintenance actions and their potential effects on the system can be associated with target states. A prognostic algorithm using a colored Petri Net propagates active failure mechanisms through the target physical states. A predictive maintenance approach is therefore proposed by allowing specific maintenance actions to be determined in a reasonable timeframe. A case study is presented for an actual hydrogenerator. Finally, model limits are discussed and potential areas for further research are identified.

J	Goebel, K; Smith, B; Bajwa, A				Goebel, Kai; Smith, Brian; Bajwa, Anupa			Ethics in Prognostics and Health Management	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								As we enter an era where intelligent systems are omnipresent and where they also permeate Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), the discussion of moral machines or ethics in engineering will inevitably engulf PHM as well. This article explores the topic of ethics within the PHM domain: how it is relevant, and how it may be addressed in a conscientious way. The paper provides a historical perspective on ethics-related developments that resulted in the formulation of engineering ethics codes, regulations, and policies. By virtue of these developments, ethics has already been encapsulated in PHM systems. The specific areas that have traditionally driven ethics considerations include safety and security, and they increasingly include privacy, proprietary considerations (protection of intellectual property), and environmental protection. During the course of future technology development, innovations will increasingly impact all of these topics. It is argued here that consciously embracing these issues will increase the competitive advantage of a PHM technology solution. As a guideline, specific ethics attributes are derived from professional engineering ethics codes, and a path towards insertion into a requirements flowdown is suggested.

This study uses a machine learning approach for the fault diagnosis study. A hydraulic brake system test rig was fabricated. The vibration signals were acquired from the brake system under different simulated fault conditions using a piezoelectric transducer. The histogram features were extracted from the acquired vibration signals. The feature selection process was carried out using a decision tree. The selected features were classified using fuzzy unordered rule induction algorithm (FURIA) and Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction (RIPPER) algorithm. The classification results of both algorithms for fault diagnosis of a hydraulic brake system were presented. Compared to RIPPER and J48 decision tree, the FURIA performs better and produced 98.73 % as the classification accuracy.	[Manghai, Alamelu T.

Automated Fault Detection of Wind Turbine Gearbox using Data-Driven Approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; BEARINGS; FEATURES	Wind turbine manufacturers have adopted condition monitoring systems to monitor and report a turbine's health and operating parameters to ensure that the system operates within its design specifications. While the present systems use specialized condition monitoring hardware to detect abnormal acoustic or vibration signals, it is not capable of pinpointing the exact location of the fault apart from isolating the system from which the signal originated. This drawback can be attributed to the requirement of powerful signal processors in order to decode the signal and efforts to train a system to identify the signal emitted by a faulty component. In the light of recent advancement of data-driven approaches and signal processing, these drawbacks can be overcome with increased computation power and sophisticated algorithms that foray into every integrated system. This paper reports such an investigation conducted on a miniature wind turbine planetary gearbox subjected to multi-component failures. The vibration signals were acquired using two accelerometers placed inside the gearbox. The speed of the gearbox was varied according to a simulated wind flow pattern. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the practicality of implementing data-driven approaches to categorise multi-component faults from a composite non-stationary signal. Short time Fourier transforms (STFT) coefficients were used as attributes by a set of data-driven algorithms to build machine learning models. Each model built was tested with a randomised set of instances which was reserved from the main dataset and tested multiple times by means of cross validation. The novelty in the paper entails a methodology which has been devised to classify faults using a randomised vibration dataset with little human intervention by means of machine learning algorithms. The authors propose that this methodology can also be used for real-time fault detection and classification for various machinery and components.	[Praveenl, Hemanth Mithun; Tejas; Sabareesh, G.

However, behind these advantages, there are hidden dangers. Once mechanical equipment goes wrong, the fault will affect production progress or the life safety of the people. It seems that the fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment is particularly important. In many rotating machinery, rolling bearings are widely used. If the early fault diagnosis can be offered to rolling bearing, then a lot of economic loss and personnel casualties will be avoided. Advocating the efficient security is an integral part to the modernization of engineering work. To define the fault type as soon as possible, this paper denoises the fault signal of rolling bearing by the KSVD dictionary learning algorithm, then the signal will be diagnosised by the BP neural network..

Based on this, a Multi-Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (MKELM) algorithm was proposed. Considering the parameter sensitivity characteristics of the MKELM, the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) was used to optimize the parameters.

The mechanical equipment fault detection is entering the age of 'big data' for much more monitoring points and sampling rate. Traditional diagnosis methods based on "signal processing feature extraction + machine learning classification" require a large amount of signal processing technology and diagnostic experience and can no longer meet the requirements of mechanical `big data'. To solve this problem, an important part bearing in mechanical equipment is taken as the research object, and a diagnosis method based on convolutional neural network is proposed. This method uses the vibration signal as the monitoring signal and uses the Fourier transform to generate the vibration signal spectrum picture as the input of the whole system. Using the powerful feature extraction capability of convolutional neural network can automatically complete fault feature extraction and fault identification. The results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the data, but also obtain higher identification accuracy than the existing methods.

These techniques are based on the motor current signature analysis (MCSA). The MCSA method was based on analyzing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the stator current to analyze the spectral content of the different signals. The precision of these techniques depends on the load and speed of the induction machine. The diagnosis and detection of the presence of static eccentricity faults by various techniques mentioned above, and it was performed analytically and practically.

Diesel generator set is very important for power supply applications. The research on automatic fault diagnosis of diesel generator set is of great significance for monitoring the operation status of diesel generator and timely maintenance. A deep convolutional auto-encoders based fault diagnosis for diesel generator set is developed. Convolutional auto-encoders replace the full-connected layers with convolutional layers, and provide a lower dimension latent representation to extract the invariable features for fault classification. The sensor data collected from diesel generator set are processed to form a dataset for training and test, and an architecture for deep convolutional auto-encoders is designed. The experimental results show that the deep convolutional auto-encoders based method has the best fault diagnosis performance in recall, precision, accuracy and F1-score than other learning based methods.

This extra complexity, added to the increasing vulnerability of transistors due to technology scaling, poses a great challenge since these effects have also been proven to affect ground-level safety-critical applications. To increase micro-architectural resilience, designers may adopt Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR), which offers full fault detection. However, given that DMR incurs in high area and energy overheads, we propose a design-time methodology aiming to achieve the best tradeoff between resilience and area overhead, decreasing DMR costs and maintaining acceptable detection levels for such a complex design. This is done by adopting the Knapsack Problem (KSP) as a heuristic to identify the optimal micro-architectural structures that should be duplicated to achieve target resilience with the smallest possible area overhead. By injecting over 800k faults in 12 significant micro-architectural structures of different versions of the complex Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) superscalar processor modeled with RTL accuracy, we compare this optimal strategy against a greedy one, showing that 90% of vulnerability reduction may be achieved with 50.6% and 107.8% area overheads for the optimal and greedy strategies, respectively.

Diagnostic Signs on the Basis of Characteristic Functions of Vibroacoustic Oscillations	OIL AND GAS ENGINEERING (OGE-2019)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Oil and Gas Engineering (OGE)	FEB 26-28, 2019	Omsk, RUSSIA	Omsk State Tech Univ, JSC Gazpromneft ONPZ				The paper deals with topical issues shaping the elements of the diagnostic signs system for reciprocating compressors malfunctions and defects. Diagnostic signs are formed on the basis of vibroacoustic signal parameters. Usually sensors are installed on the cylinder in the axial direction, on the compressor valves, on the crosshead, on the main bearing. For today, there are effective ways to assess the condition of components and parts of piston compressors on the parameters of the vibro-acoustic signal, which are developed by the authors of this work. The diagnostic signs are based on statistical parameters of the vibroacoustic signal such as the mean square value of the vibroacoustic signal, the quantile of the instantaneous values of the vibroacoustic signal, the spectral invariants of the envelope of the vibroacoustic signal. The first two groups of diagnostic signs are formed on the basis of statistical signal processing for different types of machines. Thus, these features can only be used for a certain type of piston compressors. According to the spectral invariants of the vibroacoustic signal envelope, the faults appearance and their dangers degree are evaluated regardless of the machine type. To increase certainty and reliability of diagnosis in this work, it is proposed to use the of the characteristic function modulus value for vibroacoustic signal instantaneous values for a given parameter of the characteristic function. Considering that the module of the characteristic function varies from 0 to 1, it can be assumed that the value of the characteristic will not depend on the signal and, accordingly, on the type of machine. In this case, the characteristic function of the vibroacoustic signal is used, which is obtained at certain intervals by the crankshaft rotation angle of the piston compressor in the lower and upper dead points. The probability density functions of the characteristic function modulus are determined for various states of the compressor. The boundary values of the characteristic function magnitude are obtained on the basis of probabilistic-statistical decision-making methods. Thus, the authors managed to obtain a diagnostic sign of faults and defects that do not depend on the absolute value of the vibroacoustic signal.	[Kudryavtseva, I. S.; Naumenko, A. P.; Odinets, A.

To measure the required engineering factors on any part of the pipeline, it is proposed to use an overhead piezoelectric sensor of the PD-6 type. The study results of the YAMZ-238 diesel engine fuel equipment with the use of the PD-6 sensor showed that at different speed and load conditions, when the cyclic fuel supply changes, the amplitude and the duration of the vibration signal change as well. This change is a valuable diagnostic parameter and allows determining the technical state of the high-pressure pump and injectors. The calculation method of cyclic fuel supply based on the nomogram and vibration signal analysis is given, that will allow determining the fuel consumption and engine efficiency when diagnosing. To record the movement of the needle, the inductive sensor located at the outlet of the injector is recommended.	[Salikhov, R. F.; Makushev, Y. P.; Musagitova, G.

Multi-Factor Model of Diagnostic Signals Parameters Vector Formation for Run on Variables Loading-Speed Modes Machines	OIL AND GAS ENGINEERING (OGE-2019)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Oil and Gas Engineering (OGE)	FEB 26-28, 2019	Omsk, RUSSIA	Omsk State Tech Univ, JSC Gazpromneft ONPZ				The main and most important direction in the strategy for improving the operational reliability of the dynamic equipment mining, processing industries, production and transport industry is meeting the challenge of timely detection of and localization defects at an early stage of their development. This approach ensures the improvement of technology maintenance and repair, reduce operating costs and improve availability factor. To implement measures to improve reliability and safety, dynamic equipment at the facilities of the petrochemical production and transport complexes has been equipped with various condition monitoring systems for more than twenty years. The amount of information received by systems is usually great. However, the information quality is more important than its volume for accurate and timely recognition of error conditions and monitoring the development of faults in time. Therefore, an important task is to establish the diagnostic signs informative, determine their relationship with the relevant faults classes, as well as to establish the pattern of diagnostic signs changes in time in order to predict the moment of transition of nodes to the limit state. The model of the diagnostic signal parameters vector formation is presented in this paper. This model takes into account the influence of concomitant factors on some parameters values. These parameters values depend both on the object state as well as on a number of concomitant processes and their parameters. In terms of the problem, the concomitant factors can be divided into two groups: controlled and uncontrolled. The controlled factors measurement can be carried out in parallel with the diagnostic signal parameters measurement. The uncontrolled factors are parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure. The uncontrolled factors include all kinds of environmental fluctuations. The theoretical relationship between the technical condition and the diagnostic signal parameters, taking into account the influence of concomitant factors is described by presented diagnostic model.

There have been some work aims at reducing the subjectivity and labor intensity of cytologists with machine learning methods. In this paper, a robust CTCs detection algorithm based on improved Faster R-CNN network is proposed. Special efforts have been devoted to detection of single CTC for improved sensitivity, which is more favorable in real applications. Firstly, a whole slide image preprocessing algorithm is proposed based on statistical analysis of the self-constructed CTCs database. Then, an anchor adjustment and extension method is proposed to alleviate the imbalance between limited number of positive CTCs examples and huge amount of negative normal cells. Experimental results carried out on the self-established CTCs database show that the proposed algorithm demonstrates improved performance in CTCs detection.

More than 90% of people with this condition are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is now the leading cause of blindness, end-stage renal failure, non-traumatic limb amputations, heart disease, and stroke. Due to the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in recent years, the prognosis and early diagnosis of the disease have gained much importance. In this paper a study on the types of diabetes is made and a model is proposed and developed for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method.

Here, we performed an analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation450K data from TCGA to identify DNA methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis. We examined the DNA methylation landscape of lung adenocarcinoma and investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and clinical features. We then extracted differentially methylated cytosines in CpG island promoter regions, and then adopted machine learning techniques to determine the final methylation markers. As a result, we identified three methylation subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, and found that the methylation status was not significantly related with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. We finally identified two novel lung adenocarcinoma methylation markers including cg14823851 (TBX4) and cg07792478 (MIR124-2) with the AUCs of 100%, 100%, 98.3%, and 100% on support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, respectively. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential use of methylation markers in lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis and may boost the development of new epigenetic therapies.

However, owing to the problem called catastrophic forgetting, the networks tend to forget the former knowledge. Thus, it is evident that overall classification performance has fallen, when training the existing model with new classes. We propose classification model that retains previous information using generative pseudorehearsal networks. In this method, newly arrived fault classes could be trained on same network which is parameterized by former data. The proposed method shows significant experimental results comparing to non-incremental methods, while achieving memory efficiency and solving the class imbalance problem.

Two identical 0.25 HP induction motors under healthy, single- and multi-fault conditions were tested in the lab with different VFD output frequencies and motor loadings. The stator current and the vibration signals of the motors were recorded simultaneously under steady-state for each test, and both signals are evaluated for their suitability for fault diagnosis. The signal processing technique, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), is chosen in this paper to extract features for machine learning. Four families of machine learning algorithms in the MATLAB Classification Learner Toolbox, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), k -nearest neighbors (KNN), and ensemble, with twenty classifiers are evaluated for their classification accuracy when used for fault diagnosis of induction motors fed by VFDs. To allow fault diagnosis for untested motor operating conditions, the feature calculation formulas are developed through surface fitting using experimental data of a range of tested frequencies and loadings of the motor in order to provide training data for untested conditions.

To this end this paper investigates the input data and machine learning techniques required for day-behind predictions of PV generation, within the scope of conducting informed maintenance of these systems. Five years of PV generation data at hourly intervals were retrieved from four commercial building-mounted PV installations in the UK, as well as weather data retrieved from MIDAS. A support vector machine, random forest and artificial neural network were trained to predict PV power generation. Random forest performed best, achieving an average mean relative error of 2.7%. Irradiance, previous generation and solar position were found to be the most important variables. Overall, this work shows how low-cost data driven analysis of PV systems can be used to support the effective management of such assets.

The finite element method (FEM) offers a great insight of the fundamental principle and demonstrates physical operation of the machine more thoroughly than analytical approaches. It elaborates the machine's complex geometry and illustrates electromagnetic properties of induction motor precisely. It considers nonlinear effects of the machine, and determines the machine parameters such as the magnetic field distribution, flux linkage, electromagnetic torques, and flux density. In this paper, a literature review is conducted on finite element method under consideration of fault diagnosis techniques for induction motors.

The within-class data has a similar distribution, while between-class data has some distinction in different forms. Feature selection utilizes the difference between two-class data to reduce the number of features in the training models. A large amount of feature selection methods have widely used in different fields. This paper proposes a novel feature selection method based on the Kullback-Leibler distance which measures the distance of distribution between two features. For fault diagnosis, the proposed feature selection method is combined with support vector machine to improve its performance. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and superior of the proposed feature selection method, and the proposed diagnosis model can increase the detection rate in chemistry process.

Generally, intelligent methods are preferred to estimate PV power since they are more compatible with nonlinear problems. This paper presents a comparison of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for PV power estimation. Temperature and power measurements obtained from a PV plant in Sanliurfa are employed as data set to test the methods. The results have been analyzed for sunny, mid-cloudy and cloudy days in summer. The results reveal that ELM has a better performance than SVM in terms of the accuracy of PV power estimation.

They require continuous monitoring to prevent the premature failure, of which bearing faults account for most of the causes. The bearings in the rotary equipment tend to suffer fatigue failures during certain conditions such as load variation or electrical discharge. The fault detection based on the vibration analysis could be found in lots of previous literatures, and the frequency spectrum was usually adopted to identify the fault characteristic frequency. However, previous method could only detect the occurrence of bearing faults rather than making the prediction. Hence in this study, the time and frequency features were extracted to construct regression models to predict the development of the bearing faults.

The last decade, with the advent of dynamic machine-to-machine infrastructures, the goal is forced to be ensured in safety and reliability of physical processes at cyber system. Due to the increased mobility of topology and the growing amount of data (Big Data) undergoing the processing, traditional methods of system analysis become ineffective, so the researchers are faced with the task of creating new methods for ensuring cyber security that meet new challenges. This paper outlines the essence of the approach to the detection of weaknesses caused by failures of the components of cyber physical infrastructure. The paper discusses a method of data-driven analysis for failure detection and prediction. The proposed technique is based on the modified 'k' method of nearest neighbors (KNN) extended with application of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory and our suggestion to estimate the spatial-temporal correlation of the connected devices in the cyber physical environment. Our method shows above 99%-level of effectiveness comparing to common fault management approaches.

According to WHO data published in 2017, breast cancer deaths in Indonesia reached 21,287 or 1.27 % of total deaths. Delay in knowing of the condition of breast cancer in women with breast cancer, results in increased mortality, poor prognosis, and decreased survival rates, which are also associated with lower awareness of breast cancer, and also recommended non-adherence to screening. In this paper, we propose a random forest for breast cancer prediction. Random forest is one of many classification techniques, and it is an algorithm for big data classification. Random forest classification is applied to cancer microarray data to achieve a more accurate and reliable classification performance. The accuracy in this paper is 100 %.	[Octaviani, T.

A distributed process can be considered, where an Original Equipment Manufacturer supplies services based on data collected from the machines of its clients. Examples of services are those implementing anomaly detection and predictive maintenance techniques. Data on which remote services are based, as well as their execution logic, must be transparently shared among participants, to enforce trust among OEM and its clients. The goal of this paper is to propose an approach where blockchain technology and Smart Contracts are used to ensure the required level of trust when implementing the aforementioned services. Events occurring on monitored machines are stored as transactions in a blockchain-based system, to ensure non repudiation of data on which remote services are based. Moreover, trust-demanding tasks in the execution logic of services are considered to design Smart Contracts, that guarantee the required level of trustworthiness among participants. The example featuring Remote Monitoring Services for anomaly detection is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

A critical failure in the powertrain system, e.g. electric machine, would lead to breakdown of the vehicle. To avoid this dangerous situation, the critical faults should be detected at an early stage. This paper focuses on three common faults in the stator of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). Based on analytical models, the physical behaviors of the electrical machine within these three faults are analyzed. Then, a data-driven diagnostic method, artificial neural network(ANN), to detect and classify these faults is presented. Simulation data of electric machine under healthy and faulty conditions as well as at different operating points are used to train the ANN model. The three phase currents of PMSM and the inverter input current are selected as input signals of model. Various features in time domain(e.g. average, maximum,...) and frequency domain(e.g. 2nd, 3rd harmonics) are extracted from the selected signals. The result shows that the fault diagnostic model is capable of classifying the faults with near perfect accuracy over 98%, even in case of slight fault. Finally, a driving cycle simulation is used to validate the robustness of the ANN model in dynamic driving situations.

The current state-of-the-art in signal processing often leads to a large quantity in health indicators thanks to the multiple potential pre-processing steps. Such large quantities of indicators become unfeasible to inspect manually when the data volume and the number of monitored turbines increases. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid analysis approach that combines advanced signal processing methods with machine learning and anomaly detection. This approach is investigated on an experimental wind turbine gearbox vibration data set. It is found that the combination of physics -based statistical indicators with machine learning is capable of detecting planetary gear stage damage and significantly simplifying the data analysis and inspection in the process.

The methodology merges a machine learning and pattern recognition approach, called logical analysis of data (LAD), with non-parametric cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). It considers the condition monitoring data collected from a system that experiences several competing failure modes over its life span. LAD is used as a non-statistical classification technique to detect the actual state of the system, based on the condition monitoring data. The CIF provides an estimate for the marginal probability of each failure mode in the presence of the other competing failure modes. Accordingly, the assumption of independence between the failure modes, which is essential in many prognostic methods, is irrelevant in this paper. The proposed methodology is validated using vibration data collected from bearing test rigs. The obtained results are compared to those of two common machine learning prediction techniques: the artificial neural network and support vector regression. The comparison shows that the proposed methodology has a stable performance and can predict the remaining useful life of an individual system accurately, in the presence of multiple failure modes.

In light of recent advances in neuroimaging and multi-omics, more and more biomarkers associated with psychiatric diseases and treatment responses are being discovered in precision psychiatry applications by leveraging machine learning and neural network approaches. In this article, we focus on the most recent developments for research in precision psychiatry using machine learning, deep learning, and neural network algorithms, together with neuroimaging and multi-omics data. First, we describe different machine learning approaches that are employed to assess prediction for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in various precision psychiatry studies. We also survey probable biomarkers that have been identified to be involved in psychiatric diseases and treatment responses. Furthermore, we summarize the limitations with respect to the mentioned precision psychiatry studies. Finally, we address a discussion of future directions and challenges.

In this chapter, we present the most classic methods used to infer large-scale brain connectivity based on functional MRI. We adopt a modeling perspective where every connectivity measure is linked to a specific model that allows to interpret the connectivity estimate. This perspective allows to analyze the quality of retrieved connectivity profiles in terms of modeling error and estimation error. In the first part of the chapter, we present undirected functional connectivity (Pearson's correlation and MI) and effective connectivity (partial correlation), as well as directed effective connectivity (VAR, MOU, Granger causality, DCM). In addition, some of these measures correspond to fully connected graphs (Pearson's correlation) while others to sparse ones (MOU, DCM), where the sparsity can come from the integration of functional and structural data. In the second part, we claim that machine learning tools are better suited than null-hypothesis testing to link the estimated connectomes with diagnosis and prognosis of neuropsychiatric diseases. Finally, we propose that linear models and features selection are preferable to more complex and nonlinear tools (when prediction performance is on a par) for building interpretable algorithms to predict clinical variables.

SEISMIC RTDT: REAL-TIME DIGITAL TWIN FOR BOOSTING PERFORMANCE OF SEISMIC OPERATIONS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 38TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2019, VOL 7A	Proceedings of the ASME International Conference on Ocean Offshore and Arctic Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	38th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE 2019)	JUN 09-14, 2019	Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, SCOTLAND	ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div, Univ Strathclyde, Dept Naval Architecture Ocean & Marine Engn	Univ Strathclyde		STATE ESTIMATION	Here, we present the R&D project Real-Time Digital Twin for Boosting Performance of Seismic Operations, which aims at increasing the overall operational efficiency of seismic vessels through digitisation and automation. The cornerstone in this project is the development of a real-time digital twin (RTDT) a sophisticated mathematical model and state estimator of all the in-sea seismic equipment, augmented with real-time measurements from the actual equipment. This provides users and systems on-board the vessel with a live digital representation of the state of the equipment during operations. By combining the RTDT with state-of-the-art methods in machine learning and control theory, the project will develop new advisory and automation systems that improve the efficiency of seismic survey operations, reduce the risk of equipment damage, improve health monitoring and fault detection systems, and improve the quality of the seismic data. This will lead to less unproductive time, reduced costs, reduced fuel consumption and reduced emissions for a given operational scope. The main focus in this paper is the presentation of today's challenges in offshore seismic surveys, and how state-of-the-art technology can be adopted to improve various operations. We discuss how simulation technology, machine learning and live sensor measurements can be integrated in on-board decision support and automation systems, and highlight the importance of such systems for designing the complex, autonomous offshore vessels of the future. Finally, we present some early results from the project in the form of two brief case studies.

Firstly, the lung tumor area was segmented and features were extracted. Secondly, the extracted feature data was optimized for removing redundant features. Then, the optimized feature data and the patient's prognosis were taken as input, the data was trained using a machine learning method, and a predictive analysis model was constructed to predict the prognosis of the non-small cell patient. Finally, experiments were designed to verify the performance of the prognostic recurrence analysis model. A total of 157 patients with non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled in the study. The experimental results showed that the predictive accuracy of the prognostic recurrence model of random forest classifier based on CT imagery grayscale, shape and texture is as high as 84.7%, which can effectively assist doctors to make more accurate prognosis for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This model can help doctors choose treatment and review methods to prolong the patient's survival.

J	Xia, SQ; Zhang, JH; Ye, SG; Xu, B; Huang, WD; Xiang, JW				Xia, Shiqi; Zhang, Junhui; Ye, Shaogan; Xu, Bing; Huang, Weidi; Xiang, Jiawei			A Spare Support Vector Machine Based Fault Detection Strategy on Key Lubricating Interfaces of Axial Piston Pumps	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Axial piston pumps; multiple fault detection; one against all; spare support vector machine	DAMAGE DETECTION; HYDRAULIC PUMP; DIAGNOSIS; DECOMPOSITION; EXCITATION; SIGNALS	Fault detection of axial piston pumps is of great significance to improve the reliability and life of fluid power systems. However, it is difficult to detect multiple faults on key lubricating interfaces due to the liquid-solid coupling. This paper proposes a fault detection strategy of the three key lubricating interfaces based on the one against all (OAA) and spare support vector machine (SSVM). The parameter sparsity is imposed to deal with the performance degradation of OAA-SVM model as a result of the imbalanced dataset. Experimental investigations on the benchmark dataset and axial piston pumps are carried out. Results show that the OAA-SSVM model accuracies of the benchmark dataset and axial piston pump are 96.67% and 95.83%, respectively, which are better than the OAA-SVM model. The recall rates of the bearing fault 3 and pump fault 2 can decrease by 13.33% and 10.00%, respectively. And the false discovery rates of the normal bearing and normal pump can be reduced by up to 7.58% and 6.24%, respectively. Besides, the OAA-SSVM model can improve the feature sparsity. Results show that the proposed method is effective in detecting multiple faults of axial piston pumps.

J	Ram, PK; Kuila, P				Ram, Pintu Kumar; Kuila, Pratyay			Feature selection from microarray data : Genetic algorithm based approach	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION & OPTIMIZATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Feature Selection; T-score; F-score; GA; Microarray Technology	CLASSIFICATION; RELEVANCE	The use of microarray data for the feature (gene) selection is continuously increasing in the field of health care to diagnose the disease. Now it becomes a trend to find the subset of feature by using traditional algorithms. Most of the researches have used intelligent algorithm for the same to predict the diseases and take necessary action as per the requirement. In addition, a minimum feature set can be useful to prognosis the disease in contrast to a huge feature set. Inspired by this, we built a model based on genetic algorithm to select the minimum feature set with high accuracy from large microarray data. We have applied the machine learning classifier to get the accuracy of the features. For experimental analysis, we use the cancer based microarray gene expressed data and compare the simulation result with Differential Evolution.

J	Cao, LX; Qian, Z; Zareipour, H; Huang, ZK; Zhang, FH				Cao, Lixiao; Qian, Zheng; Zareipour, Hamidreza; Huang, Zhenkai; Zhang, Fanghong			Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Gearbox Based on Deep Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Under Time-Varying Non-Stationary Operating Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; wind turbine gearbox; bi-directional long short-term memory; time varying non-stationary operating condition	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PLANETARY GEARBOX; DECOMPOSITION; SELECTION; FILTER; CRACK	Fault diagnosis of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes can reduce unexpected downtime and maintenance costs. In this paper, a new fault diagnosis framework is proposed based on deep bi-directional Long Short-term Memory (DB-LSTM). Even though deep learning has been used in fault diagnosis of rotating machines, deep learning diagnosis models with the input of raw time-series or frequency data face computational challenges. Additionally, the deviation between datasets can be triggered easily by operating condition variation, which will highly reduce the performance of fault diagnosis models. However, in most studies, several constant operating conditions (e.g., selected some rotational speeds and loads) are used in the experiments, which may not reflect time-varying non-stationary operating conditions of WT gearbox and cannot be applicable in real-life applications. In this work, the experiments are designed that the real rotor speed of WT spindle input to the WT drivetrain test rig to simulate the actual time-varying non-stationary operating conditions. Ten common time-domain features are all fed into the DB-LSTM network to construct fault diagnosis model, which eliminates the need for selecting suitable features manually and improves training time. Vibration data collected by three accelerometers are used to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

It is significant to diagnose motor component faults accurately and quickly. In this paper, we propose an efficient and responsive motor fault diagnostic method based on Feature Incremental Broad Learning (FIBL) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Firstly, we extract fault features from raw signals with Particle Swarm Optimization-Variation Model Decomposition, Sample Entropy and Time Domain Statistical Features. Secondly, these features are input into a broad learning system to train a network. Then we use FIBL to retrain the network if the diagnosis accuracy is unsatisfactory. Finally, SVD is used to further simplify the system structure to reduce diagnostic errors. In order to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic system, experiments are conducted. Experimental results show that with the proposed diagnostic method, motor component faults detection is quicker and more accurate.

The use of a wrapper implies that each time a candidate solution is explored, the classifier is evaluated on the quality measures selected (e.g. accuracy or precision). Though robust, this iteration across several candidate solutions can become computationally intensive and time-consuming. In this paper we propose a wrapper, that is based on binary Covering Arrays (CAs), and binary Incremental Covering Arrays (ICAs), that have been widely used for experimental design and fault detection in software and hardware testing. The new wrapper was evaluated with six classifiers on seven data sets. The results show that the CAs and ICAs with strength 6 significantly improve the performance and reduces the number of variables required by the classifier. A comparative analysis of the proposed method against wrappers based on other search approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), shows that the proposed method yields results similar to GA, but not to PSO, with differences to PSO, in accuracy, which in the majority of cases is below 0.04. This lack of accuracy, by which the new wrapper fails to match PSO, is offset by the fact that the user does not need to fine tune algorithm parameters, such as velocity ranges, timing, cognitive coefficient, and social coefficient, while it is also much easier to program in parallel.

This work presents a novel initial fault diagnosis framework based on sliding window stacked denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. In this approach, multiple vibration value of the rolling bearings are entered into SDAE by sliding window processing. Then, multiple vibration value of the rolling bearings of the next period is predicted from the signal reconstructed by the trained SDAE in the previous period using LSTM. For the given input data, the reconstruction errors between the next period data and the output data generated by trained LSTM are used to detect initial anomalous conditions. The proposed method not only utilizes the ability of SDAE to learn the inherent distribution of data, but also ensures that LSTM can extract timing relationships between data cycles, and the model is built using only normal data. The initial fault detection as a key difficulty in the operating condition monitoring and performance degradation assessment of the rolling bearing is effectively solved. Experimental and classic rotating machinery datasets have been employed to testify the effectiveness of the proposed method and its preponderance over some state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results indicate that the proposed method can effectively detect the initial anomalies of the rolling bearing and accurately describe the deterioration trend with strong robustness, and have high significance for maintenance guiding.

To detect the abnormal state of spacecraft electronic load systems, complex electrical signals should be processed rapidly and accurately. For the fault detection of spacecraft electronic load systems, a robust unsupervised clustering analysis method and an accurate supervised classification method are of great importance. However, the traditional machine learning methods have poor performance when processing high-dimensional signal data because of the lack of ability to extract complex features from the signals. Therefore, neural-network-based deep learning (DL) models which can extract features from signals automatically are more suitable in this situation. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module, the multi-branch residual module with dilated convolutions (MRD module), is proposed to extract multi-scale features from the electrical signal. Then, a well-designed CNN model named MRD-CNN is presented for the supervised classification task of signal. Furthermore, for the unsupervised clustering task, the clustering variational autoencoder with MRD modules (MRD-CluVAE) is proposed. The MRD-CluVAE can extract high-quality features from signal data and output the clustering results directly. To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, comparisons among the proposed models and other baseline algorithms are carried out. The experimental results show that the MRD-CNN model achieves higher classification performance and stability, while the MRD-CluVAE has a higher clustering accuracy than other algorithms. These methods can be utilized to resolve the classification and recognition problems of spacecraft electronic load signals.

In the event of a faults, relying solely on labor to observe the indicator diagrams and determine the fault will waste a lot of human and financial resources. If it is not discovered in time, it will cause serious damage to oil exploitation, even shutdown. Indicator diagrams can reflect the working state of the rod pumping well, which can effectively reflect various faults of the pumping well. This paper diagnoses the faults of pumping wells by classifying and identifying the indicator diagrams. Because support vector machine (SVM) has good effect on classification and recognition of small sample data and nonlinear data, this paper uses SVM for classification, and uses the chicken swarm optimization (CSO) to optimize support for the problem that the SVM parameters are difficult to determine. Aiming at the problems of traditional CSO in solving high-dimensional optimization problems, such as premature and rough precision, an improved CSO is proposed. The traditional CSO, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and bat algorithm (BA) are used to compare it. The simulation proves that the improved CSO has good optimization effect and is superior to the other three optimization algorithms.

Most of the previous methods deem the abnormal signal detection an issue of signal analysis, but this strategy may be ineffective due to the high noise in the original data. Aiming to solve this problem, this study regards abnormal signal detection as an issue of image classification, such that advanced image noise removal and feature representation methods can be investigated with the aim of improving abnormality detection accuracy. Excellent deep learning-based image classification methods are investigated in this study, which can directly output classification results using original data and avoid the interference of the artificial factor. However, the deep image network may be unsuitable to the nature of the vibration signal, which significantly affects the generalization and accuracy of detection results. Aiming to solve this problem, a novel deep architecture is proposed in this study to improve abnormal signal detection in terms of correctness and efficiency. Consequently, a novel abnormal signal detection method is proposed by combining the time-frequency map and our deep learning architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that the time-frequency map can extract representative abnormality features, and our deep learning method can improve the classification capability. The detection correction of our method is observed to be consistently higher than 99.90% for different databases, and the time cost of our method is bearable at the same time. The main contribution of our method lies in that it investigates and optimizes advanced deep learning architectures for abnormal signal detection.

Ensemble noise-reconstructed EMD (ENEMD) is an intelligent method by the nice integration of adaptively decomposing and naturally denoising. However, ENEMD still suffers from such issues as the false possible noise-only IMFs and the universal minimax threshold, reducing the precision of the critical noise estimation for the weak feature extraction. Thus, the dual-mode noise-reconstructed EMD method is proposed for weak feature extraction and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. First, the possible noise-only IMF selection rule is redesigned according to the noise characteristic and the correlation evaluation, to eliminate the redundant slowly oscillating IMFs mistakenly chosen for noise estimation. Second, the adaptive local minimax threshold is proposed in the noise estimation technique for the low SNR signal, to overcome the drawback of additionally keeping some critical but weak fault features into the estimation noise. Hereinto, the local threshold is respectively performed in each sliding window defined by the demodulated rotating-related feature frequency. Third, the proposed method is addressed with the flowchart. Finally, two engineering case studies are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method. The analytic results show that the method could effectively extract the periodic impulses generating by the early local damage in the gearbox of a hot strip finishing mill. Meanwhile, the method could successfully reveal the weak rubbing-impact faults along with alleviating the mode mixing phenomenon in the refined results for fault diagnosis of a heavy oil catalytic cracking unit. Hence, the method could provide a promising tool for weak feature extraction and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.

It can be used to extract fault signals from rotating machinery. To deeply improve the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a second-order underdamped tristable stochastic resonance (SUTSR) is proposed in the present study. The potential function, the steady-state probability density of particles and the SNR are used to evaluate the model. Firstly, the relationship between the noise intensity and the SNR of SUTSR is studied. Then, using the steady-state solution curve, the output response of the SUTSR system is discussed from the perspective of steady-state input, and the output response of the system is further studied when inputting low-frequency harmonic signals. Finally, SUTSR model is used to process bearing signal data with inner ring fault and rolling element fault, and the processing result is compared with tristable system and second-order underdamped bistable system. The results show that, in the background of strong noise, the SUTSR system can accurately identify the characteristic frequency of the fault signal and then greatly improve the energy of the weak fault signal under appropriate system parameters.

J	Zhang, DQ; Ding, XX; Huang, WB; He, QB				Zhang, Deqi; Ding, Xiaoxi; Huang, Wenbin; He, Qingbo			Transient Signal Analysis Using Parallel Time-Frequency Manifold Filtering for Bearing Health Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Sparse representation; time-frequency image; parallel time-frequency manifold filtering; image morphology filtering; fault diagnosis	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; RESONANCE; WAVELET	It is crucial to identify and extract the weak transient features embedded in the vibration signals for bearing health monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, due to the macro-structural disturbance and background noise interference, it is not easy to mine the transient features, especially at the apparent failure stage. Meanwhile, the actual mechanism of bearing fault detect can be not simply expressed by the formulated theory models without consideration of the actual physical collision process. To overcome these issues, motivated by the merits of time-frequency manifold (TFM), this paper proposes a new transient feature extraction method, called parallel time-frequency manifold (PTFM) filtering, by simultaneously using TFM-based reconstruction with TFM-based filter in parallel for transient feature extraction. First, to improve the computational efficiency of TFM, two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform is employed on the raw time-frequency distribution (TFD) with image compression. TFM learning is later used to mine the principle manifolds from those approximation sub-images. Then, the amplitudes of the raw time-frequency image can be reconstructed by TFM feature bases while the desired location of time-frequency feature can be captured by TFM morphology filter in a process of image morphology. With raw time-frequency phases in a series of inverse processes, the de-noised signal can be finally synthesized from these filtered images. The proposed method accomplishes a natural manifold feature denoising by combining the sparse theory with image morphology, and demonstrates attractive prospects in the following three aspects: signal de-noising with a self-learning mode in the view of image morphology processing combined with sparse theory, fault diagnosis with in-band noise/close interference removal, and machine health monitoring with capability in capturing sensitive failure information. Simulations and experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed PTFM filtering method in noise suppression and feature enhancement, which is valuable for bearing health monitoring and diagnosis applications.

J	Pan, HY; Zheng, JD				Pan, Haiyang; Zheng, Jinde			A Generalized Framework of Adaptive Mode Decomposition	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; non-stationary signal; vibration signal; fault diagnosis	TIME-SCALE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	As an effective tool for nonlinear and non-stationary signal separation method, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has attracted a lot of attention of many scholars and has been successfully applied to many engineering areas. Since the kernel of EMD is to define a baseline and then implement the sift process, it is important to select an appropriate baseline to improve the performance of EMD for an accurate decomposition. However, it is difficult to choose the most suitable method for dealing with a given arbitrary signal. Besides, the baseline constructed through the existing methods generally does not equal the expected one. To address these problems, we propose a new generalized framework for adaptive mode decomposition (GF-AMD) based on EMD, in which the optimal baseline is firstly chosen from different ones and a weighted factor is introduced to adjust the baseline for getting the optimal one. Then the optimal baseline is implemented to the sift process of EMD. Two simulation signals are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority to EMD. Finally, the proposed GF-AMD method is applied to the vibration signal analysis of faulty rotary machinery by comparing with EMD method and the analysis results indicate its effect and superiority.

J	Dou, CH; Lin, JS				Dou, Chunhong; Lin, Jinshan			Extraction of Fault Features of Machinery Based on Fourier Decomposition Method	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Feature extraction; fourier decomposition method; empirical mode decomposition; variational mode decomposition; fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; LOCAL MEAN DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS	Separations of close-frequency signal components are important for accurate diagnosis of machinery faults. Conventional methods for processing vibration signals of defective machinery can be divided into adaptive methods and parametric methods. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), an adaptive method, suffers from a bottleneck of performance in adaptively separating close-frequency signal components. Parametric methods, such as ensemble EMD (EEMD) and variational mode decomposition (VMD), face difficulties in parameter setting. As a result, these conventional methods demonstrate limited capabilities to extract fault features from machinery vibration signals. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper proposes a novel method for extraction of fault features of machinery based on Fourier decomposition method (FDM). Firstly, this paper demonstrates adaptive narrow-band filtering properties of FDM both in low frequency and in high frequency by examining Gaussian white noise. Afterwards, this paper numerally proves that FDM can transcend the bottleneck of performance of EMD in adaptively separating close-frequency signal components. Furthermore, the proposed method is compared with the method based on EMD,EEMD or VMD by investigating a turbine gearbox vibration signal.

J	Zhang, CL; Liu, YL; Wan, FY; Chen, BQ; Liu, J				Zhang, Chunlin; Liu, Yuling; Wan, Fangyi; Chen, Binqiang; Liu, Jie			Isolation and Identification of Compound Faults in Rotating Machinery via Adaptive Deep Filtering Technique	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adaptive deep filtering; compound faults isolation; empirical wavelet transform; fault diagnosis; windowed correlated kurtosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; CORRELATED KURTOSIS DECONVOLUTION; ENERGY HARVESTERS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; EXTRACTION; PACKET	Compound defects commonly occur on rotating machinery under fatigue and heavy loads, and their fault signatures are coupled and easily buried in strong unwanted vibrations and background noise. The isolation and identification of the compound fault signatures are still a challenge especially when the transient impulses induced from the compound defects share common resonant frequency. In this paper, a data-driven, adaptive deep filtering technique which mainly contains filtering and isolating procedures is proposed for compound faults diagnosis. During the filtering procedure, an empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based correlated kurtogram is presented to adaptively obtain the proper spectral segments for filtering the vibration measurements, such that to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of compound faults in the filtered signals. Subsequently, during the isolation procedure, windowed correlated kurtosis (WCK) which outputs pure periodic pulses indicating the occurrence moments of interested fault impulses is presented to isolate each interested fault mode and to determine the defects number. The performance of the proposed technique is tested on simulated signals and validated via analyzing experimental measurements from high-speed locomotive bearings which suffer multiple damages. The results validate that the proposed method outperforms dyadic wavelet transform and spectral kurtogram in isolating and identifying compound faults in rotating machinery.

The implementation of a reliable spam email filter becomes more and more important for e-mail users since they have to face with the growing amount of uninvited e-mails. The faults of spam classifiers are characterized by being more and more insufficient to handle huge volumes of relevant emails and to identify and detect the new spam email as example with high performance. The problem in spam classifiers is a huge number of features. Feature selection is an important task in keyword content classification for being among the most popular and effective methods for feature reduction. Accordingly, irrelevant and redundant features that can impede performance would be eliminated. Meta-heuristic optimization is to choose the optimal solution between possible multi-solutions, which respect the aim of this research that is the performance. The other problem is related to ambiguity of the effect of optimization feature selection on multiple classifiers algorithm which are popular used by previous work namely; K-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machine. Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve the accuracy of feature selection by applying hybrid Water Cycle and Simulated Annealing to optimize results and to evaluate the proposed Spam Detection. The methodology used in this study which consists of groundwork, induction, improvement, evaluation and comparison quality. The cross-validation was used for training and validation dataset and seven datasets were employed in testing the spam classification proposed. The results demonstrate that the meta-heuristic namely water cycle feature selection (WCFS) was employed and three ways of hybridization with Simulated Annealing as a feature selection employed. In comparison with other feature selection algorithms such as Harmony Search, Genetic Algorithm, and Particle Swarm, the hybridization interleaved hybridization outperformed other feature selection algorithms with accuracy 96.3%, on the other side the effect of using three classifier algorithms, the SVM was better than other of classifier algorithms with f-measurement 96.3%. The number of features using interleaved water cycle and Simulated Annealing the number of features has decreased to more than 50%.

In parallel to continuous advances in AI, the past decade has seen the spread of broadband and ubiquitous connectivity, (embedded) sensors collecting descriptive high dimensional data, and improvements in big data processing techniques and cloud computing. The joint usage of such technologies has led to the creation of digital twins, artificial intelligent virtual replicas of physical systems. Digital Twin (DT) technology is nowadays being developed and commercialized to optimize several manufacturing and aviation processes, while in the healthcare and medicine fields this technology is still at its early development stage. This paper presents the results of a study focused on the analysis of the state-of-the-art definitions of DT, the investigation of the main characteristics that a DT should possess, and the exploration of the domains in which DT applications are currently being developed.

Firstly, a leakage condition hydraulic calculation model of the heating pipe network is established with graph theory, which provides the pressure changes of the pressure monitoring points in the pipe network. Then, the first-level diagnostic model for the leakage of the heating pipe network is designed to diagnose the leaky pipe segment by using a deep belief network. Based on the results of the first-level diagnostic model, each leaky pipe segment is treated as a unit and a second-level diagnosis model is then developed to predict the specific leak location. Finally, the model is verified with a branch-pipe network and a loop-pipe network. Experimental results showed that the first-level diagnostic model had a high accuracy rate in the prediction of leaky pipe segments, which was superior to traditional fault diagnosis methods such as BP (Back Propagation Neural Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machines). The second-level diagnostic model can detect the leak location of the leaky pipe with satisfactory results.

A Methodology for Prognostics Under the Conditions of Limited Failure Data Availability	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Equipment prognostics; expert knowledge; generative modeling; limited failure data; physics of failure	DIAGNOSTICS	When failure data are limited, data-driven prognostics solutions underperform since the number of failure data samples is insufficient for training prognostics models effectively. In order to address this problem, we present a novel methodology for generating failure data which allows training datasets to be augmented so that the number of failure data samples is increased. In contrast to existing data generation techniques which duplicate or randomly generate data, the proposed methodology is capable of generating new and realistic failure data samples. The methodology utilises the conditional generative adversarial network and auxiliary information pertaining to failure modes to control and direct the failure data generation process. The theoretical foundation of the methodology in a non-parametric setting is presented and we show that it holds in practice using empirical results. The methodology is evaluated in a real-world case study involving the prediction of air purge valve failures in heavy-trucks. Two prognostics models are developed using the gradient boosting machine and random forest classifiers. When these models are trained on the augmented training dataset, they outperformed the best solution previously proposed in the literature for the case study by a large margin. More specifically, costs due to breakdowns and false alarms are reduced by 44%.

The arc fault experimental platform is used to collect circuit current data of normal work and arc fault. Five types of loads which are commonly used in indoor distribution system, such as resistive and inductive in series load, resistive load, series motor load, switching power load and eddy current load, are chosen. This paper uses four features of current in time domain, i.e. current average, current pole difference, difference current average and current variance. Ten features of current in frequency domain are extracted by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The learning vector quantization neural network (LVQ-NN) is designed to judge the load type. The support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM) is designed to detect the arc fault. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Among others, these are inaccurate performance coordination and unnecessary power limitations during driving or charging In this work, we propose a fleet -based framework to detect such deviations. Our main assumption is that the real value is the mean of all identically constructed EVs' measurements for the same input. Under this assumption, we train individual on -board models to predict the current of the electric machine (EM) and transmit the model parameters to a back -end. There, we compare individual deviations of the predicted current against the fleet in the same scenario. We use the results to classify three fault sources. As models we choose two different Machine Learning algorithms: State Models and Long Short -Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMs). These are evaluated on an artificial fleet of 34 EVs derived from real drive data containing three different kinds of faults. Results show that our proposed approach correctly classifies major measurement faults. Additionally, both models offer similar classifications. LSTMs are more accurate, whereas state models arc less computationally complex, and thus better suited for electronic control units (ECUs).

Existing degradation models are all developed under a single time scale, and less research has been carried out to consider the impact of multiple time scales on the degradation model. Toward this end, we mainly study a nonlinear degradation modeling and RUL prediction method for nonlinear stochastic degraded equipment with bivariate time scales in this paper. Firstly, a nonlinear degradation model considering the influence of two time scales is constructed based on the diffusion process. At the same time, the relationship between the two scales is quantitatively characterized by random proportional coefficient. Then, the analytical expressions of the life and RUL for nonlinear degraded equipment are derived under the concept of first passage time (FPT). In order to realize the adaptive estimation of parameters, the model parameters estimation method based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Kalman filtering algorithm is developed in this paper. Finally, numerical simulation and the monitoring data of gyroscope verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of RUL prediction, and has a broad engineering application space.

With the widespread utilization of electrical motors, stability and reliability become the most important considerations for safety. SRMs are famous for their great robustness, wide speed range, and high fault-tolerant capability, which are much suitable for high-speed and safety-critical applications. Although the SRM drive have some fault tolerance ability, the fault still seriously affects the system performance. The faults happening in different parts, such as converter, motor winding, sensors, and rotor, may lead to low torque, large torque ripple, overcurrent, insulation damage, and even system broken-down, without any fault-tolerant consideration. Therefore, it is important and urgent to improve the motor system reliability and robustness for SRM drives. Aiming at offering novel solutions to the faults in SRM drives, this paper begins with mathematical modeling of the SRM, and then concentrates on the state-of-art fault diagnosis and fault tolerance techniques to enhance the fault ride-through ability. Two categories, containing fault diagnosis and fault tolerance technologies are emphasized for fast faults locating and stable post-fault operation. Advanced technologies are reviewed, classified, and compared comprehensively. Besides, several fault diagnosis and tolerance schemes that have been developed by authors are presented and discussed as well. Finally, the research status and outlooks on this topic are put forward. It is our target to offer a global vision on fault-related strategies and bring out promising ideas about fault-related techniques in SRM drives.

Mammography, i.e. the screening for breast cancer with x-ray imaging, has significantly improved the prognosis of patients diagnosed with the disease. The evaluation of mammograms requires a panel of radiologists, but even well trained experts can err in their assessment. For this reason, Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems are becoming more prevalent. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for breast Micro-Calcification (MC) diagnosis using temporal sequences of digital mammograms. The goal is to increase the MC detection accuracy by subtracting prior images. A new dataset, with precise marking of MC locations, was created specifically for this study. The proposed approach began with temporal subtraction of mammograms, after demon-based registration, which effectively removed unchanged regions and MCs (173% reduction in the number of MCs). The second step was the classification of the MCs as benign or suspicious using the subtracted images. A set of diverse features were selected for the classification. Four different classifiers were tested with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. For comparison, the MC classification was also performed, using single mammograms, without temporal subtraction. The average accuracy of the classification of the MCs as benign or suspicious was 913% without and 99.2% with temporal subtraction using Support Vector Machines (statistically significant p=0.026).

To meet these needs, we develop a charging diagnosis and prognosis system for effective battery control. We first examine the battery model that can capture electrochemical reactions and battery performance. Based on this model, we develop a charging diagnosis system that determines battery internal states and predicts their trend over operational cycles in various environments. Next, we propose a prognosis system to estimate battery's end-of-life (EOL) and determine optimal operating environments. Our in-depth experiments demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis and prognosis system estimates battery parameters and their degradation over operational cycles in various environments with high accuracy and without degrading user-perceived experience.

The defect in gear mesh may cause the failure in machinery and that causes a severe loss in industry. The failure in gear mesh reduces the efficiency and hence decreases the productivity in industrial operation. Therefore the health monitoring of gear mesh is very important. Proper health monitoring of gears can avoid the failure in machinery and can save money in industrial applications. The acoustic emission and vibration are the two widely used measuring parameters which is used for the condition monitoring of gear mesh. In this work the gear fault detection by using the acoustic emission monitoring technique is used. This experimentation is done by using an efficient instrumentation system. The experimental set-up is designed which consists of a gear mesh driving system and a hand-held sound analyzer. To carry out the experiment the measuring signals from the defective and healthy gears are captured and compared. In this work the measuring signal is the acoustic emission from the tested gears. Then for the fault detection, two signal processing techniques are followed. These are statistical analysis and adaptive wavelet transform (AWT) analysis. The comparison in statistical as well as in AWT analysis used to detect the fault present in gears. In AWT analysis the adaptive noise cancellation is used to enhance the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Finally faults in gears are classified using the machine learning classifier. The statistical parameter data are used as the input data for the classifiers to train the system to classify the fault.

Among various reliability challenges, device aging is a dominant concern because it degrades circuit performance over time. Traditionally, runtime monitoring approaches are proposed to estimate aging effects. However, such techniques tend to predict and monitor delay degradation status for circuit mitigation measures rather than the health condition of the chip. In this paper, we propose an aging-aware chip health prediction methodology that adapts to workload conditions and process, supply voltage, and temperature variations. Our prediction methodology adopts an innovative on-chip delay monitoring strategy by tracing representative aging-aware delay behavior. The delay behavior is then fed into a machine learning engine to predict the age of the tested chips. Experimental results indicate that our strategy can obtain 97.40% accuracy with 4.14% area overhead on average. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first method that accurately predicts current chip age and provides information regarding future chip health.

Machine learning is used to predict the possible failure of a machine before the actual event occurs. However, main challenges in PdM are: (a) lack of enough data from failing machines, and (b) paucity of power and bandwidth to transmit sensor data to cloud throughout the lifetime of the machine. Alternatively, edge computing approaches reduce data transmission and consume low energy. In this paper, we propose Anomaly Detection based Power Saving (ADEPOS) scheme using approximate computing through the lifetime of the machine. In the beginning of the machine's life, low accuracy computations are used when machine is healthy. However, on detection of anomalies as time progresses, system is switched to higher accuracy modes. We show using the NASA bearing dataset that using ADEPOS, we need 8.8X less neurons on average and based on post-layout results, the resultant energy savings are 6.4-6.65X.

The rotating machinery normally suffers mechanical failures even during daily operations that results in poor performance or shortening lifetime of the machine. Therefore, engineers have been interested in the earliest fault diagnosis of the rotating machine. Existing fault diagnosis methods for rotating machines have used fast fourier transform(FFT) method in frequency domain to detect abnormal frequency. However, it is difficult to diagnose using the FFT method if the normal frequency components of the rotating machines overlaps with the fault frequencies. In this paper, sets of acoustic signals generated by the washing machines are collected by using a smart phone in which an inexpensive microphone is equipped, and collected data are analyzed using a new algorithm, which combining the skewness, kurtosis, A -weighting filter, high-pass filter(HPF), and FFT. The analyzed data is applied to support vector machine(SVM) to determine defect existence. The proposed algorithm solves the disadvantages of the existing method and is accurate enough to discriminate the data collected by the cheap microphone of the smart phone.

The interest for its use in applications that require a large storage capacity, such as the automotive industry or renewable energy, demands better prognostic and health monitoring procedures in order to prevent unforeseen failures because of the significant cost involved. This work focuses its study on the degradation of the batteries produced during idle-time, i.e. calendar aging. In this paper electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is investigated as a tool of prognosis under several conditions of state of charge (SOC) and temperature. For the tests, 63 Ah Lithium-ion cells based on Nickel Manganese Cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode, were used. The batteries were tested during 12 months in climatic chambers and their capacity and impedance spectra were measured on a regular basis. The data set collected was analyzed in order to create a model capable of predicting the batteries' state of health (SOH) according to the calendar aging conditions.

Using only sensor signals of the vehicle's electronic stability program for this task is cost-efficient since those sensors are already available. Machine learning algorithms in conjunction with actual measurement data can be used to classify sensor readings according to the vehicle's damper health state. This paper evaluates two methods for automated feature generation, namely "Autoencoder" and "Sparse Filter".

Development of a prognostics health management framework for flexible electronics and flexible components is still in its nascent stages due to unique need of flexible electronics. Little to no information exists on the effects of the depth-of-discharge, charging profile, environmental use conditions and other varying test parameters such as varying load (across test conditions) in the the degradation in capacity and remaining useful life for flexible lithium-ion power sources. Flexible electronic systems need a thin, robust power system with the capability to maintain state of charge while sustaining dynamic stresses resulting from human motion and exposed to human body temperature. Further, flexible electronics in wearable applications may be exposed to environment extremes and thermal cycling resulting from changes in environmental temperature and use-conditions. In this research study, flexible lithium-ion batteries have been studied under a variety of conditions including charge-discharge cycles, variations in the depth-of-discharge, changes in the charge current, and changes in the system load. In addition, effects of simultaneous thermal stresses and repeated cyclic events have been studied on output parameters such as efficiency, capacity and charge-discharge time. Regression based modeling technique has been used to estimate the battery capacity deterioration as a function of number of cycles, operating temperature, and depth-of-discharge.

This means that these objects would be able to think, sense and feel. For example, your home devices will be able to detect and feel your absence to turn off the lights of empty rooms, close doors, lock the gates, and other tasks. Thus, would it be acceptable to find intruders who might mess up your daily life style or control your home appliances? Absolutely not! The same idea for factories, they definitely reject to detect any unacceptable access from any foreigner to their logical/physical assets or machines who might be able to locally or remotely control, for example, any machine operation. This would cause a significant loss for their reputation or investments, since any vulnerability or attack can produce, for example, fault products. So far, IoT is considered as one of the most essential areas of future technologies, especially for the industries. Hence, finding an environment full of smart devices needs a smart security methodology to prevent any illegal access. In this domain, various researches are conducted to find Access Control (AC) models to enforce security policies that prevent any unauthorized detection of sensitive data and enable secure access of information. For this purpose, we present a new dynamic Smart-AC model methodology to enforce security policy in IoT layers.

However, how do you effectively select where and when to implement these technology solutions within manufacturing operations? Furthermore, how do you account for the human-driven activities in manufacturing when inserting new technologies? Due to a reliance on human problem solving skills, today's maintenance operations are largely manual processes without wide-spread automation. The current state-of-the-art maintenance management systems and out-of-the-box solutions do not directly provide necessary synergy between human and technology, and many paradigms ultimately keep the human and digital knowledge systems separate. Decision makers are using one or the other on a case-by-case basis, causing both human and machine to cannibalize each other's function, leaving both disadvantaged despite ultimately having common goals. A new paradigm can be achieved through a hybridized systems approach - where human intelligence is effectively augmented with sensing technology and decision support tools, including analytics, diagnostics, or prognostic tools. While these tools promise more efficient, cost-effective maintenance decisions, and improved system productivity, their use is hindered when it is unclear what core organizational or cultural problems they are being implemented to solve. To explicitly frame our discussion about implementation of new technologies in maintenance management around these problems, we adopt well established error mitigation frameworks from human factors experts - who have promoted human-systems integration for decades - to maintenance in manufacturing. Our resulting tiered mitigation strategy guides where and how to insert SM technologies into a human-dominated maintenance management process.	[Brundage, Michael P.; Sexton, Thurston; Morris, K.

The dictionary can either be specified through signal priors or learned from data samples. In this paper, we propose a singular vector-inspired dictionary learning (SVDL) method, combining signal priors and data samples for sparse decomposition of machinery vibration signal. The SVDL is a data driven scheme for learning dictionary atoms and simultaneously exploring the prior information. It is achieved by alternating between atom design and dictionary update steps. First, we introduce the singular vector as vibration signal priors to atom design procedure. Through singular value decomposition on the Hankel matrix of the vibration signal, the inherent signal features corresponding to mechanical fault can be expressed with some singular vectors. These vectors, closely related to fault features, are extracted as basis vectors to constitute atoms. Second, the vector quantization method is used for atom design, by clustering the extracted basis vectors for the purpose of learning representative atoms. As to the dictionary update step, a strategy including sparse coding and dictionary optimization is adopted to simplify and update atoms. The results of the numerical simulation and experimental application show that the proposed SVDL method outperforms the classical K-SVD method for vibration signal denoising and fault feature extraction.

Most of previous researches considered the degradation process as a population-specific reliability characteristics and ignored the hidden differences among the degradation process of individual machines. Moreover, existing maintenance scheme are mostly focus on the manufacturing system with fixed structure. These proposed maintenance scheme could not be applied for the reconfigurable manufacturing system, which is quite adjustable to the various product order and customer demands in the current market. In this paper, we develop a systematic predictive maintenance (PM) framework including real-time prognostic and dynamic maintenance window (DMW) scheme for reconfigurable manufacturing systems to fill these gaps. We propose a real-time Bayesian updating prognostic model using sensor-based condition information for computing each individual machine's TTFs, and a dynamic maintenance window scheme for the maintenance work scheduling of a reconfigurable manufacturing system. This enables the real-time prognosis updating, the rapid decision making for reconfigurable manufacturing systems, and the [notable maintenance cost reduction.

Rotary seal failure can be catastrophic and can lead to costly downtime and large expenses; so it is extremely important to assess the degradation of rotary seal to avoid fatal breakdown of machineries. Physics-based rotary seal prognostics require direct estimation of different physical parameters to assess the degradation of seals. Data-driven prognostics utilizing sensor technology and computational capabilities can aid in the in-direct estimation of rotary seals' running condition unlike the physics-based approach. An important aspect of data-driven prognostics is to collect appropriate data in order to reduce the cost and time associated with the data collection, storage and computation. Seals in machineries operate in harsh conditions, especially in the oil field, seals are exposed to harsh environment and aggressive fluids which gradually reduces the elastic modulus and hardness of seals, resulting in lower friction torque and excessive leakage. Therefore, in this study we implement a data-driven prognostics approach which utilizes friction torque and leakage signals along with Multilayer Perceptron as a classifier to compare the performance of the two metrics in classifying the running condition of rotary seals. Friction torque was found to have a better performance than leakage in terms of differentiating the running condition of rotary seals throughout its service life. Although this approach was designed for seals in oil and gas industry, this approach can be implemented in any manufacturing industry with similar applications.

Degradation assessment of reciprocating seal is extremely important in the manufacturing industry to avoid fatal breakdown of reciprocating equipment and machines. In this paper, we have proposed a data-driven prognostics approach using friction force to predict the degradation of reciprocating seal using Support Vector Regression. Statistical time domain features are extracted from friction force signal to reduce the complexity of raw data. Principal Component Analysis is used to fuse the relevant features and remove the redundant features from the process. Based on the selected features, a Support Vector Regression model is then built and trained for the prediction of seal degradation. A Grid search method is used to tune the hyperparameters in the SVR model. Run-to-failure data collected from an experimental test set-up is used to validate the proposed methodology. The study findings indicate that a small I set of relevant features which can represent the pattern related to degradation is sufficient to have a high prediction accuracy. The seal tested for this study comes from oil and gas industry, but the proposed method can be implemented in any industry with reciprocating equipment and machines.

However, extending these algorithms to other ball bearing applications is challenging and may not yield usable results. This work used a linear axis to study the ability of an inertial measurement unit (IMU), along with nine signal features, to measure changes in geometric error motions due to induced faults on the recirculating ball bearings of two carriage trucks. The IMU data was analyzed with the nine features used for rotating machinery systems, including root-mean-square, standard deviation, and kurtosis. For each stage of degradation, the statistical population and median value of each feature were compared against the population and median for no degradation, to monitor feature changes due to ball damage. Correlation analyses revealed an ability of the standard deviation feature to detect statistically significant changes as small as 0.05 micrometers or 0.5 microradians, corresponding to a total damaged surface area of truck balls of less than 0.1 percent.

Although these robot technologies have become more affordable, easier to integrate, and greater in functional capability, these advanced systems increase workcell complexity leading to the presence of more fault and failure modes. Given increasing manufacturing competitiveness, maximizing asset availability and maintaining desired quality and productivity targets have become essential. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing measurement science (e.g., test methods, performance metrics, reference data sets) to monitor the degradation within a manufacturing workcell that includes a six-degree-of-freedom robot arm. Numerous components of the workcell influence the accuracy of the robot's tool center position. Identifying the component(s) responsible for process degradation prior to the process performing out of specification will provide manufacturers with advanced intelligence to maintain or maximize their performance targets and asset availability. NISTs research in robot workcell health promotes workcell component health characterization and develops methods and tools to verify and validate this approach. This paper presents the overall research plan and the efforts to date in developing appropriate test methods, identifying key sources of workcell degradation, and presenting baseline performance data that is leveraged for health assessment.

This paper presents our work in the realization. of a smart factory, which comprises of a four-layer hierarchical architecture, i.e. connection infrastructure, data acquisition, data processing and smart applications. In the connection [ infrastructure layer, all shopfloor machines are connected through diverse protocols, IoT sensors, PLC interfaces and DNC connectors. A centralized IoT gateway supports such a scalable and adaptable connection and ensures a reliable communication among all heterogeneous manufacturing systems. In the data acquisition layer, the real-time machine and job data are acquired from shopfloor systems. Machine data indicates machines' working condition and job data reveals the production information. The data processing layer comprises of three modules, i.e. shopfloor monitoring, data visualization and data analytics, which monitor and visualize shopfloor activities and analyze the semantics of various data using AI-based TPM engines providing the scientific indicators for next-step decisions. The smart application layer provides with several decision-making and remote control functions for shopfloor productivity and efficiency, such as predictive maintenance, shopfloor management, machine & job optimization and digital twin. The smart factory system has been implemented in the manufacturing shopfloor at Nanyang Polytechnic. The results and validation show that the system can simultaneously collect and analyze the manufacturing data from shopfloor systems, and further communicate with and control the shopfloor systems with decision-support functions. The overall shopfloor efficiency and flexibility can be significantly improved towards a smart factory of Industry 4.0.

J	Cavdar, T; Ebrahimpour, N				Cavdar, Tugrul; Ebrahimpour, Nader			Decision-making for small industrial Internet of Things using decision fusion	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Decision-making; decision fusion; Dempster-Shafer; dendrogram-based support vector machine; artificial neural network	COMPUTATIONAL MODELS	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a new field of Internet of Things (IoT) that has gained more popularity recently in industrial units and makes it possible to access information anywhere and anytime. In other words, geographic coordinates cannot prevent obtaining equipment and its data. Today, it is possible to manage and control equipment simply without spending time in an operational area and just by using the IIoT. This system collects data from manufacturing and production units by using wireless sensor networks or other networks for classification of fault detection. These data are then used after analysis to allow operational decisions to be made in shorter amounts of time. In fact, the IIoT increases the efficiency and accuracy of the "connection, collection, analysis, and operation" cycle. The information collected through different sensors in the IIoT is unreliable and uncertain due to the sensitivity of the sensors to noise, failure, and loss of information during transmission. One of the most important techniques offered to deal with this uncertainty in information is the decision fusion method. Among the decision fusion techniques, the Dempster-Shafer and improved Dempster-Shafer theory, which is also known as Yager theory, are efficient and effective ways to manage the uncertainty and have been used in many types of research. This paper offers an architecture for decision fusion in a small IIoT using Dempster-Shafer and Yager theories. In this architecture, data collected from the desired environment are fed to classifiers for classification. In this architecture, artificial neural networks and a dendrogram-based support vector machine are used as classifiers. To increase the accuracy of classifier results, the Dempster-Shafer and Yager theories are used to combine these results. To prove the performance, the proposed method was applied for detection of faults in an induction motor and human activity detection in an environment. This proposed method improved the accuracy of the system and decreased its uncertainty significantly according to obtained results from these two example use cases.

In Brazil, hundreds of thousands of deaths occur every year, with a mortality rate higher than the world average. In this context, it is important to develop tools for decision support and training of healthcare professionals. This work discusses a modelling for sepsis that may be instrumental for achieving such goals. Machine learning is used to train a model for prognosis of outcome of septic patients. The inputs of the model include information about the patient sepsis, previous clinical records and treatment variables. The results show that high accuracy can be achieved and that the network is able to really map patients in two highly distinct groups of risk (survival and fatal outcome), under certain conditions.

Artificial Neural Networks Technique to Detect and Locate an Interturn Short-Circuit Fault in Induction Motor	RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR SMART AND SUSTAINABLE CITIES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN RENEWABLE ENERGETIC SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Renewable Energetic Systems (IC-AIRES)	NOV 24-26, 2018	ESC Kolea, High Sch Commerce, Tipaza, ALGERIA		ESC Kolea, High Sch Commerce	Induction machines; Faults diagnosis; Interturn short-circuit detection and location; Artificial neural networks	STATOR; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; INSULATION; WAVELET	Induction machines (IMs) faults diagnosis is of significance to enhance the reliability and security of the industrial productions. In recent years, the faults detection and diagnosis of IMs have moved from traditional techniques that using the signals analysis to artificial intelligence (AIs) techniques such as the neural networks (NNs). Unfortunately, stator faults related failures account for a large percentage of faults in IMs. In this context, this paper proposes a diagnostic technique based on NNs for detecting and locating the interturns short-circuit in one of three stator winding phases of IM. Often, the most important step in which NNs is the process of selecting the best inputs that enables higher performance and better diagnosis, in this study, the three-phase shift between the stator voltages and its currents are considered as inputs of the NNs in order to develop an automatic fault detection and classification system. The simulation results in MATLAB environment prove the efficiency of the suggested NN technique to detect and locate short-circuit between turns of the same coil when the SCIM is operating under various load levels and various fault severities.

However, it can be catastrophic when they fail, because they store kinetic energy that can be released in a short amount of time. Data-driven monitoring techniques have been proposed to solve fault detection tasks in several types of rotation machinery with ball bearings. In contrast to traditional approaches using human-engineered features that require a high level of expertise, a data-driven approach requires no such prior knowledge. However, flywheels differ from typical rotation machinery because they use a magnetic or pivot bearing, and it is unclear whether a data-driven method can be used to detect a fault. In the present study, the effectiveness of a data-driven fault detection system for flywheels that use pivot bearings is evaluated. A flywheel fault progresses in several stages, and vibration data were collected for a flywheel running at each of those stages. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was exploited to detect a fault of the flywheel and identify a mode of the fault. Experimental comparisons conducted using vibration signals from an actual flywheel demonstrated that faulty operational state observed at an end of the flywheel's life can be detected with high accuracy using a data-driven method.

The collected information could be further used for different purposes, such as performance evaluation, anomaly detection, change detection or fault diagnosis of the operating systems. The analysis of the data streams is done by a calculation tool for estimating the similarity level between pairs of given chunks of data from the data stream, considered as data clouds. One of these data cloud represents a prerecorded (previously known) abnormal operation of the system, while the other data cloud represents a current (still unknown) behavior of the system. Then the similarity analysis will show how close the two data clouds are. In this paper we propose a novel method for similarity analysis that uses two types of models called Data Cloud Model (DCM) and Window Cloud Model (WCM). The DCM is obtained from the data cloud that represents a previously known operation of the system, while the WCM is obtained from the newly collected data cloud from the data stream, called window data cloud. Both data clouds have an equal length (number of data). The algorithms for creating the DCM and WCM are explained in the paper. The DCM consists of Active Grid cells that represent approximately the data density within the known data cloud. The WCM estimates the data density at the same active grid cells, but based on the data from the new window data cloud. Both densities are represented as two Histograms that are compared to each other in order to calculate the similarity level as a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Another problem discussed in the paper is finding a plausible method for detection of significant changes in the data streams. Here the moving window technique is used for collecting series of subsequent data clouds. Then two procedures of moving windows are run in parallel, each of them with different window lengths, in order to calculate the center-of-gravity of the respective data in a real time. The difference between the results of the two moving windows is used as an estimate of the change in the process operation. Both technologies developed in this paper are explain in details in the paper and illustrated on the example of real data stream from a petrochemical plant.

We give first analytical evidence of the algorithms potential. Moreover, we compare the approach described here with our previous work where we went a model-based approach and present advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches.

The system is based on the sub-cycle time monitoring (mini-terms) and how the cycle time variability of machine parts can be used as a deterioration indicator that could describe the dynamic of the failure for the machine parts. The mini-term, by definition, is a sub-cycle time and had only been used to improve production. The most used sensors to perform the maintenance prognosis are vibration, noise, temperature, pressure, flow, etc. These sensors use an abrupt change (Change point) in the measurement as an indicator that something anomalous is happening. The present paper demonstrates that the Change point also affects the cycle time but with some important advantages compared with common sensors, the mini-term is easy and cheap to install. It is cheap because no additional hardware installation is required to measure the sub-cycle time, only the use of the PLC and sensors installed for the automated production process, and it is easy because we only need to code extra timers into the PLC. At the end of the paper is shown the experimental setup to measure mini-terms at Ford plant in Almussafes factory, the so-called Mini-term 4.0 and a summary of the different kinds of pathologies that through the mini-terms we are able to detect until now.

Additive manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine learning, and new smart mobility logistics models are emerging technologies that enable efficient inventory solutions for different types of MRO parts. There is no single universal strategy that works for all MRO parts due to wide variety of part attributes including usage patterns, lead-time, and cost. In this paper, we propose the clustering of MRO parts into different groups and discuss the potential strategy to improve inventory management efficiency by leveraging emerging technologies for each MRO part group.

With the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning methods, manufacturing systems are able to monitor physical processes and make smart decisions through real-time communication and cooperation with humans, machines, sensors, and so forth. Artificial intelligence enables manufacturers to reduce equipment downtime, spot production defects, improve the supply chain, and shorten design times by using machine learning technologies which learn from experiences. One of the last application of these technologies is the development of Predictive Maintenance systems. Predictive maintenance combines Industrial IoT technologies with machine learning to forecast the exact time in which manufacturing equipment will need maintenance, allowing problems to be solved and adaptive decisions to be made in a timely fashion. This study will discuss the implementation of a milling Cutting-tool Predictive Maintenance solution (including Wear Monitoring), applied to a real milling data set as validation of the framework. More generally, this work provides a basic framework for creating a tool to monitor the wear level, preventing the breakdown, of a generic manufacturing tool, in order to improve human-machine interaction and optimize the production process.

Maintenance planning and scheduling is one of the most important manufacturing components in such systems, due to importance of availability and high investment for this kind of system. In order to consider real machine operation state, recently, predictive maintenance method is proposed. However, in traditional methods, historical failure data is the main source for this planning. In this paper, we propose a methodology for dynamic predictive maintenance for a real case in automotive industries with considering multicomponent structural and positive economic dependencies between them. In our methodology, we propose to gather data science with mathematical optimization method. Prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machine parts has been made by Artificial Neural Network method with considering sensors data. With this RUL values and other cost values and optimization model parameters, and by solving proposed mathematical model, an optimal schedule is achieved with minimization of maintenance costs. Through a dynamic proposed procedure, when a new data is received, RUL values and model parameters are readjusted and new optimal solution for maintenance planning and scheduling can be achieved. Further, some scenarios are defined for analyzing the dynamicity of the proposed procedure and relating results, conclusion and perspectives of these researched are discussed.

These technologies allow access to quasi real-time data that provide a continuously updated picture of the production system, including the state of available inventory. Data-driven predictive-reactive production scheduling has the potential to support the anticipation and prompt reaction to overcome different kinds of disruptions that occur in production execution nowadays. This research paper aims to propose a conceptual model for a data-driven predictive reactive production scheduling approach combining machine learning and simulation-based optimization, considering current inventory of raw material, work in process and final products inventory to characterize a job-shop production execution state. The approach supports decision-making in dynamic situations related to inventory availability that can affect production schedules.

An insert breakage detection method based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed, which consists of off-line phase and on-line phase. In the off-line phase, 13 AE signal features were extracted as input and then the SVM model was established and optimized In the on-line phase, the constructed model was used to detect insert breakage. The proposed method was applied and validated by an experiment conducted on a rotor slot milling machine in a factory. The result shows the validity and practicability of this method.

Predictive Modelling of a K-Unit Botttling Plants for Reliability Improvement	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURING (SMPM 2019)	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Sustainable Materials Processing and Manufacturing (SMPM)	MAR 08-10, 2019	SOUTH AFRICA	ALS		Failure mode and Effect Analysis; Maintenance; Reliability; Production Technology; Bottling Machines	RISK ANALYSIS; FAILURE MODE; ANALYSIS FMEA; FUZZY-FMEA	The study presents an innovative approach of investigating and predicting the reliability of a K- unit configuration system. This novel approach investigated the major systems on each production line, in order to predict their optimal reliability for their respective hour of operation. The series network framework consists of a rinser machine, filler machine, capping machine, labeling machine and coding machine. The reliability of each system was evaluated by assuming a failure rate, lambda = 0.04per hour to each subsystem and the mean time to failure was equally evaluated. Based on the calculation using the predicted model, at a mission hour of 24,168,312 and 456 hours, the respective reliabilities were; 0.3829, 0.0012, 0.0000038 and 0.000000012. The result showed that the reliability of the system decreases drastically with increasing mission time. Based on this result, the productivity of the plants is expected to be very low, hence the need to improve the reliability. The result also showed that the predicted model is good and efficient in predicting and improving plant performance. Further to this result, the reliability of the bottling machines can be improved by applying the developed model. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical System (CPS) are some of the recent topics of interest in the manufacturing sector. Steel manufacturing process relies on monitoring strategies such as fault detection to reduce number of errors which can lead to huge losses. Proper fault diagnosis can assist in accurate decision-making We use in this study predictive analysis to help solve the complex challenges faced in industrial data. Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines are used to train and test our industrial data. We evaluate how ensemble methods compare to classical machine learning algorithms. Finally we evaluate our models' performance and significance.

This paper proposes a rotor unbalance fault diagnosis method using deep belief network (DBN) to learn the representative features automatically and accurately identify fault states. Multi-source heterogeneous information composed with vibration signal and shaft orbit plots generated by raw displacement signals can fully exploit multi-sensor information in fault diagnosis. And multi-DBN model was introduced to deal with multi-source heterogeneous information fusion problem containing all fault information which could adaptively learn useful features through multiple nonlinear transformations compared with traditional approaches depending on time-consuming and labour-intensive manual feature extraction. The results indicate that the accuracy of classifying rotor unbalance fault states is up to 100% under proper parameters of DBN which significantly improves the effect of fault recognition and validates effectiveness using the proposed method.

A number of physics-based and data-driven methods have been proposed in the literature to address a variety of damage diagnosis and prognosis challenges. Among them, neural networks have proven their strength and flexibility when suitable physics-based models are not accessible, and field data are available for sufficiently accurate regressions/classification. Their flexibility is particularly beneficial for prognosis problems, where unaccounted external variables may introduce new, un-modeled system dynamics. In this work, we propose to train neural network models in real-time by embedding them in a particle filtering scheme. The proposed algorithm learns from the monitored structure, and is capable of sequentially adapting itself to changes in the degradation dynamics. For validation purposes, the method is demonstrated with reference to a numerically-simulated fatigue crack growth in an aeronautical panel.

Even with some artificial intelligent techniques already experimented, the results have not been not systematic compared and are far from real application. Therefore, this paper tries to make a thorough use of machine learning tools towards result data from dissolved gas analysis. This paper establishes a machine learning model based on dissolved gas analysis for internal fault diagnosis of power transformers, and makes a comparison between multiple machine learning methods. Firstly, an overall neural network model of transformer diagnosis based on the dissolved gas analysis is formed. Next, the performance of optimized BP neural network, probabilistic neural network (PNN), and decision tree algorithm is compared from the aspects of speed and accuracy. Furthermore, the case-based reasoning method based on the Euclidean distance and normalized energy intensity algorithm is employed to get the closest matching similar case to realize the transformer defect prediction and assistant decision-making. With actual examples verified, the case-based reasoning method can help detect the most likely abnormal causes of faulty transformers through providing the most similar matching case.

The transformers' tank vibration technique potentially offers a decisive solution for an on line continuous assessment of the integrity of structural elements in transformers. In this paper, the influence of sensor location on tank vibration measurements is addressed by means of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. Laboratory tests have been carried out in different points of the tank, on a typical oil filled power transformer under two extreme conditions, tight and loose windings. Preliminary results of SVM analysis of tank vibration spectra showed that it is possible to correctly identify winding looseness during repetitive sensor installation.

The inherent intermittence of wind energy and locating WTs in remote areas, makes designing proper fault diagnosing method difficult. To address this issue, we have proposed a two-block deep learning based method in this paper, which encapsulates two feature extraction and classification stages in an end-to-end architecture. In the designed method, we have utilized generative adversarial network (GAN) as feature extraction block and temporal convolutional neural network (TCNN) as fault classifier block. The proposed structure benefits from the leverage GAN and TCNN. The simulation results based on real-data from a 3 MGW WT in Ireland, which is obtained from supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA) demonstrates that it is a suitable alternative for WTs' fault classification. To show the superiority of the proposed method, the results are compared with support vector machine (SVM) and feed-forward neural network (FFNN).

Humans utilize water for various purposes such as cooking, bathing, washing, drinking, cultivating, cleaning, power generation and so on. Water pumps are employed to facilitate easy access near the requirement. Pumps can be classified into many groups according to the method of fluid displacement they inculcate to transport the fluid. Various faults are associated with the working of the water pumps due to the way it is handled, environmental conditions, supply imbalance, poor power quality or due to any other mechanical failures. Hence an effective process to determine the different various faults so as to mitigate the damage is required. This paper analyses the various faults in the centrifugal water pumps driven by induction motors used in agriculture fields and proposes a new algorithm to effectively and efficiently identify the fault and classify it according to its category using machine learning algorithms.

The system under study is the hard disks used in computing cluster. The data used for analysis is provided by Backblaze as discussed later. In the article, we discuss the architecture of of the long short term neural network used and describe the mechanisms to choose the various hyper-parameters. Further, we describe the challenges faced in extracting effective training sets from highly unorganized and class-imbalanced big data and establish methods for online predictions with extensive data pre-processing, feature extraction and validation through online simulation sets with unknown remaining useful lives of the hard disks. Our algorithm performs especially well in predicting RUL near the critical zone of a device approaching failure. With the proposed approach we are able to predict whether a disk is going to fail in next ten days with an average precision of 0.8435. We also show that the architecture trained on a particular model is generalizable and transferable as it can be used to predict RUL for devices in other models from same manufacturer.

C	De Vita, F; Bruneo, D			IEEE	De Vita, Fabrizio; Bruneo, Dario			On the use of LSTM networks for Predictive Maintenance in Smart Industries	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SMART COMPUTING (SMARTCOMP 2019)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing (SMARTCOMP)	JUN 12-14, 2019	Washington, DC	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Predictive Maintenance; Deep Learning; TensorFlow; Keras; Smart Industry; Industry 4.0		Aspects related to the maintenance scheduling have become a crucial problem especially in those sectors where the fault of a component can compromise the operation of the entire system, or the life of a human being. Current systems have the ability to warn only when the failure has occurred causing, in the worst case, an offline period that can cost a lot in terms of money, time, and security. Recently, new ways to address the problem have been proposed thanks to the support of machine learning techniques, with the aim to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system by correlating the data coming from a set of sensors attached to several components. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach by using LSTM networks in order to demonstrate that they can be considered a feasible technique to analyze the "history" of a system in order to predict the RUL. Moreover, we propose a technique for the tuning of LSTM networks hyperparameters. In order to train the models, we used a dataset provided by NASA containing a set of sensors measurements of jet engines. Finally, we show the results and make comparisons with other machine learning techniques and models we found in the literature.

To prepare for this upcoming revolution, the community is assembling large disease-dedicated datasets such as TCGA or METABRIC. These datasets will serve as references to compare new patient samples to in order to assign them to a predefined category (i.e. 'patients associated with poor prognosis'). Some problems affecting the downstream analysis remain to be solved, the bottleneck is no longer data generation itself but the integration of the existing datasets with the present knowledge. Constraint-based modelling, that only requires the setting of a few parameters, became popular for the integration of high-throughput data in a metabolic context. Notably, context-specific building algorithms that extract a subnetwork from a reference network are largely used to study metabolic changes in various diseases. Reference networks are composed of canonical pathways while extracted subnetworks include only active pathways in the context of interest based on high-throughput data. Even though these algorithms can be part of automated pipelines, to be applied by clinicians, the model-building pipelines must be coupled to a standardized semi-automated analysis workflow-based on machine learning approaches to avoid bias and reduce the cost of diagnostics.

This data is useful for model training as well as for validation purposes. This paper demonstrates how a living lab, consisting of 7 identical drive train sub-systems, can enable smart machine maintenance and support the adoption of condition monitoring technologies in the industry. The living lab allows to perform accelerated lifetime tests of bearings and to speed up the process of collecting large amounts of data about degrading bearings. It is shown that the data can be used to benchmark diagnostic algorithms. Three methods are compared: a data driven approach developed by the Linz Center of Mechatronics (LCM), a diagnostic method of Flanders Make (FM) and an approach developed by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). It is concluded that the method of IMS and FM, employing bearing specific features, tend to be slightly more sensitive to early detect bearing faults than the data driven approach employed by LCM. On the contrary, the method of LCM does not require specific system knowledge and is not limited to bearing monitoring only. The method is more widely applicable to fault monitoring problems. Besides a benchmark study, the living lab can also be used to develop, test and validate new diagnostic and prognostic methods. In this way, the living lab provides opportunities to enable a wider adoption of condition monitoring technologies in industry.

Relevance vector machine (RVM) is flourishing in the field of RUL prognostics and gradually applied to the prediction of complex systems or components, but the general RVM cannot achieve on-line prediction efficiently due to its high computational complexity, besides, the sparse RVM model which is only based on historical data set could cause a large prediction error in the long term. To deal with these plights, an optimized incremental learning algorithm based on RVM is presented taking full advantage of the on-line updating samples to improve the precision of prognostics.

The fact that mathematical dynamic (transition) models of RUL are rarely available, makes it difficult for RUL information to be incorporated into the control paradigm. A novel framework for health aware control is presented in this paper where reinforcement learning based approach is used to learn an optimal control policy in face of component degradation by integrating global system transition data (generated by an analytical model that mimics the real system) and RUL predictions. The RUL predictions generated at each step, is tracked to a desired value of RUL. The latter is integrated within a cost function which is maximized to learn the optimal control. The proposed method is studied using simulation of a DC motor and shaft wear.

The size of data that needs to be checked-the entire world-and data churn rate-thousands per day-makes executing the full set of candidate checks cost prohibitive. Current techniques rely on hand-curated static subsets of checks to be run at different stages of the data production pipeline, These hard-coded subsets are uninformed of data changes, and cause bug detection to be delayed to downstream quality assurance activities. To address these problems, we have developed new representations of map data changes and checks, formally defined "check safety," and built a recommender system that dynamically and automatically selects and ranks a relevant subset of checks using signals from latest data changes. Empirical evaluation shows that it improves (1) efficiency by eliminating 65% of checks unrelated to changes, (2) coverage by recommending and ranking change-related checks from the full set of candidate checks, previously excluded by the manual process, and (3) overall visibility into the data editing process by quickly and automatically identifying latest fault prone parts of the data.

Machine Failure Prediction Technique Using Recurrent Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory-Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS IN INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	8th Computer Science On-Line Conference (CSOC)	APR 24-27, 2019	CZECH REPUBLIC	OpenPublish.eu s r o		Long-Short Term Memory; Particle Swarm Optimization; Machine learning		This paper proposes a hybrid prediction technique based on Recurrent Neural Network Long-Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) with the integration of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machines. LSTM is an improvement of RNN as RNN faces issues with predicting long-term dependencies. Issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients are the results of backpropagating errors, taking place when the network is learning to store and relate information over extended time intervals. RNN-LSTM is a feasible technique for this research due to its effectiveness in resolving sequential long-term dependencies problems. However, the accuracy can still be enhanced to a satisfactory value considering the optimal network topology has not been discovered yet. Accuracy improvement can be achieved by resorting to hyperparameter tuning. A result of proof of concept validates that by increasing the number of epochs, the accuracy of prediction has improved but increases the execution time. To optimize between the accuracy and execution time, a population-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed. PSO will be utilized to select the optimal RNN-LSTM topology specifically the learning rate instead of using manual search. This optimized hybrid prediction technique is useful to be implemented in predictive maintenance to predict machine failure.

This paradigm enables the detection of early warning signals concerning systems' degradation and facilitates the prompt decision making and actions performed ahead of time. Currently, even large manufacturing companies have not yet developed a complete Predictive Maintenance strategy and appropriate sensor-driven, real-time systems in order to utilize these benefits. In this paper, we propose a failure prediction system for complex IT systems in the steel industry. The novelty of our work lies in the exploitation of Deep Learning techniques from streaming operational sensor data, enabling earlier failure predictions through a Neural Networks approach. To evaluate the proposed framework, real-life data are collected and analyzed based on daily operational and maintenance activities within the production line. We further demonstrate the framework's potential by presenting some early results in modeling and predicting the complex and dynamic behavior in the manufacturing settings.

Integrating deep and radiomics features in cancer bioimaging	2019 16TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY - CIBCB 2019			English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (IEEE CIBCB)	JUL 09-11, 2019	Siena, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, GlaxoSmithKline		Radiomics; Deep Learning; Integration	CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION; PET/CT; REPRODUCIBILITY; ALGORITHMS; ACCURACY; SYSTEM	Almost every clinical specialty will use artificial intelligence in the future. The first area of practical impact is expected to be the rapid and accurate interpretation of image streams such as radiology scans, histo-pathology slides, ophthalmic imaging, and any other bioimaging diagnostic systems, enriched by clinical phenotypes used as outcome labels or additional descriptors. In this study, we introduce a machine learning framework for automatic image interpretation that combines the current pattern recognition approach ("radiomics") with Deep Learning (DL). As a first application in cancer bioimaging, we apply the framework for prognosis of locoregional recurrence in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (N=298) from Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. The DL architecture is composed of two parallel cascades of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers merging in a softmax classification layer. The network is first pretrained on head and neck tumor stage diagnosis, then fine-tuned on the prognostic task by internal transfer learning. In parallel, radiomics features (e.g., shape of the tumor mass, texture and pixels intensity statistics) are derived by predefined feature extractors on the CT/PET pairs. We compare and mix deep learning and radiomics features into a unifying classification pipeline (RADLER), where model selection and evaluation are based on a data analysis plan developed in the MAQC initiative for reproducible biomarkers. On the multimodal CT/PET cancer dataset, the mixed deep learning/radiomics approach is more accurate than using only one feature type, or image mode. Further, RADLER significantly improves over published results on the same data.

Several works are found in literature which focus on optimal placement of sensor units to achieve full monitoring and observability of power grids. In our previous work [1], a data driven approach has been introduced to determine the location of measurement units to achieve a desired fault location detection accuracy. In [1], the location of phasor measurement units (PMUs) has been identified via several feature selection based measures, and the performance of several machine learning based detectors has been evaluated. Simulation results have shown that the mutual information (MI) measure is capable of placing minimum number of PMUs for sufficient grid observability to achieve a desired detection accuracy using a decision tree (DT) based detector. In this work however, a new approach in the form of a convolutional neural network (CNN) based detector is introduced, and its performance is compared to the detectors in [1]. Several benchmark distribution systems are used in this work in order to evaluate the performance of the fault location detectors.

It provides a comprehensive library of device models and it allows users to define their own. Models for dynamic simulation can be defined in the DIgSILENT Simulation Language (DSL). When the functionality of DSL is insufficient, new DSL functions can be defined in C or C++. However, C and C++ can be challenging for inexperienced programmers. Furthermore, every time the C or C++ code is modified, it needs to be recompiled and PowerFactory needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect, which slows down the workflow, model development, and inhibits rapid prototyping. In this paper we present an open source library that allows users to call Python functions and methods from DSL with minimal effort. Python is a powerful and much easier to use language than C or C++. Additionally, Python programs do not need to be compiled. Furthermore, with this library PowerFactory does not need to be restarted every time the Python code is changed. To illustrate what can be accomplished with our library we present three example use cases related to load modeling, co-simulation, and fault detection based on machine learning. The examples show that it becomes straightforward to enhance DSL with Python and that sophisticated models can be produced with reduced effort using popular open source Python libraries. As a consequence, PowerFactory users gain access to enhanced modeling capabilities and user-friendliness, and a more speedy workflow, which is beneficial for rapid prototyping.

Fault diagnosis of gearbox is crucial to reduce unexpected downtime and economic losses. This paper proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks. Firstly, the multi- accelerometers vibration signals are divided into data segments. Then the common time domain features are extracted from these data segments. After that, these features are fed into the LSTM networks for fault pattern classification. The proposed method has no requirement for well-selected features, and also classifies the fault type accurately. The performance of the proposed method is validated by the multi- accelerometers vibration signals from wind turbine driven test rig. Through comparing with support vector machine (SVM) method, the superiority of the proposed method is verified. Moreover, the impact of different data segments on classification results is analyzed in this paper.

Machines unavailabilities are due to predictive maintenance interventions scheduled based on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results. Moreover, to take into account the several sources of uncertainty in the prognosis process, we model PHM outputs using fuzzy logic. The proposed genetic algorithm was calibrated based on sensitive statistical analysis. Computational experiments carried out on Taillard well known benchmark sets for permutation flowshop to which we add both PHM and maintenance data, show that the proposed algorithm seems to be efficient and effective.

This paper proposes a new diagnostic method based on impedance processing of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of a fuel cell stack (FCS). A three-dimensional feature extraction method is designed to replace the equivalent circuit model commonly used for modeling the EIS signature. By tracking internal resistance, polarization resistance, and maximum imaginary response features, the method detects a fault and isolates it from the normal degradation of a fuel cell. The proposed method can separate fault conditions from degradation and extract the degradation information effectively. The method successfully detected and isolated flooding and drying on the experimental data.

The large amount of data generated by these devices is considered to be a challenging issue. This data suffers from anomalies or abnormal behaviour for a number of reasons, such as sensor faults or attack issues. However, the data collected from IoT devices is usually unlabelled, which means that the normal or anomaly classes are unknown. This study proposes TCMD, a two-tier classification model for anomaly detection in IoT. In addition, it describes the validation methods used for the model to evaluate the quality of the clustering and the performance of the classification. TCMD firstly employs hierarchical affinity propagation (HAP) clustering to group the data into normal and anomaly clusters. Secondly, the labelled data obtained from the clustering is used to train decision trees (DTs). The results show that the TCMD is able to label the data which can be helpful to reduce human intervention. In addition, in terms of false positive rate (FPR), TCMD performs well compared with the DTs on the original dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art model.

In this scenario, the analysis of IIoT data is necessary to achieve prediction on the future machinery' status. The proposed approach relies on the use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) techniques mapped from electronic domain to production line domain. These EDA techniques are combined with field knowledge, especially for Predictive Maintenance analysis. This presentation describes a methodology that allows to abstract raw data retrieved from HOT sensors into a class of severity levels, core of the proposed methodology. For example, a class of severity level is reported in the ISO 10816 standard for vibration measurement, but similar concepts are proposed for other values. The methodology consists of two phases: first of all, traces of the nominal behavior are stored to be reused, then, such raw data are fittered with the nominal behavior and translated into severity levels. Such levels are then embedded into IIoT edge devices through the synthesis of the so-called Predictive Maintenance State Machines. The methodology has been validated on the model of a mechanical transmission system. Furthermore, the correctness of the strategy has been proved by injecting faults on the original model and by exploiting simulation procedures under different operational scenarios. This methodology gives to IIoT sensors their specific role in the software automation pyramid, by abstracting their data into levels used through the formalism of Predictive Maintenance State Machines (PMSM).

However, the depth of DL models in fault diagnosis is very shallow compared with benchmark convolutional neural network (CNN) models for ImageNet. But it is hard to train a very deep CNN model without the large amount well-organized datasets like ImageNet. In this research, a new transfer learning based on pre-trained VGG-19 (TranVGG-19) is proposed for fault diagnosis. Firstly, a time-domain signals to RGB images conversion method is proposed. Then, the pre-trained VGG-19 is applied as feature extractor to obtained the features of converted images. Finally, a softmax classifier is trained on the features. The proposed TranVGG-19 is tested on the famous motor bearing dataset from Case Western Reserve University. The final prediction accuracy of TCNN is 99.175% and the training time of TranVGG-19 is only near 200 seconds. These results outperform many DL and machining learning methods.

In this work, a data-driven Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) is employed to perform a probabilistic prediction of gas turbine future health state thanks to its capability to deal with fleet data from multiple units. First, the theoretical background of the predictive methodology is outlined to highlight the inference mechanism and data processing for estimating BHM predicted outputs. Then, BHM is applied to both simulated and field data representative of gas turbine degradation to assess its prediction reliability and grasp some rules of thumb for minimizing BHM prediction error. For the considered field data, the average values of the prediction errors were found to be lower than 1.0 % or 1.7 % for single- or multi- step prediction, respectively.

To this purpose, a comprehensive approach for Detection, Classification and Integrated.Diagnostics of Gas Turbine Sensors (named DCIDS), previously developed by the authors, is improved in this paper to detect and classify different fault classes. For a single sensor or redundant/correlated sensors, the improved diagnostic tool, called I-DCIDS, can identify seven classes of fault, i.e. out of range, stuck signal, dithering, standard deviation, trend coherence, spike and bias. Fault detection is performed by means of basic mathematical laws that require some user-defined input parameters, i.e. acceptability thresholds and windows of observation. This paper presents in detail the I-DCIDS methodology for sensor fault detection and classification. Moreover, this paper reports some examples of application of the methodology to simulated data to highlight its capability to detect sensor faults which can be commonly encountered in field applications.

Therefore, there is a continuous need for advanced monitoring techniques which can exploit the opportunities of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data Analytics, revolutionizing the future of the energy sector. The heart of wind turbines is a rather complex epicyclic gearbox. Among others, extremely critical gearbox components which are often responsible for machinery stops are the rolling element bearings. The vibration signatures of bearings are rather weak compared to other components, such as gears, and as a result an extended number of signal processing techniques and tools have been proposed during the last decades, focusing towards accurate, early, and on time bearing fault detection with limited false alarms and missed detections. Envelope Analysis is one of the most important methodologies, where an envelope of the vibration signal is estimated usually after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Different tools, such as Kurtogram, have been proposed in order to accurately select the optimum filter parameters (center frequency and bandwidth). Cyclic Spectral Correlation and Cyclic Spectral Coherence, based on Cyclostationary Analysis, have been proved as very powerful tools for condition monitoring. The monitoring techniques seem to have reached a mature level in case a machinery operates under steady speed and load. On the other hand, in case the operating conditions change, it is still unclear whether the change of the monitoring indicators is due to the change of the health of the machinery or due to the change of the operating parameters. Recently, the authors have proposed a new tool called IESFOgram, which is based on Cyclic Spectral Coherence and can automatically select the filtering band. Furthermore, the Cyclic. Spectral Coherence is integrated along the selected frequency band leading to an Improved Envelope Spectrum. In this paper, the performance of the tool is evaluated and further extended on cases operating under different speeds and different loads. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested and validated on the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking data set which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity as well as various speed and load operating conditions.

In recent years, the wind industry has become more open to adopting PHM solutions, especially those focusing on diagnostics. However, prognostics activities are, in general, still at the research and development stage. On the other hand, the industry has a request to estimate a component's remaining useful life (RUL) when it has faulted, and this is a key output of prognostics. Systematically presenting PHM technologies to the wind industry by highlighting the RUL prediction need potentially helps speed up its acceptance and provides more benefits from PHM to the industry. In this paper, we introduce a PHM for wind framework. It highlights specifics unique to wind turbines and features integration of data and physics domain information and models. The output of the framework focuses on RUL prediction. To demonstrate its application, a data domain method for wind turbine gearbox fault diagnostics is presented. It uses supervisory control and data acquisition system time series data, normalizes gearbox temperature measurements with reference to environmental temperature and turbine power, and leverages big data analytics and machine-learning techniques to make the model scalable and the diagnostics process automatic. Another physics-domain modeling method for RUL prediction of wind turbine gearbox high-speed-stage bearings failed by axial cracks is also discussed. Bearing axial cracking has been shown to be the prevalent wind turbine gearbox failure mode experienced in the field and is different from rolling contact fatigue, which is targeted during the bearing design stage. The method uses probability of failure as a component reliability assessment and RUL prediction metric, which can be expanded to other drivetrain components or failure modes. The presented PHM for wind framework is generic and applicable to both land based and offshore wind turbines.

An infection not diagnosed on time might not only severely affect the infected patient's health, but also to spread and start a focus of contagion to other people. In this paper, we propose a clinical decision support system to automatically diagnose infections using physiological signals from the patients. The focus of the system is put on being able to deal with very small amounts of data (one aggregated record per patient and day), which eases the potential of the system in environments with low resources. Data has been acquired between April 2018 and January 2019 in two nursing homes in Spain, where nurses had also tested patients for infections. Machine learning models have then been created by aggregating measurements from days prior to the infection (lead) and after the infection started (lag) in order to generate features. The best model attained reports an AUROC of 0.722, using data from up to two days after the infection started. Interestingly, an AUROC of up to 0.692 is achieved when infection prognosis is considered; i.e., using only measurements prior to the manual recording of the infection to compose the dataset.

Determining the relevant splicing factors, however, is not a straightforward task mainly due to the heterogeneity of tumors and the variability across samples. In this work, a methodology based on supervised machine learning methods is proposed, allowing the determination of subsets of relevant factors that best discriminate samples. The methodology comprises three main phases: first, a ranking of splicing factors is determined by means of applying feature weighting algorithms; second, the best subset of factors that allows the induction of an accurate classifier is detected; then the confidence over the induced classifier is assessed by means of explaining the individual predictions. Finally, the utility and benefit of the proposed methodology are illustrated by means of analyzing a small dataset of neuroendocrine lung carcinoids, and the results showed that there exist small subsets of deregulated factors which can effectively distinguish between tumor samples and their respective adjacent non-tumor tissues.

They gained popularity with the irruption of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as disease biomarkers for diagnosis and/or prognosis using Genome-Wide Association Study. They are along the genome but mostly in the non-coding regions. In these cases, SNPs may affect regulatory regions, such as promoters, enhancers or microRNA (miRNA) binding sites. miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs, that are estimated to regulate up to 60% of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It is well known they are implied in many diseases by misregulating the expression of genes. New computational technologies allow extracting more information from RNA-Seq data, being able not only to measure the gene expression but also mapping SNPs on the genome. To understand and model the effects of this type of RNAs in disease phenotype, machine learning algorithms will be trained using SNPs located in the 3'UTR (UnTranslated Region) of deregulated genes to find biomarkers and describe the mechanism of action.

Flaws can arise in many different forms: spot of different color, crack, incompleteness, excess and/or lack of material are just some examples of defects deriving from the industrial manufacturing process, which can lead to discard the component or the piece examined. These defects are recognizable by the human eye, but some issues like fatigue, illness of the operator and incorrect lighting of the samples can be tough obstacles in obtaining the right selection of the pieces. To detect faulty pieces and in order to avoid wasting compliant pieces instead, a computer based visual inspection system has been designed and implemented. As benchmark samples we adopt the outer lenses of automotive rear lamps. The surface of an outer lens needs an extreme precision manufacturing procedure and the absence of defects is essential for the quality of the final product. The aim of the work involves the ideation and commissioning of a setup to extract and analyze information about the flaws present in an outer lens, exploiting different image processing techniques depending on the nature of the defects.

The gearbox consists of various shafts, planetary gears and bearings and operates under varying conditions under excessive friction, heat and high mechanical forces. The components are vulnerable to fatigue defects and therefore Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) have been developed in order to monitor the health condition of the gearbox, focusing towards early, accurate and on time fault detection with limited false alarms and missed detections. The main aim of a HUM System is by health monitoring to enhance the helicopters' operational reliability, to support the maintenance decision making, and to reduce the overall maintenance costs. The importance and the need for more advanced and accurate HUMS have been emphasized recently by the post-accident analysis of the helicopter LN-OJF, which crashed in Norway in 2016 During the last few decades various methodologies and diagnostic indicators/features have been proposed for the monitoring of rotating machinery operating under steady conditions but still there is no global solution for complex structures. A new tool called IESFOgram has been recently proposed by the authors, based on Cyclostationary Analysis, focusing on the accurate selection of a filtering band, under steady and varying speed conditions. Moreover the Cyclic Spectral Coherence is integrated along the selected frequency band leading to an Improved Envelope Spectrum. In this paper the performance of the tool is tested on a complex planetary gearbox, with several vibration sources. The method is tested, evaluated and compared to state of the art methods on a dataset captured during experimental tests under various operating conditions on a Category A Super Puma SA330 main planetary gearbox, presenting seeded bearing defects of different sizes.

Component replacement plans have often been generic and therefore best suited for one set of ambient conditions and a few pre-defined operation profiles. Continuous development in materials and computerized analysis methods have resulted in much more well understood and robust designs than before, resulting in design induced failure rates dropping to levels where they can be considered as random and unexpected. While gas turbine designs matured, market conditions changed. Deregulation, consumer energy efficiency improvements, emission reduction requirements and large-scale introduction of renewables have reduced both average electricity price and thus the average amount of gas turbine power needed, but has also increased the variability in demand, resulting in highly unit specific operation profiles. This requires operators to cut unnecessary costs wherever possible and optimize operation and maintenance strategy in a complex environment with a growing number of parameters to consider. Over the past years much focus has been put on cost reduction through extension of maintenance intervals. However, since less maintenance and longer intervals can mean lower reliability and higher degradation, it is not always cost efficient. This paper shows how costs of maintenance, operation, fuel and degradation can be analyzed together, resulting in improved decision support for choosing better operation and maintenance strategies.

DIAGNOSTICS OF FATIGUE CRACK IN THE SHAFT USING SPECTRAL KURTOSIS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBOMACHINERY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, 2019, VOL 7A			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo: Turbomachinery Technical Conference and Exposition	JUN 17-21, 2019	Phoenix, AZ	ASME, Int Gas Turbine Inst			VIBRATION; KURTOGRAM; FAULT	Rotating machinery components like shafts subjected to continuous fluctuating loads are prone to fatigue cracks. Fatigue cracks are severe threat to the integrity of rotating machinery. Therefore it is indispensable for early diagnostics of fatigue cracks in shaft to avoid catastrophic failures. From the literature, it is evident that the spectral kurtosis (SK) and fast kurtogram were used to detect the faults in bearings and gears. The present study illustrates the use of SK and fast kurtogram for early fatigue crack detection in the shaft using vibration data. To perform this study, experiments are conducted on a rotor test rig which is designed and developed according to the function specification proposed by ASTM E468-11 standard. Fatigue crack is developed, on three shaft specimens, each seeded with the same circumferential V-Notch configuration, by continuous application of stochastic loads on the shaft using electrodynamic shaker in addition to the unbalance forces that arise in normal operating conditions. Vibration data is acquired from various locations of the rotor, using different sensors like miniature accelerometers, laser vibrometer and wireless telemetry strain gauge, till the shaft specimen develops fatigue crack. The analysis results show that the combination of SK and fast kurtogram is an effective signal processing technique for detecting the fatigue crack in the shaft.	[Prasad, Sagi Rathna; Sekhar, A.

The paper details a novel thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic (TEHD) analysis predictive tool for TPTBs that considers a 3D thermal energy transport equation in the fluid film, coupled with heat conduction equations in the pads, and a generalized Reynolds equation with cross-film viscosity variation. The predicted pressure field and temperature rise are employed in a finite element structural model to produce 3D elastic deformation fields in the bearing pads. Solutions of the governing equations delivers the operating film thickness, required flow rate, shear drag power loss, and the pad and lubricant temperature rises as a function of an applied load and shaft speed. To verify the model, predictions of pad sub-surface temperature are benchmarked against published test data for a centrally pivoted eight-pad TPTB with 267 mm in outer diameter operating at 4-13 krpm (maximum surface speed = 175 m/s) and under a specific load ranging from 0.69 to 3.44 MPa. The current TEHD temperature predictions match well the test data with a maximum difference of 4 degrees C and 11 degrees C (<10%) at laminar and turbulent flow conditions, receptively. Next, the TEHD predictive tool is used to study the influence of both pad and liner material properties on the performance of a TPTB. The analysis takes a whole steel pad (without a liner or babbitt), a steel pad with a 2 mm thick babbitt layer (common usage), a steel pad with a 2 mm thick hard-polymer (polyether ether ketone, e.g PEEK) liner, and a pad entirely made of hard-polymer material, whose elastic modulus is just 12.5 GPa, only 6% that of steel. The bare steel pad reveals the poorest performance among all the pads as it produces the smallest fluid film thickness and consumes the largest drag power loss. For laminar flow operations (Reynolds number Re < 580), the babbitted-steel pad operates with the thickest fluid film and the lowest film temperature rise. For turbulent flow conditions Re > 800, the solid hard-polymer pad, however, shows a 23% thicker film than that in the babbitted pad and produces up to 25% lesser drag power loss. In general, the solid hard-polymer TPTB is found to be a good fit for operation at a turbulent flow condition as it shows a lower drag power loss and a larger film thickness, however, its demand for a too large supply flow rate is significant. Predictions for steel pads with various hard-polymer liner and babbitt thicknesses demonstrate that using a hard-polymer liner, instead of white metal, isolates the pad from the fluid film and results in an up to 30 degrees C (50%) lower temperature rise in the pads than that for a babbitted-steel pad. For operations under a heavy specific load (> 3.0 MPa), however, a thick hard-polymer liner extensively deforms and results in a small film thickness.

Fault diagnosis systems generally have two blocks: feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction affects the performance of the prediction model, and essential information is extracted by identifying high-level abstract and representative characteristics. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the characteristics of raw data without prior knowledge, compared with traditional machine learning (ML) methods. A feature learning approach was applied using one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural networks (CNN) that works directly with raw vibration signals. The network structure consists of small convolutional kernels to perform a nonlinear mapping and extract features; the classifier is a softmax layer. The method has achieved satisfactory performance in terms of prediction accuracy that reaches similar to 99 % and similar to 97 % using a standard bearings database: the processing time is suitable for real-time applications with similar to 8 ms per signal, and the repeatability has a low standard deviation <2 % and achieves an acceptable network generalization capability.

It is envisioned that if we can develop an intelligent model that (a) represents a meaningful, realistic environment and complex entity containing manufacturing Internet of Things interdependent and independent properties that are stepping-stones of the cyber kill chain or precursors of the onset of cyberattacks; (b) can learn and predict potential errors and formulate offense/defense strategies and healing solutions; (c) can enable cognitive ability and human-in-the-loop analytics in real time; and (d) can facilitate system behavior changes to disrupt the attack cascade, then the hosting system can learn how to neutralize threats and attacks and self-repair infected or damaged links autonomously. In this article, our preliminary work presents a visual analytics framework and technique for situational awareness, including autonomously monitoring, diagnosing, and prognosticating the state of cyber-physical systems. Our approach, presented in this article, relies on visual characterizations of multivariate time series and real-time predictive analytics to highlight potential faults, threats, and malicious attacks. To validate the usefulness of our approach, we demonstrate the developed technique using various aviation datasets obtained from the Prognostics Center of Excellence at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames.

Four different filter-type feature selection were employed for ranking features. Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was employed to fuse the selected features and to increase the confidence in selecting the appropriate features. The selected features were used for training support vector machine classifiers based on experimental data.

An automated strategy that can provide a ranked list of faulty modules or files with respect to how likely they contain the root cause of the problem would help in the automation bug localization. Learning from the history if previously located bugs in general, and extracting the dependencies between these bugs in particular, helps in building models to accurately localize any potentially detected bugs. In this study, we propose a novel fault localization solution based on a learning-to-rank strategy, using the history of previously localized bugs and their dependencies as features, to rank files in terms of their likelihood of being a root cause of a bug. The evaluation of our approach has shown its efficiency in localizing dependent bugs.

Nonetheless, current modern plants are frequently highly monitored and automated, generating great quantities of data from a variety of sensors and actuators. Using this raw data, Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be implemented to achieve predictive maintenance. In this work, a method to predict and estimate the wear of a valve using the data related to an opening valve in Iberian Lube Base Oils Company, S.A. (ILBOC) is proposed. The dataset has been built from sensor data in the plant and formatted to use with Tensorflow package in Python. Then a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network is used to predict and estimate the ideal behavior of the valve without wear and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the real behavior of the valve with wear. Comparing both predictions an estimation of the valve wear is realized. Finally, this work closes with a discussion on an early alert system to schedule and plan the replacement of the valve, conclusions and future research.

The proposal was implemented over a bicomponent mixing machine used for the wind generator blades manufacture based on carbon fiber. The virtual sensor is necessary due to permanent problems with wrong sensor measurements. The solution proposed uses an intelligent model able to predict the sensor measurements, which are compared with the measured value. If this value belongs to a specified range, it is valid. Otherwise, the prediction replaces the read value. The process fault detection feature has been added to the proposal, based on consecutive erroneous readings, obtaining satisfactory results.

Effective closed-loop quality control reduces machine downtime and increases productivity, as well as enables efficient predictive maintenance and continuous improvement of product quality. Accurate estimation of dimensional variations on the final part is a key requirement, in order to detect and correct process faults, for effective closed-loop quality control. Nowadays, this is often done by experienced process engineers, using a trial-and-error approach, which is time-consuming and can be unreliable. In this paper, a novel model to estimate process parameters error variations using high-density cloud-of-point measurement data captured by 3D optical scanners is proposed. The proposed model termed as PointDevNet uses 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) that leverage the deviations of key nodes and their local neighbourhood to estimate the process parameter variations. These process parameters variation estimates are leveraged for root cause isolation as a necessary but currently missing step needed for the development of closed-loop quality control framework. The proposed model is compared with an existing state-of-the-art linear model under different scenarios such as a single and multiple root causes, and the presence of measurement noise.

These low-emission gas turbines present potential maintenance and monitoring challenges due to the intrinsically harsh pressure and temperature environments, which make diagnostics and prognostic capabilities extremely difficult. One such challenge involves understanding and interpreting combustion dynamics data. This paper focuses on gas turbine combustion dynamics monitoring (CDM) and describes an algorithm to determine combustor health based upon dynamic pressure. The ongoing CDM and diagnostic work has progressed from taking basic binned FFT data and transforming this data to statistically based health indicators that can be continuously calculated to determine combustion system anomalies. These anomalies can be detected hours, days, and sometimes even weeks before passive CDM alarm levels are reached, thus, giving additional time to plan for shutdown, inspection, and repair. The paper will discuss real-time observed successes and challenges associated with combustor health monitoring, including sensor health determination and factors associated with the non-linear nature of combustion dynamics. Overall, this work is helping to better alleviate the user's "black box" perspective of combustion dynamics monitoring systems through automated, real-time interpretation for combustion system health for can annular gas turbines.

Traditional diagnosis methods are established on the basis of physical models. However, the complexity and degradation of gas turbine limit both comprehensiveness and accuracy of these physical models, making the diagnosis less effective. Therefore, data-driven models are introduced to supplement and revise previous models. Benefitting from the prosperous development of machine learning, neural network has been greatly improved and widely used in various fields of data mining. Three neural networks, Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory Network are applied in data-driven model establishment. Their training time and prediction accuracy are the two most important factors in judging the effectiveness. An active real time training which means training and predicting simultaneously is applied as the main modelling method for an on-line diagnosis system. Three periods are defined according to the time line: data preparation period, model establishing period and stable prediction period. From the three above neural networks, the most effective data-driven models that corresponding to the last two periods are tested and selected, the purpose is to ensure the high level of accuracy. When high level of accuracy is demanded, neural network always need large computing time and memory space in data learning process. To avoid prediction delay and keep rapid response for the coming fault, distributed training on a 1-master 2-workers computer cluster is designed and applied in this system. Two types of data parallelism are realized on the cluster through Apache Spark and Shell Script for Linux. Comparing with each other and the local training mode, the results shows that dispensing data at first and averaging parameters at last reaches a better outcome both in high accuracy and low training time.

The most common faults include dampness, partial discharge, aging or insulation deterioration, and structural deterioration. The purpose of this study is to use a human-machine interface diagnosis system to detect the type of power capacitor fault, so as to determine the real-time status of the power capacitor. Partial discharge data are measured and diagnosed for the power capacitors that are functional and remaining in long-term high-voltage operation. The defects are handled before the capacitor is measured by a high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) sensor, and one power platform tester is used to measure partial discharge in the capacitor case. The voltage is increased until the partial discharge phenomenon stops, and the voltage and partial discharge signals are visualized by using a high-frequency oscillograph. Afterwards, the feature of the discharge signal is determined by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, combined with the chaos synchronization detection analysis method to establish the chaotic error scatter map of the discharge voltage. Then, the chaos eyes are used as the features of fault diagnosis, and the extension neural network (ENN) algorithm is used for capacitor fault recognition. The advantages of this method are that the feature extraction data volume can be reduced, subtle changes in power capacitor discharge voltage signal can be detected effectively so as to detect the power capacitor's operating state, and emergency measures can be executed in advance to prevent severe disasters. The proposed method is validated by actual measurements. The detection rate of the ENN fault detection method is 95%, proving that this method is applicable to power capacitor partial discharge detection.

Damage to bearings has a negative effect on schedule, production operations. Therefore, it is very important that the bearing is diagnosed beforehand. How well a feature is extracted from a vibration signal greatly affects the performance of traditional intelligent fault diagnosis. Traditional intelligent method, however, typically requires extensive domain expertise and prior knowledge. Instead of traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms have an ability to learn discriminative representations effectively and accurately from input data. This deep learning model can overcome the disadvantages of traditional intelligent algorithms. In this paper, we will focus on the idea that achieves high accuracy of lubricant oil bearings using conventional vibration signals without additional thermal cameras as possible. For achieving the purpose, we will use CNN (convolutional neural network) which will be used to learn features for fault diagnosis.

Signal Pre-Selection for Monitoring and Prediction of Vehicle Powertrain Component Aging	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			English	Article						predictive maintenance; feature extraction; signal selection; time series; machine learning; model explanation	METHODOLOGY; DIAGNOSTICS	Predictive maintenance has become important for avoiding unplanned downtime of modern vehicles. With increasing functionality the exchanged data between Electronic Control Units (ECU) grows simultaneously rapidly. A large number of in-vehicle signals are provided for monitoring an aging process. Various components of a vehicle age due to their usage. This component aging is only visible in a certain number of in-vehicle signals. In this work, we present a signal selection method for in-vehicle signals in order to determine relevant signals to monitor and predict powertrain component aging of vehicles. Our application considers the aging of powertrain components with respect to clogging of structural components. We measure the component aging process in certain time intervals. Owing to this, unevenly spaced time series data is preprocessed to generate comparable in-vehicle data. First, we aggregate the data in certain intervals. Thus, the dynamic in-vehicle database is reduced which enables us to analyze the signals more efficiently. Secondly, we implement machine learning algorithms to generate a digital model of the measured aging process. With the help of Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) the model gets interpretable. This allows us to extract the most relevant signals and to reduce the amount of processed data. Our results show that a certain number of in-vehicle signals are sufficient for predicting the aging process of the considered structural component. Consequently, our approach allows to reduce data transmission of in-vehicle signals with the goal of predictive maintenance.	[Sass, A.

However, most patterns of diseases are based on old datasets and stepwise algorithms that provide limited accuracy. Improving diagnostic accuracy of the ECG can be done by applying machine learning algorithms. This requires taking existing scanned or printed ECGs of old cohorts and transforming the ECG signal to the raw digital (time (milliseconds), voltage (millivolts)) form. Objectives: We present a MATLAB-based tool and algorithm that converts a printed or scanned format of the ECG into a digitized ECG signal. Methods: 30 ECG scanned curves are utilized in our study. An image processing method is first implemented for detecting the ECG regions of interest and extracting the ECG signals. It is followed by serial steps that digitize and validate the results. Results: The validation demonstrates very high correlation values of several standard ECG parameters: PR interval 0.984 /0.021 (p-value & x003C; 0.001), QRS interval 1/ SD (p-value & x003C; 0.001), QT interval 0.981 / 0.023 p-value & x003C; 0.001, and RR interval 1 / 0.001 p-value & x003C; 0.001. Conclusion: Digitized ECG signals from existing paper or scanned ECGs can be obtained with more than 95 of precision. This makes it possible to utilize historic ECG signals in machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of heart diseases and aid in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease.

The proposed FDI method is based on multi-classifier fusion with diverse learning algorithms and configured in a parallel form where a unique module simultaneously performs both detection and isolation tasks. In other words, a multi-classifier-based arrangement is presented on the basis of Mixed Learning strategy where four classic and well-practised classification schemes including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Partial Least Square, and Naive Bayes are incorporated into FDI module in order to make a decision on the occurrence of a fault and its location. Extensive simulation results with a high-fidelity nonlinear spacecraft simulator considering gyroscopic effects, measurement noise, and exogenous aerodynamic disturbance signals show that the proposed FDI scheme can cope with faults affecting reaction wheel torques and obtain promising FDI performances in most of the designed scenarios.

A decision-making model for managers and administrator of HEIs is presented. We propose a detailed methodology when academic prognosis is taking place. The comparison between five robust Machine Learning algorithms is executed accomplishing outperformed results by Support Vector Machine. As a validation experiment, we executed the proposed decision model in a face-to-face public university in Colombia, showing the results in a developed web platform prototype with its correspondent architecture. Moreover, we discuss the social implication of low graduation rates.

J	Yuan, XY				Yuan, Xiaoyi			Emotional tendency of online legal course review texts based on SVM algorithm and network data acquisition	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Review						Support vector machine; algorithmic optimization; online course; data network	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PREDICTION	The lack of effective evaluation of online education is a worldwide malpractice, and it is impossible to help students improve the correctness of online learning choices through existing reviews. Based on the current mainstream sentiment lexicon and text sentiment analysis, the authors use machine learning method to analyze the sentiment orientation of the legal course review text, through method that combines PMI and SVM. At the same time, this paper uses LibSVM tool to train and predict data, collect and pre-process data through network data collection, and, based on traditional algorithms, propose improved experimental scheme based on their respective advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the model proposed in this study is used to classify and process the emotional text, and the two methods are combined to obtain the final result.

Most existing fault diagnosis methods based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) can only extract single-scale features, which not only loss fault sensitive information on other scales, but also suffer from the domain shift problem. In this work, a novel end-to-end deep learning network named adaptive weighted multiscale convolutional neural network (AWMSCNN) is proposed to adaptively extract robust and discriminative multiscale fusion features from raw vibration signals. The AWMSCNN consists of three main components: the denoising layer, the adaptive weighted multiscale convolutional (AWMSC) block, and the multiscale feature fusion layer. The AWMSC block can learn rich and complementary features on multiple scales in parallel. Then, an adaptive weight vector is introduced to modulate multiscale features to emphasize fault sensitive features and suppress features that are sensitive to operating conditions. The train wheelset bearing dataset and the bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) are used to verify the superiority of the proposed model over the basic CNN and other multiscale CNN models. The experiment results show that the proposed model has strong fault discriminative ability and domain adaptive ability against variable operating conditions.

J	Lu, L; He, YG; Wang, T; Shi, TC; Ruan, Y				Lu, Li; He, Yigang; Wang, Tao; Shi, Tiancheng; Ruan, Yi			Wind Turbine Planetary Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Based on Self-Powered Wireless Sensor and Deep Learning Approach	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Wind turbine; PGB; DBN; QPSO; self-powered wireless sensor	RFID SENSOR	In this paper, a novel and more effective fault diagnosis approach for wind turbine planetary gearbox (PGB) is proposed. In order to better detect the faults in the early stage of the faults of the wind turbine PGB, the corresponding maintenance measures can be carried out to prevent the faults from becoming more serious, so as to seriously affect the normal operation of the fan gearbox. The gear with lighter fault degree is used to simulate the early fault signal. Compared with the fault which has seriously affected the normal working condition, the fault characteristics of the early fault signal are more difficult to detect. So in this design, deep belief network (DBN) optimized by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to extract deeper and more identifiable features of slight fault signal. After optimization by QPSO algorithm, DBN can get a most suitable structure according to the actual working signal of fan gearbox. Then these extracted features are input into the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) optimized by QPSO for fault diagnosis test. At the same time, the wireless sensor nodes using self-energy in vibration state are optimized. By using microcontroller unit (MCU) MSP430F149 and nRF24L01 radio frequency (RF) chip with lower energy consumption, the normal dormant state can be maintained, the power requirement of transmission mode can be met, the stability of the whole node can be improved, and the phenomenon of energy shortage caused by short-term fluctuation can be prevented. The comparative experiments in this paper show that this method has good effect on the fault diagnosis of wind turbine PGB.

J	Prosvirin, AE; Islam, MMM; Kim, JM				Prosvirin, Alexander E.; Islam, M. M. Manjurul; Kim, Jong-Myon			An Improved Algorithm for Selecting IMF Components in Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition for Domain of Rub-Impact Fault Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adaptive thresholding; degree-of-presence ratio; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; intrinsic mode function selection; KL-divergence; rub-impact faults	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM	A rubbing fault is a complex non-linear and non-stationary fault that frequently occurs in rotating machinery such as turbines. One of the most frequently applied signal processing techniques for the analysis of rub-impact faults in rotating machines is ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Despite the advantages of using EEMD in analyzing non-linear and non-stationary signals, it is crucial to determine which of the extracted intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) carry the most valuable and significant information about the mechanical faults under investigation. In this paper, an improvement in the IMF selection technique is introduced, which is based on the recent ratio of degree-of-presence (DPR) to the Kullback-Leibler divergence (DPR/KLdiv). The number of selected IMFs in the DPR/KLdiv-based technique is subjective with a constant threshold, whereas we apply an adaptive thresholding technique to select the most meaningful IMFs that are relevant to a rubbing fault. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed enhanced IMF selection algorithm allows for better signal denoising properties than the original technique while preserving significant features evidencing the presence of rubbing faults in rotating machinery.

First, the convex hull distance from a test tensor sample to the convex hull is taken as the similarity measure for classification. Then, the convex hull distance calculation is transformed into the feature tensor inner product, and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition is applied to the calculation process to capture the intrinsic information of the feature tensor. Furthermore, the reduction factor is introduced into NNCHTC to enhance its robustness. Finally, feature tensors are obtained from multi-sensor signals by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and used to identify gear working condition by NNCHTC. The experimental results show that NNCHTC not only can be effectively applied to the gear intelligent fault diagnosis based on multi-sensor signals but also has better robustness.

However, most existing solutions not only require substantial expertise to conduct feature engineering, but also seldom consider the temporal correlation of sensor sequences, ultimately leading to complex modeling processes. Therefore, we present a novel model, named Attention-based Equitable Segmentation Gated Recurrent Unit Networks (AESGRU), to improve diagnostic accuracy and model-building efficiency. Specifically, our proposed AESGRU consists of two modules, an equitable segmentation approach and an improved deep model. We first transform the original dataset into time-series segments with temporal correlation, so that the model enables end-to-end learning from the strongly correlated data. Then, we deploy a single-layer bidirectional GRU network, which is enhanced by attention mechanism, to capture the long-term dependency of sensor segments and focus limited attention resources on those informative sampling points. Finally, our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous approaches in terms of the accuracy.

When a satellite battery is working in outer space, its capacity will gradually decrease as the number of cycles increases, and a certain degree of capacity recovery will occur. Due to the excellent mapping relationship between the discharge cutoff voltage and the capacity degradation of lithium-ion batteries and the fact that the sample entropy (SampEn) can sensitively capture local fluctuations, such as the recovery effect during lithium-ion battery capacity degradation, a method for interval prediction of the satellite battery state of health (SOH) based on SampEn was proposed. This method adopts a neural network model based on lower upper bound estimation (LUBE). The method uses the discharge cutoff voltage and the discharge voltage SampEn as the inputs and the battery SOH as the output for the neural network model. To improve the prediction interval coverage and reduce the prediction interval width, especially considering that the lower bound of the interval prediction often determines whether the satellite battery output power reaches the warning threshold, a modified comprehensive indicator function, the coverage width-based criterion (CWC), was constructed. Additionally, based on the nondifferentiability of this indicator function, a simulated annealing algorithm was used to optimize the neural network; at the same time, the optimal values of the interval coverage and interval width were taken into account, resulting in the lower bound of the prediction interval being closer to the actual value. Finally, test data from a NASA 18 battery were used to validate, analyze and verify the interval prediction algorithm proposed in this paper.

The density of the thickening process in hydrometallurgical production is rather poor, and there are many interference factors, resulting in frequent failures in the density of the thickening process. The main focus of this paper is to propose a method of fault monitoring and diagnosis for the density of the thickening process in hydrometallurgy. First, through the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, the fault detection model is established to monitor the blockage of the underflow pipeline of the thickener. Second, the fault diagnosis model is established by using the random forest algorithm, and particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the fault diagnosis model. The fault type is judged using the optimized diagnosis model, and the corresponding treatment measures are taken accordingly.

J	Ding, Y; Ma, L; Ma, J; Wang, C; Lu, C				Ding, Yu; Ma, Liang; Ma, Jian; Wang, Chao; Lu, Chen			A Generative Adversarial Network-Based Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Method for Rotating Machinery Under Small Sample Size Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Gallium nitride; Training; Generative adversarial networks; Feature extraction; Generators; Fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; generative adversarial network; small sample size conditions	WAVELET TRANSFORM; NEURAL-NETWORK; SVMS	Rotating machinery plays a key role in mechanical equipment, and the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is a popular research topic. To overcome the dependency on expert knowledge regarding conventional time-frequency analysis diagnosis methods, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods are commonly studied. Although these methods can achieve high-accuracy diagnosis results, they are based on a large number of training samples. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is an algorithm with the capability of generating realistic samples that are similar to the real samples, and it can be applied to solve fault diagnosis problems with insufficient training data, which is called the small sample size condition in this study. However, a single-GAN model cannot achieve a good diagnostic result. To achieve adaptive feature extraction and high diagnosis accuracy, this study proposes an intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on GANs under small sample size conditions. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are validated using rolling bearing and gearbox datasets. In these datasets, only 10 and 20 of the samples are selected as the training data. Samples associated with different health conditions and various working conditions are included in the datasets. Compared with those of other diagnosis methods, the high-accuracy and low-volatility diagnosis results indicate that the proposed method can stably distinguish fault modes under different working conditions in an adaptive way, even though few training samples are available.

In some critical applications, failures in these machines can cause operational disasters and cost lives if they are not detected in advance. The classical methods for detecting incipient faults in BLDC motors perform processing of the current signal to obtain the required information. In this work, the SAC-DM (Signal Analysis based on Chaos using Density of Maxima) technique is applied for the first time in the diagnosis of failures of electromechanical systems from sound signals. Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis (WMA) is used to separate a chaotic signal component from the sound emitted by the motor. This work demonstrates that it is feasible to perform dynamic eccentricity diagnosis in BLDC motors by identifying variations of the SAC-DM of the sound signal. The technique exposed in this work requires low computational cost and achieves high success rate. To validate the method, tests were carried out on a small BLDC motor normally used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), demonstrating the ability of the method to detect the speed of the motor in 95.89 of the cases and to detect eccentricity problems at a fixed speed in 88.34 of the cases.

With the advent of cloud-connected devices, there are huge amounts of the battery degradation trend data available. How to make full use of these existing degradation data for the SOH prediction is a valuable problem deserving deep research. Aiming at this problem, a multiple Gaussian process regression (MGPR) method is proposed for the SOH prediction of lithium-ion batteries. In this work, the health indicators (HIs) are firstly extracted from the charging process curves of the batteries, and the mutual information analysis is used to select the important HIs which are strongly correlated to the SOH. These selected HIs are applied as the regression model input for describing the aging procedure of the battery effectively. Then, Gaussian process regression modeling is performed on the different batteries to bring multiple GPR models. Lastly, a weighting strategy based on the prediction uncertainty is designed to integrate the predictions from the multiple GPR models. The method validations are executed on the battery datasets from NASA, and the results show that the proposed MGPR method has higher prediction accuracy than the basic GPR method.

The performances analyses of motor under WSF are the basis of fault detection and diagnosis. An efficient and accurate faulty model is a great tool for evaluating motor performances under various WSF. Hence, this paper proposes a novel physical faulty model (PFM) based on the coil sub-element for the DDPMSM with the WSF. Fault position can be examined by differentiating the inductance and the electromotive force of the coil sub-element. This model can evaluate motor performances under various WSF, especially inter-turn short-circuit fault in different positions of the same slot, without changing the internal structure of model. The faults are set by connecting the desired taps as in the practical motor. First, the structure and parameters of the DDPMSM are reported. Second, the inductance calculation matrix, which considers the spatial position of the fault, is constructed. Then, the proposed PFM is established. The motor performances under various WSF are evaluated. Finally, the results of PFM, finite element model and experiment are compared. The results validate the correctness of the proposed PFM.

Therefore, this paper designs a hybrid approach of principal component analysis (PCA) and backpropagation (BP)-adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) neural network (NN), and applies the method to predict the NCDs for children with nephrotic syndrome. Specifically, PCA method was employed for dimension reduction. Six principal components were extracted from multiple physiological features, and taken as input variables of three-tiered neural networks. The boosted predictor of BP-AdaBoost model, together with three predictors of BP NN, support vector machine (SVM) and radial basis function (RBF) NN, was trained for NCDs prediction. The experimental results show that the predictor of BP-AdaBoost NN achieves the mean absolute error of 0.2334, the mean relative error of 3.2789, the SD of 4.6804 and the RSD of 50.8053 in NCDs prediction, and it outperforms other predictors of BP NN, SVM and RBF NN on both accuracy and precision. Furthermore, comparison experiments are conducted on PCA processed testing data and raw testing data for BP-AdaBoost NN and demonstrate the excellent effect of PCA.

In the field of fault diagnosis, deep learning has been extensively used due to its excellent feature learning ability. However, it still suffers from several issues; for example, 1) simultaneous requirements of features from multiple aspects, including sparsity and robustness, are hardly met due to the limited feature learning ability of a single model, and 2) most methods deal with preprocessed signals instead of original time domain signals because of the noise interference and deficiency of a single model. To solve these problems, this study proposes a new deep fusion network for fault feature learning, which combines two types of deep learning models, namely, sparse autoencoder and contractive autoencoder, which are respectively applied to enhance features sparsity and robustness and thereby guarantee the representativeness of extracted features and gain strong anti-interference ability. Consequently, fault diagnosis with original time domain signals can be realized. Bearing and gearbox fault diagnosis experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the presented network. Results show that the diagnosis accuracies for two cases are higher than those of networks based on single contractive autoencoder and sparse autoencoder. These results demonstrate that the proposed fusion network has superior feature learning ability relative to single model networks and can deal with original time domain signals by simultaneously enhancing features sparsity and robustness.

Explainable Prediction of Chronic Renal Disease in the Colombian Population Using Neural Networks and Case-Based Reasoning	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Biological neural networks; Diseases; Training; Data models; Artificial intelligence; Sociology; Chronic kidney disease prediction; neural networks; case-based reasoning; twin systems; explainable AI; support vector machines; random forest	MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a person is at risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD). The model is trained with the demographic data and medical care information of two population groups: on the one hand, people diagnosed with CKD in Colombia during 2018, and on the other, a sample of people without a diagnosis of this disease. Once the model is trained and evaluation metrics for classification algorithms are applied, the model achieves 95 accuracy in the test data set, making its application for disease prognosis feasible. However, despite the demonstrated efficiency of the neural networks to predict CKD, this machine-learning paradigm is opaque to the expert regarding the explanation of the outcome. Current research on eXplainable AI proposes the use of twin systems, where a black-box machine-learning method is complemented by another white-box method that provides explanations about the predicted values. Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has proved to be an ideal complement as this paradigm is able to find explanatory cases for an explanation-by-example justification of a neural networks prediction. In this paper, we apply and validate a NN-CBR twin system for the explanation of CKD predictions. As a result of this research, 3,494,516 people were identified as being at risk of developing CKD in Colombia, or 7 of the total population.

A system commonly works under varying operating conditions, which may affect the system degradation trajectory differently and consequently reduce the accuracy of remaining useful life estimation. In this paper, we propose CNN-XGB with extended time window to tackle this issue. Firstly, the extended time window is created by feature extension and time window processing in data preprocessing. In feature extension, multiple degradation features are extracted by an improved differential method, and these features are appended to the raw data as additional features. To make the time window cover more information for better prognostic accuracy, a time window padding method is used considering the problem of missing data in some samples. Secondly, a convolutional neural network architecture with multichannel 1 1 filter kernel is proposed considering the effect of varying operating conditions. Furthermore, to improve the prognostic robustness and avoid the sensitivity to the abnormal data, convolutional neural network and extreme gradient boosting are fused by model averaging (CNN-XGB). The validity of the proposed method is verified using aero-engine datasets from NASA.

However, there are two defects in the SSD method. SSD method uses the normalized mean square error as the stopping criterion for decomposition, and there is an over-decomposition phenomenon; the noise has a great influence on SSD and extracting fault features is difficult in a strong background noise environment. In view of the deficiencies of the SSD algorithm, the paper proposes a novel stopping criterion to make the SSD method adaptively stop. Firstly, the SSD method is improved by using the cumulative percent variance contribution rate of the principal component analysis method (PCA) as the decomposition stop criterion. Secondly, calculate the correlation coefficient between the decomposed singular spectral components (SSC) and the raw signal. Eliminating weakly correlation signal. Thirdly, due to the component signal contains noise, and employ a single filter has limitations. So, the paper uses the Auto Regressive (AR) filter filters the decomposed high-frequency component signal and the Savitzky Golay (SG) filter filters the decomposed low-frequency component signal. Finally, applies mutual information entropy (MIE) to distinguish the SSCs components distinguish two parts: high-frequency part and low-frequency part. FFT transforms and extracts fault features. The simulation signal and the composite fault signal extraction of the wind turbine gearbox test bench shows the effectiveness and superiority of the method.

With the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) technology, the particle filter (PF) has been considered a promising tool for online prognostics of FCG. Among the existing FCG models, the traditional Paris-Erdogan model is most commonly used in PF-based FCG prognostics. The parameters of the Paris-Erdogan model can be estimated together with the crack state in the PF framework. However, we find that there is a problem of <italic>Coordinated Change</italic> when the parameters priors are far from the true values. As a result, the filtering results appear as a correct remaining useful life (RUL) prognosis but an incorrect parameters estimation. To solve this problem, in this paper, a novel recursive least squares-kernel smoothing (RLS-KS) method is proposed for parameter estimation in PF-based FCG prognostics. The proposed method is validated through an experimental application; and then compared with the classic artificial evolution (AE) and kernel smoothing (KS) methods. The validation results show that the RLS-KS method can provide both correct RUL prognostics and parameter estimation.

The fault detection is performed by comparing the measured and estimated DC link currents. The fault isolation is achieved according to machine phase signal estimation and the corresponding residual examination. Single sensor fault, multiple sensor faults and non-sensor fault are covered by the proposed FDI method. The proposed sensor FDI method is not influenced by machine imbalance, feasible for FDI of both single and multiple machine current sensor faults, and capable of distinguishing between machine current sensor fault and non-sensor fault. The proposed method is validated with simulation studies in MATLAB, and the studies demonstrate that the proposed machine current sensor FDI method, different from existing methods, has a unique feature of being able to handle multiple sensor faults with the consideration of non-sensor fault disturbance.

However, the selection of robust classifier for reliable decision making in healthcare domain is three-fold: accuracy, refraining for low confidence decisions, and the cost of decisions. In the field of medical science, there are costs associated with the incorrect and the refraining from decisions, which can have negative implications in devising adequate therapeutic interventions. For example, it may be life threating if a cancer patient is declared as healthy one (misclassification cost) or decision remains pending for some time (rejection cost). In this work we proposed the concept of Accuracy Rejection Normalized-Cost Curves (ARNCCs), which is an extension of Accuracy Rejection Curves (ARCs); a three-dimensional visualization technique to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of classification algorithms over different rejection regions and normalized-cost (NC) to select the robust classifier. ARNCCs method holds ARCs plot on two dimensions, in addition it computes NC at third dimension against ratio of false positive costs and ratio of rejection costs obtained at different rejection rates. The proposed three-dimensional graphs have the potential to answer a variety of questions regarding accuracy, rejection rate and NC of a classifier. Six publicly available cancer datasets (four breast cancer and two lung cancer) having clinical parameters obtained from ML repository of University of California, Irvine (UCI) were used to assess the performance of proposed ARNCCs in this study. Empirical results show that ARNCCs provide broad range of decisions to choose the desired parameters (accuracy, rejection rate and NC) for further necessary actions as compared to traditional ARCs method. ARNCCs framework has the ability to more logically compare the performances of classification algorithms in terms of accuracy, rejection rate and NC based scenarios.

This paper surveys recent advancements in PHM methodologies using deep learning with the aim of identifying research gaps and suggesting further improvements. After a brief introduction to several deep learning models, we review and analyze applications of fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis using deep learning. The survey validates the universal applicability of deep learning to various types of input in PHM, including vibration, imagery, time-series and structured data. It also reveals that deep learning provides a one-fits-all framework for the primary PHM subfields: fault detection uses either reconstruction error or stacks a binary classifier on top of the network to detect anomalies; fault diagnosis typically adds a soft-max layer to perform multi-class classification; prognosis adds a continuous regression layer to predict remaining useful life. The general framework suggests the possibility of transfer learning across PHM applications. The survey reveals some common properties and identifies the research gaps in each PHM subfield. It concludes by summarizing some major challenges and potential opportunities in the domain.

J	Li, YB; Zou, L; Jiang, L; Zhou, XY				Li, Yibing; Zou, Li; Jiang, Li; Zhou, Xiangyu			Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Based on Combination of Deep Belief Network and One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Deep belief network (DBN); one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN); rotating machinery; feature extraction; intelligent fault diagnosis	CLASSIFICATION	The traditional intelligent diagnosis methods of rotating machinery generally require feature extraction of the raw signals in advance. However, it is a very time-consuming and laborious process for extracting the sensitive feature information to improve classification performance. Deep learning method, as a novel machine learning approach, can simultaneously achieve feature extraction and pattern classification. With the characteristics of Deep Belief Network (DBN) and one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) (e.g. learning complex nonlinear, sparse connection and weight sharing), a precise diagnosis method based on the combination of DBN and 1D-CNN is proposed. Firstly, the DBN composed of three pre-trained restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) is constructed to achieve feature extraction and dimensionality reduction of the high-dimensional raw data. Secondly, the low-dimensional features extracted by DBN are fed into 1D-CNN for further extracting the abstract features. Finally, Soft-max classifier is employed to identify different operating conditions of rotating machinery. The superiority of the proposed method is validated by comparison with several state-of-the art fault diagnosis methods on two experimental cases. Meanwhile, the proposed method is tested in different background noises and on the imbalanced datasets. The results show that it has higher efficiency and accuracy than the state-of-the art fault diagnosis methods.

In this study, we designed and fabricated a group of EDLD system modules, that could apply the technology of cloud sensors to achieve the function of automatic defense of failure. If the failure problems of machines and equipment were found by a multifunction sensor and noted immediately, all the operation reliabilities of machines and equipment could be controlled. Even if the numbers of machines and equipment were more than those of engineers, the machines and equipment could also be handled easily. The EDLD system would collect much data (or so-called big data), which were detected by numerous microsystems. Each microsystem was composed of several cloud sensors, one microcontroller unit ( MCU) card, and one wireless communication card to achieve the function of multidetection. Each microsystem had its own monitoring regions, and when the detective values of the monitoring regions were beyond the warning or admonished ones, the messages were sent automatically and immediately by the EDLD system, and the engineers would be notified to troubleshoot the problems. The monitoring process is convenient and simple because if the equipment or machines suddenly lose their functions, the EDLD system with the technology of cloud sensors can greatly reduce the loads of the engineers.

The companies that produce manufacturing machines now can follow the products throughout the production chain, from the project to the deployment in real scenarios. Industry 4.0 is pushing this trend forward, demanding for servitization of products and machines, mainly for the manufacturing sector where human and production machine are in strict collaboration. The data produced by the machines must be processed quickly to allow the implementation of reactive services such as predictive maintenance and remote control, always taking care of the safety of nearby people. This paper proposes a multi-layer architecture to tackle the main issues in monitoring legacy manufacturing machines and to provide general guidelines to solve them. We derived some guidelines from a real Industry 4.0 transition experiment performed together with the company technical departments to accomplish an efficient system for monitoring and servitization of manufacturing machines, with a scalable platform that confirms its usefulness in many production facilities with different needs.

There is a greater potential for increasing the system's awareness of the machine health and processes status that may lead to reduced downtime and increased level of automation and product quality, assuring a more dynamic responsiveness to changes in consumer demand. In this context, the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) increasingly become an indispensable component of many engineering systems. Meantime, with the rapidly evolving technology of the smart grid, electric vehicles (EVs) and the consequent industrial twin of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV), the battery is emerging as the most prominent energy storage device. Among this consideration, this paper aims to propose a practical DC Motor Equivalent Circuit testbed that may allow the design and the consequential training of a battery PHM system, able to grasp the information from the State-of-Charge (SOC), State-Of-Health (SOC) estimation evaluating the assessment of the predicted evolution with regards to the planned workload. In particular, the objective of the presented study is to contribute to the developing process of an innovative battery PHM system, proposing a reproducible and practical methodology for designing an equivalent load-dependent electrical circuit.

Performance evaluation of full-cloud and edge-cloud architectures for Industrial IoT anomaly detection based on deep learning	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON METROLOGY FOR INDUSTRY 4.0 AND INTERNET OF THINGS (METROIND4.0&IOT)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT) (MetroInd4.0 and IoT)	JUN 04-06, 2019	Naples, ITALY	IEEE, Univ Sannio, Univ Brescia, Univ Napoli Federico II, Dipartimento Ingn Electtrica Tecnologie Informazione, Univ Napoli Federico II, Neapolis		Industry 4.0; Distributed measurement systems; Automation Networks; Cloud computing; MQTT	INTERNET; NETWORK; DESIGN	One of the most interesting application of data analysis to industry is the real-time detection of anomalies during production. Industrial IoT paradigm includes all the components to realize predictive systems, like the anomaly detection ones. In this case, the goal is to discover patterns, in a given dataset, that do not resemble the "normal" behavior, to identify faults, malfunctions or the effects of bad maintenance. The use of complex neural networks to implement deep learning algorithm for anomaly detection is very common. The position of the deep learning algorithm is one of the main problem: this kind of algorithm requires both high computational power and data transfer bandwidth, rising serious questions on the system scalability. Data elaboration in the edge domain (i.e. close to the machine) usually reduce data transfer but requires to instantiate expensive physical assets. Cloud computing is usually cheaper but Cloud data transfer is expensive. In this paper a test methodology for the comparison of the two architectures for anomaly detection system is proposed. A real use case is described in order to demonstrate the feasibility. The experimental results show that, by means of the proposed methodology, edge and Cloud solutions implementing deep learning algorithms for industrial applications can be easily evaluated. In details, for the considered use case (with Siemens controller and Microsoft Azure platform) the tradeoff between scalability, communication delay, and bandwidth usage, has been studied. The results show that the full-cloud architecture can outperform the edge-cloud architecture when Cloud computation power is scaled.

Patients who achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAT, usually have better prognosis than those without. Thus, prediction of pathologic response is an important clinical issue for breast cancer patient. The purpose of this study is to develop and analyze a new computer-aided detection (CAD) and machine learning scheme using the quantitative kinetic and texture based image features extracted from breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed before and after NAT chemotherapy to predict the pCR. The images of 153 breast cancer patients underwent NAT were included in the analytical dataset. Among them, 52 achieved pCR and 101 cases were non-pCR after the NAT. A CAD scheme was developed to segment breast region and compute a total of 38 kinetic and texture features from the segmented breast regions. An image feature reduction method was used to identify 8 optimal features from the original feature pool. Then, a fine Gaussian support vector machine (FGSVM) based classifier was used to classify the two categories of pCR and non-pCR cases, which were optimized and tested using a ten-fold cross validation method. The results indicated that using features extracted from the post-chemotherapy yielded the higher area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.81 +/- 0.04 and accuracy of 82% compared to using pre-chemotherapy images. This study demonstrated that image features extracted from breast MR images acquired after the NAT chemotherapy have good potential in prediction of pathology complete response.

Deep learning leads to performance comparable to those of expert physicians, albeit not ensuring that the same clinical factors are learned in the deep representations. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the handcrafted and the deep learning features in the context of ROP diagnosis. Average statistics on the handcrafted features for each input image were expressed as retinal concept measures. Three disease severity grades, i.e. normal, pre-plus and plus, were classified by a deep convolutional neural network. Regression Concept Vectors (RCV) were computed in the network feature space for each retinal concept measure. Relevant concept measures were identified by bidirectional relevance scores for the normal and plus classes. Results show that the curvature, diameter and tortuosity of the segmented vessels are indeed relevant to the classification. Among the potential applications of this method, the analysis of borderline cases between the classes and of network faults, in particular, can be used to improve the performance.

Dose distribution as outcome predictor for Gamma Knife radiosurgery on vestibular schwannoma	MEDICAL IMAGING 2019: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis	FEB 17-20, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Gamma Knife radiosurgery; vestibular schwannoma; dose distribution; homogeneity index; three-dimensional histogram of oriented gradients; PCA; classification; SVM; outcome prediction	EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES	Vestibular schwannomas are benign brain tumors that can be treated radiosurgically with the Gamma Knife in order to stop tumor progression. However, in some cases tumor progression is not stopped and treatment is deemed a failure. At present, the reason for these failed treatments is unknown. Clinical factors and MRI characteristics have been considered as prognostic factors. Another confounder in the success of treatment is the treatment planning itself. It is thought to be very uniformly planned, even though dose distributions among treatment plans are highly inhomogeneous. This paper explores the predictive value of these dose distributions for the treatment outcome. We compute homogeneity indices (HI) and three-dimensional histogram-of-oriented gradients (3D-HOG) and employ support vector machine (SVM) paired with principal component analysis (PCA) for classification. In a clinical dataset, consisting of 20 tumors that showed treatment failure and 20 tumors showing treatment success, we discover that the correlation of the HI values with the treatment outcome presents no statistical evidence of an association (52:5% accuracy employing linear SVM and no statistical significant difference with t-tests), whereas the 3D-HOG features concerning the dose distribution do present correlations to the treatment outcome, suggesting the influence of the treatment on the outcome itself (77:5% accuracy employing linear SVM and PCA). These findings can provide a basis for refining towards personalized treatments and prediction of treatment efficiency. However, larger datasets are needed for more extensive analysis.

HCCs with MaVI presented with aggressive tumor behavior and poor survival. Early identification of HCCs at high risk of MaVI would promote adequate preoperative treatment strategy making, so as to prolong the patient survival. Thus, we aimed to develop a computed tomography (CT)-based radiomics model to preoperatively predict MaVI status in HCC, meanwhile explore the prognostic prediction power of the radiomics model. A cohort of 452 patients diagnosed with HCC was collected from 5 hospitals in China with complete CT images, clinical data, and follow-ups. 15 out of 708 radiomic features were selected for MaVI prediction using LASSO regression modeling. A radiomics signature was constructed by support vector machine based on the 15 selected features. To evaluate the prognostic power of the signature, Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test were plotted on MaVI occurrence time (MOT), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The radiomics signature showed satisfactory performance on MaVI prediction with area under curves of 0.885 and 0.770 on the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. Patients could successfully be divided into high- and low-risk groups on MOT and PFS with p-value of 0.0017 and 0.0013, respectively. Regarding to OS, the Kaplan-Meier curve did not present with significant difference which may be caused by non-uniformfollowing treatments after disease progression. To conclude, the proposed radiomics model could facilitate MaVI prediction along with prognostic implication in HCC management.

This work presents the development of laboratory practices for testing related to signal acquisition tasks that have been performed with students. The tests have been developed in the framework of a subject, where signal processing tools applied to machine diagnostics are taught as an important part of maintenance. Specifically, the type of signals that are used in the subject are time domain vibration signals. With the inclusion of the tests, postgraduate students of engineering learn how to use a machine to obtain vibration signals and how to set the machine for that purpose. Also, they are able to diagnose rotating elements with different faults; such as bearings, and unbalanced shafts. The laboratory practice gives the opportunity to tackle a job for themselves, which is one of the most important skills for the future engineer, as they gain experience.	[Zamorano, M.; Gomez, M.

For the cable fault characteristics, the impedance method is used to analyze the impedance of the cable and the magnitude and phase of the current is used for actual fault diagnosis. A FPGA-centric platform is designed to calculate the magnitude and phase of the current generated in cable in real time. Analysis by actual current data, the feasibility of the program has been verified. For the diagnosis of fault characteristics, the way of the classifier is adopted: Logistic Regression, and support vector machine (SVM). This paper briefly introduces the implementation principles of the two models. The training set and test set are constructed from the actual collected data. The two models are trained and tested respectively. According to the accuracy of the test results and the complexity of the model, the model suitable for fault diagnosis with FPGA is selected.

In order to sustain healthy period of mechanical systems, condition of the machine elements requires to be monitored regularly. Monitoring starts with collecting physical signals through the dynamic mechanical systems with different types of sensors and ends with the interpration of the signals with a software. In this research, physical signals such as acoustics, vibration and electrical signals are acquired with a Data Acquisition Card (DAQ) that is integrated with a computer system. These signals are collected through an experimental setup that is designed, constructed and located in a laboratory ambient. The novelty of this research is studying and comparing efficiency of acoustic technique, vibration technique and electrical technique in detection of misalignment in horizontal direction and subharmonic, superharmonic resonance failures in the early stage before unplanned stoppages. The purpose is making contribution to prognostics science in mechanical maintenance subject in terms of preventing catastrophic failure conditions on dynamic mechanical systems.

We assume power law (Weibull) form of the time-dependent portion of failure intensity and the Cox proportional hazards assumption for the covariate portion of failure intensity. We model the effects of preventive and corrective maintenance as multiplicative on both time and either health indicator, or raw observed covariates. Thus, we incorporate both time- and covariate-dependent parts, as well as the maintenance effects in one failure intensity function. The effects of preventive or corrective types of maintenance are modelled as different maintenance effect parameters. We derive the likelihood function and obtain the least squares estimates (LSE) of covariate coefficient(s), Weibull shape and scale parameters, as well as the preventive and corrective maintenance effect estimates on time and covariate(s). The application of the proposed model is shown in a real case study of railway point machines subject to periodic preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance on failures.

The excessive time required to diagnose the failure and return the item to service can often be attributed to inadequate diagnostics capability and complex manual troubleshooting procedures. Unfortunately, these problems also lead to pulling the wrong item resulting in Cannot Duplicates (CNDs), repair turnaround time (RTAT) increases and a decrease in field operational availability. While purchasing additional spares, developing more training, and designing more sophisticated external test equipment is a solution to this issue, it is often costly from both a schedule and budget perspective and burdensome for the maintainer, operator and the customer. Alternatively, a solution that enhances diagnostics and decreases the time to isolate a failure is more attractive as it reduces the spares demand and minimizes downtime, thus improving mission availability. Integrating an interactive diagnostic capability within the maintenance environment assists the maintainer in faster and more robust troubleshooting capabilities. A graphical model-based analysis highlights selections of equipment involved in the ambiguity group based on Built-In-Test (BIT) results, failure symptoms, and/or manual troubleshooting outputs. Links to appropriate sections of maintenance procedures are embedded for quick access to remove and replace procedures. This solution transforms maintenance troubleshooting capabilities enabling faster decision cycles and reduced system downtime when failures occur. This paper describes how diagnostic dependency models can be utilized along with developing maintenance procedures to enhance troubleshooting capability. Diagnostic dependency models created during the development phase can be further employed while designing the architecture and approach for maintenance procedures helping solve this diagnostic gap. In summary, this paper features how a diagnostic model-based maintenance capability advances human-machine integration throughout the sustainment phase.

The dependency among cells is critical to the useful life of the pack. Such dependency is attributed to many factors such as battery pack configurations and the mismatch of internal resistance. This paper proposes a general spatio-temporal prognostics method to model and quantify the dependency among cells through a class of selected spatial covariance structure. The covariance function in the proposed spatio-temporal model is estimated based on the cells capacity. Since cell-level capacity measurements in a battery pack may not be directly available, a capacity estimator based on sample entropy of current and voltage is proposed.

The aircraft landing gear shock absorber is a critical system and to enhance its reliability, a health monitoring system can be introduced to detect loads which can impact its structural integrity, functional and performance degradation, operational incidents, impending failures and provide advance warning for proactive maintenance actions. A number of health monitoring schemes have been proposed which check the condition of landing gear shock strut components but these do not provide a systems level coverage and analysis for the different failure modes which a landing gear can experience. With the rapid advances in sensor accuracy, design technology and data communication, a prognostics and health monitoring system design can detect diverse functional and operational failure conditions, support maintenance activities and ensure higher aircraft operational availability.

But most of existing data-driven prognostic methods still lack an effective model that can utilize operational conditions data to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of engineered systems. To fill these practical gaps, this paper develops a novel prognostic method based on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) network. The proposed method can effectively integrate multiple sensors data with operational conditions data for RUL prediction of engineered systems. In the proposed prognostic framework, multiple raw sensors data, operational conditions data, and inspection time epoch are preprocessed to form the desired sequences data with fixed length, and then are taken as main inputs and auxiliary inputs to fed into proposed BLSTM based network. And the labeled RUL are used as actual output for training the proposed model. Different from other deep learning (DL) based prognostic methods, the developed method can simultaneously model both sensors data and operational conditions data in a consolidated framework. The proposed approach is validated through a case study on aircraft turbofan engine, and comparisons with other existing state-of-the-art methods are also included.

The role of prognostic and health management (PHM) in battery application is to ensure that the battery system is reliable and safe through the estimation of State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the battery. Although there is a growing research trend in predicting the SoH and RUL using various machine learning algorithms, there has not yet been many sophisticated works that employ the deep learning algorithms for PHM in battery analysis. This research presents the preliminary development of a predictive data-driven model using Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithm. The proposed DNN algorithm is a deep learning approach that is fundamentally based on the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with advanced hidden layers to analyze more complex data features, such as, the SoH and RUL of a battery. To ensure the effectiveness of the proposed DNN algorithm, the lithium-ion battery dataset obtained from the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) is presented as a case study. The proposed deep learning algorithm is compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and regular ANN. The results demonstrate that the DNN algorithm exhibits in a better prediction. Further, the proposed approach hopes to serve as a benchmark algorithm for all future deep learning algorithms in predicting SoH and RUL of battery data.

What do we realize for an affluent society using IoT and AI? It is a matter of great urgency to answer this question. The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) actually changed their policy in 2017, from "Digital First" to "IoT First" [1] as shown in Figure 1. METI hopes that IoT and AI will provide clear solutions to home appliance accident prevention and accurate plant maintenance by making good use of big data on network services. [GRAPHICS] Every electrical component has the possibility to report many conditions using data measurement sensors, so it is possible to build big data related to the failure of electrical facilities in network services. However, failure modes of almost all electrical parts involve a sudden breakdown without clear signs of degradation. It is not clear what engineering method is applicable for analyzing big data to provide accurate electrical facilities maintenance. This problem should be solved quickly. The solution should lead to the development of a new risk analysis methodology for electrical facilities maintenance. This paper summarizes the research progress of diagnostic and prognostic techniques for electrical components first, and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of one candidate technology for this research is introduced. This paper discusses the near future goal of plant mechanical facilities maintenance by applying IoT and AI in Japan, and then clarifies the engineering problem for electrical facilities maintenance. This paper further discusses that the latest risk analysis research cases in four engineering fields. Finally, a new research plan for risk-based maintenance (RBM) methodology applying IoT to electrical facilities is proposed.

Prognostics, which is the basis of CBM, deals with predicting the future behavior and remaining useful life (RUL) of systems. In many applications, the system composed of multiple components that are stochastically dependent (S-dependent). Most of the earlier works that characterize RUL estimation of the multi-component systems are developed on the premise that components in a system are independent. The existing methods fail to perform when the components are interdependent. This paper proposes a RUL prediction approach based on instance-based learning considering the S-dependency between multiple components of a given system. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a simulated dataset is used. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with another popular approach and the state-of-the-art results on the same dataset.

This network consists of segments of roads, which are grouped into clusters that have similar degradation profiles. These models are applied in order to predict the roads' deterioration, and to estimate the needs for maintenance, as well as to plan for the necessary budget, according to different investment scenarios. Some of these segments' clusters are not sufficiently well defined by the current explanatory variables, such as the segments' structural categories, the functional classes of roads, and the levels of traffic, in order to be adequate predictors of segments' deterioration. This paper presents a project that was accomplished in order to solve the segments' clustering problem that aims at reducing the variability of the performance indices (PI) of segments that belong to the same cluster, at the same age, or at similar profile of degradation. Thus, the paper focuses on the problem of clustering road segments whose deterioration is similar, by using artificial intelligence techniques. Specifically, it aims at finding the profiles that best describe segments with similar degradation, and the analysis of this degradation over time. A unique segment's identifier, several performance indices (PI), a set of characteristic factors, and the age at the time of collecting an observation, describe each road's segment. The results show that using artificial intelligent techniques leads to better clustering of the roads' segments and to a decrease in the variability of the performance indices within the same cluster.

This method consists of multi-sourced monitoring data capturing, data preprocessing and multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) based end to end fault diagnosis. As the core of the method, multi-stream CNN integrates feature learning, feature fusion and fault classification into one body, which has two advantages. (1) One is that it can directly process raw multi-sourced monitoring data and learn fault-sensitive features even if the data have completely different formats, which free us from the burdensome signal/image processing and artificial feature extraction. (2) The other is that it can adaptively fuse multi-sourced monitoring data in the feature level, which is propitious to remove the redundant features and preserve complementary information. The proposed method is validated by experimental studies on a rotor test bed, and the results confirm that the proposed method is more effective than other methods.

This paper attempts to survey recent advancements of PHM methodologies associated with deep learning. After a brief introduction to several deep learning models, we reviewed and analyzed applications of fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis using deep learning, respectively. The survey reveals that most existing work utilized deep learning to conduct feature learning from unstructured raw data including vibration data, current signals, images and videos. Deep learning provides a general framework for PHM applications: fault detection uses either reconstruction error or stacks a binary classier on top of the network to detect anomalies; fault diagnosis typically adds a soft-max layer to perform multi-class classification; and prognosis adds a continuous regression layer to predict remaining useful life. We further pointed out some challenges and potential opportunities in the field.

Developed in the scope of the Industry 4.0 Lab of the Manufacturing Group of the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano, the Digital Twin is capable to run in parallel to the drilling machine operations and, as such, it enables to predict the evolution of the most critical failure mode, that is the imbalance in the drilling axis. The real-time monitoring of the drilling machine is realized with a low-cost and retrofit solution, which provides the installation of a Raspberry-Pi accelerometer, able to enhance the extant automation. Relying on a joint use of real-time monitoring and simulation, the Digital Twin implements a random coefficient statistical method through the so-called Exponential Degradation Model, eventually demonstrating to increase the prediction precision as monitoring data arrives. The Digital Twin Proof of Concept is described according to the entire process from data acquisition to Remaining Useful Life prediction, following the MIMOSA OSA-CBM standards.

The approach aims to build a decision support tool (DST) that helps operators in large-scale processes diagnose faults and make the correct decisions that will keep production schedules on track. The idea is to combine diversified supervised and semi-supervised machine-learning methods to exploit the strength of each of them in fault diagnosis. Despite their accuracy in classifying faults, supervised methods have two limitations: they do not provide meaningful explanations about their results and cannot diagnose novel faults. Semi-supervised methods can detect and isolate novel faults but cannot disclose their root causes. The proposed approach uses the best of both, providing operators with a descriptive decision that improves the diagnosability of detected faults, whether novel or not. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a benchmark industrial process. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

However, latent within the data, valuable signals are hidden that, if discovered, can offer abundant information, such as fault detection. Traditionally, principal component analysis has been used to perform fault detection in large, multivariate systems. However, these methods often struggle to find the true origin, as they are susceptible to contribution smearing. In this work, a chemical plant system was analyzed and a novel cluster and detect method for fault detection utilizing machine-learning clustering algorithms was created in aim to improve fault detection time and diagnosis. Plant data containing complex variables were simulated, clustered into groups through a unique algorithm based upon correlations, and analyzed through principal component analysis as individual groups. This approach often resulted in quicker identification and more accurate diagnosis than the traditional principal component analysis method.

Unlike most studies in the literature that focus on chemical analyses, using prior knowledge on the deterioration phenomenon and predefined contaminating parameters, this works aims at defining a general method for water quality contamination detection. Thereafter, it will allow decision makers in charge of water resource management to predict its quality deterioration and anticipate any consequence on human health. To this end, Prognostics and Health Management, which is usually applied on industrial systems, has been transposed to water to continuously monitor it, detect and predict anomalous cases. Due to a high rate of missing values, a model selection method for multiple imputation has been implemented in order to reduce the induced uncertainty of the observations, while a dimensionality reduction method has been performed to mitigate the noise induced by the large amount of parameters of interest (more than fifty). To process the detection, unsupervised and supervised learning methods have been combined, which allowed to determine four classes of water quality and to provide relevant insights on the anomalous cases. Finally, the homogeneity of the resulting classes has been evaluated using a Support Vector Machine classifier. The proposed method does not depend on a specific context and therefore, can be generalized to provide accurate rules for water quality classification of any source of data.

To solve fault classification problems and enhance classification accuracy, we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm consisting of three parts: anti-noise processing (ANP), an improved separation interval method (ISIM), and a genetic algorithm-particle swarm optimization (GA-PSO) method. ANP cleans out the outliers and noise in the dataset. ISIM uses a support vector machine (SVM) architecture to optimize SVM kernel parameters. Finally, we propose the GA-PSO algorithm, which combines the advantages of both genetic and particle swarm optimization algorithms to optimize the penalty parameter. The experimental results show that our proposed hybrid optimization algorithm enhances the classification accuracy of smart substation network faults and shows stronger performance compared with existing methods.

J	Jiang, Y; Zhu, H; Ding, C; Pfeiffer, O				Jiang, Yu; Zhu, Hua; Ding, Cong; Pfeiffer, Olivia			A novel ensemble fuzzy model for degradation prognostics of rolling element bearings	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy; ensemble learning; prognostics; machine learning	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ENTROPY	As the rolling element bearing continues to soar in industry, the requirement for accurate bearing degradation prognostics becomes more and more crucial. A single Fuzzy predictor may suffer from its model parameters optimization. To this end, this paper proposed a new ensemble Fuzzy predictor model for estimating the degradation of a bearing using tribological responses among the rollers and the bearing races. This new method employs the genetic algorithm (GA) to assign an optimal weight vector to a set of adaptive network-based Fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models. The ensemble of the predicted values of the ANFIS models is used as the prediction of the bearing degradation. Experimental data acquired from the degradation test of five rolling element bearings was used to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed method. The analysis result demonstrates that the ensemble ANFIS model enables to improve the prediction accuracy against a single ANFIS one. The contribution of this paper is that the ensemble of the ANFIS models is not addressed in existing research and should be optimized.

Although established practices can significantly reduce the frequency of alarms, operators often cannot resolve the failure cascades commonly occurring during emergency situations. Automating control rooms by incorporating design and operation knowledge about the systems can significantly improve operator efficacy. Intelligent support systems should reduce the amount of information and provide more context to the operators. The operators focus should be shifted from information acquisition to taking informed decisions about mitigation steps. This contribution gives a brief review of the development of Multilevel Flow Modeling (MFM) and its application to provide operators with decision support and situation awareness, focusing on implementations directly utilising the knowledge represented in MFM. Finally, current efforts toward a comprehensive intelligent human machine interface for operators are outlined. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Providing actionable information regarding both corrective and preventive maintenance activities at the right time may lead to reduce human failure and improve overall efficiency within maintenance processes. Selecting appropriate digital assistance systems (DAS), however, highly depends on hardware and IT infrastructure, software and interfaces as well as information provision methods such as visualization. The selection procedures can be challenging due to the wide range of services and products available on the market. In particular, underlying machine learning algorithms deployed by each product could provide certain level of intelligence and ultimately could transform diagnostic maintenance capabilities into predictive and prescriptive maintenance. This paper proposes a process-based model to facilitate the selection of suitable DAS for supporting maintenance operations in manufacturing industries. This solution is employed for a structured requirement elicitation from various application domains and ultimately mapping the requirements to existing digital assistance solutions. Using the proposed approach, a (combination of) digital assistance system is selected and linked to maintenance activities. For this purpose, we gain benefit from an in-house process modeling tool utilized for identifying and relating sequence of maintenance activities. Finally, we collect feedback through employing the selected digital assistance system to improve the quality of recommendations and to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each system in association to practical use-cases from TU Wien Pilot-Factory Industry 4.0.

Difficulty in accurate prognostic applications can be tackled by processing raw sensor readings into more meaningful and comprehensive health condition indicators that will then provide performance information for remaining useful life estimations. To that end, typically, multiple tasks on data pre-processing and predictions have to be carried out such that tasks can be assessed using different methodological aspects. However, incompatible methods may result in poor performance and consequently lead to undesirable error rates. The present research evaluates data training and prediction stages. A data-driven prognostic method based on a feed-forward neural network framework is first defined to calculate the performance of a complex system. Then, the health indicators are used in a similarity based remaining useful life estimation method.

Total Preventive Maintenance or TPM is a type of maintenance plan used in production and various industrial fields. Overall, this is a theory about how the tools, parts and machinery used for production services are maintained so that life is as increased without incident and as safe. This concept is used to reduce maintenance costs, dead times with the aim of improving and rationalizing production and customer service. The most effective tools for preventive maintenance applications, Infrared Cameras provide the amazing ability to see what other diagnostic tools cannot. Using these cameras to discover hidden issues before they turn into serious situations, help keep your equipment in peak performance, avoiding expensive equipment damage and improving safety. Infrared thermal imaging has been used as a non-destructive and non-direct technique to examine progressive deterioration processes and failure mechanisms of different medical equipment. After the study, we can conclude that thermal imaging has major advantages over other diagnostic techniques because measuring equipment does not emit harmful radiation, thermal scanning does not require direct contact with the object to be analyzed, malfunctions are detected quickly and this procedure can be repeated whenever or needed, allowing real-time analysis.

In this paper, the dissolved gas in transformer oil is analyzed by using the improved SVM (support vector machine) algorithm based on apriori (frequent item set), and a transformer familial defect detection method is proposed.Apriori method was used to analyze the correlation of dissolved gas in oil, and the variation of dissolved gas content was normalized to obtain the confidence degree and correlation degree of various gases under different transformer fault types, so as to judge the weight of transformer faults.Then, according to the gas type and content, the classifier is established by using SVM method. Considering the influence weight obtained by apriori method, the accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis can be 83.78%similar to 91.58%. Finally, the classifier is used to diagnose the transformer familial defects.

In this paper, support vector machine is used to effectively recognize various kinds of conventional gait types of exoskeleton robots. The inertial information mapping models among different parts of the lower limbs of the robots under different gaits are established respectively. Aiming at the problem of the failure of the inertial measurement unit at the end of the limb in the impact or high overload motion, a robust autonomous location method based on system reconstruction is studied. The experiment results show that, using different neural network model parameters under different gaits can be used to reduce the complexity of the network model. While the inertial measurement unit at the end of the limb fails, the location performance of the exoskeleton robot navigation system based on this method, is equal to that of the inertial navigation system at the end of the limb with same sensor precision.

This paper presents the fault type identification method based on machine learning in active distribution networks. The process of machine learning is divided into four steps: data preparation, data preprocessing, feature extraction and model training. When preparing data, a method of generating fault scenarios in the batch of simulation experiments is presented. The IEEE34 Bus System is built in PSCAD to complete the data preparation for machine learning. Variation multiples of voltage and current are extracted as the features to describe the fault type. Various machine learning models are trained by cross-validation method to get the accuracy of identification. The application of decision tree in fault type identification is presented in the form of a tree diagram. The result of fault type identification is shown by the confusion matrix of the decision tree. All the test results show that the proposed fault identifiers can identify all kinds of fault types in the distribution network.

Based on this problem, a fault feature extraction method for rolling bearings based on VMD and fast kurtogram is proposed in this paper. The energy difference is used as the selection criterion of VMD decomposition level K. Firstly, the original signal is decomposed by VMD and select the IMF containing fault information by kurtosis criterion. Reconstruct the signal by the selected IMF. Then process the reconstructed signal with the fast kurtogram to get the reconstructed signal's center frequency and bandwidth.

Therefore, it is very important to identify the fault of the transformer accurately and transformer fault diagnosis technology becomes one topic with great research value. Methods: In this paper, after analyzing the shortcomings of traditional methods, we have proposed a transformer fault diagnosis method based on Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM) and dissolved gas-in-oil analysis. This method has better precision than some commonly used methods at present. Furthermore, OS-ELM is more efficient than ELM. In addition, we analyze the effect of different parameter selection on the performance of the model by contrast experiments. Result: The experimental result shows that OS-ELM has certain promotion in precision than some traditional methods and can obviously improve the speed of training than ELM. Besides, it is known that the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the size of dataset have a great effect on the model. Conclusion: The transformer fault diagnosis method based on OS-ELM can effectively identify the faults and more efficient than ELM.

Due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient features of communication system, the conventional multi-classification algorithm Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine (DAG-SVM) has low diagnostic efficiency and poor coupling diagnosis performance. On the other hand, it has been proved that extending the feature space can effectively improve the classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposed a modified multi-classification algorithm called Feature Extended Directed Acyclic Graph Least Square Twin Support Vector Machine (FEDAG-LSTSVM). The new algorithm combined all the initial features and their random combinations to establish coupling and redundancy for every feature, and then constructed the Separable Metric (SM) as classification measurement to arrange the structure sequencing of DAG-LSTSVM. To verify the utility of the algorithm, the standard monitoring signal indicators in satellite communication system were taken as experimental data. Preliminary simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the fault diagnosis accuracy to 89.69% but with 54.20% less computational time in 10-fold cross-validation compared with DAG-SVM, which means it can be well applied to diagnose fault for satellites communication system.

It can explain much important missing information and which can be monitored using advanced AI (Artificial Intelligent) applications/tools. In this paper, we have proposed LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) based RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) which can model a time series profile for LTE network based on cell KPI values. We have shown in this paper that the dynamic behavior of a single cell can be simplified using a combination of a set for neighbor cells. We can predict the profile and anomalous behavior using this method. According to the best of our knowledge this approach is applied here for the first time for cell level performance profile generation and anomaly detection. In a related work, they have proposed ensemble method to compare different KPIs and cell performance using machine learning algorithm. We have applied DNN (Deep Neural Network) to generate a profile on KPI features from historical data. It gave us deeper insight into how the cell is performing over time and can connect with the root causes or hidden fault of a major failure in the cellular network.	[Al Mamun, S. M.

A reliable and accurate classification is essential for successful lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. Gene expression microarray, which is a high-throughput platform, makes it possible to discover genomic biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This study proposes a new approach of using improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IMPSO) technique to improve the Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) neural network prediction accuracy. The MLP weights and biases are computed by the IMPSO for more accurate lung cancer prediction. The proposed discriminant method (MLP-IMPSO) integrates the prior knowledge of lung cancer classification on the basis of gene expression data to enhance the classification accuracy. Evaluations and comparisons of prediction performance were thoroughly carried out between the proposed model and the representative machine learning methods (support vector machine, MLP, radial basis function neural network, C4.5, and Naive Bayes) on real microarray lung cancer datasets. The cross-data set validations made the assessment reliable. The performance of the proposed approach was better upon the incorporation of prior knowledge. We succeeded in demonstrating that our method improves lung cancer diagnosis accuracy with prior biological knowledge.

Generally the mechanical data which was observed from machines are having unique features. Based on the prior knowledge and previously obtained features, the inputs are given to artificial intelligent techniques for fault classification. In this paper, neuro fuzzy and neural network based fault classification techniques are proposed. This paper mainly comprises two main parts such as feature mining and fault categorization. To extract valid information or set of features from the vibration signal, various recent techniques included in the feature mining and lessening modules. Samples are collected from Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center and, more samples are obtained from matlab. Statistical features of a signal are evaluated using matlab. The samples obtained are given to neural network for training, testing and validation. The statistical features are given as input to Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for fault classification. An experimental result shows that training, testing and validation using neural network and fault classification using Adaptive Neuro fuzzy Inference System producing better results.

The biggest struggle is to find the way how to adopt all the possibilities for each plants unique use cases. In those situations where it is hard to find unified solutions internet is playing major part. Inseparable part of Industry 4.0 is Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, where it is possible to connect all devices into united system. While robust Distributed Control Systems (DCS) are preferred for their safety, Industrial IoT (IIoT) allows next level prospects: big data performance analyzation, control patterns identification and predictive preventative maintenance by using machine learning algorithms. The study shows how implementing open-source software enables engineers to develop predictive maintenance applications with basic programming knowledge. These type of applications can be widely used in industrial field to inform about possible equipment malfunction helping reduce possible damages.

In this model, there is no need to perform any preprocessing on the original data. As long as the neural network model training is completed, the original signal can be detected and identified automatically by the model. In order to verify the performance of the model, the test results of the same fault data set are compared with the fault recognition model based on traditional machine learning. The results show that the fault recognition model based on LSTM neural network has obvious superior performance and higher recognition reliability. Its recognition accuracy rate reaches 98.00%, and the recognition accuracy of the fault recognition model based on traditional machine learning is only 94.20%.

The proposed control strategy is based on the usage of a modified cascade control structure. The proposed control solution is augmented with a fault detection system capable to detect the faults which frequently occur in the operation of the D.C. motors used to drive the servicing machines. It is proved through simulation that, in a certain range of faults magnitude, their effect is rejected by the controllers, aspect which makes the proposed control system a fault tolerant one. Also, due to the usage of neural reference model, the faults magnitude can be quantified and when the safety limits are reached, some decisions for reducing the servicing machines operation are automatically generated.

In recent years seasonal diseases caused by vectors that transport viral pathogens in tropical regions, such as the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, have caused noticeable impacts both on public health and country's economies in Latin America. This work proposes a model for early prognosis based on FCMs for making a risk assessment of potential presence of seasonal virus-related diseases in a specific region of the Ecuadorian coast. The FCM is used as a knowledge representation strategy for the cause-effect relationships; and, learning models for gaining the identification of the underlying cause of symptoms. The model aims to improve the chances of proper prognosis of seasonal diseases, which could impact not only the prescription and correct decisions, but also the actions taken for preventing the spread of seasonal diseases.

Over the years, millions of such inspection sheets have been recorded and the data within these sheets has remained inaccessible. However, with industries going digital and waking up to the potential value of fault data for machine health monitoring, there is an increased impetus towards digitization of these handmarked inspection records. To target this digitization, we propose a novel visual pipeline combining state of the art deep learning models, with domain knowledge and low level vision techniques, followed by inference of visual relationships. Our framework is robust to the presence of both static and non-static background in the document, variability in the machine template diagrams, unstructured shape of graphical objects to be identified and variability in the strokes of handwritten text. The proposed pipeline incorporates a capsule and spatial transformer network based classifier for accurate text reading, and a customized CTPN [15] network for text detection in addition to hybrid techniques for arrow detection and dialogue cloud removal. We have tested our approach on a real world dataset of 50 inspection sheets for large containers and boilers. The results are visually appealing and the pipeline achieved an accuracy of 87.1% for text detection and 94.6% for text reading.

The existing monitoring devices are generally based on gas chromatography, which need to be replaced carrier gas and calibrated periodically, therefore, the maintenance work is heavy. In recent years, photoacoustic spectrum technology with the advantages of high accuracy and no carrier gas required is gradually stressed, but its measurement accuracy is susceptible to mechanical vibration and noise, and its main components such as modulation disk is prone to failure. For this reason, this paper proposes an on-line monitoring device for dissolved gas in transformer oil based on spectrum technology, which doesn't need carrier gas and maintenance during operation. The device is simpler and lighter in structure and better in performance. The device can on-line monitor 7 kinds of dissolved gas in transformer oil, and has functions such as transformer fault diagnosis, remote alarm, local man-machine interaction, local storage, and supports multiple communication modes such as IEC61850 protocol. The field application shows that the device can provide the basis for transformer fault diagnosis.

To achieve more accurate prognostic evaluation of historic masonry structures, this paper presents a novel local linearization-based Gaussian process regression (LL-GPR) model. Local linearization is used to characterize the state of health (SOH) values of adjacent data points. Gaussian process regression is employed to predict the approximate linear relations. The proposed model is validated through a case study. The results demonstrate that the prediction results of LL-GPR can well reflect the degradation trend of SOH. Moreover, compared with the published methods, more accurate SOH prediction results can be obtained under this model	[Sun, Keyang; Xu, Qiang; Yao, Qingzhen; Li, Na] Liaocheng Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong, Peoples R China		Sun, KY (corresponding author), Liaocheng Univ, Sch Architecture & Civil Engn, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong, Peoples R China.	sunkeyangde@163.com; xuqiang@lcu.edu.cn					Anzani A, 2010, J CULT HERIT, V11, P459, DOI 10.1016/j.culher.2009.11.008; Atamturktur S., 2013, STRUCT MAG, P26; Atamturktur S, 2015, J PERFORM CONSTR FAC, V29, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000517; Atamturktur S, 2011, ENG STRUCT, V33, P2472, DOI 10.1016/j.engstruct.2011.04.020; Feng DM, 2017, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V88, P199, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.11.021; Jaoude A.

Typically, condition monitoring systems that include threshold and frequency analysis are expensive and sometimes exceed the costs of the monitored device. With respect to safety issues, supervision of the health state of machinery - such as large industrial radial fans - is eminent. The proposed sensor platform is a cheaper alternative to commercial solutions and provides maximum flexibility concerning sampling rate, mobility, adaptability, and expandability. The prototype is used to collect relevant process data of a real industrial radial fan. In future, raw data shall be used to develop models for predictive maintenance.

Through predicitve maintenance the necessary inspection tasks that require machine downtimes are minimized. For industrial fans that evacuate very hot mediums or air with a high content of abrasive dust or particulates there is currently no possibility to reliably sense the wear and tear of the fan blades during operation. This work investigates the use of a radar sensor for estimating the wear of such fans by sensing vibrations and rotational imbalances. For this task a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensor is evaluated and suitable signal processing algorithms are developed to extract the desired information. Furthermore, the optimal sensing position, modulation waveform and fan optimizations are considered. This paper focuses on the basic signal processing techniques necessary as well as the measurement setup, simulations and first measurement evaluations.

Therefore, to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the engine accurately has a great practical significance. Since the turbine engine is a complex system and its life degradation process is affected by many factors, it's hard to use a certain model to represent the engine degradation. Fortunately, the turbine engine often sets a variety of sensors to obtain operational data, which provides an effective way to monitor the trend of degradation. In this paper, a prognostic approach based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is proposed to estimate the turbine engine RUL using sensor data. Firstly, the health indicator (HI), which is a synthesis indicator from multivariate sensor data, is calculated using descending dimension method, then the degradation models are built through regressing the HIs based on LS-SVM. Finally, the RUL of the testing engines can be calculated by the degradation models. As an application case, the turbofan engine degradation simulation data set supplied by NASA Ames is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Bearings are the most sensitive part of IM, and fault occurring must be considered. In industry, scratch seems the most frequently occurring fault in bearing, and only few researches have encountered this issue. This paper is motivated by considering hole and scratch as faulty factor. A fast Fourier transform analysis is carried out, the features are extracted and used for training the diagnostic algorithm. Two types of diagnosis methods are proposed; machine learning algorithm and artificial intelligence method (AI). Among the various machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is selected because of its superiority over the data preprocessing. Deep Learning Algorithm (DL) is selected in case of AI because of its intrinsic property over feature learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is originally used for fault characterization. The advantage of both the diagnosis methods and the possibility in detecting the minor bearing faults are discussed. Finally, effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated based on the experimental and diagnosis results.

This method aims to answer two questions: how to detect a fault when only the normal functioning is known? How to differentiate two different faults from one fault with two severities? The proposed method relies on the use of a recursive Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which is updated each time a new fault is detected. The detection is based on a weighted distance criteria that takes into account the contribution of the different components. A geometrical criteria is also proposed to differentiate new faults from existing ones. The method has been successfully tested on a simulation database of motor currents with different levels of unbalance and eccentricity. It is then tested on real data from a 5.5 kW synchronous machine with three different levels of unbalance.

The fault degradation process is in general slowly varying autocorrelated and shows typical nonstationary nature. However, most of existing prognostic methods don't consider the nonstationary characteristics of the fault degradation process. Besides, stationary fault information may bury the fault degradation trend. In this work, a fault degradation modeling and online fault prognosticating strategy is proposed based on degradation-oriented slow feature analysis and temporal smoothness analysis. First, a fault degradation-oriented slow feature analysis (FDSFA) algorithm is proposed to extract critical fault degradation features. Second, a stability weighting factor (SW) is defined to evaluate the stability of each feature and a key fault degradation factor (KFDF) is calculated by combining critical features and SW. Considering the nonstationary characteristics of KFDF, a time-varying regression model with temporal smoothness regularization is developed for online fault prognostics. Case study on a real industrial process illustrates the validity of the proposed method.

However, such prior knowledge is not always readily available in practice. We alleviate this shortcoming by proposing a novel data-driven framework that is capable of providing accurate RUL prediction without the need for any prior failure threshold knowledge. Correlative and monotonic metrics are utilized to identify critical features throughout the degradation progress. Subsequently, we append one-hot health state indicators to extracted degrading features, which are utilized together as adversarial training data for a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network-based model. Finally, we utilize a fully-connected layer to project the LSTM outputs into the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in conjunction with a categorical distribution, from which the long-term degradation progress is sampled. We verify the performance of the proposed framework using aeroengine health data simulated by Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (MAPSS), and the results demonstrate that significant performance improvement can be achieved for long-term degradation progress and RUL prediction tasks.

This paper mainly focuses on the fault detection and section identification during power swing using a new formula and MRA (Multi Resolution Analysis) based wavelet technique for the normal fault detection. Here we have proposed MRA based wavelet technique for discriminating between power swing and fault. It also classify the different types of fault (symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault) with their inception at different location of power system. The method is tested in 3 machine 9 bus WSCC (Western System Coordinating Council) system at different location and different distance of the transmission line during power swing in EMTDC/PSCAD platform. The scheme is found to be fast and accurate for protection of power system using distance relay.

A Transfer-Learning Approach to Feature Extraction from Cancer Transcriptomes with Deep Autoencoders	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, IWANN 2019, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN)	JUN 12-14, 2019	SPAIN	NTU Singapore		Next-generation sequencing; Deep learning; Autocoders; Machine learning; Transfer-learning; Predictive modelling	RNA-SEQ; PREDICTION	The diagnosis and prognosis of cancer are among the more challenging tasks that oncology medicine deals with. With the main aim of fitting the more appropriate treatments, current personalized medicine focuses on using data from heterogeneous sources to estimate the evolution of a given disease for the particular case of a certain patient. In recent years, next-generation sequencing data have boosted cancer prediction by supplying gene-expression information that has allowed diverse machine learning algorithms to supply valuable solutions to the problem of cancer subtype classification, which has surely contributed to better estimation of patient's response to diverse treatments. However, the efficacy of these models is seriously affected by the existing imbalance between the high dimensionality of the gene expression feature sets and the number of samples available for a particular cancer type. To counteract what is known as the curse of dimensionality, feature selection and extraction methods have been traditionally applied to reduce the number of input variables present in gene expression datasets. Although these techniques work by scaling down the input feature space, the prediction performance of traditional machine learning pipelines using these feature reduction strategies remains moderate. In this work, we propose the use of the Pan-Cancer dataset to pre-train deep autoencoder architectures on a subset composed of thousands of gene expression samples of very diverse tumor types. The resulting architectures are subsequently fine-tuned on a collection of specific breast cancer samples. This transfer-learning approach aims at combining supervised and unsupervised deep learning models with traditional machine learning classification algorithms to tackle the problem of breast tumor intrinsic-subtype classification. Our main goal is to investigate whether leveraging the information extracted from a large collection of gene expression data of diverse tumor types contributes to the extraction of useful latent features that ease solving a complex prediction task on a specific neoplasia.

This paper introduces predictive analytics for industrial ovens and their application in a real-world's oven used by a leading medical devices manufacturer. Two distinct approaches are presented in this work. A technique based on existing sensors for oven failure prediction based on monitoring and log data; and a technique based on deployed sensors for fault diagnosis based on acoustic data. Deep learning techniques have been applied on existing sensor and event log data, especially temperature monitoring, whereas an outlier detection analysis were implemented on acoustic sensor measurements. Both analytics methods create a complete solution able to detect early oven failures from their root.

With the growing use of sensors and embedded computing systems, the term predictive maintenance is most often understood as a strategy that relies on collecting streaming sensor data and performing condition monitoring. Thus, the majority of academic papers base their research work solely on sensorial sources coming from the shop floor machinery, neglecting the knowledge already existing in legacy systems and maintenance historical logs. The UPTIME project aims to develop a unified predictive maintenance framework that incorporates information from heterogeneous data sources, both from sensor devices and legacy/operational systems. In this contribution, we share our first insights on legacy data analytics in the predictive maintenance context, and outline the tools and approaches we developed in the course of the project. Experimental work has been conducted using real world datasets deriving from an actual manufacturing facility in the White Goods/Home Appliances sector. The results provide significant knowledge about the manufacturing processes and show the potential of the proposed methodology.

However, monitoring of a single machine does not cover complex faults that occur due to the interactions of different machines in the production chain. To identify these problems, possible causes and the actual defect location within the value chain, is a complex process. Assistance systems solve this by applying artificial intelligence to learn the system behaviour and provide detailed diagnostics and fault predictions covering the complete factory/plant. We aim for an Industry 4.0 compliant system. To achieve that, we use OPC UA to cover the communication between all parts of the assistance system and each assistance system carries an asset administration shell to share information within the network. In this paper, contrary to our previous work, we focus on the communication aspects required to integrate the assistance systems into the corresponding Industry 4.0 environment [1]. Besides that, we discuss options and challenges to extend our approach towards a system with multiple assistance systems in parallel to cover whole factories.

Modern companies can provide new services following products inside the shop floors along the entire production chain. To achieve the goal of servitization that the Industry 4.0 world requires, a modernization of current production chains is needed. This common demand comes mostly from manufacturing sector, where complex work machines collaborate with human workers. The data produced by the machines must be processed quickly, to allow the implementation of reactive services such as predictive maintenance, and remote control, always taking care of the safety of nearby people. This paper proposes a multi-layer architecture to monitor legacy production machines during their operations inside customers plants. The platform provides near real-time delivery of data collected from the machines with a high grade of customization according to customer needs. The performed tests show the scalability of the platform for a productive ecosystem with many machines at work, confirming its feasibility within different production facilities with different needs.

The support vector machine (SVM) is a robust and useful tool capable of resolving the problems of data classification with high accuracy. One of the most reliable kernels that are widely used with SVM to map features into high-dimensional feature space and perform classification is a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF kernel). However, the classification performance of SVM with RBF kernel strongly depends on two hyperparameter values of the trained model. This paper proposes the use of genetic algorithm (GA) as an optimization technique to select proper hyperparameter values for the SVM classifier. GA is known as an intelligent optimization approach based on heuristics that allows finding a relatively good solution to the optimization problem, especially when the exhaustive search of optimal values can be computationally expensive or may not deliver a proper result. In the experimental part of this manuscript, the classification accuracies of the trained one-against-all multiclass SVM (OAA-MCSVM) classifier with hyperparameter values adjusted by the conventional exhaustive grid search optimization algorithm and the proposed one were evaluated and compared using five datasets containing mechanical rub-impact faults of various intensity levels.

Any leakage occurring on those can result in a waste of resource and finance; consequently, detecting early faults for them become necessary. Nowadays, there are many approaches to deal with this problem; however, their results still have limitations. This paper proposes a pattern recognition method that first extracts time-domain and frequency-domain features from vibration signals to represent each fault distinctly, and these features are then utilized with a classifier, i.e. support vector machine (SVM), to classify fault types. To verify the proposed model, the experiments are carried out on different samples of fault in various operating conditions such as pressure, flow rate and temperature. Experimental results show that the proposed technique achieves a high classification accuracy for different leakage sizes, which can be applied in real-world pipeline applications.

Diagnosis and prognosis of their working condition is crucial for minimization of downtime and maintenance costs. Different approaches may be adopted to either solve or mitigate the problem of identifying incipient faults during machinery operations. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient yet effective method to solve this problem by exploiting the edge-computing capabilities of PLCs. Accelerometer signals are modeled as AutoRegressive (AR) processes whose coefficient are used as features for machine learning, based on logistic regression algorithm (LR), to perform Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI). Estimation and prediction are both implementable on-board the PLC, while machine learning can be carried out remotely, in a cloud computing perspective. The exploitation of AR modelling gives a simple and inherent methodology for feature selection. We apply the procedure to the Case Western Reserve University database, a widely known and used benchmark, to highlight its performance with respect to similar fault recognition techniques.

Such calculations rest on endogenous and exogenous economic variables: the former include operating and maintenance costs and bus depreciation; the latter include market imponderables such as the inflation and real discount rates, as well as energy costs, particularly fuel. The authors have created models for the withdrawal/replacement of buses using endogenous economic variables. The models include standard econometric models reflecting the influence of maintenance policies, especially Condition Monitoring (CM) or predictive maintenance, and the size of the reserve fleet. The paper deals with exogenous economic variables, specifically the influence of the cost of money, the inflation and real discount rates rate and the cost of fuel. Both variables fluctuate over time. The paper proposes analytical models for determining the influence of those variables on the withdrawal time and the size of the reserve fleet. It then comprehensively summarizes the variables in a global model, showing its relevance to the dimensioning of the reserve fleet and the withdrawal time.

J	Heda, Z				Heda, Zhang			Fault diagnosis and life prediction of mechanical equipment based on artificial intelligence	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; machinery and equipment; fault diagnosis	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; DESIGN; SPEED	Machinery and equipment are widely used in modern large-scale production, while industrial large-scale production and the progress of science and technology make machinery and equipment more complex and large-scale. Traditional mechanical diagnosis technology cannot meet the actual diagnosis requirements. The residual life of the whole equipment is predicted. This is of great significance for improving the efficiency of equipment, enhancing reliability, reducing maintenance costs and prolonging service life. The advantages of artificial intelligence in solving the problems of remote control, fault diagnosis and non-linearity point out the direction of the development of mechanical fault diagnosis technology. The research shows that the fault prediction and maintenance process based on the operating state of the device is summarized into three steps: data acquisition, data processing and equipment remaining life prediction. The comprehensive detection algorithm is used for diagnosis, and the diagnosis method is comprehensively analyzed.

J	Liu, XY; Yun, ZH; Yang, H; Zhang, Q				Liu, Xiaoyong; Yun, Zhonghua; Yang, Hang; Zhang, Qiang			Fault detection based on LP-SVR interval regression model with L-1-Norm minimization	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fault detection; LP-SVR; L-1-Norm minimization; linear programming; interval regression model	TOLERANT CONTROL; DIAGNOSIS	In this paper, a novel method for fault detection based on an adaptive interval regression model characterized by the upper regression model (URM) and lower regression model (LRM) has been proposed. Applying the proposed method, a confidence band for the measured data, derived in the normal operating conditions of a system, is constructed.The method combines the superiorities of model sparse representation and computational efficiency of linear programming support vector regression (LP-SVR) with some ideas from L-1-norm on approximation errors. First, the upper and lower L-1-norms with respect to upper bound approximation error are considered, and the both norms subject to respective constraints are integrated into LP-SVR to form new upper and lower optimization problems, respectively. Following that, optimization problem corresponding to URM and LRM are solved by linear programming and interval regression model is thus constructed to judge whether the fault occurs or not. The proposed method returns an interval output as opposed to a point output. Finally, the efficacy of this method is demonstrated by applying it on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman problem, and has been compared with conventional techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA), dynamic-PCA (DPCA) and One-Class Support Vector Machine(1-class SVM). It is shown that the proposed method is superior to those approaches in terms of performance measure of detection latency.

J	Jiang, KS; Zhou, YY; Chen, QH; Han, LB				Jiang, Kuosheng; Zhou, Yuanyuan; Chen, Qinghua; Han, Liubang			In Processing Fault Detection of Machinery Based on Instantaneous Phase Signal	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; signal processing; measurement	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS; ANGULAR SPEED; MODE DECOMPOSITION; TRANSMISSION ERROR; DIAGNOSIS; VISUALIZATION; SEPARATION; VIBRATION; SYSTEM; ENGINE	The instantaneous phase signal contains abundant information about the health state of machineries, which plays an important role in fault detection of machineries, rotor dynamic balance, transmission error of Rotate Vector reducer, etc. Traditional methods use signal processing methods based on encoders, EMD and Hilbert transforms or fractional delay filters to extract instantaneous phase information indirectly. These traditional methods are state-of-art, however those algorithms are slightly complicated and time-consuming, which is not conducive to online prognostics and health management to some extent. In fact, high precision and high reliability sensor technology can effectively reduce the complexity of subsequent signal processing. In this paper, an instantaneous phase direct detection technique based on eccentric demodulation principle is proposed. The method is derived from the kinematics between the cam and the pushrod. The laser displacement sensor is used to replace the pushrod to realize non-contact measurement. The instantaneous phase is modulation by the cam, and the proposed method can realize the obtain of the theoretical phase infinite resolution, which reaches 16,000-line resolution. Compared with the traditional encoder and other inspection technologies, the proposed method is also suitable for the measurement of broadband shifting and reciprocating motion. By means of simple signal processing methods, this paper realizes the fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing with typical defectives, and realizes the extraction and identification of the fault signal of the reciprocating compressor.

We summarise the main issues as 5G networks evolve, and their implications for fault management. We describe the relevant machine learning techniques through to deep learning, and survey the progress which has been made in their application, based on the building blocks of a typical fault management system. We review recent work to develop the abilities of deep learning systems to explain and justify their recommendations to network operators. We discuss forthcoming changes in network architecture which are likely to impact fault management and offer a vision of how fault management systems can exploit deep learning in the future. We identify a series of research topics for further study in order to achieve this.

Otherwise, a failure could lead to catastrophic consequences and enormous economic losses. Because of the complex structure of the satellite and its complex space environment, the factors that affect the satellite systems status are numerous. Moreover, as a result of the healthy historical data of key components in satellite are too few, which makes the traditional methods based on analysis model are not suitable for RUL prediction of key components in satellite. In this paper, in order to solve the RUL prediction problem of Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in satellite with incomplete healthy historical data, we propose an efficient RUL prediction method for key components of satellite, which is called Residual Remaining Useful Life Prediction Method (RRULPM), based on the study of Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET). The RRULPM is make up of degradation model based on MSET state estimation and criteria of failure based on historical degradation value, which is developed by improving MSET and combining the residuals with life cycle damage (LCD) prediction creatively when lacking healthy historical data. Experimental results demonstrate that the RRULPM is excellent to achieve the RUL prediction problems of LIBs through the actual in orbit telemetry data. Unlike previous RUL prediction methods, RRULPM provides good feasibility and effectiveness. This research can serve as guidance for prognostics and health management (PHM) of key components in satellite.

To control the dimensional stability of the cotton knitted fabric in advance, an artificial intelligent system is required in the knitting industry which simulates all product and process variables and is able to give human-like decisions in advance. The most important controlling parameters of knitted fabric properties such as stitch length, yarn count and overfeed percentage in stenter were considered as input variables, and mass per unit area, lengthwise shrinkage and widthwise shrinkage as output variables. Overall, 35 experiments were conducted to construct the model, varying different parameters. The applicability of the model was validated by comparing the results from 15 newly conducted experiments. The coefficient of determination of predicted and actual data for mass per unit area, lengthwise shrinkage and widthwise shrinkage were 0.97, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively which validates the model relatively effectively for an industrial application. The proposed model can assist a fabric manufacturer by taking a decision in selecting knitting and finishing parameters prior to producing the fabric. Moreover, it can reduce the time and energy required, and waste produced in the process by skipping the sample development step before bulk production.

In recent years, deep learning models have been extensively implemented in machinery fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems. The deep architecture's automated feature learning process offers great potential to solve problems with traditional fault detection and diagnosis (TFDD) systems. TFDD relies on manual feature selection, which requires prior knowledge of the data and is time intensive. However, the high performance of deep learning comes with challenges and costs. This paper presents a review of deep learning challenges related to machinery fault detection and diagnosis systems. The potential for future work on deep learning implementation in FDD systems is briefly discussed.

J	Kang, GQ; Wu, LF; Guan, Y; Peng, Z				Kang, Guoqing; Wu, Lifeng; Guan, Yong; Peng, Zhen			A Virtual Sample Generation Method Based on Differential Evolution Algorithm for Overall Trend of Small Sample Data: Used for Lithium-ion Battery Capacity Degradation Data	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; overall trend virtual sample generation method based on differential evolution (OT-DEVSG); small data	MODEL; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION; DIFFUSION; DIAGNOSIS; STATE	Considering the wide application of lithium-ion battery in life, the prediction of the remaining life of lithium-ion battery has become a research hotspot. Studies show, due to the improvement of the technology level of lithium-ion battery, its life is getting longer and longer. Even under the condition of accelerated life test, it is difficult to obtain enough available data for research in a short term. In order to solve the problem of how to accurately predict the residual life with the data-driven method under the condition of small sample size, an overall trend virtual sample generation method based on differential evolution (OT-DEVSG) is proposed. This method uses a differential evolution algorithm with better optimization performance, and improves the original mega-trend-diffusion (MID) method, the range of virtual samples is effectively constrained and the trend of samples can be estimated more accurately. The method can effectively generate a virtual sample data sequence with time parameters, and adapt the virtual sample to the real-life sample trend, which solves the problem of insufficient degradation data of the lithium-ion batteries. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the OT-DEVSG method with three existing data sets. The experimental results show that the proposed OT-DEVSG method is effective for solving the problem of long-term life prediction of lithium-ion batteries.

In this literature, a practical algorithm named Data Simulation by Resampling (DSR) is proposed for data augmentation to alleviate the two problems in fault diagnosis. In essence, as a form of Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM), DSR utilizes a two-stage resampling operation to simulate vicinal examples in both time domain and frequency domain. By doing so, DSR can both increase the sample diversity and the quantity of training set, which regularizes machine learning and deep learning based methods to achieve a higher generalization performance.

This paper proposed a novel fault diagnosis method, termed as optimization forecast components-support vector machine (OFC-SVM). The method firstly improved the forecastable component analysis (ForeCA) for feature extraction. Secondly, in order to further enhance the method, the quadratic Grid Search (GS) algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters of the proposed method. Thirdly, to properly evaluate the method performance, a new evaluation index is proposed, named Pre Alarm Rate (PAR), aiming to achieve the quantitative trade-off between false alarm rate (FAR) and missed alarm rate(MAR). Then, the new ROC curve can be further derived by PAR. Finally, the performance of OFC-SVM is strictly compared with other five methods as well as validated by a Monte Carlo model and a full-scale WWTP.

However, the prerequisite that the training data and the test data should follow an identical distribution prevents the conventional data-driven diagnosis methods from being applied to the engineering diagnosis problems. To tackle this dilemma, cross-domain fault diagnosis using knowledge transfer strategy is becoming popular in the past five years. The diagnosis methods based on transfer learning aim to build models that can perform well on target tasks by leveraging knowledge from semantic related but distribution different source domains. This paper for the first time summarizes the state-of-art cross-domain fault diagnosis research works. The literatures are introduced from three different viewpoints: research motivations, cross-domain strategies, and application objects. In addition, the corresponding open-source fault datasets and several future directions are also presented. The survey provides readers a framework for better understanding and identifying the research status, challenges and future directions of cross-domain fault diagnosis.

Perceptual Vibration Hashing by Sub-Band Coding: An Edge Computing Method for Condition Monitoring	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Prognostics and health management (PHM); condition monitoring; edge computing; bearing fault diagnosis; degradation assessment; perceptual hashing; wavelet packet transform; discrete cosine transform; symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ELEMENT BEARING DIAGNOSTICS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SCHEME; PROGNOSTICS; ENTROPY; COSINE	High data throughput during real-time vibration monitoring can easily lead to network congestion, insufficient data storage space, heavy computing burden, and high communication costs. As a new computing paradigm, edge computing is deemed to be a good solution to these problems. In this paper, perceptual hashing is proposed as an edge computing form, aiming not only to reduce the data dimensionality but also to extract and represent the machine condition information. A sub-band coding method based on wavelet packet transform, two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, and symbolic aggregate approximation is developed for perceptual vibration hashing. When the sub-band coding method is implemented on a monitoring terminal, the acquired kilobyte-long vibration signal can be transformed into a machine condition hash occupying only a few bytes. Therefore, the efficiency of condition monitoring can benefit from the compactness of the machine condition hash, while comparable diagnostic and prognostic results can still be achieved. The effectiveness of the developed method is verified with two benchmark bearing datasets. Considerations on practical condition monitoring applications are also presented.

Therefore, in many cases, it is very costly to obtain a sufficient amount of experimental data. To develop an efficient method to predict the results of semiconductor experiments with a small amount of known data, we use a novel method based on Bayesian framework with the prior distribution constructed by technology computer-aided-design (TCAD) physical models. This method combines the advantages of statistical models and physical models in the aspect that TCAD can provide visionary guidance on an experiment when a limited amount of experimental data is available, and a machine learning model can account for subtle anomalous effects. Specifically, we use aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) phenomenon as an example and use variational inference with Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization to achieve the approximation to the posterior distribution. The relation between etching process input parameters and etching depth is learned using the Bayesian neural network with TCAD priors. Using this method with 35 neurons per hidden layer, mean square error (MSE) in the test set is reduced from 0.2896 to 0.0175, 0.058 to 0.0183, 0.0563 to 0.0188, 0.058 to 0.019 for partition =10, 20, 30, 40, respectively, reference to the baseline BNN where a regular normal distribution prior with zero mean and unity standard deviation N(0,1) is used.

To ensure the reliability and the safety of electric vehicles, it is necessary to estimate the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries. Aiming at the strong nonlinear characteristics prevalent in the battery degradation process, this paper proposes a new method for predicting the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries based on stochastic model. A new nonlinear degradation model is established based on the diffusion process to characterize the degradation process in the lithium-ion batteries. The battery lifetime and the remaining useful life at any inspection cycle are defined based on the concept of the first hitting time, and the probability density functions of battery lifetime and remaining useful life are derived. Finally, the unknown parameters of the model are estimated by using the maximum likelihood estimation method and the historical data of battery degradation. Remaining useful life prediction experiments are performed based on two published data sets. The experimental results verify with the reliability and accuracy of the proposed method.

J	Yuan, R; Lv, Y; Li, HWX; Song, GB				Yuan, Rui; Lv, Yong; Li, Hewenxuan; Song, Gangbing			Robust Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Using Multivariate Intrinsic Multiscale Entropy Analysis and Neural Network Under Varying Operating Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Robust fault diagnosis; varying operating conditions; adaptive projection intrinsically transformed multivariate empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (APIT-MEMD-AN); improved multivariate multiscale sample entropy (IMMSE); smoothed coarse graining; neural network	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; EMD	olling bearings are crucial components in mechanical, civil and aerospace engineering. The practical working conditions of rolling bearings are complex and tough, hence fault diagnosis of rolling bearings under varying operating conditions is very challenging. This paper proposes a robust fault diagnosis approach of rolling bearings using multivariate intrinsic multiscale entropy analysis and neural network under varying operating conditions. The proposed approach deals with multivariate signal collected from multi-sensor acquisition system to capture much dynamical characteristic information. Multivariate intrinsic multiscale entropy analysis consists of adaptive projection intrinsically transformed multivariate empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (APIT-MEMD-AN) and improved multivariate multiscale sample entropy (IMMSE) with smoothed coarse graining process. Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) obtained by APIT-MEMD-AN depict dynamical properties of multivariate signals. IMMSE of certain orders IMFs are adopted as input values of back propagation (BP) neural network to achieve fault classification of rolling bearings. APIT-MEMD-AN and IMMSE endow the proposed approach with the underlying adaptivity and robustness, making the proposed approach a fully data driven and robust method. Theoretical derivations, numerical simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. The research work demonstrates the proposed approach is promising in fault diagnosis of rotary machinery under varying operating conditions.

During a run-to-failure experiment, rich unsupervised features from vibration sensory data are extracted by a trained sparse auto-encoder. Then, the correlation of the initial samples (presumably healthy), along with the successive samples, are calculated and passed through a moving-average filter. The normalized output which is referred to as the auto-encoder correlation based (AEC) rate, determines an informative attribute of the system, depicting its health status. AEC automatically identifies the degradation starting point in the machine component. We show that AEC rate well-generalizes in several run-to-failure tests. We demonstrate the superiority of the AEC over many other state-of-the-art approaches for the health monitoring of machine bearings.

To settle this problem, the nonlocal means (NLM) approach is proposed for the denoising of multistage centrifugal pump in this paper. Utilizing the similarity theory, the NLM method has achieved a wide range of applications in the fields of image processing and biomedical signal denoising. Due to the periodic characteristics and redundancy, NLM is successfully applied to the de-noising of 1-D machinery vibration signal. The numerical simulation experiments with different SNRs verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method. Besides, the selection principles of core parameters in NLM are discussed. The real engineering cases analysis demonstrates that the NLM can effectively filter out the background noise and realize the weak fault feature enhancements. The proposed noise reduction method is superior to traditional wavelet coefficient method.

The analysis approaches one of the most important requirements of the industrial sector, which seeks to be recognised by the efficiency and performance of its equipment when compared to its coming economic competitors. For data collection and we have followed the ISO 10816 standards, thus using the values of speed in RMS, aiming to reduce the masking of these signals that occurs depending on whether they are high or low frequencies. The study will respond to one of the most important requirements found in the predictive and preventive control of industrial sites. The problem of the predictive systems of maintenance of equipment with bearings lies in the number of monitoring and analysis points that generate a high cost in time and human resources. The aim will be to determine which of all the study frequencies is the most significant and in which position and measurement axis has the biggest impact. To do this, we will analyse the rotation frequency of the blowing machine, the resulting frequency of all the frequencies, the frequency of the impulsion blades and finally the frequency of the bearing. The study would be able to predict when our equipment is going to suffer a failure, reducing the control points and the cost.

In this paper, Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) prediction is estimated by Particle Swarm optimized Support Vector Machines (PSO+SVM) considering two possible pre-processing techniques to improve input quality: Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Wavelet Transforms (WT). Here, EMD and WT coupled with SVM are used to predict RUL of bearing from the IEEE PHM Challenge 2012 big dataset. Specifically, two cases were analyzed: considering the complete vibration dataset and considering truncated vibration dataset. Finally, predictions provided from models applying both pre-processing techniques are compared against results obtained from PSO+SVM without any pre-processing approach. As conclusion, EMD+SVM presented more accurate predictions and outperformed the other models.

This applies in particular to the advanced processing of measurement data from diagnostic and monitoring systems. The increasing amount of data collected by the embedded measurement systems requires development of effective analytical tools to efficiently transform the data into knowledge and implement autonomous machine tools of the future. This issue is of particular importance to assess the condition of the tool and predict its durability, which are crucial for reliability and quality of the manufacturing process. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to enable effective, real-time classification of the cutting blade status. The model was verified based on real measurement data from an industrial machine tool.

A hybrid fault diagnosis approach is proposed using model-based residuals as input to a set of data-driven fault classifiers. As a case study, sensor data from an internal combustion engine test bed is used where faults have been injected into the system and a physical-based mathematical model of the air flow through the engine is available. First, a feature selection algorithm is applied to find a minimal set of residuals that is able to separate the different fault modes. Then, two different fault classification approaches are discussed, Random Forests and one-class Support Vector Machines. A set of one-class Support Vector Machines is used to model data from each fault mode separately.

Moreover, with proliferation of AI based solutions in areas such as hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and education, the resulting personal and professional implications of AI are far-reaching. The dominant role played by AI models in these domains has led to a growing concern regarding potential bias in these models, and a demand for model transparency and interpretability [6]. In addition, model explainability is a prerequisite for building trust and adoption of AI systems in high stakes domains requiring reliability and safety such as healthcare [1] and automated transportation, and critical industrial applications with significant economic implications such as predictive maintenance, exploration of natural resources, and climate change modeling. As a consequence, AI researchers and practitioners have focused their attention on explainable AI to help them better trust and understand models at scale [8, 9, 19]. The challenges for the research community include (i) defining model explainability, (ii) formulating explainability tasks for understanding model behavior and developing solutions for these tasks, and finally (iii) designing measures for evaluating the performance of models in explainability tasks. In this tutorial, we will present an overview of model interpretability and explainability in AI [4], key regulations/laws, and techniques/tools for providing explainability as part of AI/ML systems [7]. Then, we will focus on the application of explainability techniques in industry, wherein we present practical challenges/guidelines for using explainability techniques effectively and lessons learned from deploying explainable models for several web-scale machine learning and data mining applications. We will present case studies across different companies, spanning application domains such as search and recommendation systems, sales, lending, and fraud detection. Finally, based on our experiences in industry, we will identify open problems and research directions for the data mining/machine learning community.

Machine learning provides an opportunity to identify functional faults with high accuracy and thereby reduce repair cost. However, the large volume of manufacturing data comes in a streaming format and exhibits time-dependent concept drift in a production environment. These drawbacks limit the effectiveness of traditional machine-learning algorithms. We propose a diagnosis workflow that utilizes online learning to train classifiers incrementally with a small chunk of data at each step. These online learning algorithms adapt to concept drift quickly with carefully designed update rules. A hybrid algorithm is also proposed to handle the scenario that data for varying numbers of boards are collected at different times. Experimental results using two boards in high-volume production show that, with the help of online learning and the proposed hybrid algorithm, the F1-score for diagnosis can be improved from 57.3% to 78.9%	[Liu, Mengyun; Li, Xin; Chakrabarty, Krishnendu] Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Ye, Fangming; Gu, Xinli] Huawei R&D, Santa Clara, CA USA		Liu, MY (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27708 USA.

The proposed HDNN framework is the first hybrid model designed for RUL estimation that integrates two deep learning architectures simultaneously and in a parallel fashion. More specifically, in contrary to the majority of existing data -driven prognostic approaches for RUL estimation, which are developed based on a single deep model and can hardly maintain satisfactory generalization performance across various prognostic scenarios, the proposed HDNN framework consists of two parallel paths (one based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN)) followed by a fully connected multilayer fusion neural network, which acts as the fusion center combining the outputs of the two paths to form the target RUL. The proposed HDNN framework is tested on the NASA commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset. Our comprehensive experiments and comparisons with several recently proposed RUL estimation methodologies developed based on the same data -sets show that the proposed HDNN framework significantly outperforms all its counterparts in the complicated prognostic scenarios with increased number of operating conditions and fault modes.

Firstly, The PCA is used to extract low-dimensional fault features from high-dimensional fault data to eliminate the correlation between features. Then, the grid search algorithm (GSA) is used to optimize the loss parameters and kernel function parameters of the SVM model. Secondly, low-dimensional fault features are used as input training classifiers for SVM. Finally, fault diagnosis is carried out through feature classification.

Firstly, the vibration signal is preprocessed, followed by 3-layer wavelet packet decomposition, and the energy entropy percentage of the reconstruction coefficient is extracted as the feature vector. Then, the 8-dimensional fault feature vector is reduced to a 2-dimensional feature vector by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, the 2-dimensional feature vector is taken as the input sample of PSO-LSSVM. In order to diagnose the three fault states of the inner ring, the ball and the outer ring of the rolling bearing, four LSSVM classifiers are established. After the simulation analysis of the bearing vibration data, the diagnostic accuracy rate of the LSSVM multi-classifier group was 100%, which proves the feasibility and effectivity of the method.

One of the methods to avoid the failures is to use historic data. Using historic data enables us to predict faults and take necessary precautions to minimize the down-fall times of systems and therefore, optimize the overall performance. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) is one of the most conventional ways to assess the risk of system performance. LOLIMOT algorithm benefits from a neuro-fuzzy structure that enables it to provide more accurate RUL estimation results than traditional neural networks or SVMs. To further enhance the LOLIMOT algorithm performance, multiple degradation processes are considered in training the prediction module. In this paper, the enhanced LOLIMOT algorithm is used to perform the prognosis of gas turbine engines using only historic data. In the case study, the effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated. The results show that more accurate results can be achieved by using neuro-fuzzy structures in prognosis process.

Indeed, smart monitoring methods, that are implemented in this kind of manufacturing process, allow efficient tracking of a system degradation in real time through appropriate sensors. Then, the sensor data are analyzed and processed to extract effective health indicators for fault detection, diagnostic and prognostics. This paper aims to develop a practical methodology for constructing a new health indicator based on heterogeneous sensor measurements to efficiently monitor system states. The proposed methodology is applied to extract the health indicator of a robot cutting tool (i.e. end-flat mill). This indicator is then used to diagnose the different fault types of the tool by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system model.

For an assembled product, the prediction of wear life is difficult because there is no an appropriate method for direct measurement. The direct product of wear is believed to contain key information of the wear status of the contact surfaces and has been suggested as an indicator for mechanical failures. Currently, several online oil debris monitoring methods are proposed with high precision for accurate debris detection, but there is still a lack of a model to describe the relationship between the wear status and the debris. This paper presents a physics-based model to predict the generation of abrasive debris of contact pairs with a certain roughness, so as to predict the wear life of mechanical components. The probabilistic model is given in a numerical way, based on the boundary element method and atomic attrition mechanism. The proposed method is able to provide predictive features of wear debris including the amount, the distribution of sizes and morphological information. Combining the online oil debris detection approaches, the method is applied to the prediction of an aviation hydraulic pump. The experimental result indicates that the method is effective in predicting the remaining useful life of mechanical components.

In this paper, a multilayer gated recurrent unit (MGRU) method is proposed, which uses a three-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) to deal with the fault diagnosis of the spur gear. Due to the complexity of the spur gearbox fault, vibration measurement is carried out separately at first. Then the vibration signals are extracted from the time domain and time-frequency domain. Finally, MGRU is used to learn representation and classification. By using this model, fault features can be deeply learned layer by layer, and feature types can be identified with higher accuracy. The proposed method was applied to two spur gears (number of teeth Gearl= 53, and Gear2= 80), which were installed on the input and the output shafts of the gearbox, and there are 10 state modes in total. To evaluate the method's performance, four methods were applied to compare, which are (GRU, multilayer long short-term memory (MLSTM), long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machine (SVM)) respectively.

Several linear regression and deep learning models have been studied to extract features from segmented time windows and learn the degradation patterns. However, distributions of features are varying between source learning domain and target test domains, due to different working conditions and environments. Thus, the generalization of traditional methods will be influenced, which leads to performance degradation. This paper develops a domain adaptive CNN-LSTM (DACL) model to predict the RUL of a system based on the multi-dimensional sensor data. The DACL model combines the CNN and LSTM with domain adaptive transfer mechanism and take the operating conditions into consideration. The features extracted by CNN of both source and target data are transformed to a higher dimensional space by reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and the loss function is compensated by using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to reduce the distributions discrepancy. The model is evaluated on C-MAPSS dataset and demonstrate its performance improvement by comparing with previous methods.

It brings a new idea of the complex system fault diagnostics and prognostics. Combining the characteristics of complex system test data and the advantages of deep learning, a fault diagnostics method based on convolutional neural network is proposed, including preprocessing, model training and optimization. Then a complex system fault diagnostic algorithm platform based-on deep learning method is realized. The simulation method of an aero-engine gas path test proves that the proposed method has good feasibility and effect, can fully utilize the advantages of deep learning, and is more suitable for characterizing the complex and varied characteristics hidden inside the complex system data. It can provide the technical support for the design, test and management of the complex system, and improve the safety and effectively reduce the life cycle costs of the complex system.

In the feature extraction step, eight time-domain degradation features are extracted from the faulty variables. A fitness function as a weighted linear combination of the monotonicity, robustness, correlation and trendability metrics is defined and used to evaluate the suitability of the features for RSL prediction. The selected features are merged using a canonical variate residuals (CVR)-based method. In the prognostic step, exponential regression is used in combination with empirical Bayesian algorithm for RSL prediction in the presence of scarce failure data. The proposed approach is validated on failure data collected from an operational industrial centrifugal pump.

Solving these domain adaptive transfer learning tasks has the potential to save large efforts on manually labeling data and modifying models for new machines in the same fleet. Although data driven methods have shown great potential in fault diagnosis applications, their ability to generalize on new machines and new working conditions are limited because of their tendency to overfit to the training set in reality. One promising solution to this problem is to use domain adaptation techniques. It aims to improve model performance on the target new machine. Inspired by its successful implementation in computer vision, we introduced Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) to our context, along with two other popular methods existing in previous fault diagnosis research. We then carefully justify the applicability of these methods in realistic fault diagnosis settings, and offer a unified experimental protocol for a fair comparison between domain adaptation methods for fault diagnosis problems.

Fault diagnosis in gearboxes is a cutting-edge topic nowadays mainly addressed by machine learning approaches. The success classifying a fault under this approach depends directly on the quality of the information provided to the models, and in gearboxes, quality of captured information depends on the place where a sensor is located. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the evaluation of the best of two accelerometers positions for classifying nine severity levels in gearboxes. Based on the performance of LSTM models whose hyperparameters have been found by a Bayesian optimization, we show which one is the best source of information for this layout. Also, we have performed statistical comparisons in order to find any statistical differences between models and accelerometers.

This paper identifies the optimal health feature (HF) as well as the state-of-charge (SOC) based optimal testing profile through IC analysis, which enables the LIB health monitoring through partial charging data that is practically achievable for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) application. Experimental data from various different aging profiles have been applied to validate the identified optimal HF and SOC-based optimal testing profile. Impacts of diverse usage patterns on LIB aging are analyzed through different combinations of four key characterizing stress factors, namely, depth-of-discharge (DOD), charging C-rate, operating mode and temperature. Results on impact analysis can be closely related with realistic automotive usage patterns, thus providing useful guidance to the design of battery management system (BMS) to achieve a more reliable prediction of LIB remaining useful life (RUL) and the improved lifetime control strategies.

Hence, Health Index (HI) construction is a research field of interest. In conventional HI construction methods, performance features have to be selected manually based on experience and expert knowledge. This is a time-consuming procedure requiring a detailed understanding of the component. Furthermore, outliers usually exist in any HI constructed, and these can result in false alarms when HIs are subsequently used. To solve those problems, a new 'end-to-end' methodology, which combines Deep Convolutional Inner Ensemble Learning (DCIEL) with an Outlier Removal method, is proposed for the degradation assessment of roller bearings. In the DCIEL algorithm, an inner-ensemble structure including multiple Deep Learning (DL) blocks is used to extract features directly from raw vibrational signals obtained from bearings. A novel DL block including two convolution layers and one nonlinear pooling layer is proposed. The obtained features are mapped into the HI using a Global Average layer, an Averaging layer, and a Logistic Regression layer. Finally, a novel outlier removal method, based on sliding thresholds, is proposed in order to detect and remove outliers in the constructed HIs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using an open-source bearing health dataset. The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages across multiple HI assessment metrics in comparison with different DL blocks and commonly used HI construction methods.

Most of these applications are developed considering vibration data from artificially induced faults. However, bearing failure in real-life can show huge damage variations even within a single category of failure which artificially induced failures are unable to represent. Thus, in this paper, the performance of classical CNN is evaluated on bearings with naturally occurring and progressing defects from the Paderborn University Dataset. A three-class (Healthy, Inner Race Fault & Outer Race Fault) classification problem is solved considering five bearing conditions within each class. These conditions vary in terms of bearing operating hours, damage mode, damage repetition pattern, the extent of damage, etc. The classification accuracy is evaluated under two cases: 1) at least a portion of data from each bearing condition from all classes is used in training; 2) data from all available conditions are considered for training except from one condition which is used explicitly for testing. Within each case, the effect of changing the domain of the input data is evaluated on the achieved accuracy. Three input signals based on vibration data (raw time domain signal, envelope spectrum, and spectrogram) were explored for their representation effectiveness. The proposed CNN with a spectrogram of the vibration signal as input achieves better results than similar architectures. Finally, the potential challenges that come along with the implementation of Deep Learning technologies for industrial applications are discussed and future research directions are proposed.

However, these kernel functions have unsatisfactory diagnosis accuracy when the sample data have a complex and high-dimension space distribution. For enhancing the diagnosis accuracy, this paper proposes the RVM with a new nonlinearly mixed kernel function. This kernel function consists of a weighted Gaussian kernel and a weighted polynomial kernel. For searching the optimal weights of this new kernel rapidly, this paper constructs an ant colony system which is similar to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to search the optimal solution. Finally, this paper uses a real DC power supply switching circuit to verify the high diagnosis accuracy of the ACO-RVM with a new nonlinearly mixed kernel function.

The main problems in the existing HI construction methods are as follows: (1) existing methods use fixed learning rate to train deep learning network, which is inefficient; (2) existing HIs construction methods do not take into account phase degradation; (3) failure threshold is difficult to determine in remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. In this paper, a HI construction method of rolling bearings based on a deep convolutional neural network with polynomial decaying learning rate (PDCNN) considering phase degradation is proposed. In this paper, the original vibration signal is input into the PDCNN, and the features extracted from the deep convolutional neural network are input into the deep neural network (DNN) to construct HI. The training label setting takes into account phase degradation. The polynomial decaying learning rate is used to train the neural network efficiently. Examples show that the HI constructed by the proposed method is superior to compared three methods in monotonicity and trendability. The polynomial decaying learning rate can improve the training efficiency of deep neural network and save a lot of time. The value of the constructed HI is in the interval [0, 1], which solves the problem that the failure threshold is difficult to determine in RUL prediction.

They usually act as a source of mechanical power for different types of industrial machines. There is a natural life cycle of such electric motors ending in malfunction caused by damage of particular electric or mechanical parts. Sudden and unforeseen engine failure may turn out to be a heavy cost for the company. Early detection of motor damage can minimize repair costs. In this work a machine-learning based methodology for early motor malfunction detection is presented. A test stand with a three-phase induction motor that can simulate various types of stator winding short-circuit faults under load controlled by a DC generator was build. This stand was equipped with multiple sensors for continuous monitoring. Readings from sensors were collected for different loads and types of damage. Multiple methods of preprocessing and classification were tested. Sensors types are evaluated for accuracy of malfunction recognition based on the results of computational experiments. The 5-fold stratified cross-validation was used for evaluation of preprocessing steps and classifiers. The best results were achieved for neutral voltage, axial flux, and torque sensors. Acquisition time of 0.16 s is sufficient for accurate classification.

Due to the complexity and dynamism of these failures, it is often hard to reproduce and diagnose them in testing environments. It is desirable yet still challenging that these failures can be detected and the faults can be located at runtime of the production environment to allow developers to resolve them efficiently. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose MEPFL, an approach of latent error prediction and fault localization for microservice applications by learning from system trace logs. Based on a set of features defined on the system trace logs, MEPFL trains prediction models at both the trace level and the microservice level using the system trace logs collected from automatic executions of the target application and its faulty versions produced by fault injection. The prediction models thus can be used in the production environment to predict latent errors, faulty microservices, and fault types for trace instances captured at runtime. We implement MEPFL based on the infrastructure systems of container orchestrator and service mesh, and conduct a series of experimental studies with two open-source microservice applications (one of them being the largest open-source microservice application to our best knowledge). The results indicate that MEPFL can achieve high accuracy in intra-application prediction of latent errors, faulty microservices, and fault types, and outperforms a state-of-the-art approach of failure diagnosis for distributed systems. The results also show that MEPFL can effectively predict latent errors caused by real-world fault cases.

The proposed mathematical models describe the operation of the main system blocks and are used as reference models in the fault detection mechanism. Using a complex control strategy, the generated power is controlled and the effects of the disturbances which occur in the system, including the faults, are rejected, making the proposed solution a robust and a fault tolerant one. The integrated control solution contains algorithms for the appropriate control of both the boost DC/DC converter and of the single phase inverter blocks. The proposed approaches are directed toward developing algorithms suitable for real-time implementation on 32 bit ARM processors.

This becomes possible due to the rapid detection of serious defects at the stage of their origin. Basically, in practice, the control of the technical condition of the nodes and aggregates of the RWT is carried out during scheduled repairs. It is not always possible to identify incipient defects. Consequently, it is not always possible to warn personnel (machinists, repairmen, etc.) of significant damage to the RWT systems until their complete failure. The difficulties of obtaining diagnostic information is that there is interdependence between the main nodes of the RWT. This means that if physical damage occurs at any of the RWT nodes, in other nodes there can also occur malfunctions. As the main way to improve the efficiency of state detection of the nodes and aggregates of RWT, we see the direction of giving the adaptability property for an automated data processing system from various contactless diagnostic information removal systems. The global purpose can be achieved, in particular, through the use of machine learning methods and failure recognition (recognition objects). In order to improve the operational reliability and service life of the main nodes and aggregates of RWT, there are proposed an appropriate model and algorithm of machine learning of the operator control system of nodes and aggregates. It is proposed to use the Shannon normalized entropy measure and the Kullback-Leibler distance information criterion as a criterion of the learning effectiveness of the automated detection system and operator node state control of RWT. The article describes the application of the proposed method on the example of an automatic detection system (ADS) of the state of a traction motor of an electric locomotive. There are given the test data of the model and algorithm in the MATLAB environment.

As a result, determining the proper features is essential for the feature learning based intelligent fault diagnosis method for rolling element bearing with varying rotating speed. To address this issue, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based fault diagnosis approach is proposed. In the proposed method, envelope order spectra extracted from the raw vibration signals are used to provide abundant information about the fault characteristic orders, which are features invariant to the rotating speed. Subsequently, to extract these representative features automatically, a CNN model is constructed and employed, which avoid the manual feature selection. Finally, the type of bearing defects can be recognized successfully. In the experimental verification, the CNN is trained using a data set corresponds to one revolution per minute (RPM), while the data sets correspond to other RPMs are employed to verify the classification accuracy of the trained CNN, which can reflect the effectiveness of proposed method for bearing fault detection under different rotating speed. Experimental results show the satisfactory performance of fault-pattern recognition for the proposed method. When compared with some other approaches using intelligence-based fault diagnosis method, the results show the superiority of the proposed method.

The paper addresses the pervasive issue that power semiconductor device electrical actuation inflicts structural damage on its assembly, and that wide-bandgap device utilization is currently limited by mechanical integration methods. This paper develops metrics fundamentally based on spatially- and temporally-variant heat transfer dynamics for identifying relationships between power electronic converter operation and local degradation modes. Spatially-varying electrothermal impedance (SETI) is defined and further processed to synthesize a dynamic thermal strain gradient rate of-degradation metric. Then, the multi-variable frequency response function (FRF) surfaces are normalized to enable rapid identification of a transient thermal response continuum's sensitivity to different modes of degradation. The methodology is applied to a 3D transient thermal model of a switching MOSFET power electronic converter. Subsequent interpretations identify relationships that allow natural synthesis of reliability-oriented hardware design constraints to add a sensing feature and reduce over-design margin in future power semiconductor products.

Development of a prognostics health management (PHM) framework for flexible electronics and flexible components is still in its nascent stages due to the novelty and understanding of the flexible regime. Little to no information exists on techniques which incorporate depth of discharge (DoD) and other varying test parameters such as varying load (across test conditions) and can then successfully evaluate the degradation in capacity and compute the remaining useful life for flexible lithium-ion power sources. Flexible electronic systems need to have a thin, robust power system that also has the capability to sustain dynamic stresses which are replicative of daily motions. Such applications can foresee the usage of flexible power sources in areas with both direct mechanical and environmental stresses. Current health monitoring techniques and test standards for rigid power sources which are used in portable electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) demonstrate robust and efficient RUL techniques with some of them considered as the benchmark in terms of model accuracy. With the current boom in internet of things (IoT), flexible power sources/flexible energy harvesting units will be the go to product of the industry for the next couple of decades. Therefore it is the need of the hour to develop PHM frameworks for such flexible lithium-ion based power sources. In this research study, 60mAh flexible lithium-ion batteries have been analyzed by cycling them through multiple full charge and shallow discharge cycles at distinct DoD operating conditions. Effects of simultaneous thermal stresses and repeated cyclic events have been studied on output parameters such as efficiency, capacity and charge-discharge time. State Of -the-art Li-Ion batteries have been tested under: multiple operating temperatures of 40 degrees C and 25 degrees C with different C-rates. In this paper, capacity and "number of cycles" have been used as vectors to monitor the health of the power source and assess remaining useful life. Regression based modeling technique has been used to estimate the battery capacity deterioration in form of number of cycles to reach the end of life (EoL) which is about 80% of the original life.

Calendar aging is a term often used to describe long term storage at elevated temperatures. Effect of such storage environments on the health of ultra-thin flexible li-ion batteries is relatively unknown but needs to be studied as it is replicative of shelf life the power sources see between fabrication and in-field usage. Also, health monitoring techniques which can successfully predict remaining useful life for flexible lithium-ion power sources have yet to be fully studied. It is well known that cyclic aging can deteriorate the health of a power source ultimately resulting in capacity fade over its lifetime. Now, whether or not calendar aging and varying thermal loads (during storage) have an effect on the working of flexible li-ion battery is yet to be established. With the current state-of-the-art moving towards flexible electronics and flexible components, it is therefore of the utmost importance to establish test protocols, test standards, prognostic health management frameworks and test methodologies for flexible power sources which will be implemented as energy harvesting units in such electronic assemblies. In this research study, flexible lithium-ion batteries have been analyzed for effects of long term calendar aging and varying thermal loads by subjecting the test samples to: 1) unpowered aging at 50 degrees C ranging from 10 days-120 days 2) unpowered exposure to thermal cyclic environment, 10 degrees C-50 degrees C, ranging from 50 loops to 550 loops. After the pre-conditional exposure the power sources were cycled through multiple full charge and full discharge cycles at ambient operating temperature under a constant C-rate. Output parameters such as efficiency, capacity and charge-discharge time have been studied for battery degradation. SEM and EDX techniques have also been utilized to study the effects on cathode microstructure and report if any visual evidence for film formation, electrolyte decomposition and/or lithium plating is observed.

The location information will facilitate not only the remote control and autonomy of the industrial robots and sensors, but it will also enable predictive control and maintenance, increased productivity, and increased workers' safety. The data labelling is typically a tedious and costly process when done manually or semi-automatically, and the fully automated data labelling has still to overcome several challenges that we describe in this paper. We propose a collaborative robotic architecture equipped with simultaneous localization and mapping as well as machine-learning-based algorithms. A scenario in an industrial setting is presented, in which data acquisition by robots, with various capabilities, can be used to enable location-based services for increased workers' safety and to offer timely tracking of mobile assets for an increased productivity. The robotic platform acquires data during the periods when the robots are not allocated to their main tasks. Besides, we demonstrate that the above mentioned robotic platform could benefit from machine learning, for example, the accurate estimation of positions and good adaption in different type of collected data sets.

In the study, a fault feature separation and extraction approach is proposed for the bearing-gear fault condition through combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD), Hilbert transform (HT), principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) techniques. Firstly, EMD is implemented to decompose the single sensor signal to obtain multiple sub-band signals termed as the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, the most relevant IMFs to bearing and gear fault features are selected to construct multiple-channels model with the help of the simulated bearing and gear fault signals. Thirdly, HT is utilized to compute marginal Hilbert spectrum (MHS) for each IMF in multiple-channels model, to construct an MHS matrix. Finally, some statistically independent components are obtained by decomposing the MHS matrix with PCA and ICA, and multiple fault features are identified from these components. The experimental application of the proposed method is put into a bearing-belt-gearbox union machinery system to evaluate its validity. The experimental analysis results indicate that the proposed method is effective to separate and extract a bearing fault and a gear fault for two types of compound bearing-gear fault conditions.

To overcome this weakness, the simulation of rare fault signals is proposed in this paper. Specifically, frequency spectra are employed as model signals, then Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) is implemented to generate simulated signals based on a labeled dataset. Finally, the real and artificial signals are combined to train stacked autoencoders (SAE) to detect mechanical health conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed WGAN-SAE method, two specially designed experiments are carried out and some traditional methods are adopted for comparison. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method can deal with imbalanced fault classification problem much more effectively. The improved performance is mainly due to the artificial fault signals generated from the WGAN to balance the dataset, where the signals that are lacking in training dataset are effectively augmented.

As each sensor provides partial and dependent information, data-level fusion techniques have been developed and aim at increasing the reliability and safety of machines by providing the current health assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. While most existing data-level fusion techniques have shown a promise for prognostics, they are mainly limited by only focusing on the improvement of point prediction, which makes it difficult to provide adequate available information for decision-making in predictive maintenance. In this paper, the prediction interval (PI) is adopted to model the prediction uncertainty of RUL for its nature of high variability. An improved echo state Gaussian process (IESGP), which is able to provide an estimation of prediction uncertainty, is developed as a novel data-driven approach for RUL prediction and PI construction. The proposed IESGP is a novel Bayesian approach which combines the merits of echo state networks and Gaussian processes to enhance the prediction accuracy. Based on this, a comprehensive cost function is constructed to characterize the accuracy and uncertainty simultaneously, then a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is applied to optimize the point prediction and PI. The validity of the proposed approach is verified on the widely used turbofan benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only achieve superior predictive accuracy in comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches but also obtain PIs with high quality.

In this paper, a novel hydrogen monitoring system is designed based on the principle of semiconductor, catalytic combustion and heat-conducting gas sensors. Also, the gas sensor will inevitably fail due to the nature of gas sensitive materials in the long-time monitoring process. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of hydrogen concentration measurement, a novel fault diagnosis and reconfiguration strategy for hydrogen sensor array based on moving window principle component analysis and extreme learning machine (MWPCA-ELM) is proposed. Firstly, online multiple faults detection is carried out by using MWPCA. Once one or multiple faults are detected, the measured values of other fault-free sensors will be used to recover the faulty data in real-time by using ELM predictor according to the relevancy among the hydrogen sensors. Secondly, the hydrogen concentration is reconfigured seamlessly and accurately based on ELM under the condition of small calibration data sample. Finally, fault diagnosis is conducted by MWPCA feature extraction coupled with ELM multi-classifier. In order to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed fault diagnosis and reconfiguration strategy, a hydrogen concentration monitoring experimental system was established. The average relative error (ARE) of hydrogen concentration estimation is declined from 1.18% to 0.82% compared with the traditional regression methods. Particularly, the proposed fault reconfiguration model can recover the fault data even if the concentration is changed, and the accuracy of fault diagnosis is 100% within 250 samples.

The maintenance strategies in the Chinese Railway industry are transforming from plan-based to condition-based, which has heightened the need for the completion of relevant research. This study proposes an experience-based health status evaluation method for train wheels, which considers factors in the wheel manufacturing process, operational process and maintenance process. The manufacturing factors are indicated by material properties and press-fitting influence factor, while operational and maintenance factors are indicated by wheel diameter and damages. Based on the health evaluation values, a decision-making function is constructed to divide wheels into four categories: fine, attention, pre-alarm and scrapped. Finally, the PHM + Wheel system is developed based on the proposed health evaluation method to provide support for maintenance strategy.

For this purpose, a new approach called improved deep transfer auto-encoder is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of gearbox faults under variable working conditions with small training samples. First, multi-wavelet is employed as activation function for effectively learning useful features hidden in the non-stationary vibration data. Second, correntropy is used to modify the cost function to enhance the reconstruction quality. Third, pre-train an improved deep auto-encoder using sufficient auxiliary data in the source domain, and transfer its parameters to the target model. Finally, the improved deep transfer should be fine-tuned by small training samples in the target domain to adapt to the characteristics of the rest testing data. The proposed approach is used to analyze two sets of experimental vibration data collected from gearbox under variable working conditions. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately diagnose different faults of gearbox even the working conditions have significant changes, which is superior to the existing methods.

J	Gou, LF; Zhong, Y				Gou, Linfeng; Zhong, Yu			A New Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Attributes Weighted Neutrosophic Set	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Neutrosophic set; fault diagnosis; attributes weighted; defuzzification; SVNPWA operator	GROUP DECISION-MAKING; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; TOPSIS METHOD	Fault diagnosis is an extensively applied issue to monitor condition and diagnose fault for safe and stable operation of the machine, which started to develop during the industrial revolution and contains various theories and technologies. Due to the growing complexity of contributing factors of a fault and the correlation of fault attributes which are often interrelated, traditional fault diagnosis methods fail to handle with this complex condition. To solve this problem, a new fault diagnosis method based on attributes weighted neutrosophic set is proposed in this paper. In the proposed approach, a attributes weighted model is developed to obtain the weights of attributes by the fault information. For a sample whose fault type is unknown, the neutrosophic set generated from the fault sample data are aggregated via the single valued neutrosophic power weighted averaging (SVNPWA) operator with the obtained attributes weights, then, the fault diagnosis results could be determined by the defuzzification method of fused neutrosophic set. This proposed method have capacity to differentiate the individual impact of attributes and handle the uncertain problems in the process of fault diagnosis. Finally, an illustrative example was provided to demonstrate the reasonableness and effectiveness of the proposed method.

In order to avoid faults, it is necessary to prepare the combine harvester for work in advance. There are many rotating parts in this machine, which work depends on each other. In the case of a unit failure, the machine cannot be operated further. To avoid these problems, it is necessary to find faults and remove them as early as possible. In order to minimize the time for determination of the combine harvester bearing condition, the vibro analytical methods are used to determine the status of the bearings without dismounting the units. This paper provides the research results of the rolling bearing condition of the combine straw chopper using vibration diagnostics. Identification of the vibration sources is based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrum analysis. From the obtained results and data analysis, it can be stated that the average values of vibration velocity (in frequency interval 10-1000 Hz) in combination to other measured parameters can be used to assess the combine straw chopper bearing condition. The obvious defects should occur when the amplitude of the vibrations increases, the bearing balls passing through the outer bearing ring, which theoretical frequency equals f(RPI) = 36 Hz, the inner ring f(RPV) = 44 Hz and the ball defect f(RDD) = 66.7 Hz. From practical point of view, the use of the vibro analysis technique together with the temperature analysis technique would significantly increase the accuracy for determination of the bearing defect.

The first phase consists in the automation of the performance assessment of the equipment in MS Excel. With the smart tools included in Excel, a macro was developed that not only saves the user time and makes the process more efficient, but also gives a clear idea of the quality of the test results. The second phase deals with the quality control management of the generated data through the application of manufacturing techniques; a code in Matlab was created that would allow the user to visualise the current performance of the equipment according to some specified limits in Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts. This enables the user to select the relevant information to visualise by analysing the control levels and dates. In the final phase a prediction algorithm applying data mining and machine learning techniques was developed, based on the historical data, which is used as a small sample of big data that could be potentially generated by the IoT enabled equipment interconnected via the internet enabling them to send and receive data. Using the K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier a performance accuracy of 94% was achieved which allows the user to predict future behaviour of the equipment.

Especially within infrastructure systems of systems and the applications of the internet of things, data became an asset for additional tasks regarding their efficient and effective operations, e.g., predictive maintenance which lowers the total costs of ownership. Many of these tasks are well supported by digital twins but building such digital replicas of systems and processes within a system of system is complicated by that context, e.g., due to the managerial independence of the contributing systems that often restricts available information and data sharing. We discuss these challenges together with strategies and architectures that address them and illustrate this digital twin perspective on cyber physical systems and the internet of things with examples from the smart grid and smart building domain.

Automatic high-grade cancer detection on prostatectomy histopathology images	MEDICAL IMAGING 2019: DIGITAL PATHOLOGY	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Digital Pathology	FEB 20-21, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE		prostate cancer detection; grading; histopathology; whole-slide imaging		Automatic cancer grading and high-grade cancer detection for radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens can benefit pathological assessment for prognosis and post-surgery treatment decision making. We developed and validated an automatic system which grades cancerous tissue as high-grade (Gleason grade 4 and higher) vs. low-grade (Gleason grade 3) on digital histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). We combined this grading system with our previously-reported cancer detection system to build a high-grade cancer detection system which automatically finds high-grade cancerous foci on WSIs. The system was tuned on a 3-patient data set and cross-validated against expert-drawn contours on a separate 68-patient data set comprising 286 mid-gland whole-slide images of RP specimens. The system uses machine learning techniques to classify each region of interest (ROI) on the slide as cancer or non-cancer and each cancerous ROI as high-grade or low-grade cancer. We used leave-one-patient-out cross-validation to measure the performance of cancer grading for classified ROIs with three different classifiers and the performance of the high-grade cancer detection system on a per tumor focus basis. The best performing (Fisher) classifier yielded an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.87 for cancer grading. The system yielded error rates of 19.5% and 23.4% for pure high-grade (Gleason 4+4, 5+5) and high-grade (Gleason Score >= 7) cancer detection, respectively. The system demonstrated potential for practical computation speeds. Upon successful multi-centre validation, this system has the potential to assist the pathologist to find high-grade cancer more efficiently, which benefits the selection and guidance of adjuvant therapy and prognosis post RP.

Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technology enables the deployment of many new IoT solutions in areas such as controlling and monitoring assets, environmental sensing and location tracking. In this paper, a prototype low-cost LPWAN module is developed to be retrofitted to existing Fault Passage Indicators, creating a automatic remote detection and location system for medium voltage faults, reducing the time to find faults from hours to minutes. This prototype device was then tested on a physical 11kV overhead line network, where the device demonstrated it was robust and suitable for mass deployment on a live network. The finalised prototype module costs roughly 5% of a single FPI unit, and additionally features the ability to remotely reconfigure FPI making installation and maintenance more convenient.

By exploiting log, tracing, metric, and network data, AIOps enable detection of faults and issues of services. The focus of this work is on detecting anomalies based on distributed tracing records that contain detailed information for the availability and the response time of the services. In large-scale distributed systems, where a service is deployed on heterogeneous hardware and has multiple scenarios of normal operation, it becomes challenging to detect such anomalous cases. We address the problem by proposing unsupervised, response time anomaly detection based on deep learning data modeling techniques; unsupervised dynamic error threshold approach; tolerance module for false positive reduction; and descriptive classification of the anomalies. The evaluation shows that the approach achieves high accuracy and solid performance in both, experimental testbed and large-scale production cloud.

The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved both ways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations. Moreover, the survey will enable security individuals differentiate IoT NIDS from traditional ones.

A final diagnosis is obtained by performing a stereotactic brain biopsy, which carries a small but not insignificant risk. Distinguishing between primary and secondary malignant neoplasms is critical for providing appropriate patient prognosis, management and treatment planning. Devising non-invasive means of distinguishing between the two would be clinically useful, as patients may forego a surgical biopsy. In this study, we propose a radiomics approach for enhanced characterization and classification of such tumors. The final dataset for this study consisted of pre-treatment MRI scans acquired from 52 patients (aged 61 +/- 7 years; 31M, 21F; 35 GBM, 17 METS, 3T MRI scanner) consisting of Contrast-Enhanced (CE) T1 and T2 FLAIR sequences. The extracted features were used with an Adaboost classifier with a 10-fold cross validation scheme. The best results (AUC=0.84) were obtained using Local Binary Patterns extracted from the CE T1 sequences and also a high-dimensional feature vector from the wavelet-transformed image at the lowest frequency (AUC=0.84). Combining all the features from both the sequences resulted in a classification performance of 0.71. Our results suggest that radiomics-based machine learning analysis can accurately differentiate glioblastomas from metastatic brain tumors. Improvements in classification of such tumors could potentially reduce the need for an invasive stereotactic brain biopsy.

The underlying cause for the onset of DME is the degradation of the blood-retinal barrier, whose primary function is maintaining the extracellular fluid at an optimal range. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has proven to be a catalyst in altering the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier, thereby initiating a cascade of events that ultimately results in a loss of visual acuity.(1) The primary imaging techniques to recognize and diagnose DME are fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Taking a multimodal approach of FA in combination with SD-OCT provides images of vasculature and other eye structures to help better identify key features such as level, location, and amount of leakage.(2) First-line treatments for DME have now evolved to using anti-VEGF to inhibit the effects VEGF has on increasing the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier.(3) Because VEGF also increases the chance of leakage, we can also expect anti-VEGF treatments to decrease the amount of leakage DME patients suffer from. Anti-VEGF treatments also have a peripheral effect of modifying the disease burden and allowing for extended time in between treatments.(4) Although current conventional treatment parameters exist to determine the efficacy of such VEGF treatments, many of these markers rely on clinicians to make a judgment call based on a minor qualitative difference of retinal scans or involve clinicians taking a fluid assessment, an option deemed too invasive to demand from all patients. In this work, we seek to find new imaging features that derive from a sub-visual feature analysis, and ideally provide a prognostic metric for clinicians to help streamline the diagnostic process. The rationale for these new biomarkers derives from leakage properties and their activity in the retina once edema develops. A decrease in leakage within certain structures in the eye would also lead to a change in the densities of leakage patterns, correlating with better clinical outcomes. In this work, we use morphological and graph-based attributes to model the global properties and spatial distribution of leakage areas on baseline FA scans of patients subsequently treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy (i.e. aflibercept). The features were then used in conjunction with a classifier to distinguish between eyes tolerating extended dosing intervals (N=15) and those eyes requiring more frequent dosing (N=12), based on initial response following treatment interval extension. The cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was found to be 0.74 +/- 0.11% using the computed imaging attributes. Edge length disorder of minimum spanning tree showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.007) between the two groups. Clinical parameters such as central subfield thickness and macular volume were not statistically significantly different. Our results indicate that there may be differences in spatial distribution of leakage areas between eyes that will exhibit favorable response to extended interval aflibercept dosing and eyes that require more frequent dosing.

Automated grading can assist the doctor diagnosing the medical condition. But algorithms still lag behind human experts in this task, as human experts excel in identifying parts, detecting characteristics and relating concepts and semantics. This can be improved by making algorithms distinguish and characterize the most relevant types of objects in the image and characterizing images from that. We propose a three-stage automated approach named OBI (Object-based Identification) with steps: 1. Object-based identification, which identifies the "type of object" of each region and characterizes it; 2. Learn about image, which characterizes distribution of characteristics of those types of objects in image; 3. Deteunination of degree of malignancy, which assigns a degree of malignancy based on a classifier over object type characteristics (the statistical distribution of characteristics of structures) in the image. Our proof-of-concept prototype uses publicly-available Mytos-Atypia dataset [19] to compare accuracy with alternatives. Results summary: human expert (medical doctor) 84%, classic machine learning 74%, convolution neural networks (CNN), 78%, our approach (OBI) 86%. As future work, we expect to generalize our results to other datasets and problems, explore mimicking knowledge of human concepts further, merge the object-based approach with CNN techniques and adapt it to other medical imaging contexts.

The high probability of metastasis makes its prognosis very poor even after potentially curative treatment. Detecting high metastatic HCC will allow for the development of effective approaches to reduce HCC mortality. The mechanism of HCC metastasis has been studied using gene profiling analysis, which indicated that HCC with different metastatic capability was differentiable. However, it is time consuming and complex to analyze gene expression level with conventional method. To distinguish HCC with different metastatic capabilities, we proposed a deep learning based method with microscopic images in animal models. In this study, we adopted convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn the deep features of microscopic images for classifying each image into low metastatic HCC or high metastatic HCC. We evaluated our proposed classification method on the dataset containing 1920 white-light microscopic images of frozen sections from three tumor-bearing mice injected with HCC-LM3 (high metastasis) tumor cells and another three tumor-bearing mice injected with SMMC-7721(low metastasis) tumor cells. Experimental results show that our method achieved an average accuracy of 0.85. The preliminary study demonstrated that our deep learning method has the potential to be applied to microscopic images for metastasis of HCC classification in animal models.

Currently, this is a significant problem faced by the printing industry. This is due to the fact that the parameters in the printing devices change automatically during their operation. The question of setting up and changing of parameters of the thickness signatures is insufficient research and has a random character. Lack of knowledge of the displacement values of these parameters forces long machine downtime in the printing industry. In the article, prognoses were made of the setting parameter for assembling signatures in book collators in gathering machine. These prognoses were made using artificial neural networks. Performance of three neural network architectures were analysed. It was also suggested which of the examined architectures can be used on real objects, and which should be further improved.

Information integration technology is the key to implementing enterprise information. At the same time, fault diagnosis is also the technical focus of enterprise information. The fault diagnosis technology based on artificial intelligence method and the remote fault diagnosis technology based on B/S mode open up a new field for the research and application of fault diagnosis technology. When a certain mode, the output maximum value F n of the neural network is close to 0, and other values Smaller, both close to 0.1, then the system can be considered F n failure. Practice has proved that if there are enough training samples, the network has a strong diagnostic function to determine the correct rate of 96% or more, indicating that the network training effect is good and meets the diagnostic requirements.

This unintended operation of relays may lead to power system blackout. It is due to their inability to distinguish a stable from an unstable power swing and to take a tripping decision appropriately. This research paper proposes a fast and wavelet energy-based method to detect stable and unstable power swings for distance relays. The proposed method computes the angular velocity of an equivalent machine developed from the measurements available at a bus. The energy in the low frequency band of the equivalent machine angular velocity will assist the tripping decisions of transmission line relays during power swings. Compared to the conventional method using blinders, the advantage of this method is that it requires less hardware and less time to know whether the resulting power oscillations after fault clearing are going to be stable or not. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on 5-bus system, WSCC 9-bus system, and IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems considering different test scenarios. The results show that using this method improves the performance of distance relays in detecting stable and unstable power swings.

Due to the high cost of satellites and their launch and operation processes, satellite batteries are expected to operate until the end of a satellite's life. Since the batteries are the core part of the power system, a battery failure would not only affect the system's normal functionality and performance, which would lead to increased system downtime, but could also lead to catastrophic events. To ensure that the batteries are reliable, efficient, and capable of delivering power and energy when required, an accurate prediction of the battery's performance, health, and life is necessary. In this paper, we estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a battery by using a pattern-based machine learning and knowledge discovery approach called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). We propose a reliability-based prognostic methodology that uses condition monitoring (CM) data, which can deal with any number of condition indicators without selecting the most significant ones, as many other machine learning methods propose. The LAD approach is based on an exploration of the monitored battery's database and the extraction of useful information, which describe the phenomenon of battery's degradation.

C	Baumann, S			IEEE	Baumann, Sebastian			Using Machine Learning for Data-Based Assessing of the Aircraft Fuel Economy	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Weight, lift, drag and thrust are the key forces during flight influencing the consumption characteristics of an aircraft. Monitoring the aircraft's fuel consumption allows statements to be made about the aircraft performance and flight efficiency. Here, valuations with regard to a propulsive or an aerodynamic degrading as well as procedural benefits are of interest for aircraft operators and airlines. Conventional data analyses and calculation methods (ex post), e.g. via physical models or statistical metrics like median or mean, have the disadvantage of not being able to quantify influencing parameters on the fuel economy accurately enough in many cases. A more precise method, which allows statements and assessments (diagnoses based on historical flight data) and estimations (prognoses based on estimated model inputs) on the aircraft fuel consumption, would be desirable to detect aircraft fuel and flight (in) efficiencies under real flight operational and environmental conditions. In this respect, a reliable trade off would be desirable in order to avoid uneconomical modeling effort and reduce expenses concerning data procurement. This paper is in the scope of an application-oriented machine learning method development. For this reason, the present work deals with algorithms of machine learning, which can exceed current methods, especially for complex tasks with multivariate interdependencies. Ensembles of bagged decision trees for regression and classification purposes, as well as hierarchical cluster analyses applied on full flight data records from flight operations. Thus, the paper addresses two objectives and provides first approaches for: modeling of route, environment and aircraft (tail sign) specific characteristics for feasible fuel flow predictions on the one hand (diagnosis and prognosis in the field of data science); data-based analyses and quantification of influencing factors on the fuel economy to identify routes and anomalous flights on the other hand (data mining, pattern recognition). The latter, thus, aims at an improvement of reporting and the derivation of recommendations for actions for future flight profiles. Finally, the analysis capability of the concept is shown with first results for two analysis questions with three examples, evaluated based on an analysis with sample flight data provided by NASA Dashlink. To proof and evaluate the applicability of this method, a benchmark is also presented by using an available (physical) performance model and statistical metrics.

C	Mehringskiitter, S; Preusche, C			IEEE	Mehringskiitter, Simon; Preusche, Christian			Consideration of Variable Operating States in a Data-Based Prognostic Algorithm	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				A technical system's availability is vital for economic efficiency. Especially, unscheduled downtime has a major impact on economic efficiency in most branches. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is an emerging discipline which enables downtime scheduling while using as most as possible of a component's wear margin. Common approaches rely on data-based algorithms that are trained with acquired sensor data and aim to model the degradation behavior in order to predict the degradation curve as well as the remaining useful life (RUL). Most data-based approaches examine a rather static operating condition of a unit under test (UUT), i.e. the load or number of revolutions is not varied while generating run to failure data of a component like bearings. While this assumption can be held for several components, there are those that are operated in a varying state. An aircraft's control surface actuator is an exemplary component that sees different loads through varying airspeed, weather and the flight mission. Since these variations influence the degradation behavior, they have to be considered in a prognosis algorithm. In this paper, a prognosis algorithm is proposed that incorporates a varying operating state, where an operating state is characterized by the parameters which significantly influence the degradation behavior. For a final discussion of the performance improvement, a simulated dataset is generated as input for the proposed and a reference algorithm. It is shown that the proposed algorithm achieves a better prediction performance compared to the reference algorithm that does not incorporate the varying operating state.

C	Yang, J; Guo, YQ; Zhao, WL			IEEE	Yang, Jing; Guo, Yingqing; Zhao, Wanli			Aircraft Actuator Fault Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Based Sparse Representation and TSM	2019 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2019	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				This paper presents a novel data-based fault diagnosis approach of aircraft actuators by using deep learning methods. Electro-mechanical actuator (EMA), which we study on, widely used in a new generation of aircraft serves as the research object. The basic fault diagnosis framework of this work is based on Time Series Modeling (TSM), which builds a model for each sensor data, then faults can be detected and isolated by differences between model prediction result and measured result. In this structure, the quantity of sensors is directly related to the fault diagnosis effect, that is, the fault detection capability increases when the number of sensors increases. Simultaneously, the workload of the model training increases without expectation. Therefore, the reduction of sensors is of great significance. The traditional method is to use the manual experience to screen, but this method has high requirements on personal ability and performance is not easy to guarantee. This paper adopts the Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) algorithm, which avoids the simple direct screening process and achieves the purpose of reducing the number of sensors by adaptively extracting features. Important features of sensor data, preserved by loss compression using SAE, can be used to build time series models. Relationship of time series adjacent data is adopted to build mathematical models. Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm can make good use of the relationship between time series, which has been widely used in speech recognition, text recognition, and other fields. However, standard RNN algorithm tends to ignore future information. In this paper, the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory RNN algorithm (BiLSTM-RNN), considering both past data and future data, is applied to TSM. Through the Comparison of the standard RNN and long short-term memory RNN (LSTM-RNN) algorithms, the biLSTM-RNN algorithm shows better modeling and fault diagnosis performance.

Diagnosis of transformer's failure is of significance to maintain its safe and stable operation. Frequency response analysis (FRA) has been widely accepted as an effective tool for winding deformation fault diagnosis, which is one of the common failures for power transformers. However, there is no standard and reliable code for FRA interpretation as so far. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM) is combined with FRA to diagnose transformer faults. Furthermore, advanced optimization algorithms are also applied to improve the performance of models. A series of winding fault emulating experiments were carried out on an actual model transformer, the key features are extracted from measured FRA data, and the diagnostic model is trained and obtained, to arrive at an outcome for classifying the fault types and degrees of winding deformation faults with satisfactory accuracy. The diagnostic results indicate that this method has potential to be an intelligent, standardized, accurate and powerful tool.

This paper deals with the problem of developing PHM framework for a satellite attitude actuator system that uses single gimballed Control Moment Gyros (CMG) in a pyramid configuration using only the attitude measurement data to eliminate the need for subsystem level sensor data acquisition. A data-driven model is used to mimic the nominal plant dynamics and fault is induced in the spin motor of the CMG of the satellite dynamics to generate run to failure data of the attitude control system. A novel scheme is used for developing a data-driven model which fuses the symmetric property of the data and the system orientation property of actuators that reduces the need for historical data by 93.75% and Chebyshev Neural Network is used as a data-driven model. General path model is used for to capture the prognosis of the system and using the parameters from general path model as apriori information, Bayesian updating technique is used to predicting remaining useful life of a system in real time. The algorithm performs with 96.25% accuracy when 30% of data is available for online prediction.

EEG signals are collected by Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and are utilized to distinguish between ictal and seizure-free signals. Here, we used the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method to obtain IMFs from EEG signals for classification of seizure and seizure-free signals. These IMFs are combined with statistical parameters and are used as an input features set to ELM. This method is accurate and provides a better classification of highly densed and complex EEG signals, which are utilized for classification of seizure and seizure-free signals.

However, during the dimensionality reduction of process observation data, UELM only aims at mining the local structure feature information of process data and lacks of the ability of preserving the global structure analysis of process data, which would perform unsatisfactorily for monitoring nonlinear process. Furthermore, the choice of the optimal number of hidden layer nodes in UELM method is still a challenging problem. To handle these two tough problems, a new fault detection approach on the basis of global preserving unsupervised kernel extreme learning machine (GUKELM) technique is proposed to monitor nonlinear process effectively. In GUKELM technique, the data global structure preserving framework is naturally incorporated into standard UELM to capture the local structure information as well as to preserve the global structure feature information of nonlinear process observation data during the dimensionality reduction. Meanwhile, to tackle the strong nonlinearity of process observation data, the kernel trick is utilized to successfully solve the challenging issue of setting the optimal number of hidden layer nodes. Based on extracted process data low dimensional feature information from GUKELM method, support vector data description algorithm is adopted to construct the monitoring statistic to detect process fault. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed process monitoring strategy is illustrated through a numerical nonlinear system and the continuous stirred tank reactor process which is a typical nonlinear process.

First, a single particle impact on the metal plate test-bed was designed and constructed. Then 1,000 groups coal and 1,000 groups gangue impact on the metal plate tests were carried out respectively, and the vibration acceleration signals of the metal plate were collected. After that, through the signal intercepting, calculating the time-domain characteristics and HHT processing of the vibration signal, 10 time-frequency characteristics, such as the variance of the intercepted signal and the Hilbert marginal spectrum energy value, are determined to form the feature vector. Finally, based on the two different type of the signal samples, the intercepted signal feature vector, and the original intercepted signal, coal gangue recognition by the seven machine learning algorithms, including the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), XGBoost, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), factorization machine (FM), and stacking integration is carried out respectively, and the basis for selecting recognition schemes is discussed. The results show that the coal gangue recognition rate with the same recognition algorithm by using the intercepted signal samples is higher than that of the feature vector samples, the Staking integration algorithm based on the same sample has the highest recognition rate, and the Staking integration algorithm based on the feature vector has the most significant comprehensive advantage in top coal caving process.

However, it is not practical to perform RPTs frequently because they are time-consuming and expensive; moreover, the Li-ion battery undergoes unnecessary degradation during test operations. Therefore, the RPTs should be performed as infrequently as possible. In this paper, a neural network-based SOH estimation scheme with reduced experimental data measured by the RPT is proposed for achieving economic efficiency and mitigating the dispensable degradation being caused by additional experiments. For the RPT-reduced experimental data, the continuous SOH estimation problem is formulated into a classification problem. The neural network learns how to estimate the SOH values using short time-series voltage and current data, labeled as the corresponding SOH values by the RPTs. Even in the SOH regions, where the data are not labeled as any given class and there is no prior knowledge on the corresponding SOH, the proposed SOH estimation scheme works well by performing regression with the class probability distribution.

This problem may not only result in the paralysis of the production but may also influence the operator safety. To resolve this problem, several methods have been developed for the monitoring and the diagnosis of faults from their appearances to avoid the industrial process interruption. With this objective in mind, this paper proposes a new diagnosis technique used in the identification of these faults based on stator current Auto-Regressive modeling. The proposed approach presents several advantages compared to the classical stator current spectral analysis using the conventional Periodogram technique. In fact, the proposed approach offers a very good frequency resolution for a very short acquisition time, which is impossible to achieve with the classical technique of the Periodogram. Simulation and experimental tests will be carried out later in this paper to verify the proposed method in bearing faults diagnosis.

In fact, under these conditions, the analysis with this approach is no more reliable. To resolve this, we use in this paper, the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), to obtain information on changes of the frequencies over time. Furthermore, we propose the use of a new approach called Maxima's Location Algorithm (MLA) which will be associated to the STFT analysis to show only harmonics with useful information on existing faults. This approach will be used in the diagnosis of bearing faults of a PWM inverter-fed induction motor operating at variable speed. Experimental results show the merits of the proposed approach on the reliability of the bearing fault detection.

In recent times, a significant amount of research work has been directed to address this problem and the techniques such as ANN, WT, FIS, SVM, Decision tree, etc., have already been employed. This study presents an intelligent framework for transmission line fault classification, applying an innovative machine learning algorithm called Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM) that requires small training time to solve nonlinear problems and is applicable to high-dimension application. EEMD method has been utilized for raw electric signals' decomposition into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), which act as input variable in PSVM-based classifier for identification of faults. Simulations and evaluations suggest that the proposed scheme is effective, reliable, and accurate.

Prognostic evaluation of multimodal biometric traits recognition based human face, finger print and iris images using ensembled SVM classifier	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ensembled SVM classifier; Face; Feature extraction; Finger print; Gabor wavelet transformation; Iris; Multimodal biometric recognition; Preprocessing; Cloud	FEATURE-LEVEL FUSION; AUTHENTICATION	Biometric recognition is an effective method for discovering a person's identity. Multimodal biometric recognition employs multiple sources of information about a human for authentication. Recently, many research works are designed for multimodal biometric recognition using classification techniques. However, the performance of conventional techniques was not efficient for achieving higher recognition rate. In order to overcome such limitations, an ensembled support vector machine based kernel mapping (ESVM-KM) technique is proposed for multimodal biometric recognition. The ESVM-KM technique is designed for improving the accuracy of multimodal biometric recognition with human face, finger print and iris images. The ESVM-KM technique initially performs the preprocessing in order to remove noise and to improve the image quality for human recognition. After that, ESVM-KM technique carried outs Gabor wavelet transformation based feature extraction process in which features of human face, finger print and iris images are efficiently extorted for classification. Finally, the ESVM-KM technique used ensembled SVM classifier for enhancing the recognition rate of multimodal biometric system. The ESVM-KM technique conducts simulation work on the metrics such as computational time, recognition rate, and true positive rate. The simulation results demonstrate that the ESVM-KM technique is able to improve the recognition rate and also reduces computational time of multimodal biometric recognition system when compared to state-of-the-art works. The results got through ESVM-KM are stored in cloud environment for easy and future access.

Different from other studies, this paper focuses on not only the impact of radial SAGE, but also the effect of axial and hybrid SAGE, on the EMT fluctuation characteristics, i.e., we actually study the 3D static rotor eccentricity. The theoretical analysis model is first set up to study the influence of SAGE on the magnetomotive force (MFD) and EMT. Then, the finite element calculation and the experimental study on the CS-5 prototype generator which is of two poles and 3000 rpm are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis. It is shown that the radial SAGE will increase the dc component of MFD and shift the whole MFD curve and the phase current upwardly, while the axial SAGE will reduce the dc component as well as the amplitudes of both the MFD and the phase current like a compressing operation. In general, no matter in unidirectional or hybrid SAGE cases, the radial SAGE will intensify the EMT ripple and increase each harmonic of EMT, while axial SAGE will play the opposite role.

To be able to generate good models, a lot of experimental data are required. Moreover, the high frequency sampling required for electronic devices implies that huge amounts of experimental data must be efficiently stored, transformed, and analyzed in the prediction models. The first contribution of this paper is the proposal of a Big Data architecture that can be used for a generic prognostics approach of electronic devices. To illustrate the proposal, the dataset for power MOSFET prognostics developed at the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence is used. This paper carefully illustrates the analysis, extraction, and transformation stages required to obtain the data for the estimation of the degradation models. An additional contribution of this paper is to study scalable methods to perform such estimation. Instead of using typical approaches such as extended Kalman filters, particle filters, or relevance vector machines to perform the estimation, we propose to use much simpler techniques (such as least squares or horizontal average) to allow a scalable implementation in a Big Data (distributed and parallelized) platform. After applying our approach to the MOSFETs dataset, we have shown that the obtained results are competitive when compared with more complex techniques.

The following work has been done in this paper: 1) IEC TC 10 fault data and other 117 sets of fault data in China are preprocessed in order to reduce the influence on the diagnosis results causing by the edge data in the fuzzy area; 2) the SVM parameters and 11 features are encoded by a binary code technique; 3) a preferred DGA feature set for fault diagnosis of power transformers is selected by genetic algorithm (GA) and SVM, and; 4) IKH is utilized to optimize the parameters of SVM. Combining with cross-validation principle, a transformer fault diagnosis model based on IKH algorithm to optimize SVM is established. The fault diagnosis results based on the new fault sample show that the proposed DGA feature set to increase the accuracy by 26.78% and 10.83% over the DGA full data and IEC ratios. Moreover, the accuracy of IKHSVM is better than the GASVM, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and particle swarm optimization optimized support vector machine (PSOSVM), the accuracy rates are 85.71%, 75%, 64.29%, and 71.43%, which proves the validity of the proposed fault diagnosis model.

J	Liu, W; Chen, W				Liu, Wei; Chen, Wei			Recent Advancements in Empirical Wavelet Transform and Its Applications	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Empirical wavelet transform; machine health monitoring; seismic data analysis; signal and image processing; power system signals analysis; medical disease diagnosis	MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SEISMIC DATA; SIGNAL	Empirical wavelets transform (EWT) is a fully adaptive signal-analysis approach, which is similar to the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) but has a consolidated mathematical theory, and is appealing in designing automatic algorithm for a variety of signal processing tasks. EWT first estimates the frequency components presented in the given signal, then, computes the boundaries and extracts the oscillatory components based on the computed boundaries. Because of the excellent performance of the EWT in decomposing the nonlinear and non-stationary signals, it has been successfully applied into a number of problems. The last six years have seen the development of EWT. This paper presents a general overview of the recent advancements made in research on the EWT algorithm and its state-of-the-art applications in a wide range of areas, such as machine fault diagnosis, seismic data analysis, image processing, power system monitoring, and medical disease diagnosis, which aims at providing some comprehensive references for reader concerning with EWT. We place emphasis on the applications of using such signal-analysis algorithm throughout with illustrative examples. Finally, the potential avenues for the future trends and directions associated with EWT are discussed.

It is therefore obvious that companies want to eliminate unplanned downtime in the production process. In the wake of the still increasing demands in terms of productivity and safety requirements, cost reduction, the industry is forced to seek the optimum between economic requirements and an acceptable level of risk in terms of security. Modern factories equipped with computerized processes and extensive diagnostic tools often do not use all the information that is collected from the hardware level. It happens that some of the relationships between events are often overlooked or neglected. The article presents an approach to increasing machine reliability through predictive data analysis. The assumptions of the predictive and preventive maintenance methods are presented. The threats and possibilities offered by this methodology implemented in the production process are presented.

Providing effective agricultural machinery failure analysis for agricultural workers can save considerable time and cost. This paper addresses this issue by designing and producing a platform for data analysis of agricultural engineering machinery. Through the collection and analysis of agricultural engineering machinery floor data and with the help of the Internet and big data technology, physical modeling, charts, and other intuitive forms have been developed to provide information for personnel on the mechanical parts of agricultural engineering machinery, the cause of failures, and maintenance requirements. This novel agricultural engineering machinery management analysis platform currently has access to 100 million data points, with system access for capacity expansion, and provides fault detection and maintenance examples. It has already been applied in multiple farms across many of China's provinces.

J	Zhao, HM; Zheng, JJ; Xu, JJ; Deng, W				Zhao, Huimin; Zheng, Jianjie; Xu, Junjie; Deng, Wu			Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Principal Component Analysis and Broad Learning System	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Rotor system; fault diagnosis; principal component analysis (PCA); broad learning system (BLS); dimension reduction	REAL-GAS MIXTURE; ROTATING MACHINERY; OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSPORT; NANOPORES	Traditional feature extraction methods are used to extract the features of signal to construct the fault feature matrix, which exists the complex structure, higher correlation, and redundancy. This will increase the complex fault classification and seriously affect the accuracy and efficiency of fault identification. In order to solve these problems, a new fault diagnosis (PABSFD) method based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and the broad learning system (BLS) is proposed for rotor system in this paper. In the proposed PABSFD method, the PCA with revealing the signal essence is used to reduce the dimension of the constructed feature matrix and decrease the linear feature correlation between data and eliminate the redundant attributes in order to obtain the low-dimensional feature matrix with retaining the essential features for the classification model. Then, the BLS with low time complexity and high classification accuracy is regarded as a classification model to realize the fault identification; it can efficiently accomplish the fault classification of rotor system. Finally, the actual vibration data of rotor system are selected to test and verify the effectiveness of the PABSFD method.

J	Tang, HB; Yang, WX; Wang, ZC				Tang, Hongbin; Yang, Wenxian; Wang, Zichao			A Model-Based Method for Leakage Detection of Piston Pump Under Variable Load Condition	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Piston pump; leakage; liquid-solid coupling model; condition monitoring	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; HYDRAULIC PUMP; WAVELET PACKET; VALVE PLATE; DEMODULATION; TRANSFORM	Hydraulic systems have been widely used in construction machinery, aeronautics, astronautics, automobiles, shipping, and other fields. Piston pumps are power source and core component in the hydraulic system. The detection and assessment of leakage fault in piston pumps is challenging because: 1) piston pump is always subjected to varying loads and operates at variable speeds, and the conventional condition monitoring methods that rely on instantaneous behavior analysis can hardly give reliable prediction to the actual health state of the piston pump and 2) it is not easy to obtain the typical condition monitoring data that can reflect the change of the piston pump in dynamic behavior when it suffers different severity levels of faults under various loading conditions. In order to tackle these issues, a model-based method for leakage detection of piston pump under variable load condition was proposed in this paper. The liquid-solid coupling model of piston pump is developed and verified at first. Then, with the aid of the model, different severity levels of oil leakage faults are simulated. It is found that outlet pressure signals can better indicate the oil leakage of piston pumps in comparison to the casing vibration signals. "Sub-harmonics" will appear in the frequency spectra of outlet pressure signals in the presence of oil leakage fault. Finally, the dynamic responses of the piston pump under different loading and structural health conditions are investigated systematically. The results show that external load can significantly influence the dynamic responses of the piston pump and the gradients of the trend lines of total "sub-harmonic" energy of outlet pressure provide correct prediction to the presence and growth of the oil leakage fault. Based on the investigation results, a reliable oil leakage detection and assessment method is proposed.

Accurate SOH estimation can not only grasp the battery performance but also achieve a better balance between the safety and economic benefits for lithium-ion battery application system. Relaxation effect refers to the capacity regeneration phenomenon of lithium-ion batteries during long rest time. This paper mainly studies the impact of relaxation effect on the degradation law of lithium-ion batteries, and proposes a novel SOH estimation method based on the Wiener process. First, the life cycle of a lithium-ion battery is divided into three parts, i.e., the degradation process that eliminates the relaxation effect, the capacity regeneration process during the rest time, and the degradation process of the regenerated capacity. Next, the degradation model after eliminating the relaxation effect is established based on linear Wiener process, the capacity regenerated model is developed by the normal distribution, and the degradation model of regenerated capacity is established based on a nonlinear Wiener process. Then, for the degradation model based on nonlinear Wiener process, a two-step maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method for prior parameters is proposed, and the random variables representing the personality features are updated online under the Bayesian framework. For the capacity regenerated model, a parameter estimation method based on MLE is proposed. In addition, a one-step and a multi-step SOH prediction method based on piecewise modeling are developed.

The state space model by synthesizing the circulating current and the output current is first established. Recurring to the Kalman filtering theory, the estimation on circulating and output current is realized, the residual is achieved by using the innovation which involved the predicted and measured current. Based on the obtained residual, the residual evaluation function and its threshold are constructed. Then, the fault can be detected according to the proposed fault detection strategy. Once the fault is detected, the fault localization unit is triggered and the residual data is adopted as data set. By employing the optimized SVM with genetic algorithm, the concurrent and intermittent fault localization of MMC can be accomplished. Finally, an 11-level MMC simulation systems with concurrent fault and intermittent fault are set up in MATLAB/Simulink, and the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection and localization method is verified.

J	Huang, HS; Fan, QS; Wei, JN; Huang, D				Huang, Haisong; Fan, Qingsong; Wei, Jianan; Huang, Dong			An intelligent fault identification method of rolling bearings based on SVM optimized by improved GWO	SYSTEMS SCIENCE & CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Improved grey wolf optimization algorithm; support vector machine; parameter optimization; bearing fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER; WAVELET PACKET; EXPERT-SYSTEM; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY; PSO	To improve the accuracy and the recognition efficiency of a bearing fault diagnosis, a fault diagnosis method based upon the improved grey wolf optimization (IGWO) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed in the following manners. First, the data are pre-processed by using the set ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), Shannon wavelet packet entropy (SWPE), and principal component analysis (PCA). Next, the idea of updating the host bird nest by the cuckoo search (CS) optimization algorithm is introduced into the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to obtain the IGWO algorithm. Then, the SVM is optimized by the IGWO algorithm to obtain optimal parameters for a new diagnostic model. This model improves the problem where the algorithm easily to falls into a local optimum. The learning ability and the generalization ability of the SVM are also enhanced. Finally, the effectiveness of the optimization model is tested by two different bearing data sets. The results show that compared to the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and GWO algorithm optimization, the IGWO algorithm can be more accurate and efficient when diagnosing bearings.

J	Liang, D; Guo, HS; Zheng, T				Liang, Dong; Guo, Huashan; Zheng, Tao			Real-Time Impedance Estimation for Power Line Communication	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Power line communication; smart grid; impedance tracking		The real-time broadband properties of impedance in power line communication (PLC) systems are one of the essential characteristics of future smart grids, which would enable the smart online systems to implement fault detection/ forecast or the PLC channel health monitoring in the grid. In the current paper, a novel technique was proposed to track impedance only by the channel frequency response (CFR). The CFR can be treated as a known quantity and is normally calculated by the channel estimation algorithms in PLC devices for communication purposes. The relationship between CFR and impedance behavior was first studied in detail, and it was found that the variations in certain key factors, such as the frequency characteristics and the values of peak-valley difference, of the CFR curves could be used to the track real-time impedance. Then, the proposed impedance estimation algorithm harnessed the variational mode decomposition (VMD) as a feature extraction method to obtain useful frequency properties. The machine learning (ML)-based impedance model was also synthesized in the proposed approach. The performance of the proposed impedance tracking method was examined under two different scenarios, and the obtained simulation results demonstrated the efficiencies of the formulated algorithms.

In this paper, we proposed a new data-driven method called frozen convolution and activated memory network (FCAMN) for bearing remaining useful life (RUL) estimation based on the deep neural network. The proposed method is composed of two parts: the multi-scale convolutional neural network is carried out to pre-train the raw data to directly obtain the global and local features, and the second step is accomplished by the convolutional-memory neural network, which enables to connect the convolutional layer with the long-short-time-memory layer together to predict the continuous bearing RUL. Compared with the traditional networks, the proposed network can additionally extract both the global and local information on the vertical feature axis and the associated context information on the horizontal time axis. The experiments are conducted to prove that the proposed method requires fewer training samples and outperforms other methods in RUL estimation.

J	Pan, HY; Zheng, JD; Liu, QY				Pan, Haiyang; Zheng, Jinde; Liu, Qingyun			A Novel Roller Bearing Condition Monitoring Method Based on RHLCD and FVPMCD	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Rational Hermite interpolation-local characteristic-scale decomposition; fusion variable predictive model-based class discriminate method; roller bearing; condition monitoring	TIME-SCALE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS APPROACH; MODE DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM	Effective condition monitoring provides some benefits such as improving safety and reliability. Roller bearing is the key component of rotating machinery, and a novel roller bearing condition monitoring method based on rational Hermite interpolation-local characteristic-scale decomposition (RHLCD) and fusion variable predictive model-based class discriminate method (FVPMCD) is proposed in this paper. RHLCD can adaptively decompose any complex signal into a sum of rational intrinsic scale components (RISCs), whose instantaneous frequency has physical meaning. In addition, targeting the limitation of variable predictive model-based class discriminate method (VPMCD), FVPMCD is presented. First, four kinds of common models are used to recognize a sample. Then, the recognition results of each model are satisfied, and the recognition probability of each state is calculated. Finally, the largest recognition probability of the state is chosen to recognize categories.

Software-defined networking (SDN) technology breaks the tight coupling between the control plane and the data plane in the traditional network architecture, making the controllability, security, and economy of network resources into a reality. As one of the important actualization methods of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), combined with SDN architecture will have great potential in areas, such as network resource management, route planning, traffic scheduling, fault diagnosis, and network security. This paper presents the network applications combined with SDN concepts based on ML from two perspectives, namely the perspective of ML algorithms and SDN network applications. From the perspective of ML algorithms, this paper focuses on the applications of classical ML algorithms in SDN-based networks, after a characteristic analysis of algorithms. From the other perspective, after classifying the existing network applications based on the SDN architecture, the related ML solutions are introduced. Finally, the future development of the ML algorithms and SDN concepts is discussed and analyzed. This paper occupies the intersection of the AI, big data, computer networking, and other disciplines; the AI itself is a new and complex interdisciplinary field, which causes the researchers in this field to often have different professional backgrounds and, sometimes, divergent research purposes. This paper is necessary and helpful for researchers from different fields to accurately master the key issues.

With the rapid development of computer science and machine learning technologies, computer-aid cancer prediction has achieved increasingly progress. DNA methylation, as an important epigenetic modification, plays a vital role in the formation and progression of cancer, and therefore can be used as a feature for cancer identification. In this study, we introduce a convolutional neural network based multi-model ensemble method for cancer prediction using DNA methylation data. We first choose five basic machine learning methods as the first stage classifiers and conduct prediction individually. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the high-level features among the classifiers and gives a credible prediction result. Experimental results on three DNA methylation datasets of Lung Adenocarcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma show the proposed ensemble method can uncover the intricate relationship among the classifiers automatically and achieve better performances.

Echo state network (ESN) is a novel type of RNN with an interconnected reservoir to model temporal dynamics of complex sequential information. In this paper, a novel ESN structure is developed and employed to conduct fault prognosis. Fault prognosis is vital in predictive maintenance, which is a prevalent research area that mainly concentrates on predicting the remaining useful life of a machine and reducing the machine's downtime. Attention model is integrated to a typical ESN and thus different importance levels of different input elements can be adaptively treated. To further enhance the generalization of the prediction model, genetic algorithm is applied to adaptively optimize the parameters of the attention based ESN. The proposed prognostic approach is verified on the NASA's turbofan benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that the attention-based ESN can not only achieve superior prediction accuracy but also obtain substantial improvement on stability.

The numerous studies have focused on faulty parts using established fault diagnosis models centered on faulty parts and developed measures for controlling machine tool reliability from the parts' perspective. However, the internal parts of machine tools are strongly coupled, and when one part or assembly begins operating abnormally, it can easily initiate the abnormal operation of other parts or the entire assembly, which can lead to failures. Thus, a fault diagnosis method that considers only individual faulty parts ignores the problem of fault propagation between parts, which may lead to failure to locate the root cause. To address this problem, this paper proposes a cascading fault analysis and control strategy based on meta action. First, the functional components are decomposed into meta actions using the "function-motion-action" principle. Second, the directed edges and hierarchical digraph of meta action fault propagation are obtained. Third, the PageRank algorithm is used to calculate the fault propagation impact degree of each directed edge, and the key paths of meta action fault propagation are extracted based on the hierarchical digraph and the impact degree. Finally, the fault tree analysis method is applied to analyze the meta action on key paths, and feasible machine control measures are developed.

In some cases, plenty of labeled data are unavailable, which may lead to low diagnosis accuracy. To deal with this problem, a deep transfer nonnegativity-constraint sparse autoencoder (DTNSAE) is proposed, which takes advantage of deep learning and transfer learning. First, a novel NSAE is adopted to enhance sparsity. Then, a base deep NSAE (DNSAE) is established to automatically capture the latent features from raw vibration signals. Next, a parameter transfer learning strategy is used to build the DTNSAE to tackle the diagnosis problems with a few labeled data. Finally, two datasets from different domains are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The testing results suggest that the proposed method is able to remove manual feature extraction and is more effective than the existing intelligent methods when only a few labeled data are available.

J	Liu, JW; Li, Q; Yang, HQ; Han, Y; Jiang, SN; Chen, WR				Liu, Jiawei; Li, Qi; Yang, Hanqing; Han, Ying; Jiang, Shuna; Chen, Weirong			Sequence Fault Diagnosis for PEMFC Water Management Subsystem Using Deep Learning With t-SNE	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						PEMFC systems; bidirectional long short-term memory network; t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding; multivariate time series; sequence fault diagnosis	FUEL-CELL; STRATEGY; IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; MACHINE	For solving the problem of sequence failure diagnosis of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) water management subsystem, this paper proposes a PEMFC failure diagnosis method of time series based on the bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). This approach adopts the normalization strategy to eliminate the influence caused by dimensional differences of different parameters. The t-SNE is presented to decrease the dimensionality of normalized data to the estimate of intrinsic dimensionality to extract key characteristic variables. The width of the diagnostic window is set to transform the original single moment diagnosis problem into the fault diagnosis problem of multi-variable time series, which is more consistent with the time scale and physical evolution law of the PEMFC water management fault generation. The 672 sets of training sets and 448 sets of test sets are learned and tested by the BiLSTM. The experimental results show that the BiLSTM-tSNE method can realize the sequence fault diagnosis of the PEMFC water management subsystem with 96.88% diagnostic accuracy and 24 s of operation time. Compared with the conventional approach of multi-class support vector machine algorithm, the training accuracy and the testing accuracy of the proposed method are improved by 15% and 16.88%, respectively. The operation time of the presented approach is only about 1/28 of the multi-class support vector machine algorithm.

J	Yan, SF; Ma, B; Zheng, CS; Chen, JH				Yan, Shufa; Ma, Biao; Zheng, Changsong; Chen, Jianhua			An Optimal Lubrication Oil Replacement Method Based on Selected Oil Field Data	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Lubricating oil; replacement; material wear and system degradation; system degradation model; health index; prognostics; oil field data	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; USEFUL LIFE PREDICTION; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; PROGNOSTICS; SYSTEMS; FUSION	The regular replacement of lubricating oil plays a key role in improving machine reliability and reducing unexpected failures of an oil lubricated system. This paper proposes a condition-based maintenance problem with selected oil field data to determine the optimal time of the lubricating oil replacement. The selected oil field data contain health information about the lubricating oil, so the degradation state of the oil can be predicted and the future health condition can be evaluated. The proposed lubricating oil replacement problem is modeled with the evaluated oil health condition in a Markov decision process framework and then, a method for constructing a health index for the lubricating oil is proposed based on information theory to fuse the multiple oil field data and build a degradation progression prediction model. Finally, the proposed method for condition-based lubricating oil replacement is illustrated in a practical case study. The possible applications of an optimal policy for lubricating oil replacement are much wider.

First, the Monte Carlo method is applied to extracting the time domain response signal of the circuit under test as sample data. Then, with SAE used to extract essential features of data, the SAE is employed to extract features of sample data. Meanwhile, multi-classification relevant vector machine (RVM) is involved for fault diagnosis of the acquired features. As the structure of the hidden layer in SAE and the learning rate could exert a significant effect on the feature extraction performance, in this paper, the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to optimize the above parameters. As revealed by the experimental results, the improved SAE method is effective in the extraction of the essential characteristics of the incipient faults for the IGBT drive circuit. Further with this, the incipient fault multi-classification RVM of the IGBT drive circuit is capable of achieving 100% diagnostic accuracy.

The KSLPP feature extraction ability is firstly used to construct the principal component feature set from the fault sample set. Then, the advantage of ELM on solving the complicated nonlinearity problem is applied to build the fault identification model from the principal component feature. Finally, the sample sets of soft fault diagnosis for the analog circuit are respectively established by waveform parameter and wavelet packet transform to conduct the diagnostic test for the built model. The simulation of Elliptic Filter shows that, based on the fault sample set gotten by waveform parameter, the total correct rate of the integrated method is 98.2%; on the basis of the fault sample set built by wavelet packet transform, the total correct rate is 100%. The feasibility and effectiveness of this method are also validated.

In addition, to address the lack of objectivity of correlation variables in the dynamic uncertainty causal graph, the combination weighting method is used to reassign correlation variables. The sub-DUCGs of gear, bearing, shaft, and box are established and connected with a logic gate and conditional connection variables. The DUCG is used to diagnose the faults in the gearbox, and the effectiveness and rationality of the method are verified by comparing the probabilities of the maximum pre-selected events before and after the improvement. Because the combination weighting method only makes moderate modifications for different weights, the limitations of the diagnosis accuracy and the calculation of variable weights are discussed by choosing faults with different numbers of weights.

J	Zhang, L; Hu, NQ				Zhang, Lun; Hu, Niaoqing			Time Domain Synchronous Moving Average and its Application to Gear Fault Detection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Signal processing; periodic signal detection; fault detection; gearbox	PERIODIC SIGNALS; ALGORITHM; VIBRATION	Periodic signal detection methods are widely used in applications including human detection and machinery fault diagnosis. Averaging is one of the most powerful filtering techniques for periodic signals extraction. Time domain synchronous average (TSA) and moving average (MA) are the most commonly used average techniques in engineering. TSA has the advantage at periodic signal detection by depressing noises and asynchronous signal components. MA is effective to remove noises while keeping signal periodicity. However, the TSA signal is not periodic as a measurement signal, and signal spectrum resolution degrades seriously; meanwhile, the MA filters out high-frequency signal components of interests. Detection of periodic signal among noises while keeping signal periodicity and high-frequency signal components become a challenge. To address this problem, time-synchronous moving average (TSMA) method is proposed as an improvement on TSA inspired by MA in this paper. Influences of signal overlap and properties of TSMA are investigated. Furthermore, a practical average times optimization method is given for reference. The correctness of theoretical deviations and effectiveness of the proposed method on periodic signal detection are validated using numerical simulations. At last, the proposed method is validated by an application on fault detection of the gearbox.

Predicting failures before their occurrence by detecting anomalies in system metrics is a viable solution to enable failure preventing or mitigating actions. The most promising approaches for predicting failures exploit statistical analysis or machine learning to reveal anomalies and their correlation with possible failures. Statistical analysis approaches result in far too many false positives, which severely hinder their practical applicability, while accurate machine learning approaches need extensive training with seeded faults, which is often impossible in operative cloud systems. In this paper, we propose EmBeD, Energy-Based anomaly Detection in the cloud, an approach to detect anomalies at runtime based on the free energy of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model. The free energy is a stochastic function that can be used to efficiently score anomalies for detecting outliers. EmBeD analyzes the system behavior from raw metric data, does not require extensive training with seeded faults, and classifies the relation of anomalous behaviors with future failures with very few false positives. The experimental results presented in this paper confirm that EmBeD can precisely predict failure-prone behavior without training with seeded faults, thus overcoming the main limitations of current approaches.

The distant metastasis of tumors is the most common cause of treatment failure. Precisely predicting the likelihood that a patient develops distant metastatic risk will help identify patients who can further intervene, such as conventional adjuvant chemotherapy or experimental drugs. Methods: Current molecular biology techniques enable the whole genome screening of differentially expressed genes, and rapid development of a large number of bioinformatics methods to improve prognosis. Results: The genes associated with metastasis do not necessarily play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, but rather reflect the activation of specific signal transduction pathways associated with enhanced migration and invasiveness. Conclusion: In this study, we discovered several genes related to lung cancer resistance and established a risk model to predict high-risk patients.

Texture Classification of Machined Surfaces Using Image Processing and Machine Learning Techniques	FME TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Surface texture; Grey level co-occurrence matrix; Feature extraction; Classification; Ten-fold cross validation	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROUGHNESS; OPTIMIZATION; FEATURES	The identification of surface texture images from machining surfaces using image processing techniques has been a prominent research area in the recent decades. The aim of this paper is to identify various machined surface texture images using machine learning techniques. Charge coupled device is used to capture images of machined components. Based on captured images, twelve statistical features are extracted and feature vector is formed. Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix is used to extract statistical features from the machined surface images. Four Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and J48 were utilized to characterize machined surfaces. Training and Ten fold cross validation process is utilized for identification of machined component images. It is found that Artificial Neural Network and Random forest give 100 % training accuracy and 99% cross validation accuracy. Results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of proposed methodology, which is useful for identifying texture images.

J	Lu, L; He, YG; Wang, T; Shi, TC; Li, B				Lu, Li; He, Yigang; Wang, Tao; Shi, Tiancheng; Li, Bing			Self-Powered Wireless Sensor for Fault Diagnosis of Wind Turbine Planetary Gearbox	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Wind turbine; PGB; fault diagnosis; self-powered wireless sensor; SDAE; LSSVM; QPSO	RFID SENSOR; NETWORK; GENERATOR	This paper proposes a wind turbine planetary gearbox (PGB) fault diagnosis method based on a self-powered wireless sensor. The proposed wireless sensor, which consists of a piezoelectric energy harvester, a power management circuit, a microcontroller unit (MCU), a radio-frequency (RF) module, and an accelerometer, can acquire the vibration signals of wind turbine PGB by the accelerometer. The piezoelectric energy harvester utilizing vibration environment is optimized as a power supply for the proposed wireless sensor, including the MCU, RF module, and accelerometer. An ac-dc converter combined with a low-dropout voltage regulator is developed to provide stable dc voltage for the proposed wireless sensor. Stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) shows excellent performance in learning robust features from the noised signal. Thus, in this paper, the SDAE method is adopted to learn robust and distinguishable features from measured signals. Then, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is employed to classify features extracted by the SDAE. Both the SDAE and LSSVM are optimized by quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO). The experimental results show that the presented power supply can generate 3.3-V dc voltage, which ensures regular operation of the rest of the wireless sensor. The proposed wireless sensor can achieve a reliable communication distance of 40.8 m in the test environment. Furthermore, the SDAE approach and LSSVM show excellent performance in feature extraction and fault diagnosis, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective in terms of fault diagnosis for the wind turbine PGB.

Neural Network-Based Diagnostic Tool for Detecting Stator Inter-Turn Faults in Line Start Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Electric motors; fault currents; fault detection; finite element analysis	INDUCTION MACHINES; WINDING FAULTS; LOCATION; DEMAGNETIZATION; SIMULATION; SEVERITY; SCHEME; MODEL; PMSM	Three-phase line-start permanent magnet synchronous motors are considered among the most promising types of motors in industrial applications. However, these motors experience several faults, which may cause significant financial losses. This paper proposed a feed-forward neural network-based diagnostic tool for accurate and fast detection of the location and severity of stator inter-turn faults. The input to the neural network is a group of representative statistical and frequency-based features extracted from the steady-state three-phase stator current signals. The current signals with different numbers of shorted turns and loading conditions are captured using the developed finite element JMAG(TM) model for interior mount LSPMSM. In addition, an experimental set-up was built to validate the finite element model and the proposed diagnostics tool. The simulation and experimental test results showed an overall accuracy of 93.125% in detecting the location and the size of inter-turn, whereas, the accuracy in detecting the location of the fault is 100%.

In order to improve the accuracy of fault detection, a novel method based on the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) is proposed. First, the features of the mechanical vibration signals are used to construct the feature space of the equipment. The DPMM modeling method is then applied to self-learn the probabilistic mixture model of the feature space. The normal working condition model is used as the benchmark model. The early fault detection is realized by using a precise difference measurement method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence to calculate the difference between the real-time model and the benchmark model accurately, and by comparing the calculation result with a self-learned alarm threshold. The effectiveness and the adaptability of this novel early fault detection method are verified by comparing it to the single feature-based anomaly detection method and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based early fault detection method.

First, using permutation entropy of different scales (MPE) to extract fault features of bearings, a group of fault feature vectors composed of permutation entropy is obtained. Then, the fault feature vectors are classified by the MELM. However, with the increase of the number of hidden layers, the random input weight and bias will also increase, which will lead to the increase of the randomness of the MELM and affect the accuracy of fault diagnosis. Therefore, this paper uses the NALO to optimize the MELM. For the NALO, opposite populations are added to the initial population to improve its global search ability. When the ant lion updates its location, the influence of pheromones left by other ants with a certain sensing distance is taken into account to prevent the ant lion from falling into the local optimal and increased the robustness. Finally, the NALO-MELM and other bearing fault diagnosis methods are applied to the bearing fault experiment of Western Reserve University to test the performance and generalization of the proposed method.

The induction motors constitute the major portion of motors in domestic and industrial applications. These motors experience different types of failures and faults associated with insulation, bearing, stator, rotor, and eccentricity. As a matter of fact, these faults may subsequently enhance the probability of failures unless proper introspection is not accomplished. In order to reduce the failure time and operating cost, early detection is indispensable which necessitates condition-based approach on contrary to scheduled maintenance. The condition monitoring is a strong candidate to address the diagnosis of machinery failure problems and unreliability. In this context, a comprehensive analysis is reported in the literature with a focus on different methodologies being addressed for such objective. Utmost efforts are made to comprehensively analyze in the reported literature in a sequential manner citing the advantage and limitations in this paper. The authors hopefully described and illustrated the associated problems with possible mitigation in the context of condition monitoring which would be immensely helpful for future researchers working in these aspects and the future roadmap would be clearly reflected.

J	Que, ZJ; Xu, ZG				Que, Zijun; Xu, Zhengguo			A Data-Driven Health Prognostics Approach for Steam Turbines Based on Xgboost and DTW	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Dynamic time warping; extreme gradient boosting; remaining useful life prediction; steam turbine	MODEL; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN	A steam turbine is one of the critical components in a power generation system whose failure may result in unexpected consequences, even catastrophic losses. Thus, the reliability of steam turbines needs to be guaranteed all the time, which requires that its health state can be monitored and predicted effectively. Due to various failure modes, it is difficult to build physics-of-failure models used for health prognostics for steam turbines. In this paper, a data-driven integrated framework for health prognostics for steam turbines, which is based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and dynamic time warping (DTW), is proposed. The proposed framework includes two modules: anomaly detection and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The anomalies refer to the overall abnormal operation of steam turbines. In the process of anomaly detection, the temporal variables which can represent the operating conditions of the considered steam turbine are selected first. Appropriately selected temporal variables can reduce the input dimension and will improve real-time performance. Then, XGBoost is used to detect anomalies based on learning historical data. In the process of RUL prediction, a similarity-based algorithm with DTW is used to gain the RUL by contrasting the measured temporal variables with those in the historical cases. The similarity-based algorithm can predict the RUL without establishing a degradation path model, which can avoid the difficulties in parameter estimation for the degradation model and model generalization. The proposed framework is validated by real case studies from an industrial steam turbine. The results show that the proposed approach can detect the anomalies successfully and predict the RUL effectively.

One solution to enforce reliability in automotive electronics is the use of Machine Learning (ML). One or more physical parameters are being monitored, and algorithms are used to illustrate the health state and predict remaining useful life based on the current and past health information. Piezo-resistive stress sensors are employed to measure the internal stresses of electronic packages, an Acquisition Unit (AU) to read out sensor data and a Raspberry Pi as PHM server to perform evaluation. Accelerated tests in air thermal chamber are performed to get time series data of the stress sensor signals, with which we can know better about how delamination develops inside the package. In this study stress measurements are performed in several electronic packages during the delamination. The delamination is detected by the stress sensor due to the continuous change of the stiffness and the local boundary conditions causing the stresses to change. Moreover, the stress change in multiple cells can give more information regarding the delamination such as the location and its state. Data preprocessing methods to remove outliers and filter raw measurement results, and feature extraction methods to capture only meaningful information by reducing the data are chosen and applied to raw data. A logical assumption is made regarding the data behavior and delamination state, based on data analytics and with Scanning Acoustic Microscope (SAM) images confirmed the delaminated area. FEM simulation are used to provide a qualitatively physical explanation of the stress change due to the delamination. A prognostic model using neural network is trained to estimate the degradation grade. Back Propagation Neural Networks are chosen to provide a fast and quick training for the mechanical stress data.

The conventional method to estimate the RUL of batteries based on offline laboratory experiment data may give rise to a considerable amount of error by ignoring the uncertainties occurred in random charge-discharge cycles under operation. To overcome this problem, an online prognostic method based on a gamma process model was presented, and verified by using the experimental data from a set of four batteries test with random discharge recorded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In addition, the probability density function (PDF) and the reliability curve of the batteries were established along with the 0.95 confidence interval to reveal the statistical profile of predicted RULs. Compared to the conventional RUL prediction methods, the proposed method merely requires a small quantity of training data to achieve accurate RUL prediction for randomized usage batteries on EVs.
