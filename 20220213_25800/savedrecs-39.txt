To achieve RUL estimation for individual equipment, we present a degradation data-driven RUL estimation approach under the collaboration between Bayesian updating and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Firstly, we utilize an exponential-like degradation model to describe equipment degradation process and update stochastic parameters in the model via Bayesian approach. Based on the Bayesian updating results, both probability distribution of the RUL and its point estimation can be derived. Secondly, based on the monitored degradation data to date, we give a parameter estimation approach for non-stochastic parameters in the degradation model and prove that the obtained estimation is unique and optimal in each iteration. Finally, a numerical example and a practical case study for global positioning system (GPS) receiver are provided to show that the presented approach can model degradation process and achieve RUL estimation effectively and generate better results than a previously reported approach in literature.

Motor square current signature analysis for induction motor rotor diagnosis	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Induction motor; Diagnosis; Fault detection; Stator currents; Motor square current signature analysis; MCSA; MSCSA	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BROKEN BARS; STATOR; ECCENTRICITY; SYSTEM	Induction machines play an important role in today's industry. Thus, preventive maintenance combined with fault diagnosis techniques have become an essential issue. One of the most used techniques for the diagnosis of faults in the induction machine is motor current signature analysis (MCSA). This approach presents some limitations for induction motor rotor diagnosis, particularly for small faults. In this paper, a new motor square current signature analysis (MSCSA) fault diagnosis methodology is presented. The proposed technique is based on three main steps: first, the induction motor current is measured; secondly, the square of the current is computed; and finally a frequency analysis of the square current is performed. This technique allows more information to be obtained from a motor with a rotor fault than the classical MCSA approach. Simulation and experimental results are presented in order to confirm the theoretical assumptions. This methodology has also been tested for the identification of two distinct faults (broken bars and rotor eccentricity). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A review on empirical mode decomposition in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review						Empirical mode decomposition; Intrinsic mode function; Fault diagnosis; Rotating machinery	HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; COMPOSITE WINGBOX STRUCTURES; VIBRATION SIGNAL ANALYSIS; WIGNER-VILLE DISTRIBUTION; DAMAGE DETECTION; EMD METHOD; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; DYNAMIC-RESPONSE; ORDER TRACKING	Rotating machinery covers a broad range of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in industrial applications. It generally operates under tough working environment and is therefore subject to faults, which could be detected and diagnosed by using signal processing techniques. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is one of the most powerful signal processing techniques and has been extensively studied and widely applied in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Numerous publications on the use of EMD for fault diagnosis have appeared in academic journals, conference proceedings and technical reports. This paper attempts to survey and summarize the recent research and development of EMD in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, providing comprehensive references for researchers concerning with this topic and helping them identify further research topics. First, the EMD method is briefly introduced, the usefulness of the method is illustrated and the problems and the corresponding solutions are listed. Then, recent applications of EMD to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery are summarized in terms of the key components, such as rolling element bearings, gears and rotors. Finally, the outstanding open problems of EMD in fault diagnosis are discussed and potential future research directions are identified. It is expected that this review will serve as an introduction of EMD for those new to the concepts, as well as a summary of the current frontiers of its applications to fault diagnosis for experienced researchers.

J	Xu, HB; Chen, GH				Xu, Hongbo; Chen, Guohua			An intelligent fault identification method of rolling bearings based on LSSVM optimized by improved PSO	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						LSSVM; IPSO; IMF; Energy entropy index; Fault identification	VECTOR MACHINE LSSVM; VIBRATIONS; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	This paper presents an intelligent fault identification method of rolling bearings based on least squares support vector machine optimized by improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO-LSSVM). The method adopts a modified PSO algorithm to optimize the parameters of LSSVM, and then the optimized model could be established to identify the different fault patterns of rolling bearings. Firstly, original fault vibration signals are decomposed into some stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and the energy feature indexes extraction based on IMF energy entropy is analyzed in detail. Secondly, the extracted energy indexes serve as the fault feature vectors to be input to the IPSO-LSSVM classifier for identifying different fault patterns. Finally, a case study on rolling bearing fault identification demonstrates that the method can effectively enhance identification accuracy and convergence rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses the problem of estimating the RUL from the observed degradation data. A Wiener-process-based degradation model with a recursive filter algorithm is developed to achieve the aim. A novel contribution made in this paper is the use of both a recursive filter to update the drift coefficient in the Wiener process and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to update all other parameters. Both updating are done at the time that a new piece of degradation data becomes available. This makes the model depend on the observed degradation data history, which the conventional Wiener-process-based models did not consider. Another contribution is to take into account the distribution in the drift coefficient when updating, rather than using a point estimate as an approximation. An exact RUL distribution considering the distribution of the drift coefficient is obtained based on the concept of the first hitting time. A practical case study for gyros in an inertial navigation system is provided to substantiate the superiority of the proposed model compared with competing models reported in the literature. The results show that our developed model can provide better RUL estimation accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, WY; Wang, ZF; Han, JG; Wang, GF				Liu Wenyi; Wang Zhenfeng; Han Jiguang; Wang Guangfeng			Wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on diagonal spectrum and clustering binary tree SVM	RENEWABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Wind turbine; Fault diagnosis; Diagonal spectrum; Support vector machines (SVM); Rotating machinery	MORLET WAVELET; CLASSIFICATION; TERMS	Renewable energy sources like wind energy are copiously available without ally limitation. Reliability of wind turbine is critical to extract maximum amount of energy from the wind. The vibration signals in wind turbine's rotation parts are of universal non-Gasussian and nonstationarity and the fault samples are usually very limited. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposed a wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on diagonal spectrum and clustering binary tree Support Vector Machines (SVM). Firstly, the diagonal spectrum is calculated from vibration rotating machine as the input feature vector. Secondly, self-organizing feature map neural network is introduced to cluster the fault feature samples and construct a cluster binary tree. Then the multiple fault classifiers are designed to train and test samples. The wind turbine gear-box fault experiment results proved that this method can effectively extract features from nonstationary signals, and can obtain excellent results despite of less training samples.

J	Canete, L				Canete, L.			Bio-inspired Sensory Systems in Automata for Hazardous Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						attention level; model; performance; emulation; automata		Every automaton in dynamic and complex environments requires sensory systems with an appropriate level of attention on the hazardous environment. This property in any efficient automaton is analogous to that observed in animal sensory systems. In this context, it is noted that to ensure its viability, the sensory systems of animals must maintain a continuous state of alertness or attention to the environment. However, the state consumes energy so it is impossible to keep a constant level over time. In this regard, biologists have designed models for explaining the variation in the level of surveillance in two vital activities of animals: Work and Rest. In an alternating pattern between Work and Rest, the Attention Level V(t) declines and increases as the animal works and rests respectively along the time. For each of the two states, there is one relation: dV/dt = -alpha * V while working and dV/dt = beta*(1-V) while resting. In this model alpha is the loss rate of surveillance that depends on the difficulty of the work and beta is the recovery rate which depends on the quality of rest. In the case of automata, this phenomenon is analogous to that observed in the Animal Kingdom. Even if the automatic machines have relief structures to monitor their environments, they always require that its sensory system recovers the alertness after being hit by the inexorable entropy. If the task is hard (alpha is large), the Attention Level decreases rapidly. Once the level has dropped below a threshold of tolerance, it must be recovered. If rest is poor, the automaton will take a lot of time to achieve the desired level. Obviously, machines do not rest, but in analogous terms, this phenomenon is emulated in the way of maintenance activities. Parameter beta represents the quality of these maintenances. This model has been tested with computer simulations to study the performance of automatic machines in hostile environments. After tests, it was possible to quantify alpha and beta for each kind of task-environment and each kind of maintenance. The bio-inspired model showed to have explicative and predictive applications to the conquest of hostile scenarios by means of automata. Indeed it is an interesting conceptual tool for increasing the performance of machines.

Early Classification of Bearing Faults Using Morphological Operators and Fuzzy Inference	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault detection; fuzzy systems; morphology; multiple signal classification; signal processing algorithms	DIAGNOSIS	Bearing faults of rotating machinery are observed as impulses in the vibration signal, but it is mostly immersed in noise. In order to effectively remove this noise and detect the impulses, a novel technique with morphological operators and fuzzy inference is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the morphological operators lies with the correct selection of structuring elements (SEs). This paper also proposes a new algorithm for this SE selection based on kurtosis, thereby making the analysis free of empirical methods. When analyzed with three different sets of faults, the results show that this method is effective and robust in bringing out the impulses. With fuzzy inference being coupled to this new technique, it makes the algorithm to be able to detect early faults also.	[Raj, A.

The objective of the study was to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of cartilage, C2M, and synovial, C3M, turnover biomarkers in AS. Serum samples were retrieved from patients suffering from AS (n = 103), RA (n = 47) and healthy controls (n = 56). AS progressors were defined as having new vertebral syndesmophytes or more that 3 unit change in mSASSS over a two-year period. Type II collagen degradation markers in serum were measured by the C2M ELISA, and type III collagen degradation by the C3M ELISA. Logistic regression and dichotomized decision tree were used to analyze the prognostic value of the markers individually or in combination. Both C2M and C3M levels were significantly higher in RA patients than in healthy controls (p<0.0001). Diagnostic utility was analyzed by ROC and areas under the curve (AUCs) were 72% and 89% for C2M and C3M, respectively. Both C2M and C3M, were significantly higher in serum samples from AS patient than from healthy controls (p<0.0001). The AUCs of C2M and C3M, respectively, were 70% and 81% for AS. A combination of C2M and C3M, dichotomized according to best cut-offs for individual markers, could correctly identify 80% of the progressors and 61% of the non-progressors. The present study is the first to show that specific biomarkers of cartilage and connective tissue degradation facilitate both diagnosis and prediction of progression of RA and AS.

J	Guo, W; Tse, PW				Guo, Wei; Tse, Peter W.			A novel signal compression method based on optimal ensemble empirical mode decomposition for bearing vibration signals	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							NEAR-LOSSLESS COMPRESSION; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SELECTION; FILTER	Today, remote machine condition monitoring is popular due to the continuous advancement in wireless communication. Bearing is the most frequently and easily failed component in many rotating machines. To accurately identify the type of bearing fault, large amounts of vibration data need to be collected. However, the volume of transmitted data cannot be too high because the bandwidth of wireless communication is limited. To solve this problem, the data are usually compressed before transmitting to a remote maintenance center. This paper proposes a novel signal compression method that can substantially reduce the amount of data that need to be transmitted without sacrificing the accuracy of fault identification. The proposed signal compression method is based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), which is an effective method for adaptively decomposing the vibration signal into different bands of signal components, termed intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). An optimization method was designed to automatically select appropriate EEMD parameters for the analyzed signal, and in particular to select the appropriate level of the added white noise in the EEMD method. An index termed the relative root-mean-square error was used to evaluate the decomposition performances under different noise levels to find the optimal level. After applying the optimal EEMD method to a vibration signal, the IMF relating to the bearing fault can be extracted from the original vibration signal. Compressing this signal component obtains a much smaller proportion of data samples to be retained for transmission and further reconstruction. The proposed compression method were also compared with the popular wavelet compression method. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimization of EEMD parameters can automatically find appropriate EEMD parameters for the analyzed signals, and the IMF-based compression method provides a higher compression ratio, while retaining the bearing defect characteristics in the transmitted signals to ensure accurate bearing fault diagnosis.

Nuclear Legumain Activity in Colorectal Cancer	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CYSTEINE PROTEINASE-INHIBITOR; CATHEPSIN-L; MAMMALIAN LEGUMAIN; CYSTATIN-M/E; ENDOPEPTIDASE; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; DEGRADATION	The cysteine protease legumain is involved in several biological and pathological processes, and the protease has been found over-expressed and associated with an invasive and metastatic phenotype in a number of solid tumors. Consequently, legumain has been proposed as a prognostic marker for certain cancers, and a potential therapeutic target. Nevertheless, details on how legumain advances malignant progression along with regulation of its proteolytic activity are unclear. In the present work, legumain expression was examined in colorectal cancer cell lines. Substantial differences in amounts of pro- and active legumain forms, along with distinct intracellular distribution patterns, were observed in HCT116 and SW620 cells and corresponding subcutaneous xenografts. Legumain is thought to be located and processed towards its active form primarily in the endo-lysosomes; however, the subcellular distribution remains largely unexplored. By analyzing subcellular fractions, a proteolytically active form of legumain was found in the nucleus of both cell lines, in addition to the canonical endo-lysosomal residency. In situ analyses of legumain expression and activity confirmed the endo-lysosomal and nuclear localizations in cultured cells and, importantly, also in sections from xenografts and biopsies from colorectal cancer patients. In the HCT116 and SW620 cell lines nuclear legumain was found to make up approximately 13% and 17% of the total legumain, respectively. In similarity with previous studies on nuclear variants of related cysteine proteases, legumain was shown to process histone H3.1. The discovery of nuclear localized legumain launches an entirely novel arena of legumain biology and functions in cancer.

Urinary Proteomic Biomarkers for Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Multicentric Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1; CORONARY-ARTERY-DISEASE; RENAL-DISEASE; VOLUME PROGRESSION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; DISCOVERY; ADPKD; IDENTIFICATION; CANCER; GENES	Treatment options for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) will likely become available in the near future, hence reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for the disease are strongly needed. Here, we aimed to define urinary proteomic patterns in ADPKD patients, which aid diagnosis and risk stratification. By capillary electrophoresis online coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS), we compared the urinary peptidome of 41 ADPKD patients to 189 healthy controls and identified 657 peptides with significantly altered excretion, of which 209 could be sequenced using tandem mass spectrometry. A support-vector-machine based diagnostic biomarker model based on the 142 most consistent peptide markers achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.5% and specificity of 94.2% in an independent validation cohort, consisting of 251 ADPKD patients from five different centers and 86 healthy controls. The proteomic alterations in ADPKD included, but were not limited to markers previously associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). The diagnostic biomarker model was highly specific for ADPKD when tested in a cohort consisting of 481 patients with a variety of renal and extrarenal diseases, including AKI. Similar to ultrasound, sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic score depended on patient age and genotype. We were furthermore able to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression. A proteomic severity score was developed to predict height adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) based on proteomic analysis of 134 ADPKD patients and showed a correlation of r = 0.415 (p<0.0001) with htTKV in an independent validation cohort consisting of 158 ADPKD patients. In conclusion, the performance of peptidomic biomarker scores is superior to any other biochemical markers of ADPKD and the proteomic biomarker patterns are a promising tool for prognostic evaluation of ADPKD.

The detection of any damages in their incipient phase can contribute to prevention of unplanned breakdowns in industrial environment. In this paper an artificial neural network (ANN) based bearing fault detection method is detailed. Upon this method the phase currents of the induction machines are measured and analyzed by means of a new classifier scheme laying on a flexible ANN and an optimal smoothed graphical representation. For both the healthy and faulty machines specific kernels were identified. The results obtained by using the proposed classifier show that the applied Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the ANN training is an excellent choice for such diagnosis purposes and it can be a beneficial method for all electrical machine diagnosticians.

Influence of Rotor Capacitance in On-Line Rotor Ground Fault Location Method for Synchronous Machines with Static Excitation	2013 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING (EEEIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering (EEEIC)	NOV 01-03, 2013	Wroclaw, POLAND			AC generator excitation; capacitance; fault location; power generation protection; rotor; synchronous generator excitation	INDUCTION; PROTECTION; DIAGNOSIS; BAR	This paper presents results about the influence of rotor capacitance in the on-line rotor ground fault location method for synchronous machines with static excitation. The location method is based on the measurement of the voltage in a grounding resistance, connected to the neutral of the excitation transformer. Due to the effect of the rotor capacitance to ground on large synchronous generators, it is observed that waveform of the neutral voltage is perturbed, and it causes an error in the fault location in case of defect in the DC side. Firstly, the influence of the fault resistance value and the fault position is evaluated through computer simulations. Then, the impact of the rotor capacitance in the accuracy of the detection and location method is analyzed in case of ground fault, as well as in healthy operating condition.	[Blanquez, F.

Partiuclarly, this paper proposes to integrate the SVM algorithm with two heuristic optimization algorithms which are particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) and genetic algorithm optimization (GA). These two optimization algorothms are used for efficiently and effectively determine the optimal parameters for SVM. The resulatant two hybrid algorithms, i.e. SVM-PSO and SVM-GA can improve the performances of the original SVM algorithm on classifying the incipient faults in power transformers. Extensive case studies and statistic comparison among the original SVM, SVM-PSO, and SVM-GA over multiple datasets are also provided. Calculation results may demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the two hybrid algorithms in improving the classification accuracy of SVM for condition assessment of power transformer.

The approach is capable of detecting and locating faults in any exciter anywhere in the system with high accuracy using simple fuzzy logic. The use of logic only implies that faults can be detected in near real time. Once the fault is detected, the excitation is immediately adjusted to control the field current and thus the terminal voltage of the affected generator and also to ensure stability of the whole system. The high accuracy and real-time aspects of the proposed approach are verified through case studies performed on IEEE 30 bus power system.	[Saha, S.; Aldeen, M.; Mahmud, M.

While the disease may not manifest with symptoms at early stages, the high risk of heart attack and stroke at first presentation make early detection of this disease process critical. While the electrocardiogram (ECG) exercise stress test is commonly used to diagnose coronary artery atherosclerosis, it is an expensive test that requires cumbersome electrode placement with standardized exercise environment testing. We present an automated method for using a single lead of ECG sensors to classify subjects afflicted by atherosclerosis. This method is not only optimized for streamlined sensor implementation, but also automates classification to address data overload. Using the MIT-BIH database, the framework achieves high accuracy and diagnostic performance, supporting the clinical value of this novel classification method.

The determination of whether a unit is considered to be in steady-state, or subject to external transients is an important pre-processing scenario for both sensor-and machine-fault detection algorithms, for instance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based Squared Prediction Error (SPE), which is known to produce excessive 'false alarms' when fed with measurements that include transient unit operation. Here, the resulting Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (VBGMM) method is utilized to discriminate the operational behaviour of industrial gas turbine systems. Daily batches of measurement data from in-the-field systems are used to show that the VBGMM provides a useful pre-processing tool for subsequent diagnostic and prognostic algorithms.

To illustrate the motivation of the proposed approach, the nature of bearing anomaly especially the generalized roughness is employed to show the difficulty to detect the bearing defect by electrical signal. Furthermore the influence of Power Quality (PQ) variation and machine manufacturing imperfections on the bearing defect by ESA was detailed, which also verified by the experiment observation. The proposed signal segmentation technique can be used to adaptively partition the non-stationary voltage signal into locally stationary process sets, which can be concatenated into a set of approximately stationary signal set for processing. The corresponding segmented current signal can also be grouped together with voltage signal according to the distance between different groups of approximately stationary signal. Finally model-based detection scheme based on electrical signals is applied to track the trend of bearing health condition change. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed procedure, experimental results are provided for different load levels.

In the present study, the additional side-band frequencies of the stator current were analyzed to classify the fault types. As a result, each type of the fault appears the different additional frequency patterns. Therefore, we propose the coupled fault modeling method and the fault type detecting algorithm to efficient fault response.

This paper presents a novel method consisting of adaptive feature extraction and support vector machine (SVM)-based classification for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of drivetrain gearboxes operating in variable-speed conditions. An adaptive signal resampling algorithm, a frequency tracker, and a feature generation algorithm are integrated in the proposed method for effective extraction of the features of gearbox faults from the stator current signal of the AC electric machine connected to the gearbox. A radial basis function kernel-SVM classifier is designed to identify the fault in the gearbox according to the fault features extracted. Experimental studies are performed for a drivetrain gearbox with a gear crack fault connected with a permanent magnet synchronous machine. Results show that the fault can be effectively identified by the proposed method.

Fault-tolerant Operation Strategy for Claw-pole Generators with Stator Turn-to-turn Short Circuits	2013 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 15-19, 2013	Denver, CO	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc			MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS; INDUCTION-MOTOR; MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS	The stator turn-to-turn short circuit is an important type of fault in automotive claw-pole generators (CPGs). If left unprotected, the fault may develop into catastrophic stator winding failures or stator core failures. This paper proposes a fault-tolerant operation strategy for CPGs with stator turn-toturn short circuits. A dynamic model of the CPG with stator turn faults is presented in this paper to analyze how the fault would interact with the connected battery and the static full-bridge rectifier, and how it would affect the generator's output voltage and current. The derived model, when implemented in its equivalent-circuit form, is able to accurately determine the fault current from the observed fault signature. Using a database generated by this model, an optimal fault-tolerant operation strategy is proposed to prevent the stator winding insulation from further thermal degradation while preserving as much as possible the limp-home capability of the automobile. Although the method is originally proposed for CPGs, it is also applicable to other poly-phase AC generators with a DC link rectifier.

Detecting Faults in Doubly Fed Induction Generator by Rotor Side Transient Current Measurement	2013 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 15-19, 2013	Denver, CO	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc			FREQUENCY RESOLUTION; DIAGNOSIS	The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is one of the main technologies at variable speed power generation systems. Reliability and efficiency are key factors to realize the maximum energy output of the renewable resources. Detecting generator faults enables the reduction of risk for unexpected outages and thus high economic losses. Stator winding insulation faults count to one of the most frequent failures in electric machines. Common fault detection methods are based on several additional sensors and hardware what makes the system complex, expansive and also fault-prone. In this work a method is proposed and investigated to detect stator winding faults based only on measured signals available from inverter build-in sensors. By rotor-side inverter switching the generator is excited by transient voltage pulses and the current response provides the possibility to extract a fault indicator through a specific signal processing. Measurements on DFIG test stand prove the methods applicability and accuracy.

Generalized Bearing Roughness Fault Detection in Claw-pole Generators	2013 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE)	SEP 15-19, 2013	Denver, CO	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc			SYNCHRONOUS MACHINE	The generalized bearing roughness fault (worn bearing) is an important type of fault in automotive claw-pole generators (CPGs). It is traditionally very difficult to detect worn bearing in electric machines using only electric signals because there is no fault signature with single or multiple characteristic frequencies. In this paper, it is found that for electric machines driven by a belt-pulley assembly, the worn bearing will result in a small but detectable change in the effective diameter of the pulley. Since the effective pulley diameter change can be reliably detected by frequency shift of generator rectifier ripple, the worn bearing fault can be reliably detected. Experimental results demonstrate the method has very good detection performance.

The development of an accurate model of turn faulted SPM motor is essential to study motor and drive behavior under fault conditions, and to develop effective turn fault detection algorithms. The main contribution of the paper is to propose a completely analytical approach to modeling turn fault in SPM machine, which has not been reported so far in literature. Further to validate the analytical method, finite element (FE) analysis of an SPM motor with stator turn fault is performed and the results are compared with the analytical prediction. It is shown that the proposed model achieves good match with the FE results.

The CMM's in industrial environments have become an important resource for the quality systems, monitoring manufacturing processes, reduction errors during the manufacturing process, inspection of product specifications and in continuous quality improvement. However, there is a need to evaluate, through practical, fast, effective and low cost methods, the CMM metrological specifications. Using calibrated artefacts, able to reproduce the geometric elements frequently measured, it seeks to ensure stability of the functional and metrological characteristics between calibrations and simultaneously knowing the errors. With better monitoring of the control parameters it is possible evaluate and optimize the calibration set deadlines, timely detection of faults and failures, detect structural changes and changes in environmental conditions of the laboratories, thus seeking to conduct a more detailed assessment of the stability of metrological characteristics of a CMM in industrial environments.

This novel optimizer, named Generalized PSO (GPSO), is inspired by linear control theory. It enables direct control over the key aspects of particle dynamics during the optimization process, overcoming some typical flaws of classical PSO. The basic idea of this algorithm with its detailed theoretical and empirical analysis is presented, and parameter-tuning schemes are proposed. GPSO is also compared to the classical PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) on a set of benchmark problems. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, two practical engineering applications of the GPSO algorithm are described, in the area of electrical machines fault detection and classification, and in optimal control of water distribution systems.

However, different kinds of faults are unavoidable in motors during their operational service. Unbalancing in the supply voltage is common in grid supply. However, the unbalance supply and phase loss produces similar symptoms. Therefore, this paper focuses on unbalanced supply condition diagnosis and discrimination between unbalancing in supply and single phasing or phase loss fault based. The proposed technique utilizes the ratio of third harmonic to fundamental of stator line currents and supply voltages using artificial neural network (ANN). The presented approach gives high degree of accuracy in detection and diagnosis of phase loss fault and those due to supply voltages unbalance using artificial neural network All simulations in this paper are conducted using finite element analysis software. The approach is proven effectively through experimental validation.	[Refaat, Shady S.; Abu-Rub, Haitham] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Doha, Qatar; [Saad, M. S.; Aboul-Zahab, E.

Medicine is one of the fields that can benefit from the application of data mining and pattern recognition techniques. The evolution of computational intelligence can improve many areas in health care including diagnosis, prognosis, screening, etc. The multiclass classification problem is important in data mining applications. Medical datasets are characterized by high dimensionality. Feature selection is considered as the main process to improve classification performance, particularly with the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a hybrid system that combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and random forest (RF) for diagnosing lymphatic diseases. The genetic algorithm is used as a feature selection technique for reducing the dimension of the lymphatic diseases dataset and RE is used as a classifier. The performance of the proposed GA-RE system is compared with that of other feature selection algorithms combined with RE classifier such as principal component analysis (PCA), ReliefF, Fisher, sequential forward floating search (SFFS), and the sequential backward floating search (SBFS). The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated to measure the prediction performance. The experiments performed show that GA RE achieved a high classification accuracy of 92.2%. Moreover, a subset of six features using the GA is sufficient for obtaining the classification.

Harmony Search applied for Support Vector Machines Training Optimization	2013 IEEE EUROCON			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE EUROCON Conference	JUL 01-04, 2013	Zagreb, CROATIA	IEEE, IEEE Croatia Sect, IEEE Reg 8, FER		Support Vector Machines; Harmony Search; Fault Detections		Since the beginning, some pattern recognition techniques have faced the problem of high computational burden for dataset learning. Among the most widely used techniques, we may highlight Support Vector Machines (SVM), which have obtained very promising results for data classification. However, this classifier requires an expensive training phase, which is dominated by a parameter optimization that aims to make SVM less prone to errors over the training set. In this paper, we model the problem of finding such parameters as a metaheuristic-based optimization task, which is performed through Harmony Search (HS) and some of its variants. The experimental results have showen the robustness of HS-based approaches for such task in comparison against with an exhaustive (grid) search, and also a Particle Swarm Optimization-based implementation.

In this paper, a prediction algorithm based on multiwavelet support vector machine(WSVM) is proposed. Multiwavelet denoising is used for signal data preprocessing. Then multiwavelet is employed to decompose the data into several subsequences at different scales. These subsequences are predicted by different support vector machines respectively. Finally, the final predicted results reconstituted from the subsequences are obtained. To validate the model, experiment data from a set of certain avionics voltage data is used. Predicted results of the proposed algorithm are validated to be more accurate than that of traditional support vector machine prediction algorithm. The mean square error (MSE) is decreased to 0.1956.

The non-dimensional symptom parameters (NSPs) in the frequency domain are defined to reflect the features of the vibration signals. SVMs are used to construct the optimal classification hyper-plane, then to integrate a new symptom parameter, which is called as synthetic symptom parameter (SSP). Finally, the possibility distributions of the SSP are used to distinguish faults by sequential inference and possibility theory. The proposed method has been applied to detect the faults of the V-belt driving equipment in a centrifugal fan, and the efficiency of the method has been verified using practical examples.

The idea is to provide a dynamic maintenance schedule, fulfilling specific needs of individual vehicles. Luckily, the same shift of focus, as well as technological advancements in the telecommunication area, make long-term data collection more widespread, delivering the necessary data. We have found, however, that the standard attribute-value knowledge representation is not rich enough to capture important dependencies in this domain. Therefore, we are proposing a new rule induction algorithm, inspired by Michalski's classical AQ approach. Our method is aware that data concerning each vehicle consists of time-ordered sequences of readouts. When evaluating candidate rules, it takes into account the composite performance for each truck, instead of considering individual readouts in separation.

The algorithm is particularly suitable for fault detection in complex technological systems, such as aircraft. This study is based on the capability of one-class support vector machine (SVM) method to classify correctly the observation and measurement data, obtained during the exploitation of the system such as airborne aircraft into a single class of 'normal' behavior and, respectively, leave data that is not assigned to this class as suspected anomalies. In order to ensure real time (in flight) application a recursive learning procedure of the method is proposed. The proposed method takes into account both "positive"/"normal" and "negative"/"abnormal" examples of the base class, keeping the overall model structure as an outlier-detection approach. This approach is generic for any fault detection problem (for example in areas such as process control, computer networks, analysis of data from interrogations, etc.). The advantages of the new algorithm based on OSA are verified by comparison with several classifiers, including the traditional one-class SVM. The proposed approach is tested for fault detection problem using real flight data from a large number of aircraft of different make (USA, Western European as well as Russian).

However, the capability of these models to simulate thermodynamically driven warm-season rainfall events, such as afternoon airmass thunderstorm formation in subtropical summers, is highly limited. Current methods of addressing this issue have included ensemble numerical weather prediction simulations, where an ensemble mean of multiple simulations with varied model physics is used as an improved prediction over any individual ensemble member. These approaches still yield only modest skill primarily due to inherent biases in each ensemble member. As such, the current research will utilize machine learning to combine logically ensemble members into a single prediction of warm-season rainfall. In particular, a support vector machine classification scheme that employs members of a 30 member ensemble as predictors and observed rainfall patterns as a predictand will be formulated on multiple warm-season rainfall days in an effort to develop an improved prognosis of warm-season rainfall that can be implemented in operational meteorology forecasts. The primary goal of the work is to obtain a statistically significant improvement of predictive skill over currently utilized ensemble member approaches. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This technology has shifted a new era in molecular classification. Interpreting gene expression data remains a difficult problem and an active research area due to their native nature of "high dimensional low sample size". Such problems pose great challenges to existing classification methods. Thus, effective feature selection techniques are often needed in this case to aid to correctly classify different tumor types and consequently lead to a better understanding of genetic signatures as well as improve treatment strategies. This paper aims on a comparative study of state-of-the-art feature selection methods, classification methods, and the combination of them, based on gene expression data. We compared the efficiency of three different classification methods including: support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor and random forest, and eight different feature selection methods, including: information gain, twoing rule, sum minority, max minority, gini index, sum of variances, t-statistics, and one-dimension support vector machine. Five-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the classification performance. Two publicly available gene expression data sets of glioma were used in the experiments. Results revealed the important role of feature selection in classifying gene expression data. By performing feature selection, the classification accuracy can be significantly boosted by using a small number of genes. The relationship of features selected in different feature selection methods is investigated and the most frequent features selected in each fold among all methods for both datasets are evaluated.

The result of grading helps the physicians to diagnose and prescribe suitable prognosis. The focus of this paper is on a CAD for automatic analysis of breast cancer histopathological Images to count mitosis as an important criteria for the breast cancer grading. To achieve this aim, sets of specific digital histopathological data are used which are captured by particular microscopic scanners named as Aperio XT and Hamamatsu NanoZoomer scanners. In the proposed method, these acquired images are employed and processed based on digital image processing approaches like 2-D anisotropic diffusion as a pre-process and morphological process. For extraction of pixel-wise features from predetermined mitotic regions, an statistical approach based on color information such as maximum likelihood estimation is employed. To prevent misclassification of mitosis and non-mitosis objects, an objectwise completed local binary pattern (CLBP) is proposed to extract texture features robust against rotation and color-level changes, and finally support vector machine (SV1VI) is used to classify the extracted feature vectors. Having computed the evaluation criteria, our proposed method performs better fmeasure (70.94% for Aperio XT scanner images and 70.11% for Hamamatsu images) among the methods proposed by other participants at ICPR2012 Mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathological images.

The marr wavelet kernel is proposed and the existence is proven by theoretic analysis and demonstration. Based on this, a novel analog circuit fault diagnosis method which is called wavelet kernel support vector machine is proposed in the paper. Using principal component analysis (PCA) as a tool for extracting fault features, the WSVM is then applied to the analog circuit fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results.

In this paper, one-against-one SVM and directed acyclic graph SVM are adopted to diagnose the faulty analog circuit. Aiming at the uncertainty of the node arrangement and the error accumulation phenomenon, the improved directed acyclic graph SVM based on fisher separability measure in high dimensional feature space and margin of SVM is proposed.

Based on our previous work, the concept of health reliability degree (HRD) is reviewed to indicate a quantitative health level from the perspectives of single parameter, some subsystems and the whole test-bed system. The relationship among multiple parameters are fully considered, which is different from traditional qualitative fault detection. The fuzzy evaluation method is used to evaluate the health condition of test-bed system under different fuzzy evaluating criterion sets. The HRD is calculated by using the RVM-based multi-variable fusion method. To verify the proposed strategy, a simulated experimental system is designed. The health evaluation of test-bed system with different health levels have been discussed under different working conditions. Results show that the proposed method provides a better solution to health evaluation of test-bed system.

The hybrid model was validated and evaluated by operating data and compared with individual ARIMA and LSSVM models. The results show that the hybrid prediction model can capture both linear and nonlinear patterns and has a better prediction performance than any single model. On this base, a sensor fault diagnosis system for pH value was designed by using the hybrid model. Firstly, the sensor fault location is determined on the reconstruction residuals, and then data reconstruction is implemented by the hybrid model instead of fault data. The simulation results from a 600 MW unit case study show that the model has high modeling precision and strong generalization. The fault diagnosis based on the hybrid model can diagnose the sensor's fault and obtain credible reconstruction data.

By means of the support vector machine, pattern recognition of extracted characteristics factors was executed. From the experimental results, some conclusions were obtained that two non-linear analysis methods were feasible and the classification results of symbolic entropy were better than the results of correlation dimension. The latter showed that the corresponding sign coding of deterministic signals in any vibration signals presented a big probability, while that of random noise possessed a small probability. Thus, the influence of random noise could be decreased by symbolic entropy. The faults in rolling bearing could be classified effectively and their diagnosis could be realized by using symbolic entropy's capability of capturing the characteristics of large-scale features in signals, as well as using vector machine's capability of recognizing small samples.

Fault diagnosis is very useful at the design stage for debugging purposes, at high-volume manufacturing for obtaining feedback about the underlying fault mechanisms and improving the design and layout in future IC generations, and in cases where the IC is part of a larger safety-critical system (e. g. automotive, aerospace) for identifying the root-cause of failure and for applying corrective actions that will prevent failure re-occurrence and, thereby, will expand the safety features. In this summary paper, we present a methodology for fault modeling and fault diagnosis of analog circuits based on machine learning. A defect filter is used to recognize the type of fault (parametric or catastrophic), inverse regression functions are used to locate and predict the values of parametric faults, and multi-class classifiers are used to list catastrophic faults according to their likelihood of occurrence. The methodology is demonstrated on both simulation and high-volume manufacturing data showing excellent overall diagnosis rate.

In this methodology, firstly, the signal was de-noised by wavelet analysis. Then the autoregressive model was used to remove the discrete frequencies from de-noised signal. Further, the residual signal which mainly contained impulsive fault signal was enhanced by minimum entropy deconvolution filter. The kurtosis was extracted which was taken as the feature for prognostics. At last, the empirical mode decomposition was used to reduce fluctuation of feature value and to extract the trend content. A case study was presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We propose distinct feature models to assemble a global feature pool from which the most discriminative information is filtered by feature selection. Statistically robust performance estimation for representative classifier models are used. The feature models are based on statistical parameters from the time and frequency domain and wavelet packet analysis. Feature selection is done by sequential techniques, with and without floating, applying wrapper and filter approaches. Performance estimation is based on the estimated accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Experimental results are shown for 1834 vibration patterns, manually labeled by experts in the field of fault diagnosis.

Testing signals were obtained by measuring the vibration signals of gear system at different rotating speed for different faults. Vibration feature signals were analyzed using wavelet de-noising. By using wavelet packet transform (WPT), signals were decomposed into different frequency bands. the fault detection is used for calculation of energy percents of every frequency. All these were used for fault recognition using Support vector machine (SVM). SVM and neural network transform results were compared. The research indicates that the de-noised signal is superior to the original one. When dealing with various signals, such as Multi-Faults, the diagnosis identification rates are over 92%. This method can be effectively used not only in engineering diagnosis of different faults of gear system, but also for other machinery fault style classification.

A parameter selection algorithm of SVM was proposed based on data maximum variance - entropy criterion by analyzing the principle of SVM classifier. The algorithm uses data maximum variance - entropy criterion to measure the linear separability of dataset in the feature space, and combines with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for parameter optimization. The experiment results on datasets from UCI show that the algorithm is excellence in accuracy and improves the training performance of SVM. To further verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, applying the method in fault diagnosis of biquadratic filter circuit, results prove it improves the diagnostic accuracy.

In this context, traditional Fourier Analysis (FA) fails to quantify the extend of fault propagation over time. To overcome this limitation a wavelet based analysis of rotor currents is here proposed in order to detect stator faults. This technique allows extracting fault frequencies dynamically over time providing effective fault detection. A periodical quantification of the fault, issued from the wavelet analysis, has been introduced for accurate stator fault detection. Simulation and experimental results show the validity of the proposed method, leading to an effective diagnosis procedure for intermittent stator electrical faults in wound rotor induction machines.

ANN based evaluation of performance of wavelet transform for condition monitoring of rolling element bearing	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING (ICONDM2013)	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference On Design and Manufacturing (IConDM)	JUL 18-20, 2013	IIITDM Kancheepuram, Chennai, INDIA		IIITDM Kancheepuram	Rolling element bearing; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Artificial Neural Network	FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; VIBRATION	Bearings are one of the critical components in rotating machines and the majority of the failure arises from the defective bearings. Bearing failure leads to failure of a machine and unpredicted productivity loss fir production facilities. Hence, bearing fault detection and diagnosis is an integral part of the preventive maintenance procedures. In this paper vibration signals for three conditions of a deep groove ball bearing Normal (N), defect on inner race (IR) and defect on outer race (OR) were acquired from a customized bearing test rig, under one load and two speed conditions. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been used for vibration signal analysis. The statistical features extracted from the dominant wavelet coefficients are used as inputs to ANN classifier to evaluate its performance. The vibration signals have also been denoised using a new thresholding scheme. A comparison of ANN performance is made based on raw vibration data and denoised data. The ANN performance has been found to be comparatively higher when denoised signals were used as inputs to the classifier. Also various mother wavelet functions (Db8, Db4, Db44 and Sym1.0) were used to analyze the denoised vibration signals and their performance has been evaluated using the ANN classifiers.

Techniques for Testing Scientific Programs Without an Oracle	2013 5TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (SE-CSE)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering (SE-CSE)	MAY 18, 2013	San Francisco, CA			Scientific software testing; Metamorphic testing; Metamorphic relation; Machine learning; Mutation analysis; Test oracles; Assertion checking		The existence of an oracle is often assumed in software testing. But in many situations, especially for scientific programs, oracles do not exist or they are too hard to implement. This paper examines three techniques that are used to test programs without oracles: (1) Metamorphic testing, (2) Run-time Assertions and (3) Developing test oracles using machine learning. We examine these methods in terms of their (1) fault finding ability, (2) automation, and (3) required domain knowledge. Several case studies apply these three techniques to effectively test scientific programs that do not have oracles. Certain techniques have reported a better fault finding ability than the others when testing specific programs. Finally, there is potential to increase the level of automation of these techniques, thereby reducing the required level of domain knowledge. Techniques that can potentially be automated include (1) detection of likely metamorphic relations, (2) static analyses to eliminate spurious invariants and (3) structural analyses to develop machine learning generated oracles.

All production has the possibility to fail due to unexpected accidents. To reduce the fatigue of human workers, small errors automatically should be corrected by a robot system. Also a learning method is important for fault detection, because labor of system integrator should be reduced. In this paper, an external thread fastening task by a robotic manipulator is investigated. To discriminate the four states of a task, linear support vector machine methods with two feature parameters are introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed through an experiment and recognition examination. Finally, the ability of linear SVM is compared with artificial neural network method.

As for those non-sampled workpieces, their quality is commonly monitored by a fault detection and classification (FDC) method. Nevertheless, it may fail to detect out-of-control (OOC) products if their corresponding manufacturing process parameters are all in-spec. In other words, unless those certain defected workpieces are selected for sampling measurements, they may not be detected through simply monitoring all the individual manufacturing process parameters. We have proposed a product quality fault detection scheme (FDS), which utilizes the classification and regression tree (CART) to build a single failure model (FML) for identifying the relationship between process parameters and OOC products. However, all the failure modes (FMs) are contained in the single FML, which makes it difficult to understand the causes of defected products. To remedy this problem, this paper develops an advanced fault detection scheme (AFDS). The AFDS builds the corresponding FM by CART for each individual failure cause and generates a FM manager via support vector machine (SVM) to manage all the FMs. Finally, the dual-phase concept is adopted to run the AFDS for achieving on-line real-time fault detection.

Those variables are named Health Indicators (HI) and they are the keystone of PHM. However, they are subject to a lot of uncertainties when computed in real time and the stochastic nature of PHM makes it hard to evaluate the efficiency of a HI set before the extraction algorithm is implemented. This document introduces Numerical Key Performance Indicators (NKPI) for the validation of HI computed only from data provided by numerical models in the upstream stages of a PHM system development process. In order to match as good as possible the reality, the multiple sources of uncertainties are quantified and propagated into the model. After having introduced the issue of uncertain systems modeling, the different NKPI are defined and eventually an application is performed on a hydraulic actuation system of an aircraft engine.

Detecting and isolating faults may be convenient for some applications where the fault does not have severe consequences on humans as well as on the environment. However, in some situations, detecting and diagnosing faults may not be sufficient. In these cases, it is more interesting to anticipate the time of the fault, what is the purpose of prognostics. This latter activity aims at estimating the remaining useful life of systems by using three main approaches: data-driven prognostics, model-based prognostics and hybrid prognostics. Data-driven prognostics concerns the transformation of the raw monitoring data to relevant models or trends which are then used to continuously assess the health state of the system and predict its remaining useful life. This approach is easy to implement, but suffers from precision. In addition, the method is applied in most cases on single physical components (bearings, gears, belts, etc.) and thus the interaction between the components of the whole system is not addressed. Model-based prognostics (also called physics of failure prognostics) deals with analytical modelling of the system including its degradation. This approach gives more precise results, but it is difficult to apply on complex systems for which the construction of the behaviour and degradation models is not a trivial task. Finally, the hybrid approach combines both model-based and data-driven approaches by keeping their advantages. This paper presents a framework allowing the development of hybrid prognostics. The framework relies on two main phases: an offline phase and an online phase. The first phase concerns the construction of the nominal and degradation models, and the definition of the faults and performance thresholds needed to calculate the remaining useful life of the system. The second phase deals with the utilisation of the models and thresholds obtained in the first phase to detect the fault initiation, assess the current health state of the system, predict its future health state and calculate its remaining useful life.

The failure will seriously affect the competitiveness of the market if the equipment failure. However, fault diagnosis technology plays an important role in the maintenance of equipment and products, fault diagnosis research has gradually focus on condition monitoring, predictive maintenance and early fault diagnostic. The new concept is the use of intelligent maintenance system (IMS), constantly monitoring the status of equipment and product performance, forecasting and assessing, make a maintenance plan to prevent them from fault. The core technology of IMS is predicting and assessment the performance degradation process of the equipment and products. Shock model is one of the important researches in the reliability mathematical theory and describes system failure, maintenance and so the phenomenon of life in randomly changing environment whose central issue of the research is system failure or system life. This article discusses a shock model that the times of shock is a Poisson process and the damage is additive, obtain the expectations of damage combined with the failure characteristics of the CNC system, and provide a basis to assess the residual life of the CNC system.

RUL can differ for similar components operating under the same conditions. Working with such problem, one needs to contend with many uncertainty sources such as system, model and sensory noise. To do that, proposed models should include such uncertainties and represent the belief about the system's state in a probabilistic form. In this work, a Bayesian approach is proposed for predicting the RUL of critical components. The approach is divided into two main parts, online and offline. In the offline part, the approach builds k-nearest neighbours classifier (kNN) for different datasets according to their end of life (EOL) values. On the other hand, the online part is similar to the offline apart from the use of Bayesian online state estimator. Bayesian online state estimator is used to represent the uncertainty of the approach about the health status. The approach starts by extracting trends that represent the health evolution of the critical component and uses these trends to build offline models of the critical component. Then, the approach uses these models to predict the RUL from new online data and assigning uncertainty value to it. The approach can be applied to a system with variable operating conditions, however, the prediction horizon will span between the minimum and maximum RUL values available in the training dataset.

Efficiently and smartly combining multi-source information and relevant models from the interested object, more accurate and reliable diagnostic and prognostic results regarding the object can be achieved, which are especially significant for the condition-based maintenance and prognostics and health management applications. Ensemble learning, as a typical machine learning and decision fusion method, has long been applied in the pattern recognition field and demonstrated promising performance. However, scarce applications of ensemble learning have been found for remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. RUL prediction based on ensemble learning by merging multi-piece information and dynamically updating is proposed in this paper. Specifically, multiple base learners are trained to work as one RUL estimator and weighted averaging with dynamically updated weights upon the latest condition monitoring information is employed to aggregate these RULs to form the final RUL. Rolling element bearing degradation experimental data is used to verify and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the first case considered, we have available a stochastic model of the creep growth process and we know the value of the failure threshold, i.e., the maximum creep strain level beyond which the blade cracks. On this basis, a Monte Carlo-based filtering technique, called particle filtering, is set-up to predict the distribution of the system RUL and online-update it when new observations are collected. In the second case considered, the only available information is the sequence of observations of the creep strain of the blade of interest and the value of the failure threshold. On this basis, a data-driven method, based on an ensemble of bootstrap models, has been developed to estimate the turbine blade RUL and the uncertainty of the estimate caused by the uncertainty in the data, the variability of the blades behaviour and the imprecision of the empirical model. The two approaches are evaluated in terms of the assumptions they require and the accuracy of the RUL predictions they provide. The ability of providing measures of confidence in the outcomes is also considered.

The uncertainty must be considered carefully to achieve more effective engineering applications. Uncertainties have been classified as aleatory uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatory uncertainty is also called objective uncertainty, irreducible uncertainty, inherent uncertainty, and stochastic uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty is also referred to as subjective uncertainty, reducible uncertainty and state-of-knowledge uncertainty. A cognitive framework to aid in the understanding of uncertainties and techniques for mitigating and even taking positive advantage of them is presented. From the perspective of man-machine-environment system engineering, the framework is an attempt to clarify the wide range of uncertainties that affect prognostics system. The uncertainty sources are identified as three aspects (machine, environment, man). A general uncertainty management procedure is proposed. It mainly contains uncertainty identification, qualification, propagation and sensitivity analysis. For case illustration purpose, the popular data-driven prognostics methods are discussed in detail. Current and developing methods for dealing with uncertainties are projected onto the framework to understand their relative roles and interactions.

The computational algorithms are based on models that combine the methods of the theory of dynamical systems, the theory of stochastic processes, statistical physics and field theory. The organization of algorithms in the hierarchical structure based on the principles of degeneration of failure signs helped identify more early signs of failure. This, in turn, allows to calculate effective Predictive maintenance strategies. The first experimental results of the cluster operation are shown. In particular, it is show that the hierarchical approach to the RUL prognosis has the structure of one-dimensional graph. The experiment confirmed the need to integrate remote computing cluster with peripheral recognizing automata in a united network for effective organization of automata operation and their retraining.

Increasing the Adoption of Prognostic Systems for Health Management in the Power Industry	2013 PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM)	Chemical Engineering Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Effective asset management benefits from accurate information about the current health and expected future health of each asset. This information can be supplied by diagnostic and prognostic systems respectively, utilizing data from condition monitoring systems and inspections to derive status and likely future behavior. However, new prognostic techniques can face difficulties when transitioning from research tool to industrial deployment. Within the power industry there are two main drivers to improve asset management. First, the safety of personnel and members of the public may be compromised by a failure in service, so maintenance aims to pre-empt such failures. Secondly, more accurate prediction of future degradation can feed into a more efficient maintenance program, reducing costs through appropriate delay of repair and replacement. These drivers prompt a cautious interest in prognostic tools, countered by some reticence within traditional utilities to adopt new and relatively unproven technologies. This paper identifies issues which may hinder the deployment of prognostic techniques within the power industry. It considers two examples of diagnostic systems (for rotating plant within nuclear stations, and for power transformers) which progressed past the research prototype stage to deployed demonstrator systems, and one example of a prognostic system (for HV circuit breakers) which has not yet made that transition. Drawing lessons from these experiences, the paper extracts key factors which link the deployed systems, but are missing from the third. The paper concludes that structural issues are the main differentiators, including automated access to data, clear and concise user interfaces, and working with the engineers who will ultimately use the system. Trust in the algorithm is also important, and the paper outlines the techniques selected for the case study applications, with discussion of selected results. Once engineers are able to integrate prognostics into their processes, it naturally contributes to asset management strategy.	[Catterson, Victoria M.; Costello, Jason J.

CBM is a maintenance strategy based on collecting information concerning the working condition of equipment, such as vibration intensity, temperature, pressure, etc., related to the system degradation or status in order to prevent its failure and to determine the optimal maintenance. Prognosis is an important part of CBM. Different methodologies can be used to perform prognosis and can be classified as: model-based or data-driven. Model-based methods use physical models of the process or statistical estimation methods based on state observers, to this approach belong Kalman filters, particle filters, etc. On the other hand, data-driven methods only makes use of the available monitoring data which to train a learning algorithm. In this paper a data-driven approach is presented to detect abnormal behaviours in industrial equipment. The suggested approach combines two multivariate analysis techniques: principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). With PCA the most important contributors to characterize the condition of the equipment are found. Next, PLS is used to predict the system state and detect abnormal behaviour. This behaviour can lead to perform maintenance tasks. Finally, an example of application to an asynchronous generator is presented.

Particle Filtering (PF) is widely used as prognostic tool in support of PrM, by reason of its capability of robustly estimating the equipment RUL without requiring strict modeling hypotheses. However, a precise estimate of the RUL requires tracing a large number of particles, and thus large computational times, often incompatible with the need of rapidly processing information for making decisions in due time. To circumvent this problem, the Risk Sensitive Particle Filtering (RSPF) technique is exemplified in this work by way of a case study concerning a mechanical component affected by fatigue degradation.

For deteriorating systems or devices it can be estimated by establishing a good-fitting stochastic process model and solving corresponding first passage problem with the given failure level. In this paper, providing that the mean and variance function of the degradation process are given or obtained directly from observed data by statistical/empirical techniques, we propose a time-dependent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose mean and variance are equal to the given mean and variance respectively. Based on this diffusion process, when a failure level is considered, the first passage failure distribution can be solved by a Volterra integral equation of second class. Furthermore, with the help of numerical methods, the residual useful life estimation is considered for a real case.

The knowledge of the degradation process is updated through the parameter of the process when new observations are available. The updating is performed through a general Bayesian filtering process within a state space model setting. The proposed adaptive model is history-dependent and can adjust itself to the sudden changes in degradation signals. The numerical case study shows that the variance of the RUL distribution obtained from the adaptive model is less than that of the conventional inverse Gaussian model and the predictive accuracy is improved by using the adaptive model in terms of TMSE. To validate our adaptive model further, we conduct a model prediction accuracy test. Our test result enables us to conclude that our model is stable, robust and beneficial for the application in prognostics and health management of systems.

RUL estimates are presented analytically. Random walk model of finite segments of the wavelet coefficients of observed signal is considered as the original model. We consider all possible cases in the problems of multidimensional random walk vectors free walk, walk with limitations of walk in a multiply connected space. In this case, the problem of RUL estimate is reduced to the assessment of the achievement by the wandering vector the preassigned critical values or areas of critical values. For this the probability of transition from the initial value to some preassigned values is determined using the representation of this probability by the Feynman path integral. During the monitoring of the operation of mechanical block is determined the type of random walk of observable process. After that there is an automatic choice of model for RUL estimates. In some cases it is possible to calculate the Feynman path integral and result analytical formula for RUL estimates. In other cases, after select the type random walk for RUL estimates the solutions of evolution equations for the transition probabilities are studied numerically. It is shown that for the RUL estimates is needed mode of continuous or periodic monitoring, because the state of the mechanical system can change and therefore the conditions of applicability of the random walk model are changed. In this case, the correction of the calculated estimates is needed. Therefore, the paper discusses the issue about prognosis of changing the conditions of applicability of random walk models. The described algorithm is implemented in PHM computing cluster. For full analysis of life time estimates the cloud computing service is used. The experimental data are shown.

Maintenance operations are fundamental in granting machineries and processes energy saving, given the capability of optimising them thanks to a predictive model. The major challenge of maintenance optimization is to implement a maintenance strategy, which maximizes availability and efficiency of the equipment, controls the rate of equipment deterioration, ensures the safe and environmentally friendly operation, and minimizes the total cost of the operation which means the both production and energy cost. To ensure that the plant achieved the desired performance it needs a track performance on maintenance operations and maintenance results. In addition it needs the relationship between the inputs of the maintenance process and the outcomes in terms of total contribution to manufacturing performance and objectives. In addition to normal wear and deterioration, other failures may occur especially when the equipment are pushed beyond their design limits or due to operational errors. As a result, equipment downtime, quality problems, energy losses, safety hazards or environmental pollution become the obvious outcomes. All these outcomes have the potential to impact negatively the operating cost, profitability, customers' demand satisfaction, and productivity among other important performance requirements. The developed model in this study is an integration of a probabilistic and a deterministic model based on balanced cost and benefits, able to support decision making. This is described through the application to a case study: the optimisation of maintenance operations in energy consuming equipment in the production process of bituminous materials, based on the energy audit from the field and a part of the results are illustrated in this work.

Amongst these algorithms, Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MC-SVM) has gained popularity due to its relatively high classification accuracy, ability to classify multiple patterns and capability to handle noisy /incomplete data. However, its application is limited by the difficulty in determining the required kernel function and penalty parameters. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid differential evolution - particle swarm optimization (DE-PSO) algorithm to optimize the MC-SVM kernel function and penalty parameters. The differential algorithm (DE) obtains the search limit for the SVM parameters, while the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) determines the global optimum parameters for a given training data set. Since degrading machinery components display several degradation stages in their lifetime, the MC-SVM trained with optimum parameters are used to estimate the health states of a degrading machinery component, from which the remaining useful life (RUL) is predicted. This method improves the classification accuracy of MC-SVM in predicting the health states of a machinery component and consequently increases the accuracy of RUL predictions. The feasibility of the method is validated using bearing prognostic run-to-failure data obtained from NASA public data repository. A comparative study between MC-SVM with parameters obtained using simple grid search with n-fold cross validation and MC-SVM with DE-PSO based on prognostic performance metrics reveals that the proposed method has better performance, with all the cases considered falling within a 10 % error margin. The method also outperforms other soft computing methods proposed in literature.

This framework consists of a Fourier-Bessel (FB) expansion for analyzing the transient signals, a generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) for feature reduction, and a relevance vector machine (RVM) for fault classification. The start-up transient current signals are acquired from different motor operating conditions and decomposed into single components using FB expansion. Subsequently, a number of statistical features in the time domain and the frequency domain are computed for each component to represent the motor conditions. The high dimensionality of the feature set is reduced by implementing GDA. Finally, the diagnosis performance is carried out by RVM, which is an intelligent method in pattern recognition area. The framework has been applied for traction motor faults including bowed rotor, broken rotor bar, eccentricity, faulty bearing, mass unbalance, and phase unbalance in general applications. The results show that the proposed diagnosis framework is capable of improving the classification accuracy significantly in comparison other methods.

Prognostics can assist diagnosis by assessing the current health of a system and predicting its remaining life based on features that capture the gradual degradation in a system's operational capabilities. Prognostics are critical to improve safety, plan successful work, schedule maintenance, and reduce maintenance costs and down time. Unlike fault diagnosis, prognosis is a relatively new area, but it has become an important part of Condition-based Maintenance (CBM) of systems. As there are many prognostic techniques, usage must be attuned to particular applications. Broadly stated, prognostic methods are either data-driven or model-based. Each has advantages and disadvantages; consequently, they are often combined in hybrid applications. A approach hybrid model can combine some or all model types (data-driven, and phenomenological); thus, more complete information can be gathered, leading to more accurate recognition of the fault state. This approach is especially relevant in railway systems where the maintainer and operator know some of the failure mechanisms, but the complexity of the infrastructure and rolling stock is huge that there is no way to develop a complete model-based approach. Therefore, hybrid models are extremely useful for accurately estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of railway systems. The paper addresses the process of data aggregation into a hybrid model to get RUL values within logical confidence intervals so that the life cycle of railway assets can be managed and optimised.

However, the advent of FEVs in mass production presents new challenges to automotive manufacturers due to the immaturity of the new building blocks, which can reduce FEV's safety and reliability. In this context, research activity is currently devoted to the development of prognostics and health management systems (PHMSs) which aim at providing information on the failsafe state of the FEV subsystem and at the prediction of its Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The objective of the present paper is to develop a method to assess the reliability and availability of a FEV subsystem which is monitored by a prognostics and health management system. The method proposed for the assessment is based on Monte Carlo Simulation.

The prognostic approach is developed considering a library of reference degradation trajectories containing parameter observations taken from a set of similar equipments until their failures. The prediction of the RUL of the a filter is obtained by comparing its degradation trajectory to the reference trajectories and by properly aggregating the RULs of the training trajectories using a weighted sum which takes into account the similarity within test and training trajectories. In order to provide a measure of confidence in the RUL prediction in the form of a prediction interval, we place our work within the framework of belief function theory and we assign to each reference trajectory a belief proportional to its similarity to the test trajectory. A prediction interval is then obtained by properly combining these belief assignments using the Dempster's rule.

Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Electric Cables in Nuclear Power Plants	2013 PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM)	Chemical Engineering Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Conference on Prognostics and System Health Management (PHM)	SEP 08-11, 2013	Milan, ITALY	IEEE				Electric cables help form the backbone of instrumentation and control (I&C) systems in nuclear power plants by providing power to electrical equipment and transmission paths for instrumentation signals used to perform safety functions and control plant operation. Operating experience in the existing fleet of nuclear reactors has shown that the number of cable failures increases with plant age resulting in plant transients, shutdowns, and in some cases, the loss of safety functions (NRC, 2012). As a result, cable condition monitoring and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation have become increasingly important in recent years, especially as many plants begin operation beyond their original licensing periods. To facilitate the understanding of cable aging mechanisms and degradation detection, the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) developed the Cable Polymer Aging Database (CPAD). The CPAD provides a repository of test results from cable aging experiments performed by a number of research institutions and represents one of the most comprehensive sources of cable degradation data that is publically available (EPRI, 2002). This paper describes the process the authors used to select appropriate prognostic parameter(s), develop prognostic models, and estimate the RUL of nuclear power plant cables from the data contained in the CPAD.

Accurate measurement of the current degradation of system components and structures is important for correct estimates of their remaining useful life (RUL). The propagation of the uncertainty involved in both the measurements and model construction of these system components is vital for finding the uncertainty of the overall system RUL calculation. Prognostic methods should seamlessly operate from beginning of component life (BOL) to end of component life (EOL). We term this "Lifecycle Prognostics." When a component is put into use, the only information available may be past failure times, and the predicted failure distribution can be estimated with reliability methods such as Weibull Analysis (Type I). As the component operates, it begins to consume its available life. This life consumption may be a function of system stresses, and the failure distribution should be updated (Type II). When degradation becomes apparent, this information can be used again to improve the failure distribution estimate (Type III). Current research typically focuses on developing methods for the three types of prognostics. This research focused on developing a framework using Bayesian methods to transition between prognostic model types and update failure distribution estimates as new information becomes available. This paper will present methods developed that integrate models from the three prognostics categories into a single prognostic system to estimate RUL over the life of the component: Lifecycle Prognostics. The methods will also be validated on a range of test beds.	[Nam, Alan; Sharp, Michael; Hines, J.

With the increasing number of wind turbines worldwide, the exposure to harsh environmental conditions and the use of remote areas like offshore, arctic or desert regions, it has become important to predict abnormal machine behaviour as early as possible. Therefore, automated fault detection is necessary. Fault detection will prevent extensive damage in case of a fault and create time to react to faults, for example, to prepare inspections and/or to purchase spare parts. To reduce the downtime of wind turbines, fault detection systems are already widely used but more research and development need to be done. The diagnostic approach of those systems is to use pre-set fixed alert thresholds but has several drawbacks and therefore makes fault isolation difficult. To overcome the drawbacks of the common systems, this paper introduces model based condition monitoring using residual generation to wind turbine drive trains. Residuals describe the difference between the measurements and the model output. The model output represents the non-faulty system behaviour. If the measurement deviates from the model output a fault is indicated. Residual generation is a known approach for other systems. A mathematical model of a system, such as a wind turbine drive train, depends on the actual and past machine operation as well as on the ambient conditions. By knowing these conditions and being able to describe them in an analytic way, a model can be derived using the well-known state-space representation.

These power systems are critical and must provide stable operating voltages for various modules found throughout the host system, including electromechanical actuators (Goodman et al., 2007), CPU-based control systems, and widely varying loads. Operating temperatures can vary as well, with vibration and mechanical shock conditions adding further stress and degradation of components in the power system. A key advantage of electronic prognostics is the monitoring of health of a power system in these critical systems. With prognostics, impending failure can be detected and mitigated. In addition, the prognostics and health management (PHM) system can help optimize the support logistics and reduce costs. In this paper, an overview of signature-based PHM technology to detect anomalies and prognostic reasoning is presented: A signature is extracted from condition-based data and is called a fault-to-failure progression (FFP) signature. Thereafter, a representative PHM system that extracts and processes dynamic degradation signatures for a critical DC regulated power system is described. The hardware and software integration involved with the addition of advanced PHM functionality to a host system is discussed, along with resulting output display and data that can be used to provide dynamic state-of-health (SoH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimates.

There is therefore a growing need to build accurate diagnosis tools which can give the operating state of the fuel cell during their use. When supervised machine learning approaches are used to build such diagnosis tools, they generally require a large amount of labeled data. Collection and annotation of data can be either difficult to perform or time consuming. In this paper, authors are interested in the monitoring of fuel cells in an unsupervised framework, meaning that no labels are required to learn the diagnosis model. The aim is to build a monitoring tool able to easily visualize the State Of Health of full cells from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measures, showing thus its evolution from fault free case ("normal" behaviour) to defective classes such as drying or flooding. The proposed approach is based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM) which have shown their performance to solve fault detection and prediction in many industrial systems. By automatically visualizing the data into a two-dimensional space, the interpretation of the results have become easy and instinctive. The approach also allows the clustering of the data into different groups of classes, thus enabling the classification of new observations. Experimental results carried out on real data sets have shown the efficiency of the proposed approach with respect to standard supervised and unsupervised classification approaches.

Most traditional features are effective only when the gearbox is under stationary operating condition. Some features which are modified based on the traditional features are no longer sensitive to load changes and remain sensitive to fault propagation. However, it is only permit the load changing in a very small range. In engineering applications, some machines usually work in a non-stationary operating condition; both speed and load are varying over a wide range (e.g. wind turbine). So, in order to solve this dilemma, we propose using the energy ratio between residual signal and deterministic periodic signal which is separated by autoregressive model as the condition indicator for fault diagnosis and prognosis. The effectiveness of this feature is demonstrated and compared to other traditional features using two run-to-failure data sets of gearbox collected in laboratory.

To the best of our knowledge, few papers have focused on the joint decision for critical component spare parts ordering and replacement with prognostic information. In this paper we present an integrated decision model for jointly determining the condition-based replacement and critical component spare parts ordering decisions for a functioning component subject to condition monitoring. To do this, the degradation path of the component is modelled using a Wiener process, and the parameters are updated through the combination of the Bayesian method and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm using real-time CM data. The probability density function (PDF) and cumulative density function (CDF) of the remaining useful life (RUL) are derived, which are then utilized to update the integrated decisions. The main advantage in our proposed decision-making model is that the prognostic information is fully utilized for joint decisions. An additional advantage lies in the updating mechanism of the RUL which enables the integrated decisions to be updated based on in-situ sensor data. The proposed integrated decision model is validated by a numerical example.

Limited by technology and time etc., it is very difficult to model, analyse, and estimate the reliability of an Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifier by means of traditional methods, since Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifiers are characterized by small sample size and long life, and it is hard to get large samples of the failure criteria in a short time. However, the failure criteria of the product are created by combining the Physics of Failure (PoF) analysis and the information from historic data about failed products. Based on the degradation trends and the failure criteria, the storage lifetime of the product can be predicted. Degradation of GaAs microwave device nearly related to stability of device's metallization which includes gate contact and ohmic contact. This article establishes a performance degradation model based on failure physics with uncertain activation energy. High temperature accelerant strass life test was performed on GaAs device to calculation the activation energy, and then uses the performance data and scanty life data to estimate the storage lifetime based on the new model. The instance analysis proves that the failure-physics-analysis-based method for the Intermediate Frequency (IF) amplifier is more effective in life forecast and consistent with engineering facts than the fake-life-based method.

This paper investigates the relationship between ApEn and different failure modes of bearings. It is shown that. ApEn values decrease with the degradation of bearing defects. After introducing the theoretical background, experimental analysis are presented to quantify variation of ApEn values as a measure for defect mode and severity. A life cycle experiment is introduced to evaluate a defect growth precondition model based on regression analysis and Genetic Algorithm. Results show that ApEn is effective for bearing defect diagnosis and remaining service life prognosis.

Advanced gas turbine asset and performance management	MODERN GAS TURBINE SYSTEMS: HIGH EFFICIENCY, LOW EMISSION, FUEL FLEXIBLE POWER GENERATION	Woodhead Publishing Series in Energy		English	Article; Book Chapter						gas turbine degradation; deterioration; data fusion; gas path analysis and management; remote monitoring centres; diagnostics; prognostics		A gas turbine degrades with use. The causes of degradation can often be related to the operating environment of the machine. Its consequent performance and other symptoms and changes are outlined in this chapter. Instrumentation in the engine can give, through a suitable analysis, useful clues that can benefit rectification of the causes of degradation. The interpretation of the information can be done effectively through specialist centres that can, remotely, receive information from different plants distributed widely geographically. They can handle disparate types of data coming through a range of streams. These features place complex requirements on information processing, analysis, staff preparation and management practice. This gives rise to the seven levels of gas path management: sensor, control and supervision, condition monitoring, performance and health assessment, prognostics, decision support and, finally, asset management.

A reliable online bearing fault-diagnostic technique is critically needed to prevent motor system's performance degradation and malfunction. Motor bearing failure induces vibration, resulting in the modulation of the stator current. Compared with conventional monitoring techniques such as vibration monitoring or temperature monitoring, stator current -based monitoring offers significant economic benefits and implementation advantages. In this paper, a novel approach to locomotive traction motor current signature analysis based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) of stator current is presented. The effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method is verified by locomotive running tests.

Maintenance operations are fundamental in granting machineries and processes energy saving, given the capability of optimising them thanks to a predictive model. To ensure that the plant achieved the desired performance it needs a track performance on maintenance operations and maintenance results. In addition it needs the relationship between the inputs of the maintenance process and the outcomes in terms of total contribution to manufacturing performance and objectives. Deterioration of manufacturing systems' condition, and hence its capability, begins to take place as soon as the system is commissioned. In addition to normal wear and deterioration, other failures may occur especially when the equipment are pushed beyond their design limits or due to operational errors. As a result, equipment downtime, quality problems, energy losses, safety hazards or environmental pollution become the obvious outcomes. All these outcomes have the potential to impact negatively the operating cost, profitability, customers' demand satisfaction, and productivity among other important performance requirements. The developed model in this study is an integration of a probabilistic and a deterministic model based on balanced cost and benefits. Through the adoption of this model it has been possible to support decision making for the maximization of energy efficiency by optimizing maintenance interventions and operative procedures. This is described through the application to a case study: the optimisation of maintenance operations in energy consuming equipment in the production process of bituminous materials, based on the energy consumption data from the field and a part of the results are illustrated in this work.

Analysis of vibration signals generated by gear in mesh has shown its usefulness in industrial gearbox condition monitoring. Vibration measurement provides a very efficient way of monitoring the dynamic conditions of a machine such as gearbox. Various vibration analysis methods have been proposed and applied to gear fault detection. Most of the traditional signal analysis techniques are based on the stationary assumption. Such techniques can only provide analyses in terms of the statistical average in the time or frequency domain, but can not reveal the local features in both time and frequency domains simultaneously. Frequency/quefrency analysis, time/statistical analysis, time-frequency analysis and cyclostationarity analysis are reviewed in regard for stationary and non-stationary operations. The use of vibration signal processing detection techniques is classified and discussed. The capability of each technique, fundamental principles, advantages and disadvantages and practical application for gear faults detection have been examined by literature review.

There are a lot of studies about effects of the cage faults on motor performance. Especially, the effects of the cage faults on the motor parameters such as current, torque and speed are well known. Unlike the literature, cage fault effects on efficiency are analyzed in this study. Furthermore, fluctuations and mean value changes resulting from the rotor faults are ranked according to size of these faults. Healthy and five different faults were investigated by using 10 HP, 25 HP, 30 HP and 50 HP submersible induction motors in both simulations and experiments. Time stepping finite element method solution was used to compute motor quantities in the simulation. Good agreement was achieved between simulation and experimental results. The effects of rotor faults on motor efficiency were clearly ranked according to size of faults.

Cancer is featured by an irregular, unmanageable growth that may demolish and attack neighboring healthy body tissues or somewhere else in the body. Microarray based gene expression profiling has been emerged as an efficient technique for cancer classification, as well as for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment purposes. In recent years, DNA microarray technique has gained more attraction in both scientific and in industrial fields. It showed great importance in determining the informative genes that can cause the cancer. This led to improvements in early cancer diagnosis and in giving effective chemotherapy treatment. Studding cancer microarray gene expression data is a challenging task because microarray is high dimensional-low sample dataset with a lot of noisy or irrelevant genes and missing data. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study that focuses on exploring the main objectives and approaches that have been applied using cancer microarray gene expression profile. We proceed by making a classification for all approaches, and then conclude by investigating the most efficient approaches that can be used in this field.

In this paper, a new fault diagnosis method based on genetic algorithm and support vector machine (GA-SVM) is proposed. We design fault mode and collect the fault datasets on the basis of a quad high pass filter circuit. Wavelet packet analysis is employed to extract fault samples information. Sampled data's dimension is further reduced by Principal Component Analysis(PCA). To improve the efficiency of SVM, we use GA to search optimized parameters for its kernel function. After being trained with sampled data, the optimized SVM can steadily classify circuit faults. Simulation results show that the new algorithm classifies circuit faults at an accuracy of 92.69%. Our approach provides a new direction for analog circuit fault diagnosis.

This data provides a unique insight into immunological status at the point of tumour removal, tumour classification and post-operative survival. We build on existing research on clustering and machine learning facets of this data to demonstrate a role for an ensemble approach to highlighting patients with clearer prognosis parameters. Results for survival prediction using 3 different approaches are shown for a subset of the data which is most difficult to model. The performance of each model individually is compared with subsets of the data where some agreement is reached for multiple models. Significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters are used for signal denoising, with a resulting noise index being developed. By comparing the noise index with a power index (also derived in the paper), obtained from the detection of transients using a spectral analysis of the rate-of-change of unit power, three operational conditions are identifiable viz. normal operation, transient operation and operation when subject to emerging machine faults. The accommodation of transient operational conditions of the unit, so as not to create excessive 'false alerts', provides a valuable alternative to more traditional techniques, based on PCA for instance, that can only provide reliable information during steady-state operation. The efficacy of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through the use of experimental trials on sub-15MW gas turbines.

In the algorithm, contribution coefficient and contribution limit were proposed to find protruding frequency components which have greater contribution to the frequency spectrum changes than other frequency components. The algorithm firstly divides the signal frequency spectrum into several bands. Secondly, in every frequency band the algorithm selects all the protruding frequency components and computes their RMS value. Thirdly the algorithm combines the RMS values of all frequency bands to construct a multi-dimensional vector as a fault feature. At last the algorithm uses the fault feature vectors got from historical signals to construct the SVM training sample set, and obtains SVM classifier which can be used in turbopump real-time fault detection. We used some historical vibration acceleration signals of a certain type of turbopump to validate the algorithm. The test results showed that the algorithm met the demands of accuracy and real-time ability.

Herein, SVM-HMM is a good method for dynamic continuous data which indentifies multiple kinds of faults with only one uniform discriminative model instead of multiple ones. A benchmark of Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP), a chemical engineering problem, is carried out to generate datasets to examine the performance of our new method.

But the single classifier cannot achieve satisfactory recognition rate and anti-interference ability. An aircraft engine fault diagnosis method based on support vector machine multiple classifiers is proposed in this paper. Firstly, sample characteristic information which constitutes the fault feature vectors obtained from the existing engine fault. Then, after training the SVM multiple classifier by faulty feature vectors, the SVM model of the fault diagnosis system is established; Finally, the trained SVM multiple classifier is used to recognize and classify the test faults. Applying the noise on the test samples, SVM multiple classifiers can still get a good diagnosis effect. It shows that the fault diagnosis algorithm has good robustness and can be applied to the study of aero engine fault diagnosis.

Use of powerful signal processing technique like CWT drastically reduces the hardware (sensor) requirement of the diagnostic system. Only axial vibration signal is enough to classify seven different types of motor faults. Moreover, successful application of Rough Set theory has enabled to select most relevant CWT scales and corresponding coefficients. Thus, the inherent deficiencies and limitations of CWT are eliminated. Consequently, the computational efficiency has also improved to a great extend. With reduction of attributes by 65%, the classification accuracy of the classifiers is very consistent even in presence of high level of noise and with a low frequency sampling frequency of 5120 Hz.

The time domain features are extracted from the segments of the experimental dataset for known machine conditions. The dataset has been subjected to somewhat preprocessing previous to feature extraction. The ANN consists of five input nodes, one hidden layer with five nodes and four output nodes. Each of five input nodes represents root mean square, variance, skewness, kurtosis and normalized sixth central moment of the time domain vibration signals, respectively. Four binary nodes in the output layer specify the bearing condition: normal, outer race defect, inner race defect or ball defect. The ANN is trained using back propagation algorithm with a subset of the time domain features. The ANN is tested using the remaining set of the time domain features. Training and test success are used to evaluate efficiency of the presented method. The results indicate the effectiveness of the time domain features in diagnosis of bearing failures with high accuracy and low computation.

In measurement and information processing aspects, this system has the multiple functions, such as multi-channel signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, numerical feature extraction of machine faults and fault knowledge protection in database. In control aspect, the rotating speed of the rotor is regulated by a variable-frequency motor and an inverter connected to a computer through a R5232 to R5485 converter. The other motor which provides motive power to the lubrication system is controlled by the control circuit based on a relay which receives control signals from the computer. The implementation results show that the system is very effective for condition monitoring, automatic control and intelligent maintenance of the machine equipments.

In this work, the proposed method firstly employs the local mean decomposition (LMD) algorithm to decompose the raw vibration signals into a small number of product functions (PFs), and then, the energy of each useful PF is computed and normalized to form an original feature vector; so an original data table about machine faults can be constructed via these feature vectors; subsequently; the table are processed using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) to extract the principal feature and compute the corresponding feature values; lastly; the low-dimensional features and their values are input into least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for fault identification. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the fault features and can accurately identify the different machine faults.

Kernel spectral clustering for predicting maintenance of industrial machines	2013 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA MINING (CIDM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM)	APR 16-19, 2013	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			PROCESS FAULT-DETECTION; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; DIAGNOSIS	Early and accurate fault detection in modern industrial machines is crucial in order to minimize downtime, increase the safety of plant operations, and reduce manufacturing costs. The process monitoring techniques that have been most effective in practice are based on the analysis of historical process data. In this paper we present a novel approach that uses Kernel Spectral Clustering (KSC) on the sensor data to distinguish between normal operating condition and abnormal situations. In other words, the main contribution is to show how KSC can be a valid tool also for outlier detection, a field where other techniques are more popular. KSC is a state-of-the-art unsupervised learning technique with out-of-sample ability and a systematic model selection scheme. Thanks to the abovementioned characteristics and the capability of discovering complex clustering boundaries, KSC is able to detect in advance the need of maintenance actions in the analyzed machine.

In particular we focus on developing machine learning algorithms for detecting documents that contain descriptions of systematic failures and root causes to the faults. We developed a machine algorithm based on entropy analysis to extract an A-word list, a list of words that are important to characterize the documents of interests, a vector space model to represent features of important documents, and a constraint based k-means clustering algorithm to generate high purity clusters for use in detecting important documents. We applied the algorithms to automotive diagnostic text data, which are unstructured and verbatim descriptions by customers and technicians that contain many typos and self-invented terms. We were able to reduce a list of 2183 words to a list of 137 important words. The classification system generated by these machine learning algorithms showed high recall and accuracy in detecting important diagnostic descriptions.

In the algorithm, nonnegative matrix factorization was employed for dimensionality reduction of the time-frequency spectral images. An artificial immune based classification model was constructed by means of training of data samples mapped into low-dimensional space to recognize the machine conditions and diagnose faults. Experimental results on the fault classification of diesel valve train demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Compared with probabilistic neural network classifiers, the hybrid classifier achieves better fault diagnosis performance.

A novel approach for incipient faults in analog circuits is proposed. Firstly, the statistical property feature vector, which is composed of range, mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, entropy and centroid, is used to reflect the global property of output response. Then, the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) is used for diagnostics of the incipient faults in analog circuits. Traditionally, multi-fault diagnosis for analog circuits based on SVM usually uses a single feature vector to train all binary SVM classifier. However, in fact, each binary SVM classifier has different classification accuracy for different feature vectors. Therefore, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to select a near-optimal feature vector and decrease the dimensions of the feature vector for each binary classifier. The experiment results show as following: (1) The accuracy using the near-optimal feature vectors is better than the accuracy using a single vector; (2) The consuming time of the near-optimal feature vectors selected by MD based on PSO is reduced about 98% in comparison to the time of the optimal feature vectors selected by the exhaustive method.

This method is improved based on related nonlinear degradation Autoregressive (AR) data-driven prognostics model considering an improved scale nonlinear degradation factor. Then a combination is implemented between the proposed factor and data-driven AR model named nonlinear scale degradation parameter based AR (NSDP-AR) model for better nonlinear prediction ability. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to obtain the specific factor for certain kind of battery. In order to promote the modified model, a remaining useful life (RUL) prognostic framework using Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA) will be established.

It intends to mitigate the sources of uncertainty of software testing processes, by learning from past experience and, at the same time, adapting the technique selection to the current testing session. The method is based on machine learning strategies. It uses offline strategies to take historical information into account about the techniques performance collected in past testing sessions; then, online strategies are used to adapt the selection of test cases to the data observed as the testing proceeds. Experimental results show that techniques performance can be accurately characterized from features of the past testing sessions, by means of machine learning algorithms, and that integrating this result into the online algorithm allows improving the fault detection effectiveness with respect to single testing techniques, as well as to their random combination.

Shrinking process geometries, with their corresponding reduction in device lifetimes, have broad implications to critical applications having long intended design lifetimes and are a major concern to the long-term reliability of safety-critical systems in aerospace and automotive applications. Common semiconductor failure modes include, among others, time-dependent dielectric breakdown (T D D B), hot carrier injection (HCI) damage, and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI). Die-level prognostic test structures can detect and help mitigate untimely failures in critical systems. These test structures, with variance measurement capabilities, also provide an effective platform for improved process-aware design for improved yields. This tutorial addresses concepts of in-situ test structures as a solution to product yield enhancement, process reliability qualification and reliability monitoring throughout the lifetime of the product and include practical application examples.

The Influence of Inverter-Based DGs and Their Controllers on Distribution Network Protection	2013 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society	OCT 06-11, 2013	Lake Buena Vista, FL	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE		Adaptive relaying; current controllers; fault characteristics; distributed generation; voltage source inverters; voltage controllers	FAULT CURRENT CONTRIBUTION; COMMUNICATION; MACHINE; RELAY	The ever growing penetration of distributed generation (DG) in a distribution network has a profound impact on the network protection and stability. Traditional protection schemes and algorithms need to be extensively investigated as more and more DGs get introduced into the network. The current version of IEEE Std 1547 does not present a comprehensive solution for fault current detection in the presence of various kinds of DGs. Power electronic inverter-based DGs are of special concern in distribution network protection as they are often incapable of providing sufficient fault current and their controllers play a principal role in the DG behavior. In this paper, the effects of voltage and current controllers for inverter-based DGs on industrial and commercial power system distribution network protection schemes are investigated. It is shown that the type of controller and its design parameters during the fault have a direct impact on fault current levels and duration. A simplified distribution network model with inverter-based DG operating under voltage and current control modes was tested to verify the effects of these controllers. This paper also proposes an adaptive relaying algorithm to detect the faults in the presence of inverter-based DGs with various types of controllers.

As motors grow larger, industry has become increasingly reliant on technologies to detect rotor faults via online prognostics and arrange optimal maintenance intervals to increase productivity. Traditional broken rotor bar fault detection algorithms have historically relied largely on monitoring changes in the stator current spectra. This often results in nuisance warnings when the motor operates at different load levels, or when baseline data at healthy motor operations are not available. To address this issue, a fault severity evaluation technique is introduced in this paper to detect rotor cage failures using only current and voltage measurements, plus selected motor nameplate data and motor's geometric dimensions. The fault severity index can indicate the possibility of a rotor cage fault even in the absence of baseline data. This guarantees the algorithm's reliability in practical applications. In addition, a decision-making system, including an adaptive filter and fuzzy logic, is proposed to warn the user in the case of a rotor cage failure. Experimental results show that the proposed fault severity evaluation algorithm can reliably reflect the rotor cage status under different operating conditions, which can be further applied in the detection of rotor cage failures.

While some of the recorded road incidents in these studies have their roots in distracting events (such as mobile phone usage) a large proportion of recorded road incidents can be attributed to more elusive driver inattention factors not linked to specific trigger events. These distraction categories are especially challenging and currently not in focus of current research as they are difficult to detect and address by suitable prognostic measures, in order to improve road safety. To contribute to this issue, this paper presents research into monitoring drivers' mental states in real-time, using objective measurements. We propose an iterative research methodology where specific mental states are elicited, user response captured experimentally, and interaction models built using advanced machine learning techniques. Behavioral measures such as speech, eye activity or posture, and physiological measures such as galvanic skin response or heart rate provide input features for the models. This driver-centric approach addresses the complex issue of driver inattention, and can help improve road safety through active monitoring of road users, customized decision support in the vehicle, and objective training feedback. Low-fidelity simulators we have built allowed us to roll out some preliminary tasks prompting encouraging feedback from subjects during informal testing.

Recently, PHM systems are emerging in the automotive industry. In the commercial vehicle sector, reducing the maintenance cost and downtime while also improving the reliability of vehicle components can have a major impact on fleet performance and hence business competitiveness. Nowadays, telematics and GPS are used mainly for fleet tracking and diagnostics purposes. Increased numbers of sensors installed on commercial vehicles, advancement of data analytics and computational intelligence methods, increased capabilities for on-board data processing as well as in the cloud, are creating an opportunity for PHM systems to be deployed on commercial vehicles and hence improve the overall operational efficiency.

Extensive automated testing and code inspections may mitigate their effect, but some code fragments are necessarily more likely to be faulty than others, and automated identification of fault prone modules helps to focus testing and inspections, thus limiting wasted effort and potentially improving detection rates. However, software metrics data is often extremely noisy, with enormous imbalances in the size of the positive and negative classes. In this work, we present a new approach to predictive modelling of fault proneness in software modules, introducing a new feature representation to overcome some of these issues. This rank sum representation offers improved or at worst comparable performance to earlier approaches for standard data sets, and readily allows the user to choose an appropriate trade-off between precision and recall to optimise inspection effort to suit different testing environments. The method is evaluated using the NASA Metrics Data Program (MDP) data sets, and performance is compared with existing studies based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) Classifiers, and with our own comprehensive evaluation of these methods.

Data-Driven Prognostics Based on Health Indicator Construction: Application to PRONOSTIA's Data	2013 EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	European Control Conference (ECC)	JUL 17-19, 2013	ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	European Control Assoc, IFAC, IEEE, CSS	ETH Zurich		OPPORTUNITIES; DIAGNOSTICS; CHALLENGES; SYSTEMS	Failure prognostics can help improving the availability and reliability of industrial systems while reducing their maintenance cost. The main purpose of failure prognostics is the anticipation of the time of a failure by estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In this case, the fault is not undergone and the estimated RUL can be used to take appropriate decisions depending on the future exploitation of the industrial system. This paper presents a data-driven prognostic method based on the utilization of signal processing techniques and regression models. The method is applied on accelerated degradations of bearings performed under the experimental platform called PRONOSTIA. The purpose of the proposed method is to generate a health indicator, which will be used to calculate the RUL. Two acceleration sensors are used on PRONOSTIA platform to monitor the degradation evolution of the tested bearings. The vibration signals related to the degraded bearings are then compared to a nominal vibration signal of a nondegraded bearing (nominal bearing). The comparison between the signals is done by calculating a correlation coefficient (which is considered as the health indicator). The values of the calculated correlation coefficient are then fitted to a regression model which is used to estimate the RUL.

The robust TTSC fault detection, fault diagnosis and fault protection technique requires better understanding of BLSG behaviour during such conditions. This paper presents modelling of the BLSG with TTSC fault on the stator phase winding. The BLSG is a complex system, a simplified approach is presented in this paper for modelling and simulation of the BLSG with TTSC fault, to analyse the machine behaviour under various degree of TTSC faults. The simulation results show that the developed model is able to exhibit the dynamic and steady state behaviour of the BLSG under healthy and TTSC fault conditions.	[Sivakumar, Nadarajan; Panda, S.

The technique that we propose proceed by incorporating a new distance based on qualitative trend analysis into Mean shift clustering algorithm. Mean shift clustering is a powerful non-parametric technique that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters and does not constrain the shape of the clusters. Trend analysis is a data-driven semi-quantitative technique that has been used for process monitoring and fault detection and diagnosis. The performances of our approach are assesed through synthetic banana shaped data. Unsupervised clustering is then applied for intelligent decision-making process specifically for fault diagnosis on Tennessee Easteman Process (TEP) challenge.

The behavior of a HDES is stratified, resulting in a hierarchy of cohabiting sub-DESs, each one living its own life. The communication between subsystems at different levels of abstraction relies on complex events, occurring when specific patterns of transitions are matched. Separation of concerns is achieved and the expressive power of diagnosis, which is scalable and context-sensitive, is enhanced.

Closed-Loop Bandwidth Impact on MVSA for Rotor Broken Bar Diagnosis in IRFOC Double Squirrel Cage Induction Motor Drives	2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLEAN ELECTRICAL POWER (ICCEP): RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES IMPACT			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)	JUN 11-13, 2013	Alghero, ITALY	Univ Birmingham, Politecnico Milano, Dipartimento Elettrotecnica, IEEE, IES, ANAE		AC Machine; Condition monitoring; double cage rotor; rotor broken bar; induction motor drives	FAULTS; FIELD	This paper investigates the detectability of rotor broken bars in indirect rotor flux oriented control (IRFOC) for variable speed double cage induction motor drives, using vibration signature analysis techniques. The Impact of the closed loop control system cannot be neglected when the detection of rotor asymmetries in the machine is based on the signature analysis of electrical or mechanical variables. Therefore, the investigation of rotor fault components for different bandwidths of closed-loop regulators is necessary to evaluate its relevance in the above listed variables. This paper investigates the impact of the control system on relevance of the fault components computed from axial and radial vibration signals. Experimental results show the validity of this impact, and more specifically, the bandwidth PI regulators. Due to its relevance, axial vibration analysis shows a more robust fault signature, under the control impact, in separating healthy from rotor bar breakage in double squirrel cage induction motors.

Rotor Demagnetization Diagnosis in Five-Phase Surface-Mounted Permanent Magnet Generators under Time-Varying Conditions	2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLEAN ELECTRICAL POWER (ICCEP): RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES IMPACT			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)	JUN 11-13, 2013	Alghero, ITALY	Univ Birmingham, Politecnico Milano, Dipartimento Elettrotecnica, IEEE, IES, ANAE		Five-phase Permanent magnet generators; permanent magnets; fault diagnosis; wavelet transform	MOTORS	Multiphase Permanent-Magnet Generators are an attractive alternative to induction machines for a variety of applications owing to their reliability and dynamic performance, suited for emerging applications such as automotive or traction systems. In this context, diagnosing the status of the rotor magnets is crucial for improving the reliability of the generators. This paper is focused on the demagnetization of the rotor magnet trailing edges, due to large stator currents, in five-phase surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous generators under Time-varying conditions. In this context, the classical application of Fourier analysis for processing the back-emf induced in the alpha-beta planes fails as the fault components intended to be monitored to assess the magnets status are spread in a bandwidth proportional to the speed variation. In this paper, a simple and effective method based on Wavelet Transform analysis of the back-emf induced in the alpha-beta planes is presented, that allows the diagnosis of rotor demagnetization for multiphase surface-mounted permanent magnet generator under speed-varying conditions. The proposed approach is validated by means of two dimensional (2-D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and numerical simulations. Moreover, a fault index, periodically calculated, is introduced to assess the healthy condition of the machine.

Despite the progress made in the literature, challenges remain in how to assess performance related information for maintenance decision-making from large data streams. Furthermore, since roller bearings operate under various regimes (e. g., speed and load), it is not trivial to consider the effect of regime changes in the modeling in order to reduce false alarms. The paper describes a multi-model approach to monitor the condition of roller bearings under different operating regimes. Two modeling approaches for anomaly and degradation monitoring are proposed to automatically retrieve information from the data. A self-organizing map (SOM) and a support vector machines (SVM) are used comparatively for the evaluation of a bearing degradation in time (i.e., a dynamic health indicator) and for the determination of changes in the tracked features. The proposed method is validated using data from multiple bearings of the same type.

In system prognostics, fault degradation models are necessarily established to describe the fault evolution dynamics and used to extrapolate the future health conditions. However, it is very challenging to build an accurate fault degradation model considering the complex fault growth dynamics and numerous modeling uncertainties, such as unit to unit variation. Particularly, in data driven modeling methods, the variations of loading conditions, environments and usage patterns will influence greatly the fault modeling accuracy. Some research has been conducted to tackle this problem by utilizing real-time monitoring data to update the fault model in terms of model parameters and even model structures to accommodate these varying factors. But whenever new data are available, it becomes difficult to determine how to retain the prior learned model while also learning new fault degradation dynamics. That is, how to learn new knowledge without forgetting what was learned previously. In this paper, we develop a new model update and fusion method for prognostics by using incremental learning. A case study is given to validate the developed approach via the battery degradation data.

These systems require new paradigms to assure availability and quality of service. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in assuring Availability and Quality of Service in a Cloud Based Application System. We propose machine learning techniques for monitoring systems logs to assess the health of the system. A web services data set is employed to show that variety of services can be clustered to different service classes using a k-means clustering scheme. Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) logs and Job logs dataset from high performance computing system is employed to show that impending fatal errors in the system can be predicted from the logs using an SVM classifier. These approaches illustrate the feasibility of methods to monitor the systems health and performance of compute resources and hence can be used to manage these systems for high availability and quality of service for critical tasks such as health care monitoring in the cloud.

A set of well known computational intelligence techniques such as Decision Trees, Fuzzy Logic, and Genetic Algorithms is used to generate a hybrid model which is called Genetic Fuzzy Rule-Based System (GFRBS) supported by a Decision Tree. The proposed method automatically generates fuzzy rules and tunes the associated membership functions. Accuracy and improved interpretability are achieved during training since they are coded in the fitness function used by the genetic algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to a case study of degradation of aeronautical engines. The task is to estimate the remaining useful life of a commercial aircraft engine using only historical data gathered by the sensors embedded in the engine.

The aim of this paper is to present a novel feature extraction procedure to face with these two problems. Two aspects are considered. Firstly, the paper focuses on feature extraction in a new manner by utilizing trigonometric functions to extract features (health indicators) rather than typical statistic measures like RMS, etc. The proposed approach is applied on time-frequency analysis with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Secondly, a simple way of building new features based on cumulative functions is also proposed in order to transform time series into descriptors that depict accumulated wear. This approach can be extended to other types of features. The main idea of both developments is to map raw data with monotonic features with early trends, i.e., with descriptors that can be easily predicted. This methodology can enhance prognostics modeling and RUL prediction. The whole proposition is illustrated and discussed thanks to tests performed on vibration datasets from PRONOSTIA, an experimental platform that enables accelerated degradation of bearings.

Automatic and pervasive data recording creates a wealth of condition assessment data that couples with operational history to yield a data store rich in opportunity for data driven prognostics as well as model development. Storing, managing, scoring, and otherwise utilizing this new found wealth of machinery condition indicators challenges the prognostics designer. Implementation of new and existing prognostic algorithms and techniques in an automated and useful way are the challenge of the day.

It is based on the complementarity between a model-based approach accounting for uncertainties aimed at quantifying the degradation modes signatures and a data-driven approach aimed at recalibrating the healthy syndrome from measures. Because of the computational time costs of uncertainties propagation into the physics based model, a surrogate modeling technic called Kriging associated to Latin hypercube sampling is utilized. The hybrid approach is tested on a pumping unit of an aircraft engine and shows good results for computing the degradation modes signatures and performing their detection and identification.

Although many attempts to predict time to failure have been reported in the literature, there are still challenges related to data availability and methodology. In addition, there is significant variation from case to case due to complexity of system usage and failure modes. This paper reveals various aspects related to such challenges experienced while applying a novel predictive technology to a spindle test-bed. The goal was to evaluate the ability of the technology to predict the remaining useful life of a bearing with seeded faults. Testing has been conducted to reveal the effectiveness of signal processing, health modeling and prediction techniques. While conducting the evaluation tests, besides some well-known bearing failure modes, an unusual case was recorded. This atypical bearing failure mode created a new challenge for the predictive technology being investigated, which prompted the development of an advanced feature discovering methodology using genetic programming. This new methodology and the technology evaluation results obtained for both the well-known and the atypical failure modes will be discussed in the paper. In addition, the paper will describe the test-bed and instrumentation approach, the data acquisition system and the experimental design for testing and validation of the technology.

Many machine learning algorithms and statistical methods can not only realize the RUL prediction but also provide the probability density function (PDF) as the prognostic uncertainty representation, involving particle filter (PF), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), etc. This paper presents a fusion RUL prediction approach with PF algorithm and data-driven autoregression (AR) algorithm for lithium-ion battery. Moreover, a framework to quantitatively analyze and evaluate the PDF distribution of the lithium-ion battery RUL prediction is presented. The probability confidence interval estimation, PDF histogram and distribution hypothesis test are included in quantifying the uncertainty. These quantitative analysis results can be meaningful for lithium-ion battery health management and maintenance. The experimental results with the battery data of NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository show that the proposed framework can achieve the quantification of PDF to introduce the reference for the corresponding maintenance and management. The proposed work also shows potential prospective for industrial application.

This paper presents the application of PHM methods as a proactive and predictive means to enable new warranty approaches. Warranty service is typically performed after the occurrence of failure. However, with the implementation of the predictive and proactive warranty strategies enabled by PHM, companies can make decisions for warranty returns up front. The prognostics-based warranty models developed in this paper include part-based warranty return, lifetime warranty, and customized extended warranty, and a case study of warranty validation and user abuse detection is also provided. The results of this work can increase the competitiveness of businesses by reshaping their warranty policies, improving their maintenance practices under warranty, and reducing their warranty costs.

Perfect maintenance actions restore completely the system to the 'as good as new' state. Their related cost are however often high. Imperfect preventive maintenance restores partially the system with reduced maintenance cost. Nevertheless, the restoration quality may depend not only on the allocated maintenance cost, the system age but also on the total number of imperfect maintenance actions executed since the last replacement time of the system. The first objective of the paper is to model imperfect maintenance actions. The second objective is to propose an adaptive maintenance policy which can help to select optimally maintenance actions (perfect or imperfect actions), if needed, at each inspection time using the remaining useful life (RUL) prognosis. To illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed maintenance policy, different sensitivity studies are analyzed and discussed through a numerical example.

However, AE sensors have not yet been applied widely in real applications. Firstly, in comparison with other sensors such as vibration, AE sensors require much higher sampling rate. The characteristic frequency of AE signals generally falls into the range of 100 kHz to several MHz, which requires a sampling system with at least 5MHz sampling rate. Secondly, the storage and computational burden for large volume of AE data is tremendous. Thirdly, AE signal generally contains certain non-stationary behaviors which make traditional frequency analysis ineffective. In this paper, a frequency reduction technique and a modified time synchronous average (TSA) based signal processing method are proposed to identify gear fault using AE signals. Heterodyne technique commonly used in communication is employed to preprocess the AE signals before sampling. By heterodyning, the AE signal frequency is down shifted from several hundred kHz to below 50 kHz. Then a low sampling rate comparable to that of vibration sensors could be applied to sample the AE signals. After that, a modified tachometer less TSA method is adopted to further analyze the AE signal feature. Instead of performing TSA on the raw signals, the time synchronous averaging of the first order harmonic signal is obtained and analyzed. With the presented method, no tachometer or real time phase reference signal is required. The TSA reference signal is directly obtained from AE signals. By examining the smoothness of obtained wave form, a noticeable discontinuity or irregularity could be easily observed for gear fault diagnosis. AE data collected from seeded fault tests on a gearbox are used to validate the proposed method. The analysis results of the tests have shown that the proposed method could reliably and accurately detect the tooth fault.

In these applications, incorporating prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques provide systems with capabilities to self assess performance, determine the advent of failure and mitigate system risks. However, the prognostics problem for electronic systems is still approached from a component-centric-view. Extending a component-centric approach to an electronic system becomes complex and is often not worth the cost of pursuit due to the imbalance between scalability and efficiency of the prognostics approach. In order to address this problem, we propose a circuit-centric approach as an alternative method for realizing prognostics at an electronic system-level. The proposed approach is developed from the idea of decomposing a system into multiple critical circuits, and exploiting the parameters specific to the system's circuitries for predicting failure. Furthermore, a method is developed for detecting the gradual degradation of an electronic system by defining a health indicator to represent the system's health state at any given time. In this paper, we provide a formulation of the electronic system-level prognostics problem and demonstrate the approach on an electronic system for filtering analog signals.

Each valid scenario is associated with a specific progression model built based on ARIMA time series analysis approach. The forecast model is determined by merging the current scenario progression model with the progression model associated with most similar past scenario.

The diagnosis of hydraulic pump is very crucial for reliability. This paper studies on a Chaotic Parallel Support Vector Machine (CPSVM) and employs it for fault diagnosis of hydraulic pump. The CPSVM combines the chaos theory and a number of SVMs connected in parallel. Phase-space reconstruction of chaos theory is utilized to determine the dimension of input vectors for each SVM. Each SVM has an output. A weighted sum of each output is considered as the output of the CPSVM. To diagnose faults of hydraulic pump, a residual error generator is designed based on the CPSVM. This residual error generator is firstly trained using data from normal state. Then, it can be used for fault clustering by analysis of the residual error. Its performance and effectiveness has also been validated via a plunger pump test-bed.

In the last three decades various fault diagnosis techniques has been developed but these techniques are considered intrusive as they require accessability to motor for data collection. Also the electromechanical devices, sensors and integrated circuits used in these techniques are expensive and not reliable. Special attention is given to non-invasive techniques to detect defects without accessing the machines. This paper attempts to provide a new approach for condition monitoring of AC motors through intelligent fault diagnosis based on programmable logic controllers. The stator current analysis which is non-invasive and economical method is used with LabVIEW signal processing tools. The current signal is analyzed via Fast Fourier Power spectrum to detect the bearing faults at incipient stages. The technique is validated at three different speeds.

This emphasizes the need for effective maintenance planning. The improvement in maintenance technology relies on predictive maintenance, which is based on the determination of a machine condition while in operation. Maintenance planning is complex problem involving condition monitoring and expert knowledge. In the paper, an intelligent approach to optimal predictive maintenance strategy defining is proposed. It is based on methodology for predictive maintenance that increases reliability by determining the optimal maintenance strategy. For the goal, an algorithm based on cost-benefit analysis and optimization tasks solution is developed. The proposed approach to optimal predictive maintenance is demonstrated on the example of real vibrating feeder data. The results of numerical illustration show the applicability of intelligent decision making for optimal predictive maintenance strategy defining.

Diagnosis of Stator Short-Circuit Faults In an IPM Synchronous Machine Using a Space-Vector Pendulous Oscillation Method	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES & DRIVES CONFERENCE (IEMDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)	MAY 12-15, 2013	Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc		turn-to-turn fault; fault resistance; diagnostics; pendulous oscillation; current spectrum; negative sequence	TURN SHORT CIRCUITS; INDUCTION MACHINES	Experimental characterization of interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machines experiencing winding short-circuit faults is necessary in developing diagnostics indices to be used in detecting short-circuit winding faults. Known fault indices include the current spectrum analysis, the negative-sequence components method, and the space-vector based pendulous oscillation method. This paper applies all three methods to experimental turn-to-turn short-circuit fault data acquired from a 3.5 hp IPM motor energized by a PWM voltage source inverter. The results are compared and analyzed, and since none of the three methods presented unambiguously demonstrate the existence of a winding short-circuit fault, the practical difficulties of short-circuit fault detection and mitigation are discussed in that light.

The prognostic circuit is composed of stress and detection module, two-stage comparator, offset voltage cancellation module, non-overlapping clock generation module, and output module. When the increase amount of resistance for interconnect line exceeds a preset value due to electromigration, the output of the prognostic circuit designed to fail faster will jump from low voltage to high voltage. It indicates the impending failure of hosted circuit because of that the prognostic circuit experiences the same manufacturing process and operational environment as the hosted circuit. The research results are useful for the prediction of performance degradation and failure of integrated circuit.	[Chen, Y. Q.; Wang, B.; En, Y. F.; Huang, Y.; Lu, Y. D.; Wang, X.

Photovoltaic modules diagnostic: an overview	39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna Univ Technol		Photovoltaic systems; monitoring systems; PV module level diagnostics	PV MODULES; PERFORMANCE; DEGRADATION; ALGORITHM; ARRAYS; SYSTEM	Diagnostic functions will be making the difference in photovoltaic systems. The need of a daily, monthly and yearly quantification of the energy produced by a plant is a feature required by the customers for comparing the actual performances of their system with the expected values in order to quantify the real return on investment time. In some cases, monitoring facilities are offered by the producers of the power processing system but some companies also offer power production monitoring as a service. The power and energy monitoring is a first step towards a more complete diagnosis of the photovoltaic modules and prognosis about the expected lifetime, which would be welcome by the market. The module's productivity is a too coarse information for understanding the problems affecting the modules and for performing the right repairing. Thus, new and even more advanced diagnostic algorithms must be developed in order to monitor the status of the cells and to predict failures before they lead to a significant reduction on the energy produced by the module. Such failures might be not only due to cells malfunctioning, but also to faults of the bypass diode the module is equipped with. This might happen due to repeated shadowing or to lightning. In this paper the techniques for photo voltaic modules diagnosis proposed in the recent literature are overviewed. The main features of some commercial products are also given.

Consequently, it is important to develop failure diagnostic and prognostic tools enabling the optimization of the FC. Among all the existing prognostics approaches, data-mining methods such as artificial neural networks aim at estimating the process' behavior without huge knowledge about the underlying physical phenomena. Nevertheless, this kind of approach needs huge learning dataset. Also, the deployment of such an approach can be long (trial and error method), which represents a real problem for industrial applications where real-time complying algorithms must be developed. According to this, the aim of this paper is to study the application of a reservoir computing tool (the Echo State Network) as a prognostics system enabling the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life of a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell. Developments emphasize on the prediction of the mean voltage cells of a degrading FC. Accuracy and time consumption of the approach are studied, as well as sensitivity of several parameters of the ESN. Results appear to be very promising.

However, unbalanced supply voltage, inherent machine asymmetry and non ideal sensors can also contribute to the generation of this negative sequence current. Thus, it is rather difficult to extract the negative sequence current caused only by the fault. To improve the accuracy of fault detection, this paper proposes an efficient method based on the use of experimental techniques to identify and separate the negative sequence current due to the inherent asymmetry in the machine and the non-calibration of the sensors in order to extract the negative sequence current caused only by the fault. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by the use of experimental data's coming from 1.1 kW motor supplied by a balanced voltage.

The method is based on two interconnected observers: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) observer. The EKF, thanks to its optimality is designed to estimate the position in case of mechanical sensor fault and despite sensor current fault. The MRAS estimates the phase currents using the actual position and speed. The computation and sort of the residuals (difference between measured and estimated values) allows the fault isolation. The structure is evaluated on a 1.1 kW test bed with mechanical and phase current sensor faults. The experimental results are so far promising with the capability of detection and diagnosis of the proposed structure.

For better exploitation of the system's capabilities all drive components are more and more operated near and even above their rated values. This leads to more strains for the drive. However, at the same time the demands for reliability are also increasing. To reach this requirement different strategies like fault tolerant design, fault detection and condition monitoring can be implemented. However, to implement such strategies a deep understanding of the effects that lead to problems or faults in the drive system is necessary. The fast switching of modern voltage source inverters leads to transient overvoltage stressing the machine's insulation system. A short literature study presenting the characteristic of and the parameters influencing the non-linear voltage distribution in the stator winding of inverter-fed machines will be presented. Furthermore the findings will be compared with experimental results on an induction machine with tapped windings.

Due to the electromagnetic interaction with the magnetic field, generated by the stator, the rotor transforms the magnetic energy into a rotational motion. It is characterized by its magnetization, its magnetic field strength, the field distribution and its geometric dimensions. The current challenge is to produce electrical drives with minimal loss. This requires ensuring the magnetic characteristics of the rotors. Errors that can occur during manufacture are cracks, blowholes or inclusions in the permanent magnet. Those can lead to commutation problems or to increased noise. For this purpose, a non-destructive and non-contact measurement method, based on the measurement of the magnetic field with Hall-effect sensors to detect defects in plastic-bonded permanent magnet rotors was developed.

In order to enable the separation, two different design patterns are elaborated. Based on an analysis of typical faults in manufacturing systems, a library of reusable function blocks for fault detection, handling, and also fault recovery is developed. These function blocks are implemented according to the international standard IEC 61499 and are applied within the design patterns. The design patterns are evaluated with the sequential control of an injection molding machine. It is shown, that the design patterns simplify the engineering and the separation of the fault detection and fault handling from control code significantly, since they provide clear design rules. Applying the proposed design patterns reduces the complexity of industrial control applications drastically. Furthermore, the function block library provides reusable and proven fault detection and fault handling methods.

C	Javed, K; Gouriveau, R; Zerhouni, N			IEEE	Javed, Kamran; Gouriveau, Rafael; Zerhouni, Noureddine			Novel failure prognostics approach with dynamic thresholds for machine degradation	39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna Univ Technol			PREDICTION; NETWORK	Estimating remaining useful life (RUL) of critical machinery is a challenging task. It is achieved through essential steps of data acquisition, data pre-processing and prognostics modeling. To estimate RUL of a degrading machinery, prognostics modeling phase requires precise knowledge about failure threshold (FT) (or failure definition). Practically, degrading machinery can have different levels (states) of degradation before failure, and prognostics can be quite complicated or even impossible when there is absence of prior knowledge about actual states of degrading machinery or FT. In this paper a novel approach is proposed to improve failure prognostics. In brief, the proposed prognostics model integrates two new algorithms, namely, a Summation Wavelet Extreme Learning Machine (SWELM) and Subtractive-Maximum Entropy Fuzzy Clustering (S-MEFC) to predict degrading behavior, automatically identify the states of degrading machinery, and to dynamically assign FT. Indeed, for practical reasons there is no interest in assuming FT for RUL estimation. The effectiveness of the approach is judged by applying it to real dataset in order to estimate future breakdown of a real machinery.

The profile produced by the gear tooth surface damage fault in the mechanical torque experimented by the driven electrical machine is primarily investigated. Then, it is shown that the periodic behavior of this particular shape produces fault-related frequencies in the stator current and hence harmonics namely integer multiple of rotation frequency in the instantaneous frequency of the stator current space vector. The results show possible non-invasive gear tooth surface damage fault detection with fault sensitivity comparable to most of the invasive methods. A dedicated experimental set-up, based on a 250W squirrel-cage three-phase induction machine shaft-connected to a single-stage gear, has been used for this purpose.

The method focuses on the analysis of the start-up current for the isolation of a component that is able to pinpoint faulty signatures. The analysis is based on the application of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) which acts as an adaptive filter during the start up and subsequently on the application of Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) for the transformation of the extracted component into a symbolic representation. Using this symbolic representation, an automated detection procedure can be developed that discriminates between faulty and normal conditions using an intelligent Icons approach while at the same time the information can be presented to the user in a more intuitive way.

Multi-harmonic tracking for diagnosis of rotor asymmetries in wound rotor induction motors	39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna Univ Technol		Induction machines; wound rotor machines; fault diagnosis; rotor asymmetries; transient analysis; Hilbert-Huang transform; Wigner-Ville distributions	WAVELET TRANSFORM; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ECCENTRICITY; MACHINES; COMPONENTS; DWT	Most of the research work hitherto carried out in the induction motors fault diagnosis area has been focused on squirrel-cage motors in spite of the fact that wound-rotor motors are typically less robust, having a more delicate maintenance. Over recent years, wound-rotor machines have drawn an increasing attention in the fault diagnosis community due to the advent of wind power technologies for electricity generation and the widely spread use of its generator variant, the Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs) in that specific context. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of reliable techniques suited and properly validated in wound-rotor industrial induction motors. This paper proposes an integral methodology to diagnose rotor asymmetries in wound-rotor motors with high reliability. It is based on a twofold approach; the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method is employed to track the low-frequency fault-related components, while the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) is used for detecting the high-frequency failure harmonics during a startup. Experimental results with real wound-rotor motors demonstrate that the combination of both perspectives enables to correctly diagnose the failure with higher reliability than alternative techniques relying on a unique informational source.

The method is based on predictive stator current calculation. For each sampling interval the difference between actual stator current and its predicted value in previous sampling interval is calculated. The magnitude of the difference serves as a main diagnostic index for single open-phase fault detection. By analyzing the angle of stator current the fault location can be identified. After the fault is detected and identified, if possible, the operation with reduced number of phases is desirable. For this purpose, single open-phase fault identification and post-fault operation will be briefly discussed. Fault detection method has been simulated in MATLAB and tested on experimental setup with a real machine.

A Parametric Spectral Estimator for Faults Detection in Induction Machines	39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna Univ Technol		Induction machine; faults detection; bearing faults; stator current; parametric spectral estimation	FREQUENCY RESOLUTION	Current spectrum analysis is a proven technique for fault diagnosis in electrical machines. Current spectral estimation is usually performed using classical techniques such as periodogram (FFT) or its extensions. However, these techniques have several drawbacks since their frequency resolution is limited and additional post-processing algorithms are required to extract a relevant fault detection criterion. Therefore, this paper proposes a new parametric spectral estimator that fully exploits the faults sensitive frequencies. The proposed technique is based on the maximum likelihood estimator and offers high-resolution capabilities. Based on this approach, a fault criterion is derived for detecting several fault types. The proposed faults detection technique is assessed using simulations, issued from a coupled electromagnetic circuits approach-based simulation tool. It is afterwards validated using experiments on a 0.75-kW induction machine test bed for the particular case of bearing faults.	[El Bouchikhi, El Houssin; Choqueuse, Vincent; Benbouzid, M. E.

Non-Stationary Spectral Estimation for Wind Turbine Induction Generator Faults Detection	39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Austrian Inst Technol, Vienna Univ Technol		Wind turbines; induction machine; faults detection; stator current; spectral estimation; maximum likelihood estimator	MACHINES	Development of large scale offshore wind and marine current turbine farms implies to minimize and predict maintenance operations. In direct-or indirect-drive, fixed-or variable-speed turbine generators, advanced signal processing tools are required to detect and diagnose the generator faults from vibration, acoustic, or generator current signals. The induction generator is traditionally used for wind turbines power generation. Even if induction machines are highly reliable, they are subjected to many types of faults. The aim then, is to detect them at an early stage in order to prevent breakdowns and consequently ensure the continuity of power production. In this context, this paper deals with wind turbines condition monitoring using a fault detection technique based on the generator stator current. The detection algorithm uses a recursive maximum likelihood estimator to track the time-varying fault characteristic frequency and the related energy. Furthermore, a decision-making scheme and a related criterion are proposed. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated using simulation data issued from coupled magnetic circuits induction generator model driven by a wind turbine for both electrical asymmetry and mechanical imbalance.

In this paper, a novel approach was presented for intelligent prognosis of a hidden state. Based on the estimation results from an SVM-based ARMAX dynamic model, an integrated methodology using a NARX model and the monotonic particle filter was proposed. The robustness and monotonicity of results were guaranteed by introducing an error equation into the state-space model and adopting a monotonic algorithm for the particle filter, respectively. Our approach was validated on an industrial high speed milling machine, and the experimental results as well as analysis utilizing several criteria defined in this paper demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed methodology.

A new Framework for Remaining Useful Life Estimation Using Support Vector Machine Classifier	2013 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS (SYSTOL)	Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)	OCT 09-11, 2013	Nice, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Res Ctr Automat Control Nancy, Univ Lorraine				In this paper a framework for remaining useful life estimation is presented. Remaining useful life of a system or an equipment is the time period between the current time instant and the time instant when the system stops operating within its predefined specifications. It is an important part required for condition based maintenance, which increases the safety, quality, reliability and reduces the operating costs of a process. The framework consists of two parts, which are health feature creation and remaining useful life estimation. Therefore, a new health feature creation approach is proposed using binary Support Vector Machine classifier, which is also used to obtain fault detection as an additional feature. As degradation of the health feature, a Weibull distribution is assumed, which is common for performance degradation of equipment due to aging. The remaining useful life is then calculated using an identified Weibull function, where a weighted least squares algorithm is employed for the identification of the Weibull parameters.

In this study, an online tool wear estimation algorithm has been developed for milling operation. AC current signal of spindle is used for the detection process due to its applicability and low acquisition cost in the industry. Based on the great potential of time-frequency analysis and its promising results on the similar applications, S-transform is utilized for signal processing and a 2-D correlation analysis determines the state of the fault using the time-frequency domain information. The clear representation of the fault in the time-frequency domain and the accuracy of tool wear estimation by this approach determine the high potential of this algorithm to be used for fault detection in industry.

Each of the wind turbines is subject to sudden and gradual faults due to operational and environmental conditions, aging etc. In order to assure an optimal power production and reduce maintenance costs, these faults have to be detected, isolated as soon as possible, and predicted. In this paper, an evolving classification method is proposed to achieve these requirements. The proposed approach is data-driven and does not require prior physical knowledge, in particular wind dynamics. It is based on the dynamic classification algorithm AUDyC. The considered features are determined according to the difference between generated electric powers regarding several operating modes. Normal operating modes are represented by classes in a decision space. Each new measure is classified on line. Indicators are computed to detect and isolate the occurrence of faults. Finally, a predictive method is implemented to forecast the degradation state of the wind turbine. A wind farm benchmark model, proposed for a fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control competition is used to highlight the efficiency of the proposed approaches.

Both hardware and analytical redundancy are utilized in this approach. The least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is proposed as the Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) unit for the wind speed sensor fault. Single and multiple sensor faults are both considered in this strategy. LS-SVM is also used to estimate the effective wind speed (EWS), which is an unmeasurable signal. Based on the FDI unit, good FTC performance is achieved by identifying the faulty sensors and switching to the healthy sensor or the estimated EWS to provide the required controller reference signal. A robust MPC controller is then designed in order to consider the uncertainty due to error of EWS estimation and respect the physical system constraints.

One can hence guarantee timely fault accommodation and avoid unanticipated breakdowns and equipment failures. The paper presents a concept of a system for on-line diagnostics and prognostics of asset condition whose aim is to make implementation easier, cost effective and highly portable. The system builds on a distributed sensor network performing signal acquisition, local signal processing and fusion of the diagnostic results on a central server. Hence the state of health as well as the estimate of the remaining useful life can be generated online. Key to the concept is optimal data storage and data manipulation framework with built-in condition monitoring taxonomy. To address all these issues the potential of the MIMOSA OSA-EAI standard are exploited. Due to its thoroughness MIMOSA OSA-EAI is unjustly deemed cumbersome and is either avoided or neglected. To bring it closer to the practitioners its main features are carefully addressed. The implementation of a platform prototype on a large milling machine is described.

Towards a reliable condition index for condition-based maintenance decision-making	2013 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS (SYSTOL)	Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)	OCT 09-11, 2013	Nice, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Res Ctr Automat Control Nancy, Univ Lorraine			PROGNOSTICS; MODEL	This paper aims at analyzing the effectiveness of some well-known condition indices for condition-based maintenance decision-making. The study is based on a single-unit system subject to competing risks due to multiple degradation paths of stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The system is assumed to be failed whenever the number of cracks or the sum of all crack sizes reach critical thresholds. A periodic inspection scheme is used to monitor the system health state. Each inspection returns the perfect diagnostic information (i.e., the number of cracks and the corresponding crack size, as well as the failure/working state of the system). Based on this information, two kinds of prognostic condition indices (i.e., average type and quantile type of the system residual useful life) are constructed. The associated predictive maintenance strategies and cost models are also developed and compared with the ones whose maintenance decisions are based on diagnostic condition indices. The comparison results allow us to conclude on the performance and on the robustness of the prognostic indices compared to the diagnostic ones, hence giving some suggestions on the choice of condition indices for maintenance decision-making.

The proposed strategies have been designed to be implemented in a specific subject dealing with the predictive maintenance of industrial electric machines. This subject is conceived to give an overall overview of the industrial maintenance protocols of these electromechanical conversion devices, an area still perceived as 'classical' by many students. The proposed solutions are being adopted in order to provide a modern perspective of the area, to increase the interest toward the subject and, at the same time, to achieve several educational goals such as better assimilation of the explained concepts. Among the proposed ideas, we can find the use of modern internet-connected signal acquisition devices during the lab sessions, the promotion of the use of teaching multimedia platforms, the elaboration of electronic didactic material or the development of on-line assessment systems.

The presented strategy is particularly suitable to be applied for the implementation of a cheap additional redundancy feature in order to augment the still existing fault-tolerant capabilities of some multiphase drives employed in safety-critical applications. The developmental steps will be described in detail after a preliminary motor modeling section, in particular the core stage of the multiphase sensorless scheme, more related with the rotor position and speed detection, will be illustrated at first and then, in a second step, the reconfiguration strategy linked with a certain subset of faults, that is opening of the phases, will be introduced subsequently; the proposed remedial policy will mainly involve the proper switching of the linear transformation used to get the equivalent two-phase description of the machine and of the employed back-EMF observer in turn. Simulation and preliminary experimental results will be shown at the end to validate the fault-adaptive properties of the proposed multiphase sensorless strategy; in this last case a proper Real-Time Simulation platform will be used.

Advanced machine-learning techniques have recently been advocated for reasoning-based diagnosis; these technologies are based on historical data of successfully repaired boards. However, traditional diagnosis systems fail to provide appropriate repair suggestions when the diagnostic logs are fragmented and some error outcomes, or syndromes, are not available during diagnosis. We describe the design of a diagnosis system, based on support-vector machines, that can handle missing syndromes by using the method of imputation. Several imputation methods are discussed and compared in terms of their efficiency in handling missing syndromes. Two large-scale synthetic data sets generated from the log information of complex industrial boards in volume production are used to validate the proposed diagnosis system in terms of diagnosis accuracy and training time.

J	Paul, S; Maji, P				Paul, Sushmita; Maji, Pradipta			Rough sets for in silico identification of differentially expressed miRNAs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE			English	Article						microRNA; feature selection; bootstrap error; support vector machine	MICRORNA EXPRESSION; CANCER; SIGNATURES; PROGNOSIS; SELECTION; PATTERNS	The microRNAs, also known as miRNAs, are the class of small noncoding RNAs. They repress the expression of a gene posttranscriptionally. In effect, they regulate expression of a gene or protein. It has been observed that they play an important role in various cellular processes and thus help in carrying out normal functioning of a cell. However, dysregulation of miRNAs is found to be a major cause of a disease. Various studies have also shown the role of miRNAs in cancer and the utility of miRNAs for the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. Unlike with mRNAs, a modest number of miRNAs might be sufficient to classify human cancers. However, the absence of a robust method to identify differentially expressed miRNAs makes this an open problem. In this regard, this paper presents a novel approach for in silico identification of differentially expressed miRNAs from microarray expression data sets. It integrates judiciously the theory of rough sets and merit of the so-called B.632+ bootstrap error estimate. While rough sets select relevant and significant miRNAs from expression data, the B.632+ error rate minimizes the variability and bias of the derived results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach, along with a comparison with other related approaches, is demonstrated on several miRNA microarray expression data sets, using the support vector machine.

This paper presents an unscented Kalman filter-based (UKF) condition monitoring scheme for leakage detection in hydraulic actuator systems using the joint sensor feedback. By comparing the UKF residuals of the developed MEMS sensor to the residuals of a highly accurate reference encoder, we show that the developed easy-to-install and low-cost MEMS sensor is suitable for this condition monitoring task.

However, such vibration based techniques are difficult to implement in planetary gearboxes due to the complex nature of measured vibration spectrum. Motor current signal analysis (MCSA) provides an alternative and non-intrusive way to detect mechanical faults through electrical signatures. In this paper, a new time-domain fault detection algorithm is presented for the detection of planetary gear faults using electrical machine stator current signals. This time-domain fault detection method combines fast dynamic time warping (DTW) and correlated kurtosis techniques to process the current signals data to detect and identify damaged planetary gear and its position. Fast DTW is employed to highlight the sideband patterns resulting from tooth damage by the introduction of an estimated reference signal that has the same frequency as the gear mesh frequency. Correlated kurtosis (CK) takes advantages of the periodicity of the geared faults; it is used to identify the position of the damaged gear tooth in the planetary gear-set. This method is later applied to simulated current signals generated from a lumped parameter model of planetary gearbox driving a permanent magnet synchronous generator to evaluate its performance. The simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed time-domain approach to detect faults in planetary gear-sets based on the electrical stator current signal.

This paper compares the sensitivity of defect detection of two adaptive methods: local mean decomposition (L. M. D) and empirical mode decomposition (E.M.D). The efficiency of L.M.D and E.M.D methods for detecting defects is investigated for two cases, one from numerical signals and the other from signals recorded during a fatigue test on gear bench. The time descriptors Kurtosis, Thalaf and Thikat are applied on the signal and on its Hilbert transform. The results reveal that both techniques seem to be suitable and have good efficiency for the fault detection. From experimental signals, the comparative results reveal that both methods allow for monitoring wear, but that L.M.D is more sensitive to detect rapid changes of degradation than E.M.D method for the considered case. Consequently these features have potential to become powerful tools for the monitoring of rotating machinery.

Besides the availability of task specific sensors and filtering techniques two major issues are of relevance: i) Preparation of the measured data (filtering) and ii) Interpretation of the data with respect to the machines state as well as to the machines remaining lifetime or guaranteed functionality. Core of this contribution is the development and first application of simple, easy to use, easy to apply, and easy to handle algorithms to be used directly with industrial data or measurements from technical systems in operation. The three approaches applied are: AI Acoustic Emission (AE) in combination using a suitable filter to be designed AII Data analysis using macro data feature capturing technique AIII Adaptive fuzzy-based filtering [1] with training and classification modules. Experimental data are used. The approaches use different algorithms as well as different signals (from same experiment) and show more or less the same results but allowing a different and distinguished problem-oriented insight to the complex wear process of the system.

Bayesian Updating of Detection Capability with Frequency Response Function Related Structural Health Monitoring Features	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2013, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)	SEP 10-12, 2013	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Lab, Off Naval Res, Boeing, Airbus, Embraer	Stanford Univ		UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	In all structural health monitoring (SHM) applications, feature extraction plays an important role, as it determines the most sensitive and specific metrics on which to base decision-making.. The Frequency response function (FRF) is a widely-used category of features because of its clear physical interpretation. Often, FRF is estimated from the acquired structural excitation and response, and the data obtained are always subject to uncertainty. As a result, this uncertainty typically propagates and compromises the estimations of the FRF, which degrades its performance in decision-making problems. With uncertainty quantification (UQ) models, the damage diagnosis problem is converted into a statistical significance detection procedure. Bayesian statistics collects evidence to make decisions and is very powerful for model and model class selection. For instance, the aforementioned transformed damage detection problem may be further implemented as a recursive model selection process in between various distribution models (usually binary cases such as undamaged and damaged conditions). Instead of evaluating the total likelihood of FRF observations, this paper adopts Bayesian framework to update the posterior probability of trinary model selection, given increasing number of measurements. Testing data are obtained from the Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS) from SpectraQuest, in which two damage scenarios, namely damaged ball bearing and damaged outer race, are included. Posterior probability for each damage condition outperforms traditional likelihood evaluation, and this recursive implementation distinguishes both damaged conditions in this paper, and works for both FRF magnitude and phase.				mdtodd@ucsd.edu					Bendat JS., 1986, RANDOM DATA ANAL MEA, V2; Cheung SH, 2010, COMPUT-AIDED CIV INF, V25, P304, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8667.2009.00642.x; Kay S.

Macro-scale phenomena such as stiffness and strength degradation are predicted by connecting micro-scale and macro-scale damage models in a Bayesian filtering framework that also allows incorporating uncertainties in the prediction. The approach is demonstrated on data collected from a run-to-failure tension-tension fatigue experiment measuring the evolution of fatigue damage in CRFP cross-ply laminates. Results are presented for the prediction of expected end of life for a given panel with the associated uncertainty estimates.	[Ruano, M. C.; Ruano, J.

Development of AE Signal Based Tool Breakage Prognosis System in Micro Gun Drilling	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2013, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)	SEP 10-12, 2013	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Lab, Off Naval Res, Boeing, Airbus, Embraer	Stanford Univ			The AE signals were analyzed in this study for monitoring tool conditions in micro gun drilling to improve the reliability of tool condition monitoring system in micro gun drilling. The AE signals corresponding to the conditions before and during tool breakage were analyzed first based on the time and frequency domain features, followed by the development of a prognosis system for the micro gun drilling process. The system consists of three modules, including a signal transform module for feature generation, a feature selection module for selecting proper features closely related to the monitored event, and a classifier for distinguishing the condition just before tool breakage from the others. To collect signals for the feature analysis and the system development, an experiment was conducted on a Swiss type turning machine. A micro drilling tool with the size of 0.9mm in diameter and 125mm in length was used in drilling the stainless steel. At the same time, an AE sensor was installed on the tool holder to collect the AE signal. During the deep hole drilling, the gun drill was fixed on a tool holder and the stainless workpiece rotated to generate the motion for micro drilling. The results show that the feature of AE signal can be observed to be changed not only during tool breakage, but also before the tool breakage occurring. With properly selecting the features closely related to various tool conditions, the condition before tool breakage can be detected successfully by the developed prognosis system.

Development of an Intelligent Shaft Fault Diagnosis System for Machine Tools	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2013, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)	SEP 10-12, 2013	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Lab, Off Naval Res, Boeing, Airbus, Embraer	Stanford Univ		EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; MULTISCALE ENTROPY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; TIME-SERIES	Aiming at reducing cost and time of repair, condition-based shaft faults diagnosis is considered an efficient strategy for machine tool community. While the shaft with faults is operating, its vibration signals normally indicate nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics but Fourier-based approaches have shown limitations for handling this kind of signals. The methodology proposed in this research is to extract the features from shaft faults related vibration signals, from which the corresponding fault condition is then effectively identified. Besides Fourier Transform, two new algorithms are used to extract the feature of signals, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and multi-scale entropy (MSE). With an incorporation of EMD method, the model applied in this research embraces some characteristics, like zero-crossing rate and energy, of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) to represent the feature of the shaft condition. The other method called MSE is used to calculate the entropy of multi-scale of the signal. The curve of MSE can be used to identify some defect model of shafts clearly. The conventional approach for online monitoring of a machine's health based on linear time-frequency analysis has its limitation, as the mechanical vibration signal is nonlinear and non-stationary in nature. Multi-scale entropy (MSE) is a recently developed method for nonlinear time series analysis, which quantifies a system's complexity. EMD-based and MSE-based methods were implemented to develop a diagnosis system in this research. In the buildup stage a knowledge ware is created from the database compiled from the existing defect models. Finally, diagnosis system is a monitor system to be implemented in a machine tool manufacturing company to verify the ability.

A wavelet decomposition analysis of vibration signal for bearing fault detection	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH (ICMER 2013)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Mechanical Engineering Research (ICMER)	JUL 01-04, 2013	Kuantan, MALAYSIA				ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; DEFECTS	This paper presents a study of vibrational signal analysis for bearing fault detection using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this study, the vibration data was acquired from three different types of bearing defect i.e. corroded, outer race defect and point defect. The experiments were carried out at three different speeds which are 10%, 50% and 90% of the maximum motor speed. The time domain vibration data measured from accelerometer was then transformed into frequency domain using a frequency analyzer in order to study the frequency characteristics of the signal The DWT was utilized to decomposed signal at different frequency scale. Then, root mean square (RMS) for every decomposition level was calculated to detect the defect features in vibration signals by referring to the trend of vibrational energy retention at every decomposition. Based on the result, the defective bearings show significant deviation in retaining RMS value after a few levels of decomposition. The findings indicate that Wavelet decomposition analysis can be used to develop an effective bearing condition monitoring tool. This signal processing analysis is recommended in on-line monitoring while the machine is on operation.	[Nizwan, C. K. E.; Ong, S. A.; Yusof, M. F. M.; Baharom, M.

This combination of data provides critical assessment of structural health, leading to prediction of failure. The SEIM system's sensors can be permanently installed in high value structures, such as buildings, bridges, or aircraft, and are connected to data acquisition nodes where initial processing is performed. From the nodes, processed data is transmitted using a Zig Bee/IEEE 802.15.4 compliant low-power, self-organizing, self-healing wireless network to a central PC hub for analysis and interpretation. Analatom's mu LPR corrosion sensors have been installed on a mock-up bridge cable at Columbia University as part of a large project on development of a corrosion monitoring system for main cables of suspension bridges. The sensors were placed inside a full-scale mock-up suspension bridge cable located in an environmentally controlled chamber subjected to accelerated corrosion conditions for one year. The mu LPR sensors recorded corrosion rate measurement at 8 different locations inside the cable showing excellent agreement with temperature measurements.

Thus, three piezoelectric disk transducers are employed.

Condition-Based Maintenance Plus and Maintenance Credit Validation	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2011: CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE AND INTELLIGENT STRUCTURES, VOL 2	Structural Health Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	SEP 13-15, 2011	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Off, Natl Sci Fdn, Off Naval Res	Stanford Univ			The Department of Defense (DoD) is currently maintaining the aircraft operability and functionality past the original design intention for many military aircraft. This practice imposes an additional burden on the inspection systems at the DoD logistic centers to ensure the aircraft in operation are airworthy and will be able to complete mission assignments for a specified period of time. Condition-Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) has evolved into the U.S. Army leader priority program and becomes a critical technology for the future of the Army to reduce the logistic footprint, maximize the aircraft availability, and increase the component time on wing. To achieve these goals, the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has initiated the CBM+ Science and Technology (S&T) Enterprise that spreads across ARL research organizations and supports the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command CBM+ initiative in the Army fleet. The CBM+ S&T Enterprise has three Integrated Product Teams (IPTs), which focus on Hardware and Sensing, Prognostics and Diagnostics, and Data Transfer and Fusion Architecture technologies. The fourth IPT is the Technology Demonstration and Integration. It has been established that CBM, when joined with the system and/or sub-system prognostic capability (CBM+), could result in tremendous inspection savings, improved aircraft safety and availability, and decreased aircraft downtime and maintenance costs. Under these IPTs, diverse research efforts are being conducted and coordinated by the Technology Focus Working Groups (TFWGs) to combine diagnostics and prognostics capabilities. TFWGs concentrate on many technologies and processes including Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Maintenance Credit Validation. One of the challenges for researchers has been the development of the SHM capability that is not only effective and reliable but also relatively low cost and easy to install and maintain while performing the desired function of monitoring DoD systems and sub-systems for loss of structural integrity. SHM methods can be used to monitor the condition of critical structural components and, with other technologies, can determine the structural remaining useful life. As a result, potential maintenance credits, e.g., increased time-between-overhaul or fatigue life adjustment, can be formulated and proposed. Formulated maintenance credits are based on full understanding of physics of failure of monitored components, direct and/or indirect data that may contain some uncertainties, and methodologies that may be complex and advanced. This paper will document the ARL CBM+ S&T Enterprise strategies in supporting the Army CBM+ implementation goals and developing a process to validate maintenance credits or formulate maintenance-related decisions. Examples of CBM+ actions include the formulation of usage credits and early replacement of monitored parts before using up its component retirement life.	[Le, D.

The machine and the transformer caverns are situated in Quintner Limestone with an overburden of 400 to 500 m. The 150 m long machine cavern has a height of 53 m and a width of approximately 30 m. The distance between both caverns was increased to 59 m to avoid overlapping plastic zones following the evaluation of geological conditions of the pilot tunnel. During construction it was found that geological conditions are more complex than expected, resulting in displacements varying to a large degree. That was why the design was reviewed by comparing the prognosis with the actual behaviour during excavation of the heading. The rock bolting system with regard to pattern and length was adjusted based on the results of numerical back analyses including sensitivity studies of the rock mass parameters. Additional 3D computations were performed to take account of the numerous intersecting galleries. During excavation of benches, additional rock bolting was provided in specific areas, where deformations continued over some time.

Development of a Generator Prognostic Tool	2013 IEEE ELECTRICAL INSULATION CONFERENCE (EIC)			English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)	JUN 02-05, 2013	Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Dielectr & Elect Insulat Soc		predictive maintenance; prognostic; diagnostic; failure mechanism; power generator		In the past decades, significant improvements in generator diagnostics were made possible by using continuous online measurements and a number of periodic tests. In recent years, the data provided has been converted into more useful information thanks to integrated diagnostic systems. For example, an integrated methodology for generator diagnostics (MIDA) was developed at Hydro-Quebec's research institute (IREQ) using a Web-based application. This comprehensive diagnostic system gives the degradation state of generator stator winding insulation by using a portfolio of diagnostic tools. Combining the various results leads to a health index ranging from 1 (good condition) to 5 (worst condition). This system is used by power plant managers as well as technical support and maintenance engineers at Hydro-Quebec in the context of condition-based maintenance (CBM). The next step of development is to add new prognostic-related characteristics. This involves automatic identification of active failure mechanisms, root cause analysis and estimation of the stage of advancement of any active mechanism. These characteristics form the basis of predictive maintenance and support the optimization of maintenance strategies. The approach chosen is based on a number of cause-and-effect chains formed by the combination of sequential physical degradation states that ultimately lead to failure. Each combination of physical states is unique and defines a particular failure mechanism. Failure mechanism analysis was followed by identification of all observable symptoms (diagnostics from MIDA) for each physical state. This paper presents a first step toward the development of a prognostic tool, where the modeling of failure mechanisms is combined with automatic analysis of observable symptoms from our diagnostic system. It puts forward probable failure mechanisms for a given generator.

The errors induced by high-energy radiation, also known as Single Event Upsets (SEUs), corrupt the configuration memory of the FPGA device and are a major concern for the system reliability and dependability. For this, error mitigation techniques like triple module redundancy and ECC codes are commonly employed techniques. However error mitigation techniques do not recover the system. The fault-free system can be recovered using reconfiguration of the FPGA device. Previous recovery methods employ processor cores as a reconfiguration controller consuming notable amount of device resources and introducing additional error detection and recovery latency. In this paper a low area overhead error recovery mechanism for SRAM based FPGA systems is presented. The error recovery mechanism is implemented as a state machine. The reliability of the developed solution was experimentally evaluated by fault emulation environment.

Generally, industrial units such as mining, oil and gas etc, are located in geographically remote areas, so a large amount of data need to be acquired for fault diagnosis and prognosis remotely. To achieve this, certain resources such as stable communication network and adequate bandwidth are required. Furthermore, it is not always feasible to dispatch human resources simultaneously over large areas of operation to perform on-site maintenance. To overcome these issues, a mobile agent based system architecture is proposed for machine condition monitoring by imitating human immune system (ACMIS), which is also known as artificial immune system. The experiment results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed system in terms of fault detection accuracy and bandwidth allocation. Overall performance evaluation of the proposed framework suggests that our proposed scheme not only provides excellent fault detection accuracy but also a flexible and reliable machine condition monitoring system with reduced network and computational resources. Further our approach provides cost effective solution in building a practical machine condition monitoring system.

Time-domain-segmentation being among the preliminary steps for further classification process plays a momentous role. Vibration signals from bearing are quasi-stationary in nature therefore calculation of constituent frequencies amplitudes in the vibration signal is dependent upon time-segmentation-window size. The proposed research confers the effects of time-segmentation window size on spectral features amplitudes calculation and its impacts on classification accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Using multi-size time-segmentation-window, for comprehensive spectral features calculation, ANN pattern classifier has been trained for enhanced classification. ANN learning assigns importance based relative weights to the links using supervised learning. Experimental results have shown that multi-size-window spectral features for ANN fault classifier perform efficiently for quasi-stationary bearing vibrations.

Classical methods which involve thermal switches, overload relays, timers, magnetic contactors and programmable integrated circuits were adopted in early days. But these methods did not guarantee full protection of motor. This paper introduces new approach to condition monitoring of motors through intelligent diagnostic system based on stator current analysis and programmable logic controllers. The proposed method is validated by experiments performed on five different defect levels. Experiment results show that this technique is more accurate, cost effective, safe and provides continuous real time tracking of faults and estimates the severity through visual indication.

In addition, an in-home healthcare station (IHHS) is needed to meet the rapidly increasing demands for daily monitoring with on-site diagnosis and prognosis. In this paper, an intelligent medication management system is proposed based on intelligent package and ubiquitous sensing technologies. Preventive medication management is enabled by an intelligent package sealed by Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by RFID link. Various vital parameters are collected by wearable biomedical sensors through the short range wireless link. Onsite diagnosis and prognosis based on these health parameters are supported by the scalable architecture. Additionally, friendly human-machine interface is emphasized to make it convenient for the elderly or disabled patients.

J	Shao, YE; Hou, CD				Shao, Yuehjen E.; Hou, Chia-Ding			Hybrid Artificial Neural Networks Modeling for Faults Identification of a Stochastic Multivariate Process	ABSTRACT AND APPLIED ANALYSIS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MEAN SHIFTS; T-2; CONTRIBUTORS; SYSTEMS; CHARTS	Due to the recent rapid growth of advanced sensing and production technologies, the monitoring and diagnosis of multivariate process operating performance have drawn increasing interest in process industries. The multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) chart is one of the most commonly used tools for detecting process faults. However, an out-of-control MSPC signal only indicates that process faults have intruded the underlying process. Identifying which of the monitored quality variables is responsible for the MSPC signal is fairly difficult. Pinpointing the responsible variable is vital for process improvement because it effectively determines the root causes of the process faults. Accordingly, this identification has become an important research issue concerning recent multivariate process applications. In contrast with the traditional single classifier approach, the present study proposes hybrid modeling schemes to address problems that involve a large number of quality variables in a multivariate normal process. The proposed scheme includes multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). By applying MARS and LR techniques, we may obtain fewer but more significant quality variables, which can serve as inputs to the ANN classifier. The performance of our proposed approaches was evaluated by conducting a series of experiments.

In order to effectively remove this noise and detect the impulses, a novel technique with multiple frequency energy spectrum (MFES) and Bayesian network(BN) inference is proposed in this paper. Original acceleration signals are processed by fast Fourier transformation (FFT) from the time domain to frequency domain. According to the analysis of the frequency information, the MFES is put forward to extract features from vibration under normal and faulty conditions of rotational mechanical systems. These features were given as inputs for training and testing the BN model. By existing BN inference algorithms, and the inference result for fault diagnosis is provided. With BN inference algorithms being coupled to this new technique, it makes the presented approach be able to detect early faults. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and robust in bringing out the early bearing fault classification of rotating machinery.

According to different characteristics of source signals including real or complex, super-Gaussian or sub-Gaussian and pollution of signal noise, a new method for fault detection that uses RobustICA based on kurtosis is put forward in this paper. The basic idea of the approach is to use RobustICA optimized by iterative technique to separate independent components which drive a process after wavelet de-noising of the original data. On this basis, statistics are established for fault detection and the kernel density estimation is used in calculating the confidence limit of statistics. After that, support vector machines (SVMs) is utilized to classify the faults. The simulation results of signal experiment and TE model clearly show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in comparison to FastICA method.

They provide a potent tool for operators in decision-making by specifying the present machine state and estimating the remaining useful life (RUL). In this paper, the health conditions of degradation process are modeled as a hidden Markov chain and the physical outputs are modeled as the stochastic events whose probability depends on the Markov chain state. The expectation maximization (E-M) algorithm is proposed to learn parameters of the modeled hidden Markov model (HMM) and the iteration convergence is demonstrated. A maximum a posteriori (MAP) current health condition assessment approach is also proposed.

Different from other methods, this algorithm doesn't require the knowledge about the mechanism of object, thus applicable for various kinds of objects. The algorithm first analyzes the working curves to get a matrix which contains the historical information, and the degradation factors of all states can be calculated by the inverse or pseudo-inverse of this matrix. Then, with the degradation factors, the lifetime of objects can be predicted. The prediction methods are different for objects with or without future working plan. If there is a plan, the prediction algorithm can calculate the precise lifetime. But if there is no plan, the algorithm can still provide a range of the possible lifetime. The algorithm had been verified on a battery model, and the results meet the expected goals. In addition, this paper mainly considers the objects with discrete working states, and the continuous states will be studied in future papers.

Stator and rotor faults are identified and analyzed such as inter turn faults resulting in the shorting of one or more circuits of stator phase winding, broken rotor bars. The model used is the one developed by [13]. The proposed strategy consists in developing an observer based on H-infinity Control theory followed by a sliding mode estimator. The performance index, the parameter that permit to differentiate between faults and disturbances or noise, for the H-infinity observer followed by the sliding mode estimator is the amplitude and the frequency. Simulations with a nonlinear Machine model were carried out which demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the robustness properties of the used H-infinity observer and the sliding estimator exhibited significant rejection of disturbances and noise-effects attenuation which make the proposed strategy adequately close to the conditions of the real physical system.				c.nohra@bau.edu.lb					Bachir S., 2002, THESIS; Baghli L., 1997, IEEE INT S DIAGN EL; Coirault P., S SAF 97 KINGST, V1, P276; Demetriou MA, 1998, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V43, P1612, DOI 10.1109/9.728881; Doyle J.C., AUTOMATIC CONTROL, V34, P831; Innes A.

In the new model we categorize faults in two aspects, namely first and second degree faults. First degree faults are instantaneous in nature and second degree faults are evolutional and appear as a developing phenomenon which start from an initial stage and graduate through development stage and finally ends at a mature stage, these category of fault have a lifetime which is inversely proportional a machine tool life according to modified version of Taylor's equation expressed as [1]. For fault diagnosis, our framework consists of two phases: the first focusing on fault prognosis which is done online and the second dwelling on fault diagnosis which depends on both off-line and on-line modules. On the first phase a neuro-fuzzy predictor is used take a decision on whether to embark Conditional Based Maintenance (CMB) or fault diagnosis based on the magnitude of a fault. The second phase only comes into action when an evolving fault goes beyond a critical threshold limit called CBM limit for a command to be issued for fault diagnosis. During this phase DBN and PF techniques are used as an intelligent fault diagnosis system to determine the magnitude, time and location of the fault. The feasibility of this approach has been tested in a simulation environment using CNC machine as a case study and the results are studied and analyzed.

To ensure the reliability service of the test-bed and the testing personnel security, this paper deeply analysed the mechanical failure mechanism of the test-bed, and pointed at the fault characteristics of the test-bed, we diagnosed the fault of the test-bed based on data and model method. In the data based method, Wavelet theory was used to diagnose the fault of the test-bed rotor. To make up the lack of the data based method, the Kalman filter was used to diagnose and simulate the drop of inertia disc based on the model. The results showed that it could meet the demand of diagnosis of mechanical fault of the test-bed based on the data and model method as well as improve the safety and reliability of the test-bed, moreover provide a foothold for diagnosing the complete machine fault of the test-bed.

Invasive weed optimization (IWO) is a novel numerical optimization algorithm inspired from weed colonization. An approach that combines IWO and SVM (IWO-SVM) is proposed to fault diagnosis of analog circuits in this paper. The process of fault diagnosis of analog circuits using IWO-SVM approach is introduced in details. A biquadrate filter is used to test the performance of IWO-SVM approach for fault diagnosis. The simulation experiments show that the IWO-SVM approach proposed in this paper has a higher diagnosis accuracy rate than the conventional SVM in fault diagnosis of analog circuits.

J	Zhu, HY; Hu, JT; Gao, L; Huang, H				Zhu, Hong-yu; Hu, Jing-tao; Gao, Lei; Huang, Hao			Practical Aspects of Broken Rotor Bars Detection in PWM Voltage-Source-Inverter-Fed Squirrel-Cage Induction Motors	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; MACHINES; DRIVES; RESOLUTION; DEFECTS; SPEED	Broken rotor bars fault detection in inverter-fed squirrel cage induction motors is still as difficult as the dynamics introduced by the control system or the dynamically changing excitation (stator) frequency. This paper introduces a novel fault diagnosis techniques using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) to solve the problems. Switching function concept and frequency modulation theory are firstly used to model fault current signal. The competency of the amplitude of the sideband components at frequencies (1 +/- 2s)f(s) as indices for broken bars recognition is subsequently studied in the controlled motor via open-loop constant voltage/frequency control method. The proposed techniques are composed of five modules of anti-aliasing signal acquisition, optimal-slip-estimation based on torque-speed characteristic curve of squirrel cage motor with different load types, fault characteristic frequency determination, nonparametric spectrum estimation, and fault identification for achieving MCSA efficiently. Experimental and simulation results obtained on 3 kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors show that the model and the proposed techniques are effective and accurate.

Detection of Defects in Stator Winding of Inverter Fed Induction Machines	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES & DRIVES CONFERENCE (IEMDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)	MAY 12-15, 2013	Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc		fault detection; inverter fed drive; stator resistance; induction machine	RESISTANCE; FAULTS	Inverter fed drive has become to one of the most important components of modern industrial facilities and propulsion systems. Growing demands on efficiency lead to higher wear of the drive systems and the risk of breakdowns. Unexpected outages of the drive system lead to high economic and/or safety losses. Detecting faults in an early stage helps increase the reliability and reduce the risk of breakdown. Beside short-circuit faults, open-circuit faults count to the most frequent reasons for the breakdown of the winding system. Starting with a crack or cross section deformation of the stator winding conductors the open-circuit fault induces an increased resistance in the corresponding phase. Detecting such small resistance changes provides the possibility to react timely on the developing fault. In this paper a method is presented to detect incipient open-circuit faults in the stator windings of an inverter fed drive. The method gets along with the hardware already present in modern drives, no additional sensors are required. By Applying voltage steps to the machine terminals and measuring the resulting current the phasor resistance can be estimated. By spatially combining the phase measurements of the resistance a phasor of the resistance symmetry can be introduced. With this phasor a high sensitive fault indicator is generated able to detect fault severity and position. Measurements on a laboratory test stand for different fault configurations prove the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method.

C	Tsypkin, M			IEEE	Tsypkin, Mikhail			Induction Motor Condition Monitoring: Vibration Analysis Technique - a Twice Line Frequency Component as a Diagnostic Tool	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES & DRIVES CONFERENCE (IEMDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)	MAY 12-15, 2013	Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc		condition monitoring; diagnostics; electrical faults; induction motors; twice line frequency; vibration analysis	ECCENTRICITY; NOISE	Vibration analysis is one of the most successful techniques used for condition monitoring of induction motors. The efficiency of this technique for diagnosing electromagnetic problems in the motor depends on the ability to analyse vibration data. The aim of this presentation is to clarify the origin of the motor vibration at twice line frequency based on the classical theory of electromagnetic vibration, recent researches, and the author's many years of experience in the field of vibration diagnostics on electrical machines from different industries. The vibration component at a twice line frequency is a very important indicator when evaluating an induction motor electromagnetic system condition. The correct understanding of physical phenomena that excite the vibration at this frequency is a key factor for diagnosing induction motor problems related to electromagnetic system operation. This presentation emphasizes that the most important forcing functions exciting the vibration at twice line frequency are the radial magnetic forces produced by the fundamental rotating magnetic field and a torque pulsation due to asymmetrical voltage and current in the stator winding as a result of a supply voltage imbalance in the power line and/or internal faults in the motor electrical system. Vibration excited by these sources may be significantly amplified by a resonance condition on the entire motor structure and/or on the particular motor components (for example, a stator core).

As faults in motor drives can cause safety hazards in applications such as electric traction, propulsion, aircraft, and others, it is desired to diagnose the fault, i.e., detect it and isolate it, in order to recover or engage safe-mode operation. Machine learning methods are divided into three main steps: 1) Feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA); 2) Classification using the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) or Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) methods; and 3) Classifier performance evaluation using the Cross-Validation (CV) method. While electric machine, inverter, and sensor faults are introduced, the supervised learning algorithms are applied to four case studies where two fault modes occur in a current sensor, and two occur in the speed encoder. Classification accuracy, i.e., the ability to diagnose a fault, for all four cases is shown to exceed 98%. The paper also investigates a load profile used in automotive driving cycles which produces richer dynamic responses that are more interesting from an application perspective. The final goal is to implement these algorithms in real-time such that fault diagnosis can be used to isolate drive faults, especially sensor faults, and operate in a safe mode.

Fault Simulation and Pattern Recognition in a Modular Generator under Two Different Power Converter Configurations	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES & DRIVES CONFERENCE (IEMDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)	MAY 12-15, 2013	Chicago, IL	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc		Fault tolerance; condition monitoring; fault detection; Permanent magnet machines	WIND; RELIABILITY; DRIVE	Key focus of this paper is the investigation of condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control in the modular multi-stage air-cored permanent magnet synchronous generator called 'C' core generator under different electrical connections. Condition monitoring and fault-tolerant control have been identified as a means of improving the reliability and availability of offshore or inaccessible renewable energy devices. As a result, two different ways of connecting modular generator stages are presented. Based on the above topologies two wind turbine models are designed in MATLAB (R)/Simulink (R) and fault-tolerance is investigated by implementing single electrical faults in one of the stages, such as single phase open circuit, diode short circuit, two phase short circuit and diode open circuit. It was found that the first topology offers fault-tolerance against the single phase open circuit fault while the second offers isolation between generator stages in all types of faults. Finally, the signal processing techniques of alpha - beta current locus, Power Spectral Density analysis and Continuous Wavelet Transformation have been implemented in order to extract detectable patterns of the electrical faults.

Transportation industry (automotive and aviation) is one of the major industries gaining interest in applications with PMAC machines due to increasing demand in fuel economy. Fault detection capability provides an additional level of reliability in all applications involving electric machines and, more specifically applications involving safety of consumers, operators or passengers. Open phase fault is one type of fault that could occur in a PMAC machine drive. A novel method of open single phase detection is proposed to overcome drawbacks in existing open single phase detection algorithms. The proposed method is based on the quadrature and direct axis current (I-qs(r) & I-ds(r)) behavior during the fault. Further, a simpler open phase/open winding fault simulation technique is presented for a SM-PMSM machine. Performance of fault detection scheme was verified through actual implementation on motor generator setup with Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) test capability.	[Kuruppu, Sandun S.; Kulatunga, N.

The FLS is a mathematical tool for calculating the uncertainties where precision and significance are applied in the real world. It is based on natural language which has the ability of "computing the word". The ELM is an extremely fast learning algorithm for neural network that can completed the training cycle in a very short time. By combining the FLS and ELM, new hybrid model, i.e., FLS-ELM is developed. The applicability of this proposed hybrid model is validated in fault detection in CWS which may help to improve overall efficiency of power generation plant, hence, consuming less natural recourses and producing less pollutions.

Containment domains are a programming construct that enable applications to express resilience needs and to interact with the system to tune and specialize error detection, state preservation and restoration, and recovery schemes. Containment domains have weak transactional semantics and are nested to take advantage of the machine and application hierarchies and to enable hierarchical state preservation, restoration and recovery. We evaluate the scalability and efficiency of containment domains using generalized trace-driven simulation and analytical analysis and show that containment domains are superior to both checkpoint restart and redundant execution approaches.

In this work, a new approach is proposed which combines a feature selection algorithm and neural network tool for leaks detection and characterization tasks in diesel engine air path. The Chi(2) is used as feature selection algorithm and the neural network based on Levenberg-Marquardt is used in system behavior modeling. The obtained neural network is used for leaks detection and characterization. The model is learned and validated using data generated by xMOD. This tool is used again for test. The effectiveness of proposed approach is illustrated in simulation when the system operates on a low speed/load and the considered leak affecting the air path is very small.

SVMs with radius basis function kernels are used for detecting and identifying sensor stuck and offset faults, where binary codes of fault types are used as the outputs of the SVMs to minimize the number of SVMs being used. The same output of a SVM may correspond to different types of faults and the final decision is made by all SVMs instead of one SVM. Moreover, a residual-based fault detection method using a time-variant threshold is developed to identify the abrupt change and scaling faults. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out in MATLAB to test the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed FDI methods using a wind turbine FDI benchmark model. Results show that the proposed methods can always detect the faults successfully within the required time limits.

Two methods were employed to isolate faults of different types at different locations: Support vector machines (SVM) and a Kalman-like observer. SVM could isolate most faults with the used data and characteristic vectors, except for high varying dynamics. In this case, the use of an observer, which is model-based, was found necessary.

A widely accepted approach is based on flux distribution or back EMF (BEM) model of the machine to calculate healthy phase currents. This is essentially an open-loop technique where currents are determined offline (based on motor fault models) for each fault scenario. Therefore, it is highly model-dependent. Since torque pulsation due to open-circuit faults are periodic, learning and repetitive control algorithms are excellent choices to minimize torque ripple. In this paper, iterative learning control (ILC) is applied as a current control technique for recovering performance in multiphase PM motor drives under open-circuit fault conditions. ILC-based FTC needs torque measurement, but avoids the need for complicated fault detection and fault diagnosis algorithms. Furthermore, a BEM+ILC based FTC is proposed that initiates the learning from a model-based approximate guess (from the BEM method). Therefore, this method combines the advantages of both model information as well as robustness to model uncertainty through learning. Hence, the proposed method is well-suited for high performance safety-critical applications. Finite element analysis (FEA) results on a five-phase PM machine are presented for verification of the proposed control schemes.

These genome-wide data present major computational challenges as the number of variables far exceeds the number of observations. Many computational tools have been developed for the analyses of these high dimensional data, and these methods have led to improved understanding of molecular biology. In particular, signature discovery (also known as variable selection or feature selection), a machine learning technique in which subsets of variables are selected to build robust models, are useful in mining these highdimensional functional genomic data. In this paper, we will review the applications of signature discovery methods in mining these high dimensional data. Specifically, we will focus on two applications, namely, the identification of signature genes predictive of disease phenotypes and the inference of regulatory networks. Signature genes predictive of disease phenotypes can be potentially used in the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Regulatory networks that capture the gene-to-gene influences can be used to provide the context of therapeutic intervention.

However, in practical application of this method, the imbalanced problem occurred in fault sample dataset has greatly influenced its effectiveness. To remedy this problem, this paper proposed an improved Support Vector Machines method based on biased empirical feature mapping. In the new method, biased discriminant analysis was applied in empirical feature space, to make all normal samples far away from center of fault samples, so that the overall fault diagnosis ability can be improved. Through theoretical analysis and empirical study on actual electronic circuit fault diagnosis problem, we show that our method augments the diagnosis accuracy rate effectively.

With the uncertainty representation of the RUL, the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) becomes an effective approach in lithium-ion battery RUL prognostics. But, the small sample size and low precision of multi-step prediction will bring district to RUL prediction for sparse RVM algorithm. With the on-line monitoring data updating, the dynamic training ability and online algorithm are necessary to improve the prediction precision for battery RUL model. Moreover, the operating efficiency and computing complexity are needed for on-line and real-time processing. A simple and effective on-line training strategy is introduced for RVM algorithm to realize high prediction performance. An incremental optimized RVM algorithm is proposed to achieve efficient online training for model updating. Furthermore, with the on-line training strategy, the prediction precision can increase for battery RUL estimation. Using proposed method, we carry out experiments with NASA battery data and the results show that our method has excellent performance on predicting the RUL of lithium-ion battery.

The sensor may not be truly healthy or fault-free, which could reduce the reliability of measurement results. In this paper, a new prototype of multifunctional self-validating sensor was put forward, and detailed intelligent functions were illustrated and generalized. Specifically, we 1) employ the multivariable relevant vector machine (MVRVM) coupled with faults detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) technology for the final validated measurement value (VMV), in which the polynomial predictive filters with low computation complexity is used for the data validation and then the incorrect measurements are validated or corrected on line. This MVRVM is very suitable for multiple measured components; 2) propose a novel random fuzzy variable (VRFV) based uncertainty evaluation strategy for the on-line validated uncertainty (VU) estimation, in which negative effects of different faults are fully considered. As a more general theory, VRFV has taken both the nonrandom and random effects into account; 3) define some measurement value status (MVS) to imply how the VMV are obtained, which enhance the security in application. The methodology presented is illustrated on an experimental system for hydrogen concentration, temperature and humidity, and results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a good solution to the status self-validation of the multifunctional self-validating sensor under both normal and abnormal faults situations.

The proposed constructing strategy starts with a known second generation wavelet basis and applies it in an undecimated filterbank. Via forward and inverse transformation procedure, an input signal is decomposed into a set of dyadic wavelet packets. By introducing a systematic way of wavelet packet reordering and ensemble wavelet generating method, another corresponding set of non-dyadic wavelet packets are generated. It is demonstrated that the derived pseudo non-dyadic second generation wavelet packets (PNSGW) are associated with well-defined band-pass filters, which ensure good time-frequency localizability and exact shift-invariance. The PNSGW strategy is combined with spectral kurtosis to detect incipient faults in mechanical systems. The processing results show that the proposed technique is a well complement to conventional dyadic wavelet transform in investigating transient impulse responses caused by faulty mechanical components.

For a pair of response data outputs of the circuit under test (CUT), the method introduces the notion of fault detection compatibility and conditional fault detection compatibility (conditional upon some other pair of response data outputs being simultaneously fault detection compatible) with respect to two-input AND/NAND and/or OR/NOR logic. The process is illustrated with the design details of space compressors for the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems or ISCAS 85 combinational and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark circuits using simulation programs ATALANTA, FSIM and COMPACTEST, though, because of space constraints, only some partial results on simulation on ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential benchmark circuits using ATALANTA are provided here.

The concerned stator faults are the inter turns short circuit, phase to phase and phase to ground faults. The inputs of the feedforward multi-layer neural network are the indicators of the stator faults while its outputs are the corresponding faults. Therefore, the used indicators of faults are extracted from the symmetrical components of the stator currents which are the magnitude and the angle phase of the negative and zero sequence current. The neural network is trained by the back-propagation algorithm. A faulty simplified multiple coupled circuit model of a 1.1 kW induction motor is used to simulate the different operating conditions of the machine useful to built the data base for the training and the test procedures. The good training and test results show the efficiency of the proposed method.

In fact, due to the design, construction, and ageing phenomenon of loads, torque imposed to the motor can not be strictly constant and, in most of cases, varies according to the machine rotor position. These variations of the load torque, which are not related to the health of the motor, involve amplitude modulation of machine stator current at rotational frequency. In this paper we propose a technique based on the introduction of a supplementary known mechanical unbalance on the motor rotor axis to estimate the unknown load unbalance level from time analysis of stator current signal. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Inappropriate operation of this component can prove costly for the machine's owner. This paper presents theoretical analysis and experimental validation for detecting failure of brushless exciter rotating diodes that can fail either open circuit or short circuit. Harmonic analysis of the alternator output voltage waveform is performed when machine is unloaded as well as when it runs around its rated load. Apparition of characteristic frequencies can be useful to distinguish the rotating diodes state.

The rubbing model used consists of the radial elastic impact and the tangential Coulomb friction. Through numerical calculation, the excitation current, eccentricity are used as the control parameters, investigating their effect on the rub-impact rotor-bearing system, by bifurcation diagrams, Poincare maps, trajectories, and frequency spectrums. Various nonlinear phenomena, including period-one, period-five, quasi-period and chaotic motions, are induced and the system stability is obviously influenced due to the UMP. In addition, it is found that the large eccentricity that exceeds to a certain extent may lead to the full annular rubbing from the partial rubbing. The results can provide some theoretical references for the safety operation and rub-impact fault diagnosis of the hydraulic generating set.	[Zhang, L. K.; Ma, Z.

Since these works have been carried out on complex mechanical systems (automotive gearboxes, vehicle wheels, wind turbines), neither the influence of operating parameters, nor the influence of structural parameters over the observed angular speed variations have been clearly identified. However, the implementation of effective tools for condition monitoring prospects requires a deep understanding of these interactions. In this regard, a test bench has been designed to allow defective bearing monitoring through IAS observation of a simple shaft running under varying loads and speeds, the system being simple enough to be easily described in various kind of mechanical or phenomenological models. The aim of this paper is to present a better understanding of the relationships between the speed variation induced by the monitored fault, the structural response and the observed phenomena. In the first part results obtained for a healthy bearing will be analyzed. These initial results serve as a reference for analysis of the results obtained with bearing defects. Coupled with dynamic modeling, they will also highlight the existence of a low frequency torsion mode. The results of this first part also highlight the wider interest of the IAS analysis for the study of rotating systems. In a second part, the measurements are performed with bearings having spalling type defects on their outer ring. The aim of this section is to estimate the influence of operating conditions on IAS monitored indicators. All these results will provide further phenomenological explanations of coupling between bearing fault and rotating speed.

In this paper we propose to use the statistical modeling of vibration time series to identify these components. Building a model of raw signal may be ineffective. It is proposed to decompose the signal into set of narrowband sub-signals using a time-frequency representation. Next, it is proposed to model each sub-signal in the given frequency range and classify all sub-signals using their statistical properties. We have used several parameters (called selectors because they will be used for selection of sub-signals from the time-frequency map for further processing) for analysis of the sub-signals. They are based on the statistical analysis and can be useful for example in testing Gaussianity of the data set (distribution of vibration time series from machine in good condition is close to Gaussian, damaged not). Results of such modeling will be used in the sub-signals classification procedure and in the defects detection as well. We illustrate effectiveness of the novel technique using real data from heavy machinery system.

Premised upon the concept of time-frequency (TF) reassignment, its basic objective is to provide a sharper representation of signals in the TF plane and extract the individual components of a non-stationary multi-component signal, akin to empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The rich mathematical structure based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) makes synchro-squeezing powerful for gear fault diagnosis, as faulty gear signal is frequently constituted out of multiple amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated signals embedded in noise. This work utilizes the decomposing power of synchro-squeezing transform to extract the IMFs from a gear signal followed by the application of standard gearbox condition indicators which promises greater prognostic power than that can be achieved by applying condition indicators directly to the inherently complex gear signals. The efficacy and robustness of the algorithm are demonstrated through practical experimental data obtained from a helicopter gear box.

In this paper polynomial models are employed to describe nonlinear relationships of variables available from such drives and to generate residuals for real time fault detection and performance comparisons. Both transient and steady state system behaviours have been investigated for optimal detection performance. Amongst 27 variables available from the drive, the torque related variables including motor current, I-d, I-q currents and torque signals show changes due to mechanical misalignments. So only these variables are explored for developing and optimising detection schemes. Preliminary results obtained based on a motor gearbox system show that the torque feedback signal, in both the steady and transient operations, has the highest detection capability whereas the field current signal shows the least sensitivity to such faults.

Specifically, Concordia transform is firstly performed on the real-valued three-phase motor current signals to construct complex-valued signals. The instantaneous frequencies of the current signals are then extracted through a phase demodulation. Subsequently, spectral analysis is performed on the current instantaneous frequencies to identify bearing defect features. Both simulation and experimental studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method in identifying bearing defects. The method is inherently low cost, non-invasive, and computational efficient, making it a good candidate for various applications.

Bayesian estimation is applied to support vector machine (SVM) in the novel algorithm, which made fault diagnosis system work more effectively. In the paper, the analysis model is presented that the solutions of RVM have the feature of sparsity and RVM can obtain global solutions under finite samples. The process of transformer fault diagnosis for four working statuses is given in experiments and simulations. The results validated that this method has obvious advantages of diagnosis time and accuracy compared with backpropagation (BP) neural networks and general SVM methods.

The application of PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technologies can be a powerful decision support tool to help maintenance planners. The RUL (Remaining Useful Life) estimations obtained from a PHM system can be used in order to plan in advance for the repair of components before a failure occurs. However, when system architecture is not taken into account, the use of PHM information may lead the operator to rush to replace a component that would not affect immediately the operation of the system under consideration. This paper presents a methodology for decision support in maintenance planning with application in aeronautical systems. The methodology combines system architecture information and RUL estimations for all components comprised in the system under study, allowing the estimation of a RUL value for the whole system. This system level RUL (S-RUL) can be used as support information for identifying the best moment to repair a component. Also, when several components present high degradation levels, the proposed methodology can be used to define a set of components that, when repaired, will bring the whole system to a safe degradation level with lowest cost. A case study is used to illustrate the application of the methodology in a simplified aircraft electrical system.

This GP-based method does not require knowledge of the layout design of a board, nor relevant domain knowledge such as lighting conditions and visual characteristics of the components. Furthermore, conventional image operators are not required to perform the detection. The experiments show that these evolved GP programs can identify all the faults while some suspicious areas are also highlighted. By this GP approach, manual inspection effort can be dramatically reduced. In addition, an evolved GP detection program can readily work on different types of boards without re-training.

In order to estimate the time before failure to provide information for timely bearing replacement strategies, condition-based machine health monitoring techniques are employed. This paper discusses a model for estimating the severity of bearing faults that can be used for residual bearing life estimation by processing the vibration signal. The proposed technique used in this model examines the spectral content of vibration signals across frequency bins and then fits Gaussian distributions to each frequency bin. With the use of these Gaussian models and training set examples with different fault severity levels, characteristic membership functions are constructed. This enables estimation of the severity levels of the bearing faults through a fuzzy-logic inspired process, whereby the severity level corresponds to the maximum of the set of corresponding membership functions. Thus based on discrete fault severity levels, trained Gaussian fittings of spectral bins and characteristic fault membership functions are capable to estimate the fault severity on a continuous scale.

So any fault in the power transformer may lead to the interruption of power supply and accordingly the financial losses will also be great. So it is important to detect the incipient faults of transformer as early as possible. Among the existing methods for identifying the incipient faults, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is the most popular and successful method. Any kind of fault inside transformer gives rise to overheating and will produce characteristics amount of gases in transformer oil. In this paper classical methods of DGA such as Key Gas Method, Rogers Ratio Method and Duval Triangle Method are reviewed first and the need to integrate with the artificial intelligence (AI) methods for improving the performance of diagnosis is justified. Reported work presents a new and efficient artificial intelligence technique that is support vector machine (SVM) for transformer fault diagnosis using dissolved gas analysis. The proposed method i.e. Support Vector Machine is a classification tool based on statistical learning theory. Here 3 types of multiclass SVM method that is One-against-One, One-against-All and binary decision tree have been used for the fault diagnosis. Each SVM method has been trained and tested with many practical fault data of power transformers.	[Mehta, Amit Kumar; Sharma, R.

J	Li, XB; Qian, JS; Wang, GG				Li, Xiaobin; Qian, Jiansheng; Wang, Gai-ge			Fault Prognostic Based on Hybrid Method of State Judgment and Regression	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL; MACHINE; DIAGNOSTICS	Fault prognostic is one of the most important problems in equipment health management system. This paper presents a hybrid method of mixture of Gaussian hidden Markov model (MG-HMM) and fixed size least squares support vector regression (FS-LSSVR) for fault prognostic. The system is established based on three parts. The first part trains the MG-HMM and FS-LSSVR model. According to the known samples, several MG-HMM models can be learned based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, the forward variables can be calculated based on these MG-HMM models. Based on these forward variables, the corresponding FS-LSSVR models are built. All the MG-HMM models and corresponding FS-LSSVR models are combined into a model library. The second part recognizes the unknown sample based on the model library. This part obtains the MG-HMM model and FS-LSSVR model by maximization likelihood calculation between the unknown sample and MG-HMM models. The third part of the system calculates the forward variables based on the MG-HMM obtained from the second part. These forward variables are inputted into the corresponding FS-LSSVR model to compute the remaining useful life (RUL) of the unknown sample. Finally, we carry out experiments on benchmark data set to verify the proposed method. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the hybrid method.

Correct diagnosis and early detection of incipient faults avoids harmful, sometimes devastative, consequences. In this work, on the basis of a model of an induction motor, we study the detection of broken rotor bars problem using residual generators based in moving horizon estimator of the rotor resistance and the reconfiguration action where the failure events are detected by jumps in the estimated parameter values of the model. The estimated parameter is introduced in the control law which based on input-output linearizing feedback control in order to reconfigure the control law and compensate the fault effect. Simulation experiments in terms of speed response show the applicability of the proposed approach to induction motor subject to faulty conditions caused by a broken rotor bar.

The control of such a type of defect makes it possible to avoid the damage and to guarantee machines functioning with the maximum effectiveness. This fault leads essentially to load torque oscillation around its average value at rotational frequency. Theoretical development based on magneto-motive forces approach shows the modulation effect of mechanical unbalance on rotor current expressions. Taking account rotor winding function distribution, supplementary induced currents in rotor meshes lead to an amplitude modulation of stator current around its supply frequency and its principal slot harmonic, at rotational frequency. Because a real load is not ideal and presents an intrinsic rotor asymmetry involving an additional time varying torque according to its rotor position, the stator motor current spectral harmonics produced by the load will overlap the harmonics caused by the main fault (rotor unbalance) since induction machine becomes sufficiently loaded. This paper examines detection of such machine defect by analysis of stator current spectrum for unloaded and loaded squirrel cage motor.

The DGA is exploited for fault classification tools implementation using the artificial intelligence techniques. In this study, we use the Rogers ratios and the Doernenburg ratios DGA methods as gas signature. The Support vector machine (SVM) is powerful for the problem with small sampling (small amounts of training data), nonlinear and high dimension (large amounts of input data). The paper presents a comparative study on one hand for the choice the most appropriate DGA method between the Rogers and Doernenburg ratios methods. On the other hand, it compares the various SVM architectures by comparing the kernel functions types with the aim to establish the most appropriate SVM model. Before testing, the proposed structures are trained and tested by the experimental data from Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG). The test results suggest that SVM Rogers model can generalize better than SVM Doernenburg model. The approach has the advantages of high accuracy. The other advantage is that the model is practically applicable and may be utilized for an automated power transformer diagnosis. The classification accuracies of the SVM classifier are compared with fuzzy logic (FL), radial basis function (RBF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifiers. The test results indicate that the developed preprocessing approach can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracies for power transformer fault classification.

Equipment Health monitoring (EHM) is a companion to PdM that provides a tracking indication of equipment health. The industry needs to deploy and assess PdM and EHM capabilities to determine best practices for the industry and the potential for cost reduction through deployment of these technologies. Applied Materials is working with both Micron Technology and Intel Corporation on EHM and PdM development and assessment projects, partially funded by ISMI. As a result of these projects a portable EHM solution has been designed and demonstrated that can be deployed "out-of-the-box" to track equipment health, but also updated as more information is ascertained on specific smart health indicators. Also, preliminary PdM results in both projects reveals an ability to predict key downtime event including particle monitor, throttle valve and liquid flow failures. Results were achieved on both CVD and etch tool types.

Various detection approaches have been proposed in previous papers. This paper proposes a method for diagnosing the stator-winding faults of an induction motor by the direct detection of asymmetry admittance component. Before starting the diagnosis, the asymmetry admittances for the considered fault cases under various load conditions are obtained by simulation. The amplitude and phase of the positive-and the negative-sequence voltages, V-p and V-n, and those of currents, I-p and I-n, are extracted from the voltage and current Park vectors respectively. The asymmetry admittance, Y-a, is calculated from them. These steps are repeated for each sample time and the motor condition is diagnosed according to the variations in the Y-a value. Simulation and experimental results are also shown and the proposed method is investigated and validated.

In the paper we have developed, implemented and tested a prognostic software system for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of failing components of a commercial grade turbofan engine. The software system was developed in two stages - prognostic stage for predicting engine component's remaining useful life (RUL) and decision-fusion stage for combining the different decisions predicted by the prognostic software. A graphical user interface (GUI) was also developed for testing and ease of operation. Two different prediction approaches were used in the development of the prognostic software - a deterministic and a probabilistic prediction approaches. A nonlinear exponential prediction method was used to develop the deterministic prognostic algorithm and the cloud computation theory was used to develop a probabilistic prediction algorithm. The data used were the estimated efficiency and flow of the engine derived by a diagnostic software from the sensor measurement of temperature and pressure of an engine component. The decision fusion stage was used to fuse all predicted RUL values by the prognostic algorithms to produce a final decision about the most accurate RUL prediction of an engine's failed component. Fuzzy logic inference system was used in the development of the decision-fusion algorithm. The overall performance of the developed prognostic software system was satisfactory and the test results produced accuracy above the ninety percent when the input efficiency and flow data were free of measurement noise. The prediction accuracy of the component's RUL was dropped to about eighty percent when the input data were corrupted with ten percent measurement noise. However, during the fusion stage some of the low RUL prediction accuracy due to noise was regained. In this paper, the development steps along with descriptions of the technical approaches used in the development of the prognostics and fusion algorithms are included. Test results are also provided and explained with adequate illustrations along with comparison of the major differences between the two prediction approaches used to develop the prognostics algorithms.

In this work, a state model of internal faults of the PMSM is developed. This model is in the (abc) reference frame. The modeling approach is based on the assumption that each stator phase is replaced by two major and minor sub-windings. This model is used subsequently in the residual generation for diagnosis. The fault indicators are obtained by the projection in parity space and estimated using the Luenberger observer. A scenario of fault inter-turn by the short-circuit occurring between phase (a and b) is validated by simulation.

A complete model of the device is presented. An accurate model of the induction machine is proposed because the considered faults are come from this element. The developed model of the conversion chain allows studying both the cases with and without faults. The principal components analysis (PCA) method is then used for system diagnosis. This approach is based on residues analysis. The complete model has been implemented on the Matlab software to perform the matrix data needed for PCA method. The simulation results of several variables such as stator and rotor currents, shaft rotational speed, electrical power, electromagnetic torque and other variables issued from mathematical transformations of healthy and faulted DFIG are analyzed. Comparisons of simulation results with those of other diagnostic methods are performed to show importance of the PCA method in fault diagnosis of systems. The results show the efficiency of the approach but require a good choice of the number of principal components.

The research currently done under the scope of Self-Learning Production Systems (SLPS) tries to fill this gap by providing an innovative and integrated approach for developing more intelligent monitoring and control solutions. This paper introduces the research background and describes the generic SLPS architecture with the main focus on the Adapter component, which represents the entity responsible for adapting the system behaviour based on the available contextual information. The envisioned Adapter architecture as well as the generic Adaptation Process are introduced. The proposed solution was then employed to manage the energy consumed by machine tools in CNC machines, taking into account machine idle times patterns. Both the objectives and approach of this application scenario are presented, as well as the Adapter role whenever the system needs to be adapted to improve the manufacturing line sustainability.

In case of a damaged bar, the use of a machine model that represents the rotor as a set of electrically and magnetically coupled coils allows the computation of the impedance that depends on the asymmetry in the damaged cage. The paper proposes a simple method, based on the measurement of the impedance of the motor for a single phase supply that uses the changes of the impedance along the rotor position as an indicator for the asymmetry. Experimental results prove the validity of the proposed technique.

Development of effective monitoring and fault diagnosis methods to prevent failures that could cause huge economic loss timely is necessary. Bearing faults with different degrees differ from each other in the aspects of signal amplitudes, impact intervals, etc. Besides, the whole life of the bearing is also a developing process for some sensitive features related to the fault trend. Most of the work in machine fault diagnosis focus on the decision of fault existence and thus ignore the developing process of the faults. Hence, to investigate the fault degree is of great meaning for timely maintenance action. In this paper, a novel intelligent method based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) to conduct rolling element bearing fault size quantitative recognition is proposed. This analysis constructed an intelligent nonlinear model with input feature vectors extracted from raw signals and defect sizes as outputs. Through validation of experimental data, the results indicated that the bearing fault size could be effectively and precisely recognized.

J	Coteli, R				Coteli, Resul			A combined protective scheme for fault classification and identification of faulty section in series compensated transmission lines	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Fault classification; faulty section identification; series compensated transmission line; S-transform; support vector machines	NEURAL-NETWORK; WAVELET TRANSFORM; AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION; S-TRANSFORM; SYSTEM; ALGORITHM	The fault detection process is very difficult in transmission lines with a fixed series capacitor because of the nonlinear behavior of protection device and series-parallel resonance. This paper proposes a new method based on S-transform (ST) and support vector machines (SVMs) for fault classification and identification of a faulty section in a transmission line with a fixed series capacitor placed at the middle of the line. In the proposed method, the fault detection process is carried out by using distinctive features of 3-line signals (line voltages and currents) and zero sequence current. The relevant features of these signals are obtained by using the ST. The obtained features are then used as input to multiple SVM classifiers and their outputs are combined for classifying the fault type and identifying the faulty section. Training and testing samples for the proposed method have been generated with different types of short-circuit faults and different combinations of system parameters in the MATLAB environment. The performance of the proposed method is investigated according to the accuracy of fault classification and faulty section identification. To evaluate the validity of this study, the proposed method is also compared to both ST neural network and previous studies. The proposed method not only provides a good classification performance for all types of faults, but also detects the faulty section at a high accuracy.

Crack and blade fracture often occur in centrifugal compressor impeller. In order to study the impeller dynamic characteristic with crack and the blade fracture, a three-dimension finite element model (FEM) was built using ANSYS program, and an experimental modal analysis was also carried out. The compared results show that the preceding four orders natural frequencies and vibration models are basically consistent, and those also verified the reliability of the simulation results. In addition, two kinds of failure mode were also simulated, such as crack and blade fracture. It concluded that all orders natural frequencies decrease clearly, compared with the normal impeller. How the severity of crack and blade fracture affects the natural frequency was also discussed.

Statistically significant relationships were investigated between different mechanistically based variables to develop a statistical pathway diagram for the degradation of acrylic that is important in concentrating photovoltaics. The statistically signi cant relationships were investigated using lifetime and degradation science using a domain knowledge semi-supervised generalized structural equation modeling (semi-gSEM. Predictive analytics and prognostics are informed from the statistical pathway diagram in order to predictively understand the lifetime of PV modules in different stress conditions and help with these critical lifetime technologies.

The analysis of stator currents in the frequency domain is the most commonly used method, because induction machine faults often generates particular frequency components in the stator current spectrum. In order to obtain a more robust diagnosis, we propose to classify the feature vectors extracted from the magnitude of spectral analysis using multi-class SVM to discriminate the state of the motor. Finally, in order to validate our proposed approach, we simulated the multi-winding induction motor under Matlab software. Promising results were obtained, which confirms the validity of the proposed approach.

Quantitative Rotor Broken Bar Evaluation in Double Squirrel Cage Induction Machines under Dynamic Operating Conditions	2013 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION ON ECOLOGICAL VEHICLES AND RENEWABLE ENERGIES (EVER)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference and Exhibition on Ecological Vehicles and Renewable Energies (EVER)	MAR 27-30, 2013	MONACO	Monaco Dev Durable, MITI, Automobile Club Monaco, Moto Club Monaco, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE		AC Machine; Condition monitoring; double cage rotor; fault diagnostics; induction motor; wavelet Transform.	MOTORS	Advanced monitoring techniques leading to fault diagnosis and prediction of induction machine faults, operating under non-stationary conditions have gained strength because of its considerable influence on the operational continuation of many industrial processes. In case of rotor broken bars, fault detection based on sideband components issued from currents, flux, instantaneous control or power signals under different load conditions, may fail due to the presence of inter-bar currents that reduce the degree of rotor asymmetry, especially for double squirrel cage induction motors. But the produced core vibrations in the axial direction, can be investigated to overcome the limitation of the classical technique using appropriate timefrequency analysis for these purposes. Unlike previous approaches, the presented technique is based on optimized use of the Discrete wavelet transform to overcome the limitation of classical frequency approaches under non-stationary operating conditions. The developed approach is best suited for automotive or high power traction systems, in which safe-operating and availability are mandatory. Experimental results are provided, showing the validity of the investigated technique, leading to an effective diagnosis procedure for incipient rotor broken bars in double or single cage induction machines under dynamic operating conditions.

Thus, these two elements must be taken into account in order to provide a relevant diagnosis of these electrical systems. The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of fault detection and diagnosis in a three-phase inverter feeding an induction motor. The proposed approach is a neural network classification applied to the fault diagnosis of a field oriented drive of induction motor. Multilayer perception (MLP) networks are used to identify the type and location of occurring fault using the stator Concordia mean current vector. In the case of a single fault occurrence, a localization domain made with seven patterns is built. With the possibility of occurrence of two faults simultaneously, there are twenty-two different patterns. Simulated experimental results on 1.5-kW induction motor drives show the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a classification performance over than 95%.

However, despite their advantages, they are subjected during function to several constraints of different nature including, mechanical faults are statistically the most frequent of these faults, there are mainly the eccentricity faults which are defined by a variation of the air gap of the machine. Failure of eccentricity with its variants has been extensively studied for the case of an induction machine with squirrel cage. we consider in this paper to take account of the specificities and characteristics of the doubly-fed induction generator, for develop an analytical model that describes as precisely as possible the machine performance in the healthy case and fault eccentricity. So, we are particularly interested in developing this model and the global modeling of the wind chain.

An intelligent approach for engine fault diagnosis based on Hilbert-Huang transform and support vector machine	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Engine fault diagnosis; Noise feature vector; Wavelet packet denoising; Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT); Support vector machine (SVM)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; VIBRATION	Based on the techniques of Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and support vector machine (SVM), a noise-based intelligent method for engine fault diagnosis (EFD), so-called HHT-SVM model, is developed in this paper. The noises of a sample engine under normal and several fault states are first measured and denoised by using the wavelet packet threshold method to initially lower the noise level with negligible signal distortion. To extract fault features of the engine, then, the HHT is selected and applied to the measured noise signals. A nine-dimensional vector, which consists of seven intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), maximum value of HHT marginal spectrum and its corresponding frequency component, is specified to represent each engine fault feature. Finally, an optimal SVM model is established and trained for engine failure classification by using the fault feature vectors of the noise signals. Cross-validation results show that the proposed noise-based HHT-SVM method is accurate and effective for engine fault diagnosis. Due to outstanding time-frequency characteristics and pattern recognition capacity of the HHT and SVM, the newly proposed HHT-SVM can be used to deal with both the stationary and nonstationary signals, and even the transient ones. In the view of applications, the HHT-SVM technique may be suggested not only to detect the abnormal states of vehicle engines, but also to be extended to other fields for failure diagnosis in engineering.

Among the large body of previous works, Strata enables efficient memory dependence recording with little hardware overhead and can be applied smoothly to snoopy protocols. However, Strata records imprecise happens-before relations and assumes Sequential Consistency (SC) machines that execute memory operations in order. This paper proposes Rainbow, which is based on Strata but records near-precise happens-before relations, reducing the number of logs and increasing the replay parallelism. More importantly, it is the first R&R scheme that supports any relaxed memory consistency model. These improvements are achieved by two key techniques: (1) To compact logs, we propose expandable spectrum (the region between two logs). It allows younger non-conflict memory operations to be moved into older spectrum, increasing the chance of reusing existing logs. (2) To identify the overlapped and incompatible spectra due to reordered memory operations, we propose an SC violation detection mechanism based on the existing logs and the extra information can be recorded to reproduce the violations when they occur. Our simulation results with 10 SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that Rainbow reduces the log size by 26.6% and improves replay speed by 26.8% compared to Strata. The SC violations are Jew but do exist in the applications evaluated.

In this context, three operational classes are considered, namely: normal (where the machine has no fault), unbalance (where the machine load has its weight not equally distributed), and misalignment (where the rotor and machine axes are dislocated from its natural concentric position). A large dataset consisting of 606 distinct scenarios is developed for system training and testing, along with a preprocessing strategy that improves data distribution among the three classes considered. A classifier based on an artificial neural network is described, achieving a global accuracy rate of 93.5%.

A New Diagnostic Technique for Real-Time Diagnosis of Power Converter Faults in Switched Reluctance Motor Drives	2013 TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL IEEE APPLIED POWER ELECTRONICS CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION (APEC 2013)	Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)		English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 17-21, 2013	Long Beach, CA	IEEE, Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc			PERFORMANCE; COMMUTATION; GENERATORS; TORQUE	Accurate fault identification allows the adoption of procedures that minimize the fault impact on the machines operation. Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) have been recognized for their fault-tolerant capabilities and they present a very robust configuration, particularly due to the absence of windings or magnets in the rotor. All these attributes make the SRM a competitive solution for aircraft and automotive applications, where systems reliability is a crucial feature. Therefore, in this paper, a new algorithm for real-time diagnosis of power converter faults in SRM drives is proposed. In contrast to other methods that use additional sensors or devices, the presented technique uses the measured phase currents only, which are already available for the drive control. The proposed algorithm effectively detects the inverter faulty phase and is capable to localize the faulty power switch. Power switch open-and short-circuit fault occurrences in an asymmetric full-bridge converter are considered and analyzed.

By analysis of the coupled heat and mass transfer between the process air and desiccant solution, six variables are used as the inputs of the LSSVM model, namely: desiccant solution and air flow rates, desiccant solution and air inlet temperature, desiccant concentration, and air relative humidity. Meanwhile, outlet air temperature and relative humidity related with the performance of the dehumidifier are considered as the outputs of the LSSVM model. Compared with the existing theoretical models, the present one is very simple, yet accuracy, and does not need complex theoretical analysis. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on performance predicting in a packed tower liquid desiccant dehumidifier. This developed model is expected to have widely applications in performance evaluation, operational monitoring, fault detection and diagnosis.

This research proposes two types of engine failures that are broken rotor bars, and rotor unbalance. Several conventional vibration and current analysis techniques exist by which certain faults in rotating machinery can be identified; however, they generally deal with a single fault only. Instead, in real induction machines, the case of multiple faults is common. When multiple faults exist, vibration and current are excited by several fault-related frequencies combined with each other, linearly or nonlinearly. The contribution of this paper is the development of a condition-monitoring strategy that can make accurate and reliable assessments of the presence of specific fault conditions in induction motors with single or multiple faults present.

Spectral Analysis for Identifying Faults in Induction Motors by Means of Sound	2013 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING (CONIELECOMP)	International Conference on Electronics Communications and Computers CONIELECOMP		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd Annual International Conference on Electronics, Communications and Computing (CONIELECOMP)	MAR 11-13, 2013	Cholula, MEXICO	UDLAP, IEEE Secc Puebla		induction motor; fault detection; sound; intrinsic mode function; spectral analysis	DIAGNOSIS	Induction motors are critical components for most industries. Induction motors failures may yield an unexpected interruption at the industry plant. Several conventional vibration and current analysis techniques exist by which certain faults in rotating machinery can be identified. Ever since the first motor was built, plant personnel have listened to the noises emanating from machines; with enough experience, a listener may make a fairly accurate estimate of the condition of a machine. Although there are several works that deal with vibration and current analysis for monitoring and detection of faults in induction motors, the analysis of sound signals has not been sufficiently explored as an alternative non-invasive monitoring technique. The contribution of this investigation is the development of a condition monitoring strategy that can make reliable assessment of the presence of a specific fault condition in an induction motor with a single fault present through the analysis of sound signal. The proposed methodology is based on the combination of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods. Results show that the proposed methodology can be applied to sound signal analysis; there this detection technique is suited for detection of fault frequencies in induction motors.

On-Line Monitoring of Mechanical Unbalance/Misalignment Troubles in Ship Alternators by Direct Measurement of Split-Phase Currents	2013 IEEE ELECTRIC SHIP TECHNOLOGIES SYMPOSIUM (ESTS)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 5th Biennial Electric Ship Technologies Symposium (ESTS)	APR 22-24, 2013	Arlington, VA	IEEE, RTDS Technologies, U S Off Naval Res (ONR), Sci & Technol, Dept Navy, ABB, IEEE Power & Energy Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Fault diagnosis; rotor eccentricity; split-phase currents; symmetrical components; synchronous machine	UNBALANCED MAGNETIC PULL; FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; GENERATOR	Synchronous generators (SGs) are vital ganglia of the ship. SGs supply survival/defense/attack systems, propulsion, etc., so deserving on-line monitoring. Rotor unbalances shorten bearing lifetime, with overheating and stator-rotor rubs. No technique is definitely established for on-line evaluation of rotor eccentricities (REs) in working SGs. Actual manual air gap checks are time-consuming, and require unit shut-down and dismounting. This paper shows a method based on measurement of split-phase currents in stator windings with parallel branches. A symmetrical component transformation reverts the split-phase currents in rotating space vectors. The (p+/-1)-order vectors provide an affordable estimation of REs in 2p-pole machines. Rogowski coils or current transformers can be installed in the terminal box, or on winding front-ends, for current measurement. A LabView virtual instrument (VI) was developed for method application. This paper also describes some tests carried out on board an Italian Navy's ship for on-line monitoring of shaft misalignments in a loaded 2MVA SG. Loads on board ships are usually unbalanced and may change suddenly. However, it is shown that the load-related unbalance can be separated from the eccentricity-related unbalance in the split-phase currents. Good assessment of air gap percentage reduction in the tested 2MVA machine was finally obtained.

The method proposed is aimed to handle the training problem of missing or incomplete fault sampling data and is inspired by the "self/nonself" recognition principle in the artificial immune systems. The detectors, generated by the RRNS, are treated as the "nonself" training samples and used to train the RVM model together with the "self" training samples. After the training succeeds, the "nonself" detection model, which requires only the "self" training samples, is obtained for the fault detection and diagnosis. It provides a general way solving the problems of this type and can be applied for both fault detection and fault diagnosis. The standard Fisher's Iris flower dataset is used to experimentally testify the proposed method, and the results are compared with those from the support vector data description (SVDD) method. Experimental results have shown the validity and practicability of the proposed method.

Gearbox vibration measurement is typically processed via frequency spectrum analysis to identify faults. However, the gearbox system may operate with varying rotational speed, as in many types of wind turbines. In such applications, harmonic wavelet transform analysis has been shown to capture the physics of events with minimal leakage between frequency bands, good frequency resolution and good time resolution. Implementing HWT signal processing for fault detection requires the development of libraries of healthy and faulty gear states to use with pattern recognition. The development of DGM can help to greatly reduce the library development and provide a physically meaningful connection of fault indicators to the actual fault patterns. In this research, a comprehensive DGM is developed, followed by HWT analyses to illustrate the fault detection and diagnosis procedure and capability.

Field Experience With the Split-Phase Current Signature Analysis (SPCSA): Eccentricity Assessment for a Stand-Alone Alternator in Time-Varying and Unbalanced Load Conditions	2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES DESIGN, CONTROL AND DIAGNOSIS (WEMDCD)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE Workshop on Electrical Machines Design, Control and Diagnosis (WEMDCD)	MAR 11-12, 2013	Pierre & Marie Curie Univ, Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE France Sect	Pierre & Marie Curie Univ	Fault diagnosis; rotor eccentricity; split-phase currents; symmetrical components; synchronous machine	FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS; MAGNETIC PULL; GENERATOR; CIRCUIT	This paper describes some tests carried out on board an Italian Navy's ship for validation of a novel technique for on-line monitoring of shaft misalignments in working synchronous generators. The technique is based on the split-phase current signature analysis principle. Rotor eccentricities impact on the split-phase currents of stator windings with parallel connections, producing asymmetry in both amplitudes and phases. Symmetrical components can be applied to carry out a straightforward diagnosis starting from the measurement of those currents. This paper also describes the practical measurements, in presence of unbalanced and step-changing loads. Loads on board ships are usually unbalanced and may change suddenly. However, it is shown that the load-related unbalance can be separated from the eccentricity-related unbalance in the split-phase currents. The paper shows the basics of the split-phase current signature analysis, the practical installation of current transformers in the test generator, the instrumentation set-up, and the results of measurements with various loads, besides some check simulations carried out by using winding functions.

Using d-q model of induction motor this asymmetry is reflected as pseudo-saliency through different resistances and inductances in both axes. An extensive study has been performed to simulate various cases of faulty cage, which cannot be achieved by measurements on actual industrial drives. Simulation results can be efficiently used for analysis of closed-loop induction motor drives, in which determination of rotor faults, due to the intrinsic speed correction performed by the controller, is much harder to achieve.

In these cases, the load and speed fluctuate continuously, near their rated values, and in a random way; the diagnosis becomes more complicated than under stationary regime or under other kind of transients, as the startup, much intensively studied at the literature, in which the speed, slip, and current undergo larger variations and evolve in a predefined way. In the first part of this paper, different approaches which enable the diagnosis under non-stationary conditions are introduced from a conceptual perspective.

Response of Electrical Drives to Gear and Bearing Faults - Diagnosis under Transient and Steady State Conditions	2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES DESIGN, CONTROL AND DIAGNOSIS (WEMDCD)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE Workshop on Electrical Machines Design, Control and Diagnosis (WEMDCD)	MAR 11-12, 2013	Pierre & Marie Curie Univ, Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE France Sect	Pierre & Marie Curie Univ	Electrical Drives; prognostics and health management; fault diagnosis; fault detection; fault tolerance; gears; bearings; time-frequency analysis; categorization	DECOMPOSITION; DEMODULATION; VIBRATION; SIGNALS	Bearing and gear faults in systems using electrical drives share many commonalities and have some differences in they way that they can be detected. They both cause a mechanical impulse at a frequency that is related to the speed of the rotor. For neither is it possible to develop a state-space model relating the fault and its location and severity to the measured outputs. The measurements therefore require extensive processing to extract features that are related to a fault and to categorize it. Measurements physically close to the fault location (e. g. vibrations) are generally more useful to accurately determine this fault than measurements away from it (e. g. currents and voltage at the drive). Models of faults include fatigue (e. g. Paris model) and degradation due to bearing currents. In the recent past the techniques to identify these faults have been refined, tested extensively, and compared. They typically include signal conditioning, feature extraction (in the time and time-frequency domain) and categorization, which includes fault identification. Failure prognosis and use of multiple sensors are possible future directions of research to produce reliable estimated of condition and facilitate health management.

An anti-aliasing wavelet packet algorithm is proposed. The method is used to analyze a typical simulation signal and a vibration signal measured from a gear box in wind generator to study the mechanical mechanics. The results show that the improved algorithm is quite effective in overcoming the shortcomings of the canonical method. It can extract the characteristic frequencies of rotating machine precisely and effectively.

J	Jiang, C; Huang, SH				Jiang, Chuan; Huang, Samuel H.			A Computationally Efficient and Adaptive Approach for Online Embedded Machinery Diagnosis in Harsh Environments	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; TRANSFORM; SCHEME	Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has advanced to the stage where industry is now demanding machinery that possesses self-diagnosis ability. This need has spurred the CBM research to be applicable in more expanded areas over the past decades. There are two critical issues in implementing CBM in harsh environments using embedded systems: computational efficiency and adaptability. In this paper, a computationally efficient and adaptive approach including simple principal component analysis (SPCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering for classification is proposed for online embedded machinery diagnosis. Compared with the standard principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), SPCA is adaptive in nature and has lower algorithm complexity when dealing with a large amount of data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is firstly validated using a standard rolling element bearing test dataset on a personal computer. It is then deployed on an embedded real-time controller and used to monitor a rotating shaft. It was found that the proposed approach scaled well, whereas the standard PCA-based approach broke down when data quantity increased to a certain level. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieved 90% accuracy when diagnosing an induced fault compared to 59% accuracy obtained using the standard PCA-based approach.

A quality control of machines subsequent to manufacturing is therefore required in order to test whether the machines comply with its specifications. This paper aims to describe the consideration of rotor tolerances due to non-ideal manufacturing processes. Design/methodology/approach - Various fault scenarios are studied employing numerical field simulations focusing the influence of rotor tolerances on current and back-EMF of the studied machine. Findings - This analysis shows that electrical quantities are applicable to realize tolerance diagnosis by evaluating the influence of non-ideal manufactured rotor components on the back-EMF and current characteristics of the studied machine. Practical implications - This study provides an approach how to estimate the influence of the manufacturing tolerances for realization of a reliable quality control. This is useful to ensure a high reliability of the manufactured machines. Originality/value - This paper gives a close insight on how to investigate non-ideal manufacturing and in particular its influence on the stator current.

Due to the complex nature of guided waves (GWs), accurate and efficient computation tools are necessary to investigate the mechanisms responsible for dispersion, coupling, and interaction with damage. In this paper, a fully coupled electromechanical elastodynamic model for wave propagation in a heterogeneous, anisotropic material system is developed. The final framework provides the full three dimensional displacement and electrical potential fields for arbitrary plate and transducer geometries and excitation waveform and frequency. The model is validated theoretically and proven computationally efficient. Studies are performed with surface bonded piezoelectric sensors to gain insight into the physics of experimental techniques used for SHM. Collocated actuation of the fundamental Lamb wave modes is modeled over a range of frequencies to demonstrate mode tuning capabilities. The effect of various actuation types commonly used in numerical wave propagation models on Lamb wave speed are studied and compared. Since many studies, including the ones investigated in this paper, are difficult to perform experimentally, the developed model provides a valuable tool for the improvement of SHM techniques.

Through studying the theory of invariant moment and the shape characteristics of pump indicator diagram, seven invariant moments is extracted from the indicator diagram as a pumping unit well condition of the characteristic parameters. Then these parameters are pretreatment, and it makes up seven eigenvector which are regarded as the input eigenvector of the SVM. The experiment indicates that the method can not only detect the fault of the pumping oil well but also can recognize the fault type of it, which is very effective for safety protection and fault diagnosis of the pumping oil.

Since the frequencies of ultrasonic signal are very high, they will lead to much higher computing burden when using the common technique of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) directly. In this paper, envelope detection technology and heterodyne technology which integrated in an ultrasonic data collection system are used to reduce the frequency effectively. To allow for the easier detection of the bearing faults, these two techniques has been used together with FFT. A verification research with respect to vibration analysis is carried out to analyze the effectiveness and superiority of ultrasonic data collection in time domain and frequency domain aspects respectively. Extensive experiments have been performed in an Alternating Current (AC) motor system, and the results indicated that this ultrasonic data collection system is as useful as vibration analysis system in diagnosing the faults of bearings. In addition, it is more sensitive in fault diagnosis in the early stages of the bearing faults than vibration acquisition system.				wsl20052005@126.com; wsl20052005@126.com					Han D, 2007, IET COMPUT DIGIT TEC, V1, P170, DOI 10.1049/iet-cdt:20060145; Hua Zhu Ning, 2006, QUANTUM ELECTRON, V42, P241; PETER WY, 2010, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V57, P263; Villa LF, 2011, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V25, P2157, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2011.01.022	4	0	0	0	7	TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD	STAFA-ZURICH	LAUBLSRUTISTR 24, CH-8717 STAFA-ZURICH, SWITZERLAND	1022-6680		978-3-03785-710-6	ADV MATER RES-SWITZ			2013	706-708						803	806		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.706-708.803			4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Materials Science	BGR70	WOS:000323912100178					2022-02-14

The steps of the per-level de-noising method were then given and the experimental study with a vibration model was carried out. The results prove that the method is advantageous to de-noising, which is more suitable to recover the interest mutations signal buried in intensive background noise. The application of the method in the bearing vibration was presented and the results show that it can inhibit the background noise effectively and recover the interest information satisfactorily. Rolling bearing is the most widely applied mechanical part in rotating machinery and also one of the most easily damaged components. Its running state often directly affects the overall equipment performance. But the early impact vibration signal of the fault rolling bearing is weaker, the fault signatures are often severely polluted by noise, and extracting noise signatures from the noise interference is the key ([1]) for fault diagnosis of the rolling bearing. When it is failed, the vibration often contains some certain abrupt signals, showing a certain non-stationary. The traditional Fourier transform can only make global transform for the signal, but can not depict the characteristics during specific time quantum or frequency band. Therefore, it is unsuitable for time varying signal analysis and has greater limitations. Wavelet Analysis has been highly concerned as frontier domain by scientific and technological circles both at home and abroad in recent years, and it is a new powerful time-frequency analysis tool. It overcomes the shortcomings ([2]) that the frequency domain analysis does not involve time information and the time domain analysis does not involve frequency domain information. In 1992, Donoho and Johnstone proposed the Wavelet Threshold Denoising Method and also gave the threshold value formula, which was applied to a variety of noise reductions and achieved great success. But this general threshold has serious "over-shrinked" tendency for wavelet coefficients, especially the higher frequency part in the useful signal is often treated as noise for removal ([3-4]). To solve this problem, this article proposes the Gradient Threshold Denoising Method based on the autocorrelation analysis of wavelet detail coefficient, and describes the determination of the wavelet decomposition layers and conducts experimental study. Finally, it applies this method to conduct denoising analysis on the engine bearing signal, and proves the validity of Wavelet Gradient Threshold Denoising Method in preprocessing of bearing fault diagnosis based on the analysis of the vibration signal.

However, such vibration based techniques are difficult to implement in planetary gearboxes due to the complex nature of measured vibration spectrum resulting from rotating planets with respect to the stationary transducer mounted on the gearbox housing. Motor current signal analysis (MCSA) provides an alternative and non-intrusive way to detect mechanical faults through electrical signatures. So far, no investigation has been reported in literature to monitor a planetary gearbox in an electromechanical drive-train using MCSA because of the difficulties in modeling the planetary gear-set such as a large number of degrees of freedom and nonlinearity associated with tooth separations. In this paper, a lumped parameter model of an electro-mechanical drive-train has been developed, which consists of a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) connected to a load through a planetary gearbox. Afterwards, a seeded tooth defect is introduced into the electro-mechanical model to show that MCSA can successfully provide valuable diagnostic information regarding the planetary gearbox failure. Finally, the time waveform, as well as, the Fourier transform and Morlet wavelet transform of the PMSM stator current are presented to demonstrate the capability to detect the gear tooth fault and its severity in planetary gearbox using MCSA.

The safety region estimation and the state identification of the rolling bearing operational were performed by the comprehensive utilization of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). The collected vibration data was segmented according to a certain time interval, and then the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of each piece of the data were obtained by EMD. The control limits of two statistical variables extracted by PCA were presented as state characteristics. The safety region estimation for the rolling bearing operational status was performed by two-class LSSVM. The states of normal bearing, ball fault, inner race fault, and outer race fault were identified by the multi-class LSSVM. The results show that the estimation accuracy for both the safety region and the states identification reached 95%, and that the validity of the proposed method was verified.

Sensitivity Analysis of Insulation State Indicator in Dependence of Sampling Rate and Bit Resolution to Define Hardware Requirements	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	FEB 25-28, 2013	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE), IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Technol Management Council, IEEE Reg 8, IEEE S Africa Sect IE IA PEL Joint Chapter		AC motor drives; Fault diagnosis; Induction motor protection; Monitoring; Pulse width modulated inverters; Rotating machine insulation testing; Squirrel cage motors	MACHINES; MOTOR	Industrial application of adjustable speed drives (ASD) has been constantly growing in the last decades. In addition to the sheer number of inverter-fed drives the variety of application fields is increasing too. The use of such ASD in safety critical devices or industrial systems with many drives installed leads to the requirement of increased reliability. Furthermore many drives are operated at or near their rated values to increase efficiency and return on investment. In comparison to mains-fed machines, high dynamics and the fast switching of the inverter adds significant stress to different components of inverter-fed drives. The electrical machine is one of the most important components in these drives. A major cause for machine breakdown is insulation related fault. It is important to mention that such faults do not occur suddenly but origin in an alteration of the insulation condition and finally lead to short circuits. This alteration of the insulation leads to changes in the machine's high-frequency (hf) behavior. To reduce the number of breakdowns and apply predictive maintenance insulation monitoring can be implemented. Monitoring of the machine's hf-behavior can be used to assess the insulation condition by investigation of the transients in the current or voltage. Thus oversampling of the sensor signals is needed. The needed sampling rate and resolution to detect alterations in the machine's hf-behavior is investigated by experimental results.	[Nussbaumer, P.; Wolbank, Th.

A novel ant-based clustering algorithm with kernel method is used to cluster machines in a fleet. The algorithm has two features. First, a projection based on kernel principal component analysis replaces random projection to improve the efficiency. Second, the clustering is performed on the feature space after kernel mapping to improve the clustering accuracy. The algorithm can cluster machines in a self-organizing way to achieve the horizontal assessment. The vertical assessment for the single machine based on CMAC is presented. Then, how to combine the vertical and horizontal assessment results is discussed. The outlier mining method to detect abnormal machines based on the clustering results is also proposed. Cluster-based global outlying factor is suggested to measure the outlying degree of abnormal machine. Finally, the case study on axial fans shows that the combined method can give a more comprehensive assessment for fans' performance monitoring.

Fault-tolerant Control of a Wind Turbine with Generator Stator Inter-turn Faults	AUTOMATIKA			English	Article						Wind turbine control; Generator fault-tolerant control; Stator winding isolation fault; Nonlinear estimation; Asymmetric field-oriented control		Faults of wind turbine generator electromechanical parts are common and very expensive. This paper introduces a generator fault-tolerant control scheme for variable-speed variable-pitch wind turbines that can be applied regardless to the AC generator used. The focus is on generator stator isolation inter-turn fault that can be diagnosed and characterised before triggering the safety device. An extension of the conventional wind turbine control structure is proposed that prevents the fault propagation while power delivery under fault is deteriorated as less as possible compared to healthy machine conditions. Fault-induced and inherent asymmetries of the generator are estimated and respected by the field-oriented control of the generator to eliminate torque oscillations. An approach for asymmetry detection based on an unscented Kalman filter is proposed. Presented fault-tolerant control strategy is developed taking into account its modular implementation and installation in available control systems of existing wind turbines to extend their exploitable life span and increase energy production. Simulation results for the case of a megawatt class wind turbine are presented.

This state-transition methodology is straightforward, with a simply-perceived relation between the programming and the corresponding sequential function. The current operational function of the system is described as the current state of the system using state-transition programming. The state transition diagram or table describes the current state and the conditions for transition. The operation is transferred to a corresponding destination state when a set of conditions become valid for leaving the current state. Thus, the sequential operation is explicit, and any continuous conditions scanning (from command source and sensors) only include those that are pertinent for leaving the current state. The methodology is highly-structured and efficient, the programming tasks are readily comprehensible, and fault diagnostics can be easily included within the program's structure. The presented application of an automatic sliding-door illustrates the feasibility of this approach. This paper presents the MFSM (Modular Finite-State Machine), the ECA (Event-Condition-Action) system, motion generation, motion control with load estimation, and an example of a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) system. The limitations and attributes of each technique are discussed, and a state-table format is presented with the capability of representing parallel asynchronous sequential processes.

PROGNOSIS INFORMED STOCHASTIC DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK FOR OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF WIND TURBINES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME/ISCIE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION, ISFA 2012			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME/ISCIE International Symposium on Flexible Automation (ISFA2012)	JUN 18-20, 2012	St Louis, MO	Amer Soc Mech Engineers		Wind farm O&M; predictive maintenance; prognostics; economic and environmental impact	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMISSIONS; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; ENERGY	Advances in high performance sensing and signal processing technology enable the development of failure prognosis tools for wind turbines to detect, diagnose, and predict the system-wide effects of failure events. Although prognostics can provide valuable information for proactive actions in preventing system failures, the benefits have not been fully utilized for the operation and maintenance decision making of wind turbines. This paper presents a generic failure prognosis informed decision making tool for wind farm operation and maintenance while considering the predictive failure information of individual turbine and its uncertainty. In the presented approach, the probabilistic damage growth model is used to characterize individual wind turbine performance degradation and failure prognostics, whereas the economic loss measured by monetary values and environmental performance measured by unified carbon credits are considered in the decision making process. Based on the customized wind farm information inputs, the developed decision making methodology can be used to identify optimum and robust strategies for wind farm operation and maintenance in order to maximize the economic and environmental benefits concurrently. The efficacy of proposed prognosis informed maintenance strategy is compared with the condition based maintenance strategy and demonstrated with the case study.

Traditionally, CBM involves equipping machinery with electronic sensors that continuously monitor components and collect data for analysis. The addition of the multisensory capability of human cognitive functions (i.e., sensemaking, problem detection, planning, adaptation, coordination, naturalistic decision making) to traditional CBM may create a fuller picture of machinery condition. Cognitive systems engineering techniques provide an opportunity to utilize a dynamic resource-people acting as soft sensors. The literature is extensive on techniques to fuse data from electronic sensors, but little work exists on fusing data from humans with that from electronic sensors (i.e., hard/soft fusion). The purpose of my research is to explore, observe, investigate, analyze, and evaluate the fusion of pilot and maintainer knowledge, experiences, and sensory perceptions with digital maintenance resources. Hard/soft information fusion has the potential to increase problem detection capability, improve flight safety, and increase mission readiness. This proposed project consists the creation of a methodology that is based upon the Living Laboratories framework, a research methodology that is built upon cognitive engineering principles(1). This study performs a critical assessment of concept, which will support development of activities to demonstrate hard/soft information fusion in operationally relevant scenarios of aircraft maintenance. It consists of fieldwork, knowledge elicitation to inform a simulation and a prototype.

The introduced motor consists of seven magnetically independent stator layers, which each layer includes a set of 4 by 4 stator/rotor poles. In this SLSRM, the three layers are energized together to produce high torque and also decrease the torque ripple in comparison with the one layer conventional SRM. Since each layer has its independent phase in the motor, the isolation problem of coils and cooling troublesome existing in conventional SRMs is solved. In addition, these types of SLSRM have some other advantages, like simpler configuration, cooling in easier way, etc.. Firstly an analytical design is carried out to illustrate the design procedure and then three-dimensional (3-D) magneto static simulation analysis of the SLSRM and the one layer SRM is performed using 3-D FEM, to obtain and verify the flux-linkage, flux density and torque profiles. Also, the proposed motor is compared with a conventional one layer SRM with a same size and volume.

In the U.S., scour accounts for almost 60% of bridge failures. Currently available techniques in the literature for predicting scour are mostly based on empirical equations and deterministic regression models, like Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, and do not predict the evolution of scour over time. In this paper, we will discuss a Gaussian process model, which includes Bayesian uncertainty for prediction of time-dependent scour evolution. We will validate the model on the experimental data conducted in four different flumes in different conditions. The robustness of the algorithm will also be demonstrated under different scenarios, like lack of training data and equilibrium scour conditions.

RVM is developed in Bayesian framework. It does not need to estimate the regularization parameter with less relevance vectors, and its kernel function does not need to satisfy Mercer condition. Simulation results show that: compared with the traditional BP neural network, RVM has the faster modeling speed, more accurate diagnosis, and is worthy of promotion and application in fault diagnosis of the gearbox.

In order to improve the performance of kurtosis under strong levels of background noise, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is used to decompose the bearing vibration signals into a number of IMFs. The IMF kurtosis is then calculated because of its sensitivity of impulses caused by faults. Subsequently, the IMF kurtosis values are treated as fault feature vectors and input into SVM for fault classification. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in roller bearing fault diagnosis.

But slight knock can improve the power and economic performance of an engine. Therefore, existence and intensity of the knock are preconditions for the automatic knock control system to work. This paper describes an advanced approach solving the knock detection task. It is based on a time-frequency image generation solution followed by a support vector machine detection step trained in a constructive supervised way. The proposed method is applied to analyze the pressure signals measured from an engine cylinder to detect the knock based on the popular cycle-by-cycle classification. It is shown that this approach can qualify well for knock detection.

Eccentricity Faults Compensation in SRMs by Counterbalancing Ampere Turns in Facing Poles	4TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL POWER ELECTRONICS, DRIVE SYSTEMS & TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE (PEDSTC 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th Annual International Power Electronics, Drive Systems and Technologies Conference (PEDSTC)	FEB 13-14, 2013	K N Toosi Univ Technol, Tehran, IRAN	Iran Power Generat, Transmiss & Distribut Management Co (Tavanir), IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc (IAS), IEEE Iran Sect, Iranian Assoc Elect & Elect Engineers (IAEEE), Power Elect Soc Iran (PESI)	K N Toosi Univ Technol	Electromagnetics Characteristics; Finite Element Analysis; Eccentricity Compensation; Fault Control; Switched Reluctance Machines	SWITCHED RELUCTANCE MOTOR; FINITE-ELEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	In this paper, a new eccentricity compensation method for Switched Reluctance Machines (SRMs) is presented. Eccentricity faults are very common in these machines; nevertheless there are little literatures addressing the control and compensation on this issue. It is theoretically shown that the occurrence and growth of the eccentricity fault change the amplitude of radial forces (RF) exerted on the rotor and accordingly the amplitude of the unbalanced magnetic force (UMF) is increased, these RFs can be controlled to compensate the fault. In this regard, the dependency of RF on variation of number of turns for stator coils and fault level is demonstrated analytically and principle of the new compensation strategy is introduced as well. This strategy is implemented on a SRM utilizing Finite Element Method (FEM). This approach is accomplished through switching among the various arrangements in the number of turns for the coils on the stator poles; hence, UMF is controlled without additional auxiliary coils.

J	Su, H; Liu, Q; Li, JS				Su, Hang; Liu, Quan; Li, Jingsong			Adaptive Approach for Boundary Effects Reduction in Rotating Machine Signals Analysis	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							IMAGE COMPRESSION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; EXTENSION; DESIGN	Boundary effects are caused by incomplete data in the boundary regions when the analysis window gets closer to the edge of a signal. Various extension schemes have been developed to handle the boundaries of finite length signals to reduce the boundary effects. Zero padding, periodic extension, and symmetric extension are some basic extension methods. However, these solutions have drawbacks. In this paper, we consider the problem of handling the boundary effects due to improper extension methods in the wavelet transform for the application of fault diagnosis of rotating machine. An extension algorithm based on curve fitting with properties that make it more suitable for boundary effects reduction is presented. This extension algorithmcould preserve the time-varying characteristics of the signals and be effective to reduce distortions appearing at the boundary. Then, an interpolation approach is used in the boundary effects region to further alleviate the distortions. Procedures for realization of these two algorithms and relative issues are presented. Several experimental tests show that the proposed algorithms are efficient to alleviate the boundary effects in comparison to the existing extension methods.

J	Pietrowski, W				Pietrowski, Wojciech			3D analysis of influence of stator winding asymmetry on axial flux	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						3D FEM; Artificial neural networks; Condition monitoring; Induction machine; Finite element analysis; Electric motors	INDUCTION MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORK; FAULTS	Purpose - The diagnostics of electrical machines is a very important task. The paper seeks to present a study and analysis of stator winding asymmetry in induction motors. The purpose of this paper is presentation of coupling two numerical techniques, a finite element analysis and an artificial neural network, in diagnostics of electrical machines. Design/methodology/approach - A finite element method (FEM) analysis and time-stepping are applied for the study of IM with stator winding asymmetry. One of the asymmetry symptoms is an axial flux. In order to determine the level of winding asymmetry a generalized regression neural network has been considered. The result of FFT analysis of axial flux and electromagnetic torque was the input vector to artificial neural network. The output vector is the level of asymmetry. The algorithms are tested using a set data obtained from numerical simulation. The emphasis of this structure is on accurate approximation of the value of the stator winding asymmetry. Findings - The axial flux, as the symptom of stator winding asymmetry, can contribute to better detection of the asymmetry in stator winding.

However, testing for the existence of the ER biomarker in a patient's tumor sample mainly depends on the subjective decisions of the doctors. The aim of this paper is to introduce the usage of a machine learning tool, functional trees (FTs), to attain an ER prognosis of the disease via an objective decision model. For this aim, 27 image files, each of which came from a biopsy sample of an invasive ductal carcinoma patient, were scanned and captured by a light microscope. From these images, 5150 nuclei were segmented with image processing methods. Several attributes, including statistical, wavelet, cooccurrence matrix, and Laws' texture features, were calculated inside the border area of each nucleus. A FT was trained over the feature dataset using a 10-fold cross-validation and then the obtained model was tested on a separate dataset. The assessment results of the model were compared with those of 2 experts. Consequently, the weighted kappa coefficient indicated a very good agreement (kappa = 0.899 and kappa = 0.927, P < 0.001) and the Spearman's rank order correlation showed a high level of correlation (rho = 0.963 and rho = 0.943, P < 0.001) between the results of the FT and those of the observers. The Wilcoxon test revealed that there was no significant difference between the results of the experts and the model (P = 0.051 and P = 0.316). Finally, it was concluded from the results that the FT could be used as a tool to support the decision of doctors by indicating consistent outputs and hence contribute to the objectiveness and reproducibility of the assessment results.

In this paper, we use the Bayesian network (BN) classifiers and data mining technology to diagnose different kinds of rotor faults in machinery fault simulator (MFS) under varied loads. First of all, three kinds of popular BN classifiers are introduced as the diagnosis model for rotor fault, and the fault diagnosis modeling methods based on BN classifiers is established by data mining. Then, a MFS is introduced and applied to generate the vibration data of system with different rotor faults under varied loads, as dataset 1, dataset 2 and dataset 3. At last, the dataset 1 generated by MFS is used to demonstrate the rotor fault diagnosis process with BN classifiers. The same procedures are also implemented for dataset 2 and dataset 3 to show the difference of diagnosis results under varied loads.

This paper focuses on developing a condition-based replacement policy using online inspection data, which is one of the main problems in prognostic and health management of mechanical devices. This problem is addressed for a type of mechanical device with a multistate degradation process. In addition, one of the practical challenges in failure data analysis using inspection data called interval censoring is addressed. A control-limit policy is presented through a cost-based optimization model, which can be used to determine when to replace a degraded device. The application of the proposed model is demonstrated using a case study on a bearing shell's wear process.

The developed methodology enables inference with limited number of monitoring points optimally placed to obtain information on functional states of components, subsystems, and relevant physical parameters affecting the reliability of elements of the system. The approach integrates physics of failure modes when available with traditional reliability data (e. g., failures and demands) and is (1) capable of assessing current state of a system's health and probabilistic assessment of the remaining life of the system (prognosis), and (2) through appropriate data processing and interpretation can point to elements of the system that have caused or are likely to result in system failure or degradation (diagnosis). Continuous health assessment is made possible through the application of dynamic BBNs. The proposed methodology is designed to answer important questions such as how to infer the health of a system based on limited number of monitoring points at certain subsystems ("upward" inference); how to infer the health of a subsystem or component based on knowledge of the health of the main system ("downward" inference); and how to infer the health of a subsystem based on knowledge of the health of other subsystems ("distributed" inference). The methodology and algorithms are demonstrated through an example.

However, its application not only spans these macro systems, but can also be effectively applied to nano-systems, as we illustrate in this work. Though initial studies have been carried out to apply PHM to high power field effect transistors [3], an in-depth investigation into its potential for nano-reliability studies is still lacking. This serves as a motivation for us to present a holistic study on the time-dependent dynamic degradation and failure prediction of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) using random telegraph noise (RTN) fluctuations that can be measured when the device leakage current is sensed with a nominal voltage during the operation of the transistor / circuit. We will first present the algorithm used to track the degradation of the transistor and highlight the use of RTN signals and their analysis in the time and frequency domains. This will be followed by an experimental case study on a very small area transistor, illustrating how the RTN signals can be used to diagnose the degradation of the device. Finally, we conclude with potential suggestions for further research into this topic in the near future.

To cope with this, new maintenance policies like condition monitoring and prognostics are developed to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of components. However, decision making based on these predictions is a still underexplored area of maintenance management. The objective of this paper is to quantify the added value of prognostic information (RUL) in maintenance decision making for multi-component systems considering different levels of inter-component dependence (i.e. economic, structural and stochastic). Furthermore, the effect of implementation of the prognostic maintenance policy on the component lifetimes is investigated, as generally in literature the use of prognostics in maintenance scheduling is perceived as to increase component lifetimes. A dynamic prognostic maintenance policy is developed, which takes into account the real component degradation and inter-component dependencies to optimally plan maintenance while minimizing the long-term average maintenance cost per unit time. The added-value of scheduling maintenance actions based on prognostic information is determined by comparing it to two other conventional maintenance policies, these are: age-based preventive maintenance without grouping and age-based preventive maintenance with grouping of maintenance activities. The ability of the prognostic maintenance policy to react to different and changing deterioration patterns and dependencies between all considered components is validated and illustrated by a real life case study on a multi-component manufacturing system. The results show that the developed dynamic prognostic maintenance policy reduces the long-term maintenance costs. Moreover, it is shown that the magnitude of this cost reduction and increase or decrease in component lifetimes depends on the component dependencies.

The proposed approach is based on the three phase voltage and current measurements which are available at all the sources i.e. substation and at the connection points of DG. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a practical distribution feeder emanating from 132/11kV-grid substation in India with loads and suitable number of DGs at different locations is considered. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, practical situations in distribution systems (DS) such as all types of faults with a wide range of varying fault locations, source short circuit (SSC) levels and fault impedances are considered for studies. The proposed fault location scheme is capable of accurately identify the fault type, location of faulted feeder section and the fault impedance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed method in practical in smart grid distribution automation (DA) for fault diagnosis.

The complex architecture of electronics, the interdependency of component functionalities, and the miniaturization of most electronic systems make it difficult to detect and analyze anomalous behaviors. A Hidden Markov Model-based classification technique determines unobservable hidden behaviors of complex and remotely inaccessible electronic systems using observable signals. This paper presents a data-driven approach for anomaly detection in electronic systems based on a Bayesian Hidden Markov Model classification technique. The posterior parameters of the Hidden Markov Models are estimated using the conjugate prior method. An application of the developed Bayesian Hidden Markov Model-based anomaly detection approach is presented for detecting anomalous behavior in Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors using experimental data. The detection results illustrate that the developed anomaly detection approach can help detect anomalous behaviors in electronic systems, which can help prevent system downtime and catastrophic failures.

Optimized Diagnostic Model Combination for Improving Diagnostic Accuracy	2013 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2013	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; ENSEMBLES; MACHINES	Identifying the most suitable classifier for diagnostics is a challenging task. In addition to using domain expertise, a trial and error method has been widely used to identify the most suitable classifier. Classifier fusion can be used to overcome this challenge and it has been widely known to perform better than single classifier. Classifier fusion helps in overcoming the error due to inductive bias of various classifiers. The combination rule also plays a vital role in classifier fusion, and it has not been well studied which combination rules provide the best performance during classifier fusion. Good combination rules will achieve good generalizability while taking advantage of the diversity of the classifiers. In this work, we develop an approach for ensemble learning consisting of an optimized combination rule. The generalizability has been acknowledged to be a challenge for training a diverse set of classifiers, but it can be achieved by an optimal balance between bias and variance errors using the combination rule in this paper. Generalizability implies the ability of a classifier to learn the underlying model from the training data and to predict the unseen observations. In this paper, cross validation has been employed during performance evaluation of each classifier to get an unbiased performance estimate. An objective function is constructed and optimized based on the performance evaluation to achieve the optimal bias-variance balance. This function can be solved as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Sequential Quadratic Programming based optimization with better convergence property has been employed for the optimization. We have demonstrated the applicability of the algorithm by using support vector machine and neural networks as classifiers, but the methodology can be broadly applicable for combining other classifier algorithms as well. The method has been applied to the fault diagnosis of analog circuits. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared to other combination rules in the literature. It is observed that the proposed combination rule performs better in reducing the number of false positives and false negatives.

A mix of physical simulation and functional failure analysis was chosen as a route for early assessment of degradation in complex systems as capturing system failure modes and their symptoms facilitates the assessment of health management solutions for a complex asset. The method chosen for the IVHM development is closely correlated to the generic engineering cycle. The concepts employed by this method are further demonstrated on a laboratory fuel system test rig, but they can also be applied to both new and legacy hi-tech high-value systems. Another objective of the study is to identify the relations between the different types of knowledge supporting the health management development process when using together physical and functional models. The conclusion of this lead is that functional modeling and physical simulation should not be done in isolation. The functional model requires permanent feedback from a physical system simulator in order to be able to build a functional model that will accurately represent the real system. This paper will therefore also describe the steps required to correctly develop a functional model that will reflect the physical knowledge inherently known about a given system.

C	Wang, N; Lyu, MR; Yang, CG			IEEE	Wang, Ning; Lyu, Michael R.; Yang, Chenguang			A Machine Learning Framework for Space Medicine Predictive Diagnostics with Physiological Signals	2013 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 02-09, 2013	Big Sky, MT	IEEE			SEIZURE-PREDICTION; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; SYMPTOMS; EPILEPSY; LONG	Prognostics and health management (PHM) in the context of space missions focuses on the fundamental issues of system failures in an attempt to predict when the failures may occur, and links these issues to system life cycle management. Space missions that are targeting for aerospace exploration or aviation also pose great challenges on the health conditions of people involved, such like astronauts, crew members, aviators, etc. Considering the inherent risks of space missions and the difficulty of direct communications between crew and ground support medical specialists, we see that greater autonomy in medical operations for crew is required. Namely, there is an urgent call for an effective on board medical system to predict and prevent health problems in a timely manner, rather than following reactive approaches which are inherent to conventional medicine. Interdisciplinary research is underway to develop computer based, self-diagnosis and self-directed treatment programs for the crew to autonomously predict, prevent, and manage potential health problems of two types: physiological and psychological. Predictive diagnostics aims at identifying negative health trends with concerned premonitory symptoms followed by predicting the future health condition and raising alarms in case of emergency. These alarms will startup devices that are capable of quickly reacting to an acute disease by delivering therapy or notifying a caregiver, thus avoiding fatal consequences likely to occur. Acute diseases such as cardiovascular and epileptic seizures are found to be frequently incident in-flight medical events, where the aftermath of seizures such as dyspnoea or serious physical injuries usually does the most harm to the subject. Consequently, a predictive diagnostics system that is able to provide early and action able real-time warnings of impending health problems would play an extremely crucial role in aerospace medicine. In this process, the diagnostic determination is based on the differences between current health status and the predefined normal status. Besides, considering the underlying concepts in predictive diagnostics of aerospace medicine in which every crew member is unique, the development of a processing strategy specially designed for each individual on a subject-by-subject basis is not only necessary but also feasible. The highly autonomous predictive diagnostics system in aerospace medicine would then be able to perform real-time health assessment followed by a comparison of inspection results with a crew member's health baseline, where the health baseline refers to a normal health state in which the crew member is identified as a physically and mentally healthy person to meet in-flight specific requirements. On the Information Technology side, machine learning techniques have made tremendous progress recently in medical diagnosis and health data analytics. We consequently initiate an effort on bringing machine learning based disease prediction technology as predictive diagnostics applications in the context of aerospace medicine. In space missions the physiological and psychological health conditions of crew are subject to continuous monitoring, in which electroencephalogram (EEG) , electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can be critical. EEG is broadly used to study the nervous system, monitoring of sleep stages, biofeedback and control, and diagnosis of epilepsy. Considering EEG has long been employed in crew selection and training, and recently been widely recognized as an effective means for disease diagnosis and prediction, in this paper we mainly focus on EEG in our investigation for aerospace medicine. After introduction of EEG and its applications in predictive diagnostics, we explore and extract amplitude-frequency patterns in EEG to provide distinctive features as health indicators. To further achieve predictive diagnostics for aerospace medicine, we propose a machine learning based framework involving physiological signals for automatic health monitoring and disease prediction. This framework incorporates feature extraction as front end, and employs state-of-the-art data mining and classification mechanism to proactively distinguish between normal and abnormal health conditions in real time. Automatic disease prediction for crew members can therefore be timely provided for proper actions. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm, we employ epileptic seizure prediction as a case study. It is shown through experiments that the proposed predictive diagnostic system leads to promising prediction results. As an application of the disease prediction framework on physiological sources other than EEG, we have further discussed its employment on measuring and diagnosing disrupted neuromuscular characteristics and muscle fatigue for astronauts and aviators with EMG signals. We expect the framework described in this paper will result in a positive impact on enhancing the medical operation autonomy in aerospace medicine.

Therefore, parallel applications must tolerate hardware failures to ensure that not all computation is lost on machine failures. Checkpointing and rollback recovery are very useful techniques to implement fault-tolerant applications. In parallel applications a checkpointing protocol is required to guarantee that individual checkpoints form a consistent global state. Coordinated approaches are the most popular solution to achieve global checkpointing consistency. However, their main drawback is their poor scalability due to the required runtime coordination. This work presents a new hybrid protocol that combines the detection of valid recovery lines at compile time with a light and asynchronous protocol at runtime to negotiate the closest valid recovery line. Experimental results prove the efficiency and scalability of the proposal.

Moreover, the coordination characteristic curves of the trigger time versus dynamic errors are proposed for under-voltage and over-voltage protection. Modified coordination characteristic curves use a critical trigger time to isolate the faults. An support vector machine (SVM) is a multi-layer decision-making model, which detects voltage disturbances, such as voltage swell, voltage sag, voltage unbalance, and faults.

Accordingly, such quantities as cell's output voltage, current, operating temperature, and pressures of gases supplied are monitored. Subsequently, an extension matter-element model is built according to malfunctions of the fuel cell system, which are further categorized into 7 types, each with 12 sorts of characteristics.

Engine Fault Diagnosis Using Acoustic Signals	PROGRESS IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND PROCESSING OF RESOURCE, PTS 1-4	Applied Mechanics and Materials		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Engineering (ICSEEE 2012)	DEC 29-30, 2012	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	Guangdong Univ Business Studies		Diagnosis; IC Engine; Noise Pollution; Acoustic; Amplitude	NOISE	This work presents an experimental study to detecting the faults of engine using its noise. The noises produced by the engine and its accessory systems are numerous: whines, squeals, knock, rattles, and many other sounds. Faults diagnosis for Mitsubishis car engine model 2006 has been conducted and this diagnosis includes normal operating conditions for the engine (without malfunction) and for malfunctions situations at variable engine speed 1000,2000, 3000 and 4000 rpm respectively The engine data is acquired from a four cylinder one- petrol engine test bed under consideration at different operating states, and then simulated. Most of the conventional fault diagnosis techniques using sound emission and vibration signals are based on analyzing the signal amplitude in the time or frequency domain. For engine under fired and misfires spark the all the domain parameters (RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy) was processed using MATLAB software. It was found that fault detection and diagnosis for internal combustion engines is complicated by the presence of engine noise during normal operation. The average of amplitude found to be 450 x10(-3)m for normal engine working without any malfunction and 458x10(-3)m for misfire of one spark plug and for misfire of two spark plugs 457.8 x10(-3)m. In this study, some of the engine malfunction such as failure spark plug has been recorded, but we can generalize it to include all engine breakdown. Generally, sound emission signal serves as a promising alternative to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in rotating machinery when the vibration signal is not available. This research paper explores that automobiles could be major sources of noise pollution.

In this paper, a new faults diagnosis technique for the power station using the data fusion technique has been proposed. The vibration signals of the power station were recorded by the multi-channel sensors. The independent component analysis (ICA) was adopted as the data fusion approach to find the characteristic vibration signals of the power station faults. Then the wavelet packet was employed to extract the feature vector of the fused vibration signals. In addition, the oil particle features has been extracted using the oil analysis. Lastly, the least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) was used to recognize the fault patterns of the power station. Moreover, the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) was employed to enhance the learning ability of the LS-SVM. The experimental tests were implemented in a real ship to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis approach. The diagnosis results have shown that distinguished fault features have been extracted and the fault identification accuracy is acceptable. In addition, the classification rate of the proposed method is superior to the traditional SVM based method.

J	Wang, GF; Feng, XL; Liu, C				Wang, Guofeng; Feng, Xiaoliang; Liu, Chang			Bearing fault classification based on conditional random field	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Fault classification; conditional random field; rolling element bearing; hidden Markov model	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; MODELS	Condition monitoring of rolling element bearing is paramount for predicting the lifetime and performing effective maintenance of the mechanical equipment. To overcome the drawbacks of the hidden Markov model (HMM) and improve the diagnosis accuracy, conditional random field (CRF) model based classifier is proposed. In this model, the feature vectors sequences and the fault categories are linked by an undirected graphical model in which their relationship is represented by a global conditional probability distribution. In comparison with the HMM, the main advantage of the CRF model is that it can depict the temporal dynamic information between the observation sequences and state sequences without assuming the independence of the input feature vectors. Therefore, the interrelationship between the adjacent observation vectors can also be depicted and integrated into the model, which makes the classifier more robust and accurate than the HMM. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, four kinds of bearing vibration signals which correspond to normal, inner race pit, outer race pit and roller pit respectively are collected from the test rig. And the CRF and HMM models are built respectively to perform fault classification by taking the sub band energy features of wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) as the observation sequences. Moreover, K-fold cross validation method is adopted to improve the evaluation accuracy of the classifier. The analysis and comparison under different fold times show that the accuracy rate of classification using the CRF model is higher than the HMM. This method brings some new lights on the accurate classification of the bearing faults.

J	Du, WL; Li, AS; Ye, PF; Liu, CL				Du, Wenliao; Li, Ansheng; Ye, Pengfei; Liu, Chengliang			Fault diagnosis of plunger pump in truck crane based on relevance vector machine with particle swarm optimization algorithm	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Plunger pump; truck crane; fault diagnosis; particle swarm optimization; relevance vector machines	VIBRATION SIGNAL; FUZZY-LOGIC; CLASSIFICATION	Promptly and accurately dealing with the equipment breakdown is very important in terms of enhancing reliability and decreasing downtime. A novel fault diagnosis method PSO-RVM based on relevance vector machines (RVM) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for plunger pump in truck crane is proposed. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to determine the kernel width parameter of the kernel function in RVM, and the five two-class RVMs with binary tree architecture are trained to recognize the condition of mechanism. The proposed method is employed in the diagnosis of plunger pump in truck crane. The six states, including normal state, bearing inner race fault, bearing roller fault, plunger wear fault, thrust plate wear fault, and swash plate wear fault, are used to test the classification performance of the proposed PSO-RVM model, which compared with the classical models, such as back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ant colony optimization artificial neural network (ANT-ANN), RVM, and support vector machines with particle swarm optimization (PSO-SVM), respectively. The experimental results show that the PSO-RVM is superior to the first three classical models, and has a comparative performance to the PSO-SVM, the corresponding diagnostic accuracy achieving as high as 99.17% and 99.58%, respectively. But the number of relevance vectors is far fewer than that of support vectors, and the former is about 1/12-1/3 of the latter, which indicates that the proposed PSO-RVM model is more suitable for applications that require low complexity and real-time monitoring.

According to the characteristics of vibration signal for the valve mechanism, fault diagnosis has been proposed for abnormal valve clearance based on artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). Two kinds of intelligent technology have been compared in fault identification by changing the number of training samples. The diagnosis has indicated that at small number of training samples SVM has high generalization ability, and at large number of training samples, ANN has exact recognition when it comes to diagnosing valve train.

This holds for rotating machines. The vibration signals of them are periodic or contain periodic parts, which can be used for fault diagnosis for the rotating machines. The periodic time series of the superposition of two oscillations were investigated by the multifractal theory in this study. The wavelet transform modulus maxima method was used for the singularity spectrum computations. From the results, we can find that when the amplitude, frequency or the phase difference changed, the width and the peak position of the singularity spectrum changed significantly. Therefore, a new measure - the width and the peak position of the singularity spectrum can be used for the periodic signals.

The faults of belt conveyors can directly influence the daily production. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method combining wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for monitoring belt conveyors with the focus on the detection of idler faults. Since the number of the idlers could be large, one acceleration sensor is applied to gather the vibration signals of several idlers in order to reduce the number of sensors. The vibration signals are decomposed with WPD, and the energy of each frequency band is extracted as the feature. Then, the features are employed to train an SVM to realize the detection of idler faults. The proposed fault diagnosis method is firstly tested on a testbed, and then an online monitoring and fault diagnosis system is designed for belt conveyors. An experiment is also carried out on a belt conveyor in service, and it is verified that the proposed system can locate the position of the faulty idlers with a limited number of sensors, which is important for operating belt conveyors in practices.

J	Shahriar, MR; Ahsan, T; Chong, U				Shahriar, Md Rifat; Ahsan, Tanveer; Chong, UiPil			Fault diagnosis of induction motors utilizing local binary pattern-based texture analysis	EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Induction motors; Local binary pattern; Texture analysis; Background noise; Support vector machine	VIBRATION SIGNALS; CLASSIFICATION; NOISE	Fault diagnosis of induction motors in the practical industrial fields is always a challenging task due to the difficulty that lies in exact identification of fault signatures at various motor operating conditions in the presence of background noise produced by other mechanical subsystems. Several signal processing approaches have been adopted so far to mitigate the effect of this background noise in the acquired sensor signal so that fault-related features can be extracted effectively. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes a new approach for fault diagnosis of induction motors utilizing two-dimensional texture analysis based on local binary patterns (LBPs). Firstly, time domain vibration signals acquired from the operating motor are converted into two-dimensional gray-scale images. Then, discriminating texture features are extracted from these images employing LBP operator. These local feature descriptors are later utilized by multi-class support vector machine to identify faults of induction motors. The efficient texture analysis capability as well as the gray-scale invariance property of the LBP operators enables the proposed system to achieve impressive diagnostic performance even in the presence of high background noise. Comparative analysis reveals that LBP8,1 is the most suitable texture analysis operator for the proposed system due to its perfect classification performance along with the lowest degree of computational complexity.

S	Kulesza, Z		Gosiewski, Z; Kulesza, Z		Kulesza, Zbigniew			An Induced Shaft Deflection for Rotating Shaft Crack Detection	MECHATRONIC SYSTEMS AND MATERIALS V	Solid State Phenomena		English	Article; Book Chapter						rotordynamics; health monitoring; cracked rotor; fault detection; finite element method		Over the years various techniques have been developed to extract information on the dynamic state of the rotating machinery. This paper introduces a new method based on the phase data of the shaft rotation angle. Usually the phase data is omitted and only the frequency components of the vibration spectrum are taken into consideration. However, the transverse shaft crack has a specific angular location about the shaft axis. Therefore, it is supposed that by measuring the vibration response of the rotor deflected by an additional constant force applied perpendicularly to the shaft axis at different angular locations, different vibration signatures can be obtained. Such signatures can then be used to detect the crack. The method utilizes also the coupling phenomenon between the lateral/torsional vibrations of the cracked rotor, since the shaft is additionally excited by an external harmonic torque. The computer simulation study is based on the uncracked and cracked rotor models obtained by using the finite element (FE) approach. The results of the numerical analysis demonstrate the potential of the suggested method for the effective shaft crack detection.

However, the traditional analytic way cannot finish the accurate and complete calculation and analysis. So it is very necessary to make FEM dynamics research on base of machine tool. This paper employs FEM modal analysis to research the free vibration of base which is undamped And then we can get the nature frequencies of the base's first six modal, there are 407.79 Hz, 430.47 Hz, 501.23 Hz, 623.63 Hz, 626.51 Hz and 661.19 Hz, respectively. In addition, the first six modal shapes are also obtained. The forth frequency and the fifth frequency are much closed, so they can be considered the multiple roots for the vibration equation. The research results can provide theoretical basis for fault diagnosis, safety operation and vibration control, and the important parameters are useful for structural improvement and optimization design of the NC machine tool.

In order to improve the diagnosis accuracy of wireless sensor, a novel fault diagnosis for wireless sensor technology by twin support vector machine (TSVM) is proposed in the paper. Twin SVM is a binary classifier that performs classification by using two nonparallel hyperplanes instead of the single hyperplane used in the classical SVM. However, the parameter setting in the TSVM training procedure significantly influences the classification accuracy. Thus, this study introduces PSO as an optimization technique to simultaneously optimize the TSVM training parameter. The experimental results indicate that the diagnosis results for wireless sensor of twin support vector machine are better than those of SVM, ANN.

At the same time, the theoretical model was simulated and the experiment was finished in the vibrating sieve. The experiment results are consistent with the theoretical analysis results. The results show that there is the obvious difference from the fault characteristic spectrum of the rolling bearing multi-point pitting corrosion for the vibrating machine and the rotating machinery. There is an obvious amplitude modulation phenomenon for the outer ring pitting corrosion fault of the vibrating machine rolling bearing, but there is not the amplitude modulation phenomenon for the outer ring pitting corrosion fault of the ideal rotating machinery rolling bearing. There is a slight amplitude modulation phenomenon for the inner ring pitting corrosion fault of the vibrating machine rolling bearing and but there is the obvious amplitude modulation phenomenon for the inner ring pitting corrosion fault of the ideal rotating machinery rolling bearing.

J	Xu, Y; Li, ZH; Lai, XD				Xu, Yong; Li, Zhaohui; Lai, Xide			Dynamic model for hydro-turbine generator units based on a database method for guide bearings	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Rotor dynamics; hydro-turbine generator units; radial vibration; modeling; simulation	LATERAL VIBRATION; COEFFICIENTS	A suitable dynamic model of rotor system is of great significance not only for supplying knowledge of the fault mechanism, but also for assisting in machine health monitoring research. Many techniques have been developed for properly modeling the radial vibration of large hydro-turbine generator units. However, an applicable dynamic model has not yet been reported in literature due to the complexity of the boundary conditions and exciting forces. In this paper, a finite element (FE) rotor dynamic model of radial vibration taking account of operating conditions is proposed. A brief and practical database method is employed to model the guide bearing. Taking advantage of the method, rotating speed and bearing clearance can be considered in the model. A novel algorithm, which can take account of both transient and steady-state analysis, is proposed to solve the model. Dynamic response for rotor model of 125 MW hydro-turbine generator units in Gezhouba Power Station is simulated. Field data from Optimal Maintenance Information System for Hydro power plants (HOMIS) are analyzed compared with the simulation. Results illustrate the application value of the model in providing knowledge of the fault mechanism and in failure diagnosis.

Due to the strong non-linear, complex and non-stationary characteristics of vibration signals from working bearings, an accurate and reliable health assessment method for bearing is necessary. This paper proposes to utilize the selected chaotic characteristics of vibration signal for health assessment of a bearing by using self-organizing map (SOM). Both Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm and Takens' theory are employed to calculate the characteristic vector which includes three chaotic characteristics, such as correlation dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov entropy. After that, SOM is used to map the three corresponding characteristics into a confidence value (CV) which represents the health state of the bearing. Finally, a case study based on vibration datasets of a group of testing bearings was conducted to demonstrate that the proposed method can reliably assess the health state of bearing.

A fast and adaptive varying-scale morphological analysis method for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Signal processing; bearing fault diagnosis; morphology; varying-scale feature extractor; vibration analysis	WAVELET DECOMPOSITION; SIGNALS; FILTER; GEAR	The research in fault diagnosis for rolling element bearings has been attracting great interest in recent years. This is because bearings are frequently failed and the consequence could cause unexpected breakdown of machines. When a fault is occurring in a bearing, periodic impulses can be revealed in its generated vibration frequency spectrum. Different types of bearing faults will lead to impulses appearing at different periodic intervals. In order to extract the periodic impulses effectively, numerous techniques have been developed to reveal bearing fault characteristic frequencies. In this study, an adaptive varying-scale morphological analysis in time domain is proposed. This analysis can be applied to one-dimensional signal by defining different lengths of the structure elements based on the local peaks of the impulses. The analysis has been first validated by simulated impulses, and then by real bearing vibration signals embedded with faulty impulses caused by an inner race defect and an outer race defect. The results indicate that by using the proposed adaptive varying-scale morphological analysis, the cause of bearing defect could be accurately identified even the faulty impulses were partially covered by noise. Moreover, compared to other existing methods, the analysis can be functioned as an efficient faulty features extractor and performed in a very fast manner.

Combining hard and soft system thinking: the development of a value improvement model for a complex linear friction welding repetitive process (lfw-VIM)	2013 CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS ENGINEERING RESEARCH	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference on Systems Engineering Research (CSER)	MAR 19-22, 2013	Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA	Georgia Res Tech Inst, Intercax, IBM Res	Georgia Inst Technol	Lean Thinking; PDCA; DMAIC; Systems Thinking; Soft Systems; Hard Systems; Process Improvement; Manufacturing Engineering; Action Research; Fault Detection; Modelling		Linear Friction Welding (LFW) is a relatively new process adopted by aircraft engine manufacturers operationalizing new technologies to produce better value components. With increasing fuel prices and economical drives to reduce CO2 emissions, LFW has been a key technology in recent years for aircraft engine manufacture in both commercial and military market sectors. For joining Blades to Discus ('Blisks'), LFW is the ideal process as it is a solid state process which gives reproducibility and high quality bonds therefore improving performance. A fault detection and isolation (FDI) model of the LFW machine has been developed in [ 1] in order to detect and predict common machine faults. The purpose of this research investigation is to develop a bespoke value improvement model (VIM) for the LFW repetitive process identifying the critical influencing factors - whether human, machine system or both-to achieving the customer requirements, successful FDI model implementation and user uptake. Action research and case study intervention will be implemented at the Rolls-Royce site enabling the combination of hard systems (the FDI model) and soft systems (VIM model) to be effectively utilized to develop a holistic model (lfw-VIM). Outcomes of the research show the VIM approach can be used to aid successful change management and the implementation of a complex system. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Detection of Early Faults in Rotating Machinery Based on Wavelet Analysis	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CRACK DETECTION; ROTOR SYSTEM; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS	This paper explores the application of wavelet analysis for the detection of early changes in rotor dynamics caused by common machinery faults, namely, rotor unbalance and minor blade rubbing conditions. In this paper, the time synchronised wavelet analysis method was formulated and its effectiveness to detect machinery faults at the early stage was evaluated based on signal simulation and experimental study. The proposed method provides a more standardised approach to visualise the current state of rotor dynamics of a rotating machinery by taking into account the effects of time shift, wavelet edge distortion, and system noise suppression. The experimental results showed that this method is able to reveal subtle changes of the vibration signal characteristics in both the frequency content distribution and the amplitude distortion caused by minor rotor unbalance and blade rubbing conditions. Besides, this method also appeared to be an effective tool to diagnose and to discriminate the different types of machinery faults based on the unique pattern of the wavelet contours. This study shows that the proposed wavelet analysis method is promising to reveal machinery faults at early stage as compared to vibration spectrum analysis.

J	Xu, J; Zhao, J; Ma, BP; Hu, SS				Xu, Jie; Zhao, Jin; Ma, Baoping; Hu, Shousong			Fault Diagnosis of Complex Industrial Process Using KICA and Sparse SVM	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								New approaches are proposed for complex industrial process monitoring and fault diagnosis based on kernel independent component analysis (KICA) and sparse support vector machine (SVM). The KICA method is a two-phase algorithm: whitened kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The data are firstly mapped into high-dimensional feature subspace. Then, the ICA algorithm seeks the projection directions in the KPCA whitened space. Performance monitoring is implemented through constructing the statistical index and control limit in the feature space. If the statistical indexes exceed the predefined control limit, a fault may have occurred. Then, the nonlinear score vectors are calculated and fed into the sparse SVM to identify the faults. The proposed method is applied to the simulation of Tennessee Eastman (TE) chemical process. The simulation results show that the proposed method can identify various types of faults accurately and rapidly.

Accordingly, efficient maintenance strategies for port equipment have to be established. The change to condition-based maintenance strategies promises to save resources while enhancing availability and reliability. This paper introduces a framework of methods and tools that enable the systematic design of condition-based maintenance systems on the one hand and offers integrated support for operating such systems on the other hand. The findings are evaluated based on a case-study of a German seaport and illustrate the usage of the system based on managing the equipping process of machines with sensors for condition monitoring as well as bringing the system into the operation phase.

J	Mendes, RU; Cavalca, KL; Ferreira, LOS				Mendes, Ricardo Ugliara; Cavalca, Katia Lucchesi; Saraiva Ferreira, Luiz Otavio			Analysis of a complete model of rotating machinery excited by magnetic actuator system	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Directional frequency response function; forward whirl; backward whirl; magnetic actuator; lubricated bearings		Rotating machines have a wide range of application involving shafts rotating at high speeds that must have high confidence levels of operation. Therefore, the dynamic behavior analysis of such rotating systems is required to establish operational patterns of the equipment, providing the basis for controller development in order to reduce vibrations or even to control oil instabilities in lubricated bearings. A classical technique applied in parameter identification of machines and structures is the modal analysis, which consists of applying a perturbation force into the system and then to measure its response. However, there are mainly two problems in modal analysis concerning the excitation of rotating systems. First, there are limitations to the excitation of systems with rotating shafts when using impact hammers or shakers, due to friction, undesired tangential forces, and noise that can be introduced in the system response. The second problem relies in the difficulty of exciting backward whirl modes, an inherent characteristic from these systems. Therefore, the study of a non-contact technique of external excitation, also capable of exciting backward whirl modes, becomes of high interest. In this sense, this article deals with the study and modeling of a magnetic actuator, used as an external excitation source for a rotating machine, mainly in backward whirl mode. Special attention is given to the actuator model and its interaction with the rotor system. Differently from previous works with similar proposal, which uses current and air gap measurements, here the external excitation force control is based on the magnetic field directly measured by hall sensor positioned in the pole center of the magnetic actuator core. The magnetic actuator design was completely developed for this purpose, opening different paths to experimental application of this device, for example, fault detection analysis based on directional modes. It is also presented a comparison between the numerical simulations and practical tests obtained from a rotor test rig and an experimental evidence of the backward whirl was accomplished based on the numerical simulation results.

One of the challenges in ignition system diagnosis is that more than one fault may appear at a time. This kind of problem refers to simultaneous-fault diagnosis. Another challenge is the acquisition of a large amount of costly simultaneous-fault ignition patterns for constructing the diagnostic system because the number of the training patterns depends on the combination of different single faults. The above problems could be resolved by the proposed framework combining feature extraction, probabilistic classification, and decision threshold optimization. With the proposed framework, the features of the single faults in a simultaneous-fault pattern are extracted and then detected using a new probabilistic classifier, namely, pairwise coupling relevance vector machine, which is trained with single-fault patterns only. Therefore, the training dataset of simultaneous-fault patterns is not necessary. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well for both single-fault and simultaneous-fault diagnoses and is superior to the existing approach.

J	Liu, WY; Han, JG				Liu, W. Y.; Han, J. G.			Rolling element bearing fault recognition approach based on fuzzy clustering bispectrum estimation	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Fault recognition; fuzzy clustering; bispectrum estimation; bearing fault	ORDER STATISTICS; DECISION TREE; C-MEANS; DIAGNOSIS	A rolling element bearing fault recognition approach is proposed in this paper. This method combines the basic Higher-order spectrum (HOS) theory and fuzzy clustering method in data mining area. In the first step, all the bispectrum estimation results of the training samples and test samples are turned into binary feature images. Secondly, the binary feature images of the training samples are used to construct object templates including kernel images and domain images. Every fault category has one object templates. At last, by calculating the distances between test samples' binary feature images and the different object templates, the object classification and pattern recognition can be effectively accomplished. Bearing is the most important and much easier to be damaged component in rotating machinery. Furthermore, there exist large amounts of noise jamming and nonlinear coupling components in bearing vibration signals. The Higher Order Cumulants (HOC), which can quantitatively describe the nonlinear characteristic signals with close relationship between the mechanical faults, is introduced in this paper to de-noise the raw bearing vibration signals and obtain the bispectrum estimation pictures.

Comparison of two classifiers; K-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network, for fault diagnosis on a main engine journal-bearing	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; main journal-bearing of IC engine; power spectral density; K-nearest neighbor; artificial neural network	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FUZZY-LOGIC; VIBRATION; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; SYSTEM	Vibration analysis is an accepted method in condition monitoring of machines, since it can provide useful and reliable information about machine working condition. This paper surveys a new scheme for fault diagnosis of main journal-bearings of internal combustion (IC) engine based on power spectral density (PSD) technique and two classifiers, namely, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN). Vibration signals for three different conditions of journal-bearing; normal, with oil starvation condition and extreme wear fault were acquired from an IC engine. PSD was applied to process the vibration signals. Thirty features were extracted from the PSD values of signals as a feature source for fault diagnosis. KNN and ANN were trained by training data set and then used as diagnostic classifiers. Variable K value and hidden neuron count (N) were used in the range of 1 to 20, with a step size of 1 for KNN and ANN to gain the best classification results. The roles of PSD, KNN and ANN techniques were studied. From the results, it is shown that the performance of ANN is better than KNN. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed diagnostic method can reliably separate different fault conditions in main journal-bearings of IC engine.

J	Fei, CW; Bai, GC				Fei, Cheng-Wei; Bai, Guang-Chen			Wavelet correlation feature scale entropy and fuzzy support vector machine approach for aeroengine whole-body vibration fault diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						Wavelet Correlation Feature Scale Entropy (WCFSE); Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM); aeroengine whole-body vibration; fault diagnosis; WCFSE-FSVM method	TRANSFORM	In order to correctly analyze aeroengine whole-body vibration signals, Wavelet Correlation Feature Scale Entropy (WCFSE) and Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) (WCFSE-FSVM) method was proposed by fusing the advantages of the WCFSE method and the FSVM method. The wavelet coefficients were known to be located in high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (S/N or SNR) scales and were obtained by the Wavelet Transform Correlation Filter Method (WTCFM). This method was applied to address the whole-body vibration signals. The WCFSE method was derived from the integration of the information entropy theory and WTCFM, and was applied to extract the WCFSE values of the vibration signals. Among the WCFSE values, the W-CFSE1 and W-CFSE2 values on the scale 1 and 2 from the high band of vibration signal were believed to acceptably reflect the vibration feature and were selected to construct the eigenvectors of vibration signals as fault samples to establish the WCFSE-FSVM model. This model was applied to aeroengine whole-body vibration fault diagnosis. Through the diagnoses of four vibration fault modes and the comparison of the analysis results by four methods (SVM, FSVM, WESE-SVM, WCFSE-FSVM), it is shown that the WCFSE-FSVM method is characterized by higher learning ability, higher generalization ability and higher anti-noise ability than other methods in aeroengine whole-vibration fault analysis. Meanwhile, this present study provides a useful insight for the vibration fault diagnosis of complex machinery besides an aeroengine.

J	Yao, B; Lu, YD; Wan, M				Yao Bin; Lu Yudong; Wan Ming			Solder joint degradation and detection using RF impedance analysis	SOLDERING & SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Solder; Fatigue; Mechanical properties of materials; Solder joint; Degradation; DC resistance; RE impedance; Time domain; High frequency structure simulator		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to clarify the method of using RF impedance changes as an early indicator of degradation of solder joint. It proposes the mode of crack propagation in solder joint and outlines why RF impedance analysis can be capable of detecting small cracks. The study aims to show the potential of RF impedance analysis as a prognostic tool that can provide advanced warning of impending failures of solder joint. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, the mode of crack propagation in solder joint was studied to show why RF impedance analysis could be capable of detecting small cracks. A real simple impedance-controlled test vehicle was developed to allow RF impedance and DC resistance measurements to monitor solder joint degradation. The influence of crack length on RF impedance was evaluated by high frequency structure simulator (HFSS) simulation for the first time. Findings - The paper demonstrates that RF resistance can respond to an open state of a solder joint as well as DC resistance. Furthermore, RF impedance can monitor partial degradation of solder joints, while the DC resistance cannot do it. In addition, time-domain reflection coefficient is found to be more useful than RE impedance in detecting solder joint degradation. The HFSS simulation results show that even very slight physical degradation of solder joints can be detected using RF impedance analysis. Originality/value - In this paper, HFSS simulation is used for the first time to evaluate the influence of crack length on RF impedance.

Model Based Fault Identification of Unbalance and Misalignment Simultaneously Present in a Rotor System	ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Condition monitoring; Finite element method; Residual generation	COUPLING MISALIGNMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Vibration in rotating machinery is mostly caused by unbalance, misalignment, mechanical looseness, shaft crack, and other malfunctions. The diagnostics of rotor faults have been gaining importance in recent times. Many researchers have dealt with single fault identification at any given instance, but normally more than one fault can occur in a rotor system, simultaneously. In the present study a model based technique is described for the on-line identification of rotor having more than one fault. The rotor has been modeled using finite element method with unbalance and misalignment together as the considered faults. Using the residual generation technique, residual vibrations are generated from experimental results for unbalance and misalignment present simultaneously in a rotor system, and then the residual forces due to presence of these faults are calculated.

Gear Fault Assessment Based on Continuous Wavelet Transforms	ADVANCES IN VIBRATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS	A gear system transmits power by means of meshing gear teeth and is conceptually simple and effective in power transmission; thus typical applications include electric utilities, ships, helicopters and many other industrial applications. Monitoring the condition of large gearboxes in industries has attracted increasing interest in recent years owing to the need for decreasing the downtime on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures. Currently there are three different approaches to the detection of faults in geared systems: vibration analysis, oil/wear particle analysis and acoustic signal analysis. The use of vibration and acoustic signals is quite common in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machinery. This paper focuses on the application of wavelet transforms for detection of the local faults of the gear teeth of the helical gear transmission system. Seven conditions of the gear were investigated: healthy gear and gear with six stages of depth wise wear induced on the gear tooth by grinding operation. The experiments were conducted on a gear box with good gear and gears with various stages of gradual depth wise removal of tooth surface and the signals have been processed using wavelet transforms. Diagnostics has been done using wavelet transform of not only the vibration signals, but also wavelet transform of acoustic signal and wavelet transform of the cross correlation between the vibration and acoustic signals. The latter has not been reported earlier in literature and gives conclusive diagnostic information.

J	Jovic, F; Jovic, A; Krmpotic, D				Jovic, Franjo; Jovic, Alan; Krmpotic, Darko			Quality control engineering in automated ceramic tile production using a signal information content approach	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Quality control; Automated batch production; Information measure; Qualitative coding; Monitoring signals; Crew monitoring	PERFORMANCE; ENTROPY; SPACE	The pressing process in the automated production of ceramic tiles is a complicated process that involves fully functional machinery and efficient coordination of the working crew. Quality control (QC) of the process relies on reasoning and acting on information coming from measured signals on the automated machinery. For QC, it is necessary to establish that these measurements are correct for the purpose of final product quality. In the process, tile batches are produced within a tolerable range of tile rejection. However, if the percentage of rejects rises above a certain threshold, e.g. 6%, the QC staff are responsible for finding the cause of the defect. The aim of this work is the investigation of a short-term information measure, expanded tessellation entropy, which can aid the QC staff in discovering the causes of deviations in the quality of batch production of ceramic tiles. This unique signal measure is calculable from as few as four consecutive machinery signal measurements, it is sensitive to small changes in the signal, and its computation is fast. Its noise sensitivity is tested for a set of four standard analytical process signals, with the addition of 1% random noise, and is shown to be robust with appropriate setting. The information measure is applied to measured process-machinery signals, and the results are compared with the QC signal that measures the tile rejection rate. An interpretation procedure is proposed and applied that reveals which signals are significant for increased tile rejection. The procedure is based on comparing signals and QC sequences with similar information code patterns. The results show that the defects are mainly due to human error, and that they usually start with improper furnace handling or uncompensated tile humidity. The method is compared to Shannon entropy, approximate entropy, Pearson correlation, and control charts, and it is shown to be superior for detection of faults in a setting where there is not much historical data available for statistical analysis, and where the quality of the process (percentage of rejects) is continuously measured as a target signal. In employing the proposed procedure, all of the QC defects were explained. The interpretation procedure is not fully automated at this moment. However, it is shown to be applicable to monitoring automated press machines in a ceramic tile plant, and thus preventing future defects. It can be applied to other similar automated industrial processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Different gear backlashes and mesh damped and transmission errors are considered in the NLTV dynamic model. The corresponding multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) state space models are also presented. Through analyzing the linear dynamic model, the optimal reducer ratio (ORR) and optimal transmission ratio (OTR) are obtained for the shield TBM cutterhead driving system, respectively. The NLTV and LTV dynamic models are numerically simulated, and the effects of physical parameters under various conditions of NLTV dynamic model are analyzed. Physical parameters such as the load torque, gear backlash and transmission error, gear mesh stiffness and damped, pinions inertia and damped, large gear inertia and damped, and motor rotor inertia and damped are investigated in detail to analyze their effects on dynamic response and performances of the shield TBM cutterhead driving system. Some preliminary approaches are proposed to improve dynamic performances of the cutterhead driving system, and dynamic models will provide a foundation for shield TBM cutterhead driving system's cutterhead fault diagnosis, motion control, and torque synchronous control.

For the same vector control system induction motor drive analysis concerning operation with the asymmetric motor, broken rotor fault handling and operation were investigated. Reliability, range of stable operation, fault symptoms and application of diagnosis methods based on control system variables utilization was analyzed. Design/methodology/approach - Induction motor drive vector control system synthesis was applied using the multiscalar variables of the machine model with nonlinear feedback linearization applied to use classical cascaded PI controllers for the speed-torque and flux decoupled control. Speed observer was applied for the rotor flux and rotor speed estimation for the sensorless control system synthesis. Findings - Relative sensitivity of the state and control system variables to broken rotor fault based on experimental results for the closed-loop and sensorless control systems is presented and compared. Drawbacks of using the MCSA analysis for the rotor fault diagnosis in the closed-loop and sensorless control systems are pointed. Advantages and drawbacks of the state space estimators filtering characteristics in the sensorless control system are described. Practical implications - Asymmetric IM motor drive handling and diagnosis. Broken rotor range diagnosis inconsistency using the popular MCSA method should be considered in the closed-loop and sensorless control system of the induction motor drive. Depending on the IM motor drive application and the operation requirements the results can be used for asymmetric machine proper handling, choosing proper control system structure and control system variables for rotor fault early diagnosis. Originality/value - Sensitivity of the state and control system variables to broken rotor fault based on experimental results for the closed-loop and sensorless control systems is presented, which implies motor handling procedures and fault diagnosis.

This study deals with the detection of such faults when the machine operates under varying speed conditions. The performance of two methods is analyzed and compared, i.e., the analysis of the third harmonic of the stator currents and the first one of the zero-sequence voltage components. The Vold-Kalman filtering order tracking algorithm is introduced and applied to track the harmonics of interest when the machine operates under a wide speed range and different load levels. This study also presents two reliable fault indicators especially focused to detect stator winding interturn faults under nonstationary speed conditions. Experimental results endorse the methodology proposed, showing its potential to carry out a reliable fault diagnosis scheme.

J	Huang, CY				Huang, Chien-Yi			Reliability assessment of RFID reader through prognostics and health management	MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY			English	Article								Obtaining real-time information during the shipping process is important in enhancing turnover effectiveness. An RFID system is an emerging product that provides a solution and requires long term operation. This is a concern since a failure may cause losses such as line stoppages or delays in stocking and shipping. This study investigates the reliability of the RFID reader through prognostics and health management. An accelerated life test is conducted to reduce the time and cost required for the experiment. The correlation of the output power and the product performance (read rate) is verified, so the output power can be used as the performance index to judge the health of the product at any given moment. This research employs a threefold cross-validation for the output power discrepancy to determine the optimal warning parameters. Desired null/alternative hypothesis tests are established for subsequent SPRT testing to verify the degradation of the mean of the power discrepancy for the unhealthy data. An alarm is then sent to warn the user that the RFID product will soon fail to meet the requirement of the 100% read rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Promising Noninvasive Cellular Phenotype in Prostate Cancer Cells Knockdown of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							CD44 VARIANT ISOFORMS; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX DEGRADATION; COLORECTAL-CANCER; CYTOSKELETON FUNCTION; METASTATIC PROSTATE; SURFACE EXPRESSION; BREAST-CANCER; STANDARD CD44; INVADOPODIA; CORTACTIN	Cell surface interaction of CD44 and MMP9 increases migration and invasion of PC3 cells. We show here that stable knockdown of MMP9 in PC3 cells switches CD44 isoform expression from CD44s to CD44v6 which is more glycosylated. These cells showed highly adhesive morphology with extensive cell spreading which is due to the formation of focal adhesions and well organized actin-stress fibers. MMP9 knockdown blocks invadopodia formation and matrix degradation activity as well. However, CD44 knockdown PC3 cells failed to develop focal adhesions and stress fibers; hence these cells make unstable adhesions. A part of the reason for these changes could be caused by silencing of CD44v6 as well. Immunostaining of prostate tissue microarray sections illustrated significantly lower levels of CD44v6 in adenocarcinoma than normal tissue. Our results suggest that interaction between CD44 and MMP9 is a potential mechanism of invadopodia formation. CD44v6 expression may be essential for the protection of non-invasive cellular phenotype. CD44v6 decrease may be a potential marker for prognosis and therapeutics.

J	Cao, JF; Chen, L; Zhang, JL; Cao, W				Cao, Jianfu; Chen, Ling; Zhang, Jialiang; Cao, Wen			Fault diagnosis of complex system based on nonlinear frequency spectrum fusion	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Nonlinear output frequency response function; Nonlinear system; Evidence theory; Fault diagnosis	S EVIDENCE THEORY; RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; VOLTERRA SYSTEMS	A novel fault detection and diagnosis approach is proposed for nonlinear complex systems by combining nonlinear frequency spectrum characteristics and evidence theory. In order to overcome the problem of calculated amount expansion of generalized frequency response functions, single-dimensional nonlinear output frequency response functions are used to obtain nonlinear frequency spectrum, from which, features of nonlinear frequency spectrum are extracted. The fault diagnosis model of multiple faults is given based on evidence theory. The mass functions of evidences are obtained according to the similarity among different modes. In order to solve the problem of evidence fusion in the situation of evidence confliction, a dynamic parameter conflicting evidence combination method is proposed based on the average credibility.

Diagnosis of artificially created surface damage levels of planet gear teeth using ordinal ranking	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Ordinal ranking; Damage level; Planetary gearbox; Correlation coefficient	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; CRACK	Effective diagnosis of damage levels is important for condition based preventive maintenance of gearboxes. One special characteristic of damage levels is the inherent ordinal information among different levels. Retaining the ordinal information is therefore important for diagnosing damage levels. Classification, a machine learning technique, has been widely adopted for automated diagnosis of gear faults. However, classification cannot keep the ordinal information because the damage levels are treated as nominal variables. This paper employs ordinal ranking, another machine learning technique, to preserve the ordinal information in automated diagnosis of damage levels. As to ordinal ranking, feature selection is important. However, most existing feature selection methods are for classification, which are not suitable for ordinal ranking. This paper designs a feature selection method for ordinal ranking based on correlation coefficients. A diagnosis approach based on ordinal ranking and the proposed feature selection method is then introduced. This method is tested on diagnosis of artificially created surface damage levels of planet gear teeth in a planetary gearbox. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis approach. The advantages of using ordinal ranking for diagnosing gear damage levels are also demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Wavelet support vector machine is a powerful novel tool for solving the diagnosis problem with small sampling, nonlinearity and high dimension. Immune genetic algorithm is developed in this study to determine the optimal parameters for WSVM with the highest accuracy and generalization ability. Moreover, the feature vectors for fault diagnosis are obtained from vibration signal that preprocessed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The experimental results indicate that this proposed approach is an effective method for gearbox fault diagnosis, which has more strong generalization ability and can achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than that of the artificial neural network and the SVM which has randomly extracted parameters.

It is required them to run for longer periods of time. All of these factors mean that the detection, location and analysis of faults play a vital role in highly reliable operations. Using vibration analysis, the condition of a machine can be periodically monitored. In this study, dynamic behavior of a direct coupled rotor-bearing system is investigated. Experimental vibration analyses in the vertical direction of the system are implemented. Vibration monitoring with trend analysis and spectrum graphs are employed to diagnose the excessive vibration source(s). It is seen that the rotating machineries can have one or more vibration sources. The vibration values obtained from each bearing show that the main excessive vibration sources in the system stem from mechanical looseness and misalignment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Feature extraction using wavelets and classification through decision tree algorithm for fault diagnosis of mono-block centrifugal pump	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Mono-block centrifugal pump; J48 algorithm; Fault diagnosis; Continuous wavelet transform (CWT)	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; TRANSIENT CURRENT SIGNAL; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; TRANSFORM; BEARING; SYSTEM; MOTOR	Monoblock centrifugal pumps are employed in variety of critical engineering applications. Continuous monitoring of such machines becomes essential in order to reduce the unnecessary break downs. Vibration based approaches are widely used to carry out the condition monitoring tasks. Decision tree, fuzzy logic, support vector machine and artificial neural networks are some of the classification algorithms employed for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. In the present study, fault discriminating capability of wavelets in its continuous form with the application of J48 algorithm is analyzed. Vibration signals are extracted from the experimental setup. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is calculated for different families and at different levels which form the feature set. The features are then fed as an input to the classifier (J48 algorithm, a WEKA implementation) and the classification accuracies are calculated.

J	Eristi, H				Eristi, Huseyin			Fault diagnosis system for series compensated transmission line based on wavelet transform and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Series compensated transmission line; Fault diagnosis; Wavelet transform; Norm entropy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system	PROTECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; MACHINE; SCHEME	This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis approach based on combined wavelet transform and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for fault section identification, classification and location in a series compensated transmission line. It performs an effective feature extraction approach based on norm entropy in order to obtain the features represented main frequency, harmonic and transient characteristics of the fault signals. The proposed method uses the samples of fault voltages and currents for one cycle duration from the inception of fault. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 400 kV, 300 km series compensated transmission line for all the ten types of faults using MATLAB/Simulink for a large data set of 23,436 fault cases comprising of all the 10 types of faults. Fault signals varying with fault resistance, fault inception angle, fault distance, load angle, percentage compensation level and source impedance are applied to the proposed algorithm. The results also indicate that the proposed method is robust to wide variation in system conditions and has higher fault diagnosis accuracy with regard to the other approaches in the literature for this problem.

J	Li, P; Kong, FR; He, QB; Liu, YB				Li, Peng; Kong, Fanrang; He, Qingbo; Liu, Yongbin			Multiscale slope feature extraction for rotating machinery fault diagnosis using wavelet analysis	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Discrete wavelet transform; Rotating machinery; Multiscale slope feature; Fault diagnosis	TRANSFORM; VARIANCE; SPECTRUM	This paper proposes a multiscale slope feature extraction method using wavelet-based multiresolution analysis for rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The new method mainly includes three following steps: the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is first performed on vibration signals gathered by accelerometer from rotating machinery to achieve a series of detailed signals at different scales; the variances of multiscale detailed signals are then calculated; finally, the wavelet-based multiscale slope features are estimated from the slope of logarithmic variances. The presented features reveal an inherent structure within the power spectra of vibration signals. The effectiveness of the proposed feature was verified by two experiments on bearing defect identification and gear wear diagnosis. Experimental results show that the wavelet-based multiscale slope features have the merits of high accuracy and stability in classifying different conditions of both bearings and gearbox, and thus are valuable for machinery fault diagnosis.

J	Lu, F; Huang, JQ; Lv, YQ				Lu, Feng; Huang, Jinquan; Lv, Yiqiu			Gas Path Health Monitoring for a Turbofan Engine Based on a Nonlinear Filtering Approach	ENERGIES			English	Article						turbofan engine; performance estimation; nonlinear filter; extended Kalman filter; particle filter	NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSTICS; SYSTEMS	Different approaches for gas path performance estimation of dynamic systems are commonly used, the most common being the variants of the Kalman filter. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) method is a popular approach for nonlinear systems which combines the traditional Kalman filtering and linearization techniques to effectively deal with weakly nonlinear and non-Gaussian problems. Its mathematical formulation is based on the assumption that the probability density function (PDF) of the state vector can be approximated to be Gaussian. Recent investigations have focused on the particle filter (PF) based on Monte Carlo sampling algorithms for tackling strong nonlinear and non-Gaussian models. Considering the aircraft engine is a complicated machine, operating under a harsh environment, and polluted by complex noises, the PF might be an available way to monitor gas path health for aircraft engines. Up to this point in time a number of Kalman filtering approaches have been used for aircraft turbofan engine gas path health estimation, but the particle filters have not been used for this purpose and a systematic comparison has not been published. This paper presents gas path health monitoring based on the PF and the constrained extend Kalman particle filter (cEKPF), and then compares the estimation accuracy and computational effort of these filters to the EKF for aircraft engine performance estimation under rapid faults and general deterioration. Finally, the effects of the constraint mechanism and particle number on the cEKPF are discussed. We show in this paper that the cEKPF outperforms the EKF, PF and EKPF, and conclude that the cEKPF is the best choice for turbofan engine health monitoring.

J	Tao, XC; Lu, C; Lu, C; Wang, ZL				Tao, Xiaochuang; Lu, Chen; Lu, Chuan; Wang, Zili			An approach to performance assessment and fault diagnosis for rotating machinery equipment	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Performance assessment; Fault diagnosis; Fisher discriminant analysis; Mahalanobis distance	FISHER DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; TRANSFORM	Predict and prevent maintenance is routinely carried out. However, how to address the problem of performance assessment maximizing the use of available monitoring data, and how to build a framework that integrates performance assessment, fault detection, and diagnosis are still a significant challenge. For this purpose, this article introduces an approach to performance assessment and fault diagnosis for rotating machinery, including wavelet packet decomposition for extracting energy feature samples from vibration signals acquired during normal and faulty conditions; clustering analysis for demonstrating the separability of the samples; and Fisher discriminant analysis for providing an optimal lower-dimensional representation, in terms of maximizing the separability among different populations, by projecting the samples into a new space. In the new low-dimensional space, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the new measurement data and normal population can be calculated for performance assessment. Moreover, this model for performance assessment only requires data to be available in normal conditions and any one of all possible fault conditions, without the necessity for the full life cycle of condition monitoring data. In addition, if monitoring data under different fault conditions are available, the fault mode can be identified accurately by comparing the MDs between the new measurement data and each fault population. Finally, the proposed method was verified to be successful on performance assessment and fault diagnosis via a hydraulic pump test and a ball bearing test.

J	Miao, Q; Tang, C; Liang, W; Pecht, M				Miao, Qiang; Tang, Chao; Liang, Wei; Pecht, Michael			Health Assessment of Cooling Fan Bearings Using Wavelet-Based Filtering	SENSORS			English	Article						cooling fan; health assessment; prognostics and health management; comblet filtering; exponentially weighted moving average; health condition indicator	VECTOR DATA DESCRIPTION; DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TOOTH FAILURE; PROGNOSTICS; TRANSFORM; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; SUBJECT; HILBERT	As commonly used forced convection air cooling devices in electronics, cooling fans are crucial for guaranteeing the reliability of electronic systems. In a cooling fan assembly, fan bearing failure is a major failure mode that causes excessive vibration, noise, reduction in rotation speed, locked rotor, failure to start, and other problems; therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on the health assessment of cooling fan bearings. This paper presents a vibration-based fan bearing health evaluation method using comblet filtering and exponentially weighted moving average. A new health condition indicator (HCI) for fan bearing degradation assessment is proposed. In order to collect the vibration data for validation of the proposed method, a cooling fan accelerated life test was conducted to simulate the lubricant starvation of fan bearings. A comparison between the proposed method and methods in previous studies (i.e., root mean square, kurtosis, and fault growth parameter) was carried out to assess the performance of the HCI. The analysis results suggest that the HCI can identify incipient fan bearing failures and describe the bearing degradation process. Overall, the work presented in this paper provides a promising method for fan bearing health evaluation and prognosis.

Drawbacks of swarm-based algorithms in heuristic search strategy related to mutual dependence of solutions are overcome by a likelihood-based trail intensity modification of ant-colony optimization. Numerical results of a comprehensive characterization through statistical experiment design on high-dimension multiple-faults diagnosis applications are shown. Experimental results under the framework of an industrial research project committed to industrial remote monitoring of operating machines are discussed. Numerical and experimental results show excellent performance, outperforming genetic algorithms, especially in high-dimension problems, and easiness in algorithm configuration.

Fault diagnosis of motor drives using stator current signal analysis based on dynamic time warping	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Reciprocating compressor; Dynamic time warping; Motor current signal	RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	Electrical motor stator current signals have been widely used to monitor the condition of induction machines and their downstream mechanical equipment. The key technique used for current signal analysis is based on Fourier transform (FT) to extract weak fault sideband components from signals predominated with supply frequency component and its higher order harmonics. However, the FT based method has limitations such as spectral leakage and aliasing, leading to significant errors in estimating the sideband components. Therefore, this paper presents the use of dynamic time warping (DTW) to process the motor current signals for detecting and quantifying common faults in a downstream two-stage reciprocating compressor. DTW is a time domain based method and its algorithm is simple and easy to be embedded into real-time devices. In this study DTW is used to suppress the supply frequency component and highlight the sideband components based on the introduction of a reference signal which has the same frequency component as that of the supply power. Moreover, a sliding window is designed to process the raw signal using DTW frame by frame for effective calculation. Based on the proposed method, the stator current signals measured from the compressor induced with different common faults and under different loads are analysed for fault diagnosis. Results show that DTW based on residual signal analysis through the introduction of a reference signal allows the supply components to be suppressed well so that the fault related sideband components are highlighted for obtaining accurate fault detection and diagnosis results. In particular, the root mean square (RMS) values of the residual signal can indicate the differences between the healthy case and different faults under varying discharge pressures. It provides an effective and easy approach to the analysis of motor current signals for better fault diagnosis of the downstream mechanical equipment of motor drives in the time domain in comparison with conventional FT based methods.

J	Cong, FY; Chen, J; Dong, GM; Zhao, FG				Cong, Feiyun; Chen, Jin; Dong, Guangming; Zhao, Fagang			Short-time matrix series based singular value decomposition for rolling bearing fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Singular value decomposition; Short-time matrix series; Fault diagnosis; Accelerated life test	ELEMENT BEARING; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SIGNALS; OPTIMIZATION; EXTRACTION; ENVELOPE	Rolling element bearing faults are among the main causes of rotating machines breakdown. It is important to distinguish the incipient fault before the bearings step into serious failure. Based on the traditional singular value decomposition (SVD) theory, short-time matrix series (STMS) and singular value ratio (SVR) are introduced to the vibration signal processing. The proposed signal processing method is called S-SVDR (STMS based SVD method using SVR) and it has been proved to have a good local identification capability in the rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The detailed description of applying S-SVDR methods to rolling bearing fault diagnosis is given through the artificial fault signal processing in experiment 1. In experiment 2, rolling element bearing accelerated life test is performed in Hangzhou Bearing Test & Research Center (HBRC). The experimental result shows that the incipient fault can be well detected through S-SVDR processing method. However, the envelope analysis of original signal cannot detect the fault due to the existence of signal interference. A conclusion can be made that the proposed S-SVDR method has a good effect on de-noising and eliminating the signal interference of rolling bearing for the fault diagnosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sinha, JK; Elbhbah, K				Sinha, Jyoti K.; Elbhbah, Keri			A future possibility of vibration based condition monitoring of rotating machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Rotating machine; Fault detection; Higher order spectra; Bispectrum; Trispectrum; Data fusion	HIGHER-ORDER SPECTRA; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BISPECTRAL ANALYSIS; SIGNAL; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSFORM; SHAFT	Adopted conventional practice uses a number of vibration sensors at a bearing pedestal of a rotating machine for the vibration based condition monitoring. The number of bearings in a machine, say a Turbo-Generator (TG) set, is likely to be very high hence increasing sensors to a large number. Therefore results in huge data sets to analyse to track any fault(s) which often depends on the experience and the engineering judgments in fault detection process. The effort of the present study is to reduce the number of sensors per bearing pedestals by enhancing the computational effort in signal processing. The concept used was fusion of the data from all sensors in the frequency domain to get a composite spectrum for a machine and then the computation of the higher order spectra (HOS) so that the vibration data is managed efficiently and able to detect fault uniquely. The results of the suggested approach are discussed here. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Transient-based analysis for the detection of broken damper bars in synchronous motors	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Synchronous machines; Fault diagnosis; Damper bars; Transient analysis; Power generation	DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; INDUCTION MACHINES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MECHANICAL FAULTS; ROTOR; PROGNOSIS; FAILURES	Synchronous generators and motors constitute critical elements in power generation plants and certain industrial facilities. Damper bars are crucial components of most of these synchronous machines. They enable, among other functions, the direct-on-line starting of these machines, just as if they were asynchronous. Some recent cases, reported by several authors, have demonstrated that eventual failure of damper bars is possible, mainly due to the currents and stresses rising during their operation. In this context, the development of reliable techniques able to diagnose possible damper breakages has attracted significant interest within the fault diagnosis area. The present paper proposes the application of a novel transient-based methodology to diagnose broken damper bars in synchronous motors. This methodology was previously assessed with success in industrial induction motors with diverse sizes. The approach relies on the analysis of the stator startup current demanded by the machine during a direct-on-line starting. To this end, suitable time-frequency decomposition tools are used. In this particular work, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is proposed, due to its simplicity, low computational requirements and easy interpretation of its results. Simulation and experimental results obtained with laboratory synchronous machines confirm the validity of the approach for condition monitoring of such windings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SELECTION OF DISCRETE WAVELETS FOR FAULT DIAGNOSIS OF MONOBLOCK CENTRIFUGAL PUMP USING THE J48 ALGORITHM	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							DECISION TREE; CLASSIFICATION; MACHINERY; TRANSFORM; SYSTEM	Monoblock centrifugal pumps play an important role in a variety of engineering applications such as in the food industry, in wastewater treatment plants, in agriculture, in the oil and gas industry, in the paper and pulp industry, and others. Condition monitoring of the various mechanical components of centrifugal pumps becomes essential for increasing productivity and reducing the number of breakdowns. Vibration-based continuous monitoring and analysis using machine learning approaches are gaining momentum. Particularly, artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic have been employed for continuous monitoring and fault diagnosis. This article presents the use of the J48 algorithm for fault diagnosis through discrete wavelet features extracted from vibration signals of good and faulty conditions of the components of a centrifugal pump. The classification accuracies of different discrete wavelet families were calculated and compared in order to find the best wavelet for the fault diagnosis of the centrifugal pump.

The system is used as triage for human analysis and, thus, a very low false negative rate is more important than high accuracy. Data are classified using a standard SVM, but for data within the SVM margin, where misclassifications are more like, a k-NN is used to reduce the false negative rate. Using data from a month of operations of a predictive maintenance company, the system achieved a zero false negative rate and accuracy ranging from 75% to 84% for different machine types such as induction motors, gears, and rolling-element bearings.

In the literature, two main 3D machining variation models have been studied: the stream of variation model, oriented to product quality improvement (fault diagnosis, process planning evaluation and selection, etc.), and the model of the manufactured part, oriented to product and manufacturing design activities (manufacturing and product tolerance analysis and synthesis). This paper reviews the fundamentals of each model and describes step by step how to derive them using a simple case study. The paper analyzes both models and compares their main characteristics and applications. A discussion about the drawbacks and limitations of each model and some potential research lines in this field are also presented.

The system consists of two data stream mining modules: a trace segmentation module and a multivariate trace comparison module. Each time a wafer exits the processing chamber, the trace segmentation module extracts the traces of monitored tool parameters from raw sensor data streams. We propose a novel trace segmentation algorithm called multisensor-based trace segmentation. The algorithm finds the individual start and end times of monitored tool parameters in a wafer-to-wafer fashion. For analyzing faulty tool operations, the multivariate trace comparison module performs a new principal component analysis (PCA) called a trace structure-based PCA. For each tool parameter, the structural similarity distance between a template and the extracted trace is measured using a dynamic time warping algorithm. Then, the measurements are used to build the PCA model. This approach is contrasted with the traditional PCA procedure in which the trace means are used as the building blocks for the PCA model. Experiments using the data collected from a worksite reactive ion etch tool showed that the performance of the proposed system is very encouraging.

A large body of research work in fault diagnosis has been proposed to identify the root causes of the large dimensional variations on products. These methods are based on a linear relationship between the dimensional measurements of the products and the possible process errors, and assume that the number of measurements is greater than that of process errors. However, in practice, the number of measurements is often less than that of process errors due to economical considerations. This brings a substantial challenge to the fault diagnosis in multistation assembly processes since the problem becomes solving an underdetermined system. In order to tackle this challenge, a fault diagnosis methodology is proposed by integrating the state space model with the enhanced relevance vector machine (RVM) to identify the process faults through the sparse estimate of the variance change of the process errors. The results of case studies demonstrate that the proposed methodology can identify process faults successfully.

Residual Life Prediction of Rotating Machines Using Acoustic Noise Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE International Workshop on Measurements and Networking (MandN)	OCT 10-11, 2011	Capri Island, ITALY			Acoustic noise; acoustic signal processing; fault detection; feature extraction; frequency domain analysis; information theory; pattern recognition	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MODULATION SPECTRUM; DEFECT DETECTION; VIBRATION; RELEVANCE; SOUND	While automated condition monitoring of rotating machines often use vibration signals for defect detection, diagnosis, and residual life predictions, in this paper, the acoustic noise signal (< 25 kHz), acquired via non-contact microphone sensors, is used to predict the remaining useful life (RUL). Modulation spectral (MS) analysis of acoustic signals has the potential to provide additional long-term information over more conventional short-term signal spectral components. However, the high dimensionality of MS features has been cited as a limitation to their applicability in this area in the literature. Therefore, in this study, a novel approach is proposed which employs an information theoretic approach to feature subset selection of modulation spectra features. This approach does not require information regarding the spectral location of defect frequencies to be known or pre-estimated and leverages information regarding the chronological order of data samples for dimensionality reduction. The results of this study show significant improvements for this proposed approach over the other commonly used spectral-based approaches for the task of predicting RUL by up to 19% relative over the standard envelope analysis approach used in the literature. A further 16% improvement was achieved by applying a more rigorous approach to labeling of acoustic samples acquired over the lifetime of the machines over a fixed length class labeling approach. A detailed misclassification analysis is provided to interpret the relative cost of system errors for the task of residual life predictions of rotating machines used in industrial applications.

Mohammad			High-Impedance Faulted Branch Identification Using Magnetic-Field Signature Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						Distribution networks; electromagnetic field; faulted branch indicator; high-impedance fault (HIF); mathematical morphology (MM); nonlinear support vector machines; protection	LOCATION TECHNIQUE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; EXPERT-SYSTEM; DIAGNOSIS; SECTION; SCHEME	In this paper, for the first time, a high-impedance fault indicator (HIFI), to be mounted on the poles of distribution feeders, is proposed to detect and track down the location of high-impedance faults (HIFs). The main contribution of this paper is the investigation of employing the magnetic-field strength signal, measured in the vicinity of the conductors of a feeder, to detect HIFs based on a novel pattern recognition method. The proposed HIFIs should be installed so that the faulted branch identification becomes possible and simple (i.e., at the sending ends of branches). Applying the data for HIFs, insulator leakage current and harmonic load from field tests and for other similar phenomena from simulations has shown high security and dependability of the proposed method as a computational model for HIFI.

Bearing Multiple Defects Detection Based on Envelope Detector Time Constant	JOURNAL OF TRIBOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; BALL-BEARING; VIBRATION; PROGNOSTICS	Rolling element bearing damage detection is one of the foremost concerns in rotating machinery. The difficulties in bearing defect diagnosis when the bearing has multiple defects increase, since unexpected changes occur in the amplitude of the bearing defect frequencies. In addition, the tendency toward condition-based maintenance (CBM) requires a better understanding of the fault progression due to the fact that multiple defects is one kind of fault development. In this paper, in order to detect multiple defects on one component of the bearing, a new method based on the high frequency resonance technique (HFRT) is introduced. The time constant in the envelope detector is used to find the pattern of the amplitude of defect frequency harmonics (ADFH) in the frequency domain. This method is based on a comparison of the ADFH with a curve, which is obtained from vibration modeling of the bearing. Two criteria are given for the diagnosis of multiple defects. The method is investigated with a simulation and a real experiment. Single and multiple defects are created on the outer race of the ball bearing at different angles. Additionally, the ADFH in the multiple faults experiments are calculated with the proposed mathematical modeling in order to check the accuracy of the model. The experimental results confirm the ability of the proposed method to diagnose multiple defects. [DOI:10.1115/1.4007806]	[Mohammadi, A.; Safizadeh, M.

J	Hou, JJ; Jiang, WK; Lu, WB				Hou, Junjian; Jiang, Weikang; Lu, Wenbo			Application of a near-field acoustic holography-based diagnosis technique in gearbox fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						Condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; gearbox; near-field acoustic holography; pattern recognition	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; VIBRATION; FAILURES; FEATURES; SIGNALS	With the combination of the near-field acoustic holography (NAH) and pattern recognition technique, a NAH-based diagnosis technique is proposed and applied to diagnose gearbox faults by analyzing the sound field distribution information first. After visualizing the sound fields under different working conditions by NAH, the spatial gray level co-occurrence matrices based textural features can be obtained from the NAH images. Then, the support vector machine is employed to identify different working conditions and diagnose the faults. Two gearbox experiments with different gear faults and fault severity are studied in a semi-anechoic chamber to verify the NAH-based diagnosis technique. The experimental results demonstrate that the NAH-based diagnosis method is feasible and effective, and can be anticipated as a choice for gearbox fault diagnosis.

J	Lebaroud, A; Medoued, A				Lebaroud, Abdesselam; Medoued, Ammar			Online computational tools dedicated to the detection of induction machine faults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Online components calculation; Faults; Induction machine	DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS	This paper presents online components calculation techniques for stator and rotor of the induction machine. Four techniques have been developed for online components calculation; the first one starts the calculation of the negative component of stator current space vector using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in order to detect the stator fault. The second technique is dealing with the detection of rotor fault by the Recursive Fourier Transform (RFT), This technique improves the signal acquisition and enhanced detection of components near the fundamental. The third technique allows improving of the rotor fault detection by the spectrum of analytical signal. The fourth and the last technique is the frequency analysis of the instantaneous power, which allows obtaining a singular signature of faults. These techniques have shown better detection, where each fault is characterized by a singular signature and therefore they improve the detection and diagnosis of faults. Experimental results applied on an asynchronous machine 5.5 kW, approve and validate these calculation techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work we are going to propose an efficient diagnosis technique, based on the use of a low-cost sensor, for the online detection of a transient abrupt drop in the drive speed system. Tests have been conducted on a four-pole brushless alternator driven by a DC shunt motor. Through conventional time-frequency analysis, four different techniques are suggested. Whereas the two first are based on the load currents analysis (one phase and three phases), the two other methods are based on the stray fluxes analysis (axial and transversal components).

Bearing defects decision making using higher order spectra features and support vector machines	14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCES AND TECHNIQUES OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL & COMPUTER ENGINEERING STA 2013	International Conference on Sciences and Techniques of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Sciences and Techniques of Automatic Control and Computer Engineering (STA)	DEC 20-22, 2013	Sousse, TUNISIA	Univ Sfax, Nat Engn Sch Sfax, Lab Sci & Tech Automat Control & Comp Engn, IEEE Tunisia Sect, Assoc Tunisienne Tech Numeriques & Automatique		Bi-spectrum; Fault diagnosis; Rolling element bearing; Principal component analysis; Support vector machines; Vibration	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CYCLIC BISPECTRUM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DECOMPOSITION; PATTERNS	This paper presents a novel pattern classification approach for bearing defects diagnostics, which combine the higher order spectra (HOS) analysis features and support vector machine classifier (SVM). The use of non-linear features motivated by the higher order spectra has been reported to be a promising approach to analyze the non-linear and non-Gaussian characteristics of the bearing mechanical vibration signals. The vibration bi-spectrum patterns are extracted as the feature vectors presenting different faults of the bearings. The extracted bi-spectrum features are subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. These principal components were fed to support vector machine to distinguish four kinds of bearing conditions namely: normal, inner race fault, outer race fault and ball fault, which were measured in the experimental test bench running under different working conditions. The results indicated that the proposed method can reliably identify different fault patterns of rolling element bearings based on mechanical vibration signals.

This model is used to predict the influence of these harmonics on the electromagnetic performances of IM drives in healthy condition and to extract significant signatures under faulty conditions such as unbalanced supply voltage. The equations which describe the transient as well as steady state behavior including the computation of machine inductances are presented, basing on the calculation of the magnetic field distribution through the machine air-gap. The proposed model is less complicated to be implemented for condition monitoring or control of IM drives. The simulation results provide useful consequences about the characteristics of the IM under unbalanced voltage conditions including space and time harmonics effects. It will be shown that the space and time harmonics influence significantly the harmonic content of the electromagnetic torque and stator currents which are used for condition monitoring of IM drives.

We focus on two new use cases that are of special importance to city authorities. One use case is the automatic identification of malfunctioning meters. with a focus on distinguishing them from legitimate non-consumption such as during periods when the household residents are on vacation. The other use case is the identification of leaks or theft in the unmetered common areas of apartment buildings. These two use cases are highly important to city authorities both because of the lost revenue they imply and because of the hassle to the residents in cases of delayed identification. Both cases are inherently complex to analyze and require advanced data mining techniques in order to achieve high levels of correct identification, Our results provide for faster and more accurate detection of malfunctioning meters as well as leaks in the common areas. This results in significant tangible value to the authorities in terms of increase in technician efficiency and a decrease in the an amount of wasted, not-revenue, water.

Managing these huge numbers of incoming bug reports is a challenging task. Dealing with these reports manually consumes time and resources which leads to delaying the resolution of important bugs which are crucial and need to be identified and resolved earlier. Bug triaging is an important process in software maintenance. Some bugs are important and need to be fixed right away, whereas others are minor and their fixes could be postponed until resources are available. Most automatic bug assignment approaches do not take the priority of bug reports in their consideration. Assigning bug reports based on their priority may play an important role in enhancing the bug triaging process. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the priority of a reported bug using different machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. We also investigate the effect of using two feature sets on the classification accuracy. We conduct experimental evaluation using open-source projects namely Eclipse and Firefox. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is feasible in predicting the priority of bug reports. It also shows that feature-set-2 outperforms feature-set-1. Moreover, both Random Forests and Decision Trees outperform Naive Bayes.

Firstly, a track circuit electrical model is developed based on transmission line theory. A signal known as short-circuit current signal is obtained and the influences on it are then investigated for the existence of defective electrical separation joints. The signal is composed of arched curve segments, and each of the segments can be approximated by a quadratic polynomial. The coefficients of the polynomials for the first three arched segments are used as fault features to train the proposed diagnosis mode. Training parameters are selected using cross-validation technique. Polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernel functions are employed. Experiments with simulated data show that the correct diagnosis rates over 96% can be achieved using this approach, which can meet the requirement of practical application.

A New Approach of Preprocessing with SVM Optimization Based on PSO for Bearing Fault Diagnosis	2013 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYBRID INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (HIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)	DEC 04-06, 2013	Gammarth, TUNISIA			Condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transform; Fault Diagnosis; Kurtosis; Machine learning; Particle Swarm Optimization; Roller Bearing; Rotating machines; Support Vector Machine; Vibration measurement	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Bearing fault diagnosis has attracted significant attention over the past few decades. It consists of two major parts: vibration signal feature extraction and condition classification for the extracted features. In this paper, feature extraction from faulty bearing vibration signals is performed by a combination of the signal's Kurtosis and features obtained through the preprocessing of the vibration signal samples using Db2 discrete wavelet transform at the fifth level of decomposition. In this way, a 7-dimensional vector of the vibration signal feature is obtained. After feature extraction from vibration signal, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to automate the fault diagnosis procedure. To improve the classification accuracy for bearing fault prediction, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to simultaneously optimize the SVM kernel function parameter and the penalty parameter. The results have shown feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

To make the equipment maintenance more efficient, this paper proposes an online and remote machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system for motor system based on WIA-PA (Wireless network for Industry Automation Process Automation). The system continuously monitors the status of the target motor systems using wireless vibration transmitters. After extracting the feature of vibration signals, the wireless vibration transmitters send feature data to host computer through WIA-PA wireless sensor network. These data are processed further in host computer to make diagnosis for the motor system using the customized expert system. This paper describes the structure of the system, vibration transmitter, WIA-PA wireless network and host computer system in detail. The proposed system was tested in field, and the results are presented.

Machine-learning techniques have recently been proposed for reasoning-based functional-fault diagnosis system to achieve high diagnosis accuracy. However, machine learning requires a rich set of test items (syndromes) and a sizable database of faulty boards. An insufficient number of failed boards, ambiguous root-cause identification, and redundant or irrelevant syndromes can render machine learning ineffective. We propose an evaluation and enhancement framework based on information theory for guiding diagnosis systems using syndrome and root-cause analysis. Syndrome analysis based on subset selection provides a representative set of syndromes with minimum redundancy and maximum relevance. Root-cause analysis measures the discriminative ability of differentiating a given root cause from others. The metrics obtained from the proposed framework can also provide guidelines for test redesign to enhance diagnosis. A real board from industry, currently in volume production, and an additional synthetic board, based on data extrapolated from another real board, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The quantity used to analyze the problem is the stator current or, more specifically, the harmonic content of its frequency spectrum, also called current signature. The analysis through the current signature is a non-invasive method and may be embedded in the frequency converter, what is a great advantage. The dataset used for training and validating the ANN is obtained using a test bench that allows applying different levels of interturn short-circuits in the machine. It is observed that the fault motor dataset and healthy motor dataset are difficult to separate, which demands a large computational effort to choose a proper MLP topology. The MLP is trained by two different algorithms (the classical error Backpropagation - BP - and an adaptation of the newer Extreme Learning Machine - ELM) and the results are thoroughly explored, including after the application of a pruning method called CAPE. Then it is slightly compared with the results of a Self-Organized Map ANN [1] obtained by using the same dataset.

Many compound faults are coupled with each other, fuzzy, object and some complex characteristics so it is a bottleneck problem which is very tough to break through in fault diagnosis field. Early research results indicate that diagnosis with dimensionless parameters have got good effects in single fault for rotating machinery, but under simulating actual working state of compound faults, there are obvious overlap in ranges of dimensionless parameters calculated by vibration monitoring data of each compound faults, that is to say, it is hard to distinguish the ranges of dimensionless parameters of each fault, causing complexity of diagnosis rise, and the existing method is hard to deal with this problem. To solve the difficult problem, an online fusion fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on dimensionless immune detector and evidence reasoning (ER) is proposed. Experimental result demonstrates that the method can realize effectively real-time fault diagnose for rotating machinery and has high potential applications in real project.

Our objective is to prove that by implementing a good scheduled maintenance program including Proactive, Predictive and Preventive maintenance will decrease the high cost in time and money contributed to Corrective maintenance and will lower unexpected machine faults dramatically. A comparison study between two groups of machines has been done. The 1st group is subjected to scheduled maintenance program and the second is left without a program, the result showed that the first group had a very low unplanned downtime, the second group had a high number of faults, thus a high unplanned down time.

Due to the potential advantages to be gained from proactive maintenance, monitoring of machines health, assessing survival probability of machines unit. Numerous methods have been developed based on intelligent systems. This paper concerns with the prediction of engine oil wear particle using regression relevance vector machine(RVM). It attempts to overcome the problems of support vector machine (SVM) such as low sparsity, low computationally efficient and kernel function must be satisfied with the Mercer's condition. RVM is a method suitable for processing regression and classification problems. In this paper, a regress prediction model is developed using RVM. The results of experiments show that RVM provides better prediction accuracy and generalization than SVM and artificial neural network (ANN). At the same conditions, RVM can be widely used in engine oil wear particle analysis and fault prediction.

To overcome this difficulty, a novel integrated model-based and grey-relational-analyzed diagnosis strategy is proposed. Due to its strong robustness, a sliding mode observer based on the aircraft braking model is employed to generate the residuals of the wheel speed. And grey-relational-analyzed diagnosis, which is known as its diagnostic accuracy and few computing requirement, is used for sensor failure diagnosis. Four different sensor states, namely normal state, gain variation failure, stuck failure, constant deviation failure, are simulated on an aircraft braking model and compared. The results presented indicate that this diagnosis strategy is capable of handing difficult wheel speed sensor failure.

The principle of the predictor and its online algorithm are introduced. Compared with the traditional least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), OS-LSSVM has an advantage on training speed owing to the online training algorithm based on the base vector set. The real-time output data of sensor is employed as the training vector to establish the regression model. This method is compared with the LSSVM predictor in the experiment.

This method utilizes the newly developed concept of Augmented Global Analytical Redundancy Relations (AGARRs) to consider incipient fault prognosis of parametric and nonparametric nature. The incipient fault could develop at all modes (detectable mode/non-detectable mode). Before a fault is detected, the mode information is provided by a mode tracker, which is based on Mode-change Signature Matrix (MCSM) and is only activated when an inconsistency between monitored system and its nominal model is detected. Once a fault is detected, model based mode tracker is not useful anymore. A technique to parameterize the mode change is utilized. The degradation behavior of incipient fault is unknown in advanced, and a degradation model selection mechanism is discussed. The fault hypothesis set, including suspected faults and suspected mode change, is established after fault isolation. A mixed differential evolution (MDE) algorithm is proposed for fault prognosis, which is able to simultaneously handle real and binary unknown variables. Simulation results of different fault scenarios show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between movement changes during stair ascent and pain, radiographic severity, and prognosis of knee OA in the elderly women using machine learning (ML) over a seven-year follow-up period. Eighteen elderly female patients with knee OA and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Kinematic data for stair ascent were obtained using a 3D-motion analysis system at baseline. Kinematic factors were analyzed based on one of the popular ML methods, support vector machines (SVM). SVM was used to search kinematic predictors associated with pain, radiographic severity of knee OA, and unfavorable outcomes, which were defined as persistent knee pain as reported at the seven-year follow-up or as having undergone total knee replacement during the follow-up period. Six patients (46.2%) had unfavorable outcomes at the seven-year follow-up. SVM showed accuracy of detection of knee OA (97.4%), prediction of pain (83.3%), radiographic severity (83.3%), and unfavorable outcomes (69.2%). The predictors with SVM included the time of stair ascent, maximal anterior pelvis tilting, knee flexion at initial foot contact, and ankle dorsiflexion at initial foot contact. The interpretation of movement during stair ascent using ML may be helpful for physicians not only in detecting knee OA, but also in evaluating pain and radiographic severity.

Since the motor has parallel-connected windings, the air-gap unbalance makes rise unbalanced currents in the stator branches, and the split-phase current signature analysis can be attempted for fault detection. The split-phase currents are better analyzed when transposed in the complex domain, by using symmetrical components. Moreover, the rotor cage currents must be carefully taken in account in the model, since they develop a powerful damping effect on the signature of static eccentricity. This paper shows that the faulted machine can be represented by the superimposition of five equivalent circuits corresponding to five centered-rotor virtual machines, useful for fault-related split-phase current calculation. The mathematical modeling shown in this paper is useful to carry out a diagnostic method, as shown in a companion paper. The latter also reports confirmatory simulations of the faulted 1130kW motor, based on winding function approach.

The five circuits allow the calculation of stator and rotor fault-related currents, in form of 2(P +/- 1)-pole space vectors for 2p-pole machines. The formal calculation of fault-related currents is very useful for defining fault indicators and tools for diagnosis, and in case of parallel-connected stators (like in many traction motors) the split-phase current signature analysis becomes possible. This paper validates the sequence-circuit modeling by comparing the theoretical results with simulations of a 1130kW traction induction motor with static, dynamic, and mixed faults in both no-load and full-load conditions. The simulations are carried out by using a full mesh-model of the motor, implemented by winding functions. A good match is obtained between theoretical calculations and simulations. Moreover, the role of the cage damping on the eccentricity-related current signatures is evidenced. It is shown that the cage damps not only the signature of static fault but also that of dynamic fault, and that the damping itself is load-dependent in the latter case.

In this paper, we have proposed a magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) model considering magnetic saturation to evaluate and analyse the performance of an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) under eccentricity fault. This model provides the advantages in fast computation while giving reasonable degree of accuracy. The potential application of this model includes fault tolerant machine design optimization, fault tolerant machine drive design, as well as fault diagnosis and monitoring. The accuracy of this model will be gauged by comparison with finite element method (FEM) modeling.

Vibration measurement is very needful in mechanical and electrical industries to check the machine health & to take predictive maintenance steps before failure or major fault occur. A system based on virtual instrument is introduced that can measure vibration signals. The hardware-developing of the system includes vibration sensors, a signal conditioning circuit cum sensor exciter, a data acquisition device and a PC. Here for research, we are implementing vibration sensor on cantilever beam type arrangement and analyzing vibration signal using signal processing technique in LabVIEW. This methodology relies on the use of advanced methods for machine vibration analysis and health monitoring. Because of some issues encountered regarding traditional methods, for Fourier analysis of non stationary rotating machines the use of more advanced method using powerful software is required. FFT is a very powerful tool in frequency domain for analysis of vibration signal and it provides the information at which frequency the fault occurs? And according to that information we also predict the speed of rotating machine. For FFT analysis; it is necessary to convert vibration data (dynamic data 100mv/g) into EUs (Engineering Units) like acceleration, Velocity and displacement. Here we did the same. The main advantage of vibration monitoring with propose system is that it enables simultaneous monitoring of a number of machines of industries located at different places from a common point. The paper presents a scientific direction and development of vibration signals measurement.

Finite element method is adopted to evaluate the stator currents and electromagnetic torque. The simulation results of the induction motor with circinal and oval stator are compared to find the conclusions for oval stator and rotor eccentricity diagnosis. It shows that the rotor eccentricity and the ovality of the stator are possible to be detected by analyzing the spectra of the stator currents and electromagnetic torque. The findings of this paper help to complement the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of electrical machines.

Of late, there has been greater emphasis on machine learning based approaches to solve the fault diagnosis problem. The availability of relevant sensors and required processing capabilities has further enabled the research efforts in this area. In this work, we have developed an acoustic signal based fault diagnosis and classification system for air compressors. The acoustic signals are acquired using a microphone and National Instruments' data acquisition system. The acquired data is analyzed in time, frequency and wavelet domain. We have used a set of robust features using the Shannon's information theory. In this work, we have made two significant contributions: (i) used an information theoretic framework to determine the suitability of an acoustic data instance for classifier training. (ii) proposed a novel Bag-of-feature based approach for fault diagnosis using an acoustic signal. We evaluated the performance of these features using three well known classifiers like kNN, SVM and Maximum-Likelihood and obtained very good accuracy for the real data set.

Therefore, efficient inspection technology is very important for heat exchanger's blockage and leakage. The existing detection technologies, like temperature test and pressure test, are very easily affected by extraneous factors, e. g., temperature and pressure, while the nondestructive testing technology based on vibration sensors is free from above limits. In this paper, we use vibration sensors to detect blockage and leakage of the circulating-water heat exchanger. According to the experimental results, it is found that when detecting heat exchanger's blockage and leakage with vibration sensors, environmental vibration from the working machines has influence upon the result, while pump vibration and vibration produced by liquid flowing through regulating-valve make little difference. Nevertheless, fault diagnosis of large-scale circulating-water heat exchanger, which uses nondestructive testing technology based on vibration sensors, needs to be further improved.

By means of advanced diagnosis methods, it is possible to detect these faults in their incipient phase, before the catastrophic effects of the failures can occur. In this paper, a new bearing fault diagnosis method by means of statistical analysis of the stator current and of the stray flux around an induction motor is presented. The experimental tests were carried out on a three-phase induction motor with three different bearing faults: crack in the outer race, hole in the outer race and deformation of the protective seal.

On the other hand, vibration monitoring is reported as an interesting technique for the rotating machinery condition diagnosis. This paper considers the Wavelet Transform (WT) and FFT of vibration signals for detect and diagnose of unbalance faults in rotating machinery. The fault condition and location of faults are success fully detected by WT-FFT for non-stationary vibration measurements obtained from accelerometer sensors. Experimental studies on the rotating machine include faulty rotor with different rotational speeds has been carried out in this paper. These experimental results confirm that WT-FFT serves as a good tool to online faults detection and diagnosis of rotating machines.

A variety of signal analysis techniques exists for machine status diagnosis. This paper deals with remote diagnosis of electrical systems. Herein, we developed a remote monitoring system based on the Internet technology. The use of such system gives many advantages including minimum intervention on the client side, and simplicity to expand the system. The users can check the machine status data through the internet and mobile terminals. The automatic alarm part can actively send alerting messages to the engineers' mobile phones and call these phones to make sure they get alert when machine's status is abnormal. Another advantage is the reduction of the maintenance cost.

In this paper, discrete wavelet coefficients (DWT) of stator current in a specific frequency band are derived and analyzed. Wavelets db8, db9, db10, sym7 and sym8 are compared to select a most optimal one. This approach facilitates the detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bar occurrence or even number of broken bars under load variation. Simulation and experimental tests on inductions motors with 1, 2, and 3 broken bars are conducted, which demonstrate the effective fault detection of the proposed approach.

New Quantitative Rotor Fault Evaluation in Wound Rotor Induction Machine Drives Under Time-Varying Conditions	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales		WAVELET TRANSFORM; TURN FAULTS; DIAGNOSIS; CONNECTIONS	This paper presents a new diagnosis approach for quantitative rotor faults evaluation in three-phase wound rotor induction machines. In the considered application, the rotor windings are supplied by a static converter for the control of active and reactive power flows exchanged between the machine and the electrical grid. Under speed or fault-varying conditions, the typical rotor fault frequency components, which appear in rotor voltages, are spread in a bandwidth proportional to the speed which complicates its detectability. The proposed diagnosis approach is based on the use of wavelet analysis improved by a pre-processing of the rotor voltage commands. Thus, the time evolution of fault components can be effectively analyzed. Experimental results show the validity of the proposed method under speed and intermittent fault varying conditions, leading to an effective diagnosis procedure for rotor electrical faults in wound rotor induction machines.

This paper describes a real fault detection problem of a high-power (3.2 MW) induction motor driving pumps in a heating plant. Steady-state vibration signals were collected and some characteristic low-and high-frequency features were observed, resulting in broken rotor bar diagnosis. The obtained results were verified by disassembling the motor, which proved that this particular technique can be successfully applied in induction motor fault detection.

Diagnosis of Induction Motor Faults using a DSP and Advanced Demodulation Techniques	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	Broken bar rotor faults; demodulation; DSP; signal analysis; fault diagnosis; induction machine; motor current signature analysis	ENERGY; SIGNAL; OPERATOR; BAR	On-line diagnosis of induction motors faults requires special, high speed hardware, such as DSP or FPGAs. Practical implementation of diagnosis algorithms in such a device must take into account the limited amount of memory available for storing sampled data, and for performing spectral analysis using the FFT. Another practical problem is the need to filter the mains component, whose leakage can hide fault harmonics, prior to compute the FFT of the current's signal. This requires the use of digital filters, that must be tuned in case of using variable speed drives that can operate the motor at different speeds. In this paper, an advanced demodulation technique that is able to eliminate the mains component with an extremely low memory requirement, based on the Teager-Kaiser energy operator, is presented. The demodulated current is footprint is down sampled, so that only 2kb of memory are needed to perform the diagnosis process. The proposed method is implemented in a DSP commercial board online diagnosis system and tested on commercial induction motors with broken bars. Finally, the results are compared with the results obtained offline using conventional Motor Current Signature Analysis method.

In the literature, Spectral Kurtosis is mainly presented as a tool used to detect non-stationary components in a signal. However, classical use of SK is unsuitable for detection of new stationary components or slow evolutions in a spectrum. In order to detect different types of faults, three indicators are designed from the original definition of the Spectral Kurtosis. These indicators are first tested and compared on synthetic signals. Then, their performance are demonstrated for unbalance detection in a Induction Machine (IM) using current signal.

The proposed method is able to extract fault components either in steady-state or in transient conditions. This paper also proposes a new way to compute the energy of a signal in the frequency domain by means of the Plancherel's Theorem. Unlike the Discrete Wavelet Transform, which makes the filtering process in the time domain, the Discrete Fourier Transform allows the filtering process in the frequency domain. The use of the Discrete Fourier Transform makes the filtering process possible without applying any pretreatment to the current as it is done in the former works. As a consequence of the filtering process in the frequency domain and in order to reduce useless computations, in the current paper is also demonstrated the possibility of the computation of the energy of the extracted fault component in the frequency domain. The results are compared with the former and already published works in the area showing the good reliability of the new filtering process and energy computation in the frequency domain.

Fault Detection and Classification in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines using Fast Fourier Transform and Linear Discriminant Analysis	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	Demagnetization; Eccentricity; Inter-turn short circuit; Linear discriminant analysis classification; Permanent magnet synchronous machine	ECCENTRICITY	The main objective of this paper is to propose a method to detect the presence of a fault in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs), determine the type of that fault and estimate the severity in the case of eccentricity fault. In this paper, three types of faults are discussed: static eccentricity, inter-turn short circuit, and demagnetization faults. The machine is controlled using a three phase current source and the harmonics of the stator voltage are used as detailed features for the classifier for fault detection. Two dimensional (2-D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to model and simulate the machine under healthy and faulty conditions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is performed to the phase voltage signal to detect the frequency spectrum and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is chosen as a classification method. To validate the method, two different types of PMSMs are tested: the first with a concentrated winding and the second with a series distributed winding. The tests are applied for different operation loads.

Early Broken Rotor Bar Detection Techniques in VSD-fed Induction Motors at Steady-state	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Induction motors; Multiple signal classification; Spectral analysis; Wavelet transforms	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL; MACHINES; LOAD	Condition monitoring has become necessary to detect failures in induction motors (IM), where the detection of incipient faults is of great concern. However, the detection of partially-broken rotor bars at an early stage is not so easily achieved. Therefore, it is necessary to use suitable condition monitoring accompanied with signal processing techniques to detect partially-broken rotor bar. This paper presents a comparative study of various condition monitoring methods accomplished for IM, with the aim of early detection of one partially-broken rotor bar by steady-state current spectrum analysis and different supply conditions, such as two different variable speed drives providing three fundamental supply frequencies, and the line supply case. The study includes three different load conditions for each case. Results show that the most accurate and robust analysis methodology for early detection of broken rotor bars under different supply conditions, fundamental supply frequencies and load conditions during steady-state analysis, are the subspace methods.

The diagnostic in some specific situations (presence of load toque oscillations, light loading conditions) or of specific failures may be difficult when using the classical MCSA approach. In this context, the transient-based methodologies have been proven to become valuable informational sources for the diagnosis, either confirming the MCSA results or avoiding its possible false positives. The application of these transient methodologies requires the use of modern signal processing tools that are in continuous evolution. This work proposes the application of an advanced tool; the recently developed Adaptive Slope Transform. The paper compares the performance of this continuous transform and that of a discrete counterpart, the Discrete Wavelet Transform, when applied to different controversial fault cases in which the classical MCSA may not lead to correct results: outer bar breakages in double cage motors and motors with rotor axial duct influence. The results show the potential of the continuous transforms for the transient tracking of high-order fault-related components as well as for the improved discrimination between fault components.

Two forms of permeance function are presented and compared. The mixed-eccentricity fault is studied because it generalizes better the case encountered in any machine. IM inductances are calculated by using the modified winding function and including space harmonics of winding functions. It is also analytically detailed the genesis of the eccentricity signatures allowing the diagnosis. Coherence of simulated and experimental results in term of frequency content proves a validity of the study.

Motor Current Signature Analysis Apply for external Mechanical Fault and Cage Asymmetry in Induction Motors	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	Cage asymmetry; Condition Monitoring; External Fault; Modeling; Motor Current Signature Analysis; Squirrel Cage Motor	DIAGNOSIS	The aim of this paper is to recognize if the differences between effects due to external mechanical faults and internal electrical faults in induction motors can be diagnosed through Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) techniques applying Fourier analysis. For that purpose an alternative algorithm to traditional Fast Fourier Transform was used. Positive and negative frequency spectra have been studied. The paper shows a comparison between frequency spectra of the symmetrical and natural components of stator currents for internal electrical fault (rotor cage asymmetry) and external mechanical fault represented by a periodical oscillating torque. Cage asymmetry is defined by symmetrical and asymmetrical factors. The study is based on the classical model of induction machine considering only effects of Main Magneto-motive Forces. Result shown corresponds to the steady-state performance of the motor supplied directly from the net as a sinusoidal voltage source. The advantages of the algorithm use for Fourier analysis have also been discussed.	[Gomez, A. J. Fernandez; Sobczyk, T.

The basis for model's equations is the fact that this type of faults inevitably alters the rotor parameters. Both the resistance and inductance take a sinusoidal shape, being a function of rotor angle, almost regardless of the configuration of fault. Differing from previous work, in this paper a model has been developed in rotor field coordinates, being this the preferable reference frame for machine control and thus easier for control engineers to grasp, especially in closed-looped systems. The approach has been tested on laboratory models of two different induction machines connected to the grid with completely different severities of faults. The results show a very good agreement between measurements and simulations.

Support Vector Machine for Diagnosis of Induction Motors: a Comparative Analysis in Terms of the Quantity and the Signal Processing Tool Used to Build the Feature Space	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales		FAULT	The use of advanced diagnosis techniques for induction motor (IM) faults relies on the use of automated classifiers, such as those based on support vector machines (SVMs), which are able to assess the condition of the machine using a set of relevant features extracted either from the time domain or from the frequency domain machines signals. But the performance of such systems depends on two main factors: the quantity that is used to obtain the machine's condition, and the signal processing tool used for extract the features set. In this paper, a combination of the most used quantities and signal processing tools is used for diagnosis a set of machines with broken bars, fed from the mains and from variable speed drives, using the same SVM. In this way, the most efficient combination can be chosen, from the point of view of the performance of the automatic classifier system.

The condition monitoring technique proposed in this paper indicates the presence of a winding fault and provides information about its nature and location. The data required for the proposed method are motor terminal voltages, stator currents and rotor speed obtained during steady state operation. The data is then processed off-line using an induction motor model in conjunction with GA to determine the effective motor parameters. The proposed technique is demonstrated using experimental data obtained from a 1.5 kW wound rotor three-phase induction machine with both stator and rotor winding faults considered. Results confirm the effectiveness of GA to properly identify the type and location of the fault without the need for knowledge of various fault signatures.	[Alamyal, M.; Gadoue, S.

Data comes from a tested motor fed by different types of supply: direct line and two different Voltage Source Inverters. Diagnosis is always difficult in Voltage Source Inverter fed motors due to inherent noise level and the presence of additional non-related fault harmonics in the stator current spectrum. Moreover, the motor was tested under different load conditions, from no-load to full-load. Diagnosis is also more difficult at lower load levels. Previous to fault classification, a variable reduction was carried out using Principal Component Analysis. Fault classification was performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. The motor was tested with different fault severities, what allowed us to perform an analysis oriented to different maintenance approaches, considering the criticality of the motor.

In this regard, an acoustic emission based intelligent sensor is presented in this work. The proposed sensor records regularly the acoustic emission signal generated by gearboxes. A time domain statistical analysis is applied in order to characterize the acquired data. Afterwards, a neural network based algorithm is applied to detect gear fault patterns. Finally, the diagnosis result is sent through a wireless transceiver to the central control unit. Moreover, in order to reach a real autonomous operation, the sensor power is approached by different energy harvesting solutions.

The mechanical strength of magnetic wedges is weak compared to the epoxy glass wedges, and many cases of loose and missing wedges have recently been increasingly reported. Magnetic wedge failure deteriorates the performance and reliability of the motor, but there is no method available for testing the wedge quality other than visual inspection after rotor removal. Monitoring of overall wedge condition without motor disassembly can help reduce the cost of maintenance and risk of degradation in performance. In this paper, a new off-line standstill test method for detecting magnetic wedge problems for ac machines without motor disassembly is proposed. An experimental study on 380 V, 5.5 kW and 6.6 kV, 3.4 MW motors with magnetic wedges is performed to verify the effectiveness of the new test method. It is shown that the new method can provide reliable monitoring of magnetic wedge problems over time, independent of other faults or motor design.

The spectral analysis identifies the fault signature modifying the sample frequency in the data acquisition system. The wavelet analysis maintains a constant sample frequency using MRA, which provides redundant information to identify the faults. Furthermore, the MRA analysis of ISP stator currents helps to identify small incipient faults choosing a threshold between the healthy and faulty machine. The cases considered are stator and rotor electric faults, which are modeled by means of parametric variations. In Spite of its simplicity, the model provides useful information for fault identification.	[Villalobos-Pina, F.

Large synchronous machines are typically designed with parallel connected windings in order to split the currents in parallel paths, delivering the total power at the terminals. Under ideal symmetrical conditions, no current will circulate between parallel branches of the same phase. However, when a motor fault breaks this symmetry, currents circulate between the branches. Thus, due to the fact that they are only non-zero under faulty conditions, circulating currents potentially represent a sensitive indicator of faulty condition. In this paper, the advantages of using the circulating current between parallel branches of the stator of a synchronous motor as an early indicator of motor faults are shown. Analysis is conducted both through simulation, via the use of finite element methods (FEM), and through experimentation using a specially-designed synchronous machine which allows various fault conditions to be investigated. Through comparison between experiment and simulation, the simulation tool is validated. Furthermore, it is shown that the circulating current is better suited for fault detection than either the branch or the stator current. It is concluded that an improved condition monitoring and protection system for a synchronous machine may be achieved if these currents are monitored.

Detecting High-Resistance Connection Asymmetries in Inverter Fed AC Drive Systems	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	fault detection; wiring system; high resistance connections; induction machine; inverter fed		The wiring system between inverter and the machine consists of different parts connected by metal-to-metal joints. High load currents lead to an increase temperature of the connections and higher material degradation. Basically, these effects result in an increased resistance in one phase. If such faults are not identified timely an unexpected outage of the whole system can be a consequence. However, the degree of reliability of the wiring system should not be less than that of the machine or inverter. Detecting such small resistance incensement provide the possibility to react timely on the occurred fault. In this paper a method is presented to detect open-circuit faults in the stator windings of an inverter fed drive. The method gets along with the hardware already present and doesn't need additional sensors etc. By applying voltage phasor steps to the machine terminals and measuring the resulting current the phase resistance can be estimated. By combination of the current direction with the phase resistance value resistance phasors can introduced. With these phasors a high sensitive fault indicator is generated able to detect connection fault severity and position. Measurements on a laboratory test stand for different fault configurations prove the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method.	[Stojcic, G.; Wolbank, T.

Fault-Tolerant Converter for AC Drives using Vector-Based Hysteresis Current Control	2013 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 27-30, 2013	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales, Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Power Elect Soc, Generalitat Valenciana, Conselleria Educacio, Cultura Esport, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Siemens	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Escuela Tecnica Super Ingn Industriales	Condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; fault tolerance; power semiconductor switches; pulse width modulation converters; semiconductor device reliability; variable speed drives	POWER ELECTRONIC CONVERTERS; 4-SWITCH 3-PHASE INVERTERS; REDUCED SWITCH COUNT; MOTOR-DRIVES; PMSM DRIVE; RELIABILITY; ALGORITHMS; DIAGNOSIS; STRATEGY; SYSTEMS	This paper presents a fault-tolerant converter intended for AC regenerative drives requiring improved reliability and availability. The standard six-switch three-phase converter is rearranged in order to obtain a four-switch tree-phase converter (FSTPC) during post-fault operation. Thus, its performance relies heavily on the fault diagnostic technique to trigger the remedial procedures, and on the control strategy to guarantee proper post-fault operation of the drive. With the aim to achieve these two goals effectively without increasing significantly the control system complexity, it is proposed to integrate, into the drive controller, a new and simple voltage-based approach for open-circuit fault diagnosis (without additional sensors), and vector-based hysteresis current control of the FSTPC. The performance of proposed fault-tolerant converter is evaluated by means of experimental results with a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive.	[Freire, Nuno M.
