Traditional RUL estimation models are built on sufficient prior knowledge of critical components degradation process which is not easily available in most situation. With the development of integrated circuit and sensor technique, data-driven approaches show good potential on RUL estimation. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for RUL estimation, which can make full use of the sensor date sequence in bidirection. By visualized analysis of the hidden layers, the model can expose hidden patterns with sensor data of multiple working conditions, fault patterns and degradation model. With experiment using C-MAPSS dataset, BiLSTM approach for RUL estimation outperforms other traditional approaches for RUL estimation.

However, major challenge is the selection of the handcrafted statistical features, which limit performance of the classifiers immensely. Deep learning, a feature representation based method opens up a new horizon, where feature descriptors are extracted from the raw signals. This paper has exploited merit of deep learning and reports a preliminary findings in motor fault detection using novel semi 2D Convolution Neural Networks. The experimental results of the proposed approach show 3-10% enhanced performance compared to the conventional feature engineering based methods. The computation is relatively faster than 2D Convolution Neural Networks and the generalization of the results is promising for real life applications.

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is an effective way to ensure the battery reliability. The loss of actual capacity of a battery is usually used to reflect the battery RUL. However, the capacity degradation is complex and non-linear. For the longer capacity prediction horizon, the accuracy of traditional methods becomes lower which would cause error in RUL prognosis. To address this problem, this paper proposed a deep belief networks (DBN) method for lithium-ion battery RUL prediction. The proposed method is trained with historical battery capacity data. With the powerful fitting ability of DBN, the proposed method can track capacity degradation and predict the RUL. Experiments are conducted based on commercial lithium-ion batteries. The results show that the proposed method has high accuracy in capacity fade prediction and RUL prediction.

When employing characteristic parameter monitoring method to implement radar fault prediction, the predictability measurement of the observation sequence should be solved first to ensure that the conclusion is valid and credible. Firstly, the composition of the radar performance monitoring sensor network, the characteristics of the performance parameter monitoring sequence and the applicable ARMA modeling prediction algorithm were introduced. Then a method was proposed to determine the predicting time advance applicable for the parameter observation sequences based on phase space reconstruction theory and chaos analysis. The method constructs the optimal embedding space and restores the dynamic characteristics of performance degradation of radar, by which the maximum predictable number of steps based on the largest Lyapunov exponent can be calculated to determine whether the performance observation parameters can be predicted. Furthermore, scientific basis of determining a valid time advance can be provided. Finally, the experimental analysis of radar signal-to-noise ratio parameter observation sequences was carried out, indicating that the proposed method is effective for radar equipment.

The spacing of the planet gears related to the rotating carrier plate is unequal, because of the crack on the planetary carrier. In this paper, the time domain synchronous averaging method is utilized to detect the fault. This method tends to eliminate any machining error and frequency components not concerned with carrier crack. And then, observation of spectrum sidebands is employed to extract cracked planetary carrier fault features.

In this work, we have explored the degradation of Power MOSFETs due to thermal cycling and used the ON-resistance variation as the failure precursor for prognosis. The particle filter algorithm has been adopted for this purpose and the drawbacks of these algorithms such as particle degeneracy and particle impoverishment have been dealt with. An independent Gaussian jitter noise is purposely added to the resampled particle with the intention of roughening. The results indicate an improvement in accuracy over the standard particle filter algorithm. The impact of different degrees of roughening on the accuracy of RUL prediction is explored and the performance is evaluated using prognostic metrics such as relative accuracy and computational time.

The particle filter (PF) algorithm has proved to be an effective method for prognostics. However, the PF algorithm suffers from serious particle degeneracy and particle impoverishment problems. Most of the studies in the literature focus on solving the particle degeneracy problem but at a heavy computational cost. In this study, we aim to explore the time efficient Partial Stratified Resampling algorithm which can be used for online state estimation problems and compare it with conventional Stratified Resampling algorithms. The accuracy and precision of the algorithms are validated using the lithium-ion battery data sets from CALCE (R) research group.

Normally, one has to resort to using sequential updating methods such as the particle filtering approach for effective prognosis and lumen maintenance life prediction of LEDs because of their long lifetime and reliability. However, the performance of the particle filter severely depends on the selection of the initial parameters. Moreover, it cannot deal with situations where there is missing data due to intermittent sensor failure or malfunction. The multi-task Gaussian process regression (MTGP) can model multiple correlated multivariate time series simultaneously. Thus, it can be used to learn the correlation between multiple degradation trends (from different similar units tested) even though they might be sampled at different frequencies and have training sets available only for different time spans. This paper presents the multi output (task) Gaussian process regression as a solution for prognosis of lumen maintenance life of LED devices in the event of "missing" data. We analyze the performance of the MTGP on the LED data extracted from previously published studies and demonstrate that it can give good prediction results even when there are missing data.

Therefore, a quantitative analysis method of bearing fault is presented in this paper based on the unit of dynamic mechanism and feature extraction algorithm of vibration signal. Based on this method, vibration signals for different sizes of rolling bearing fault in the outer race were simulated using a dynamic bearing model with five freedom degrees. Then, the quantitative size feature was extracted from the vibration signals with an algorithm of fast spectral kurtosis (FSK) and quantitative diagnosis of rolling bearing fault was obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by practical defective bearing signals of different defective sizes.

A new feature extraction method for gearbox fault diagnosis integrating singular value decomposition (SVD) with multidimensional scaling (MDS) is proposed in this article. SVD is used to extract the singular components (SCs), which reflect the main energy of the vibration signal, and the kurtosis values of SCs are calculated to detect the fault sensitivity of each singular value. The kurtosis-weighted singular values are applied to classify different conditions of gearbox supplemented by the MDS and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) method. Five gearbox operating conditions including tooth breakage, tooth pitting, gear eccentricity and normal are simulated to test the performance of proposed feature extraction method in an experiment rig. Partition coefficient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) are used to evaluate the classification effect of weighted singular values. The result suggests that the proposed kurtosis-weighted singular values perform better in distinguishing the different conditions of gearbox than original singular values.

While under normal operating conditions, bearings often run under variable rotational speed conditions especially when the machine starts and stops or there is a speed fluctuation with bearing fault. Under such circumstances the bearing signal is non-stationary, which makes the traditional bearing fault diagnosis methods inapplicable. Thus, rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on synchroextracting transform is proposed. Spectral kurtosis is used to find the optimal frequency band, based on which a band pass filter is designed. Then the synchroextracting transform is applied to the band-pass filtered signal to get the time-varying frequency demodulated spectrum and extract the fault features. Through the time-varying frequency demodulated spectrum, rolling element bearing fault can be diagnosed without resampling. The method proposed is illustrated by numerical simulated signal analysis, and is further validated via lab experimental rolling bearing vibration signal analyses.

In this paper, we propose two deep learning models to solve feature extraction problem and faults diagnosis problem. First model is based on Auto-Encoder (AE) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). AE is used to reduce the dimensions of original signal and efficiently extract features. Then the extracted features are classified as the input of SVM. Second model is based on Convolution Neural Network (CNN), we propose a 1D-CNN model to process the original bearing vibration signal and directly output the type of fault. These models have yielded good results on the milling datasets and CWRU bearing dataset respectively. This paper verified the feasibility of these methods, summarized the application experiences and obtained their performance indicators as a benchmark for research.

Among various induction machine faults, failure of the bearing is considered as the leading cause of the shutdown of the industries and accounted approximately 41%. It is characterized by persisting of vibration signal which is usually very low in amplitude and associated with frequencies. An investigation has been carried out on enhancing the diagnostic relevance of vibration measurement using the identification of representative features and classification of damage, the location of damage and severity of damage. To fulfill the purpose, a hybrid feature pool has been prepared using calculated features from time, frequency, and time-frequency domain. In feature pool, there are total forty-six features which have been calculated and the optimal features have been selected using principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) from feature pool. The representative features are input to the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) Classifier. The performance of classifier has been compared.	[Patel, Raj Kumar; Giri, V.

It is therefore vital to research lung cancer prognosis prediction model. From the characteristics of cancer data samples, we consider the unbalanced category data. Due to the small number of samples, one of the commonly used over-sampling techniques is selected, which is an improved Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE) to expand a few types of samples. For labeling the dataset by 5-year survival time, support vector machines (SVM) and Cox-proportional hazard regression model (COX) were used for training and calculating, respectively. The results show that the performance of the proposed prognosis model based on SVM is better. Similarly, 2-year survival time as the standard for labeling the dataset, the experimental results also show that the performance of the proposed model is better, which verifies the validity and reliability of the designed model.

However, in some low speed condition, the fault signal is weak and overwhelmed by the strong noise. It is hard to extract fault signal information effectively. To handle this problem, a vibration signal filtering method based on Kullback-Liebler (KL) divergence genetic algorithm (GA) is presented. This method employs binary string of GA to match the frequency of fault signal frequency spectrum. Based on the KL divergence as GA fitness function, the signal similarity between normal condition and the KL divergence GA filtered signal is evaluated and GA employs genetic operations to obtain the optimal noise binary string. After that, negating this optimal noise binary string can obtain optimal fault signal binary string, which will then be multiplied by diagnosis vibration signal frequency spectrum, to yield a new frequency spectrum that only has fault components. Based on envelope demodulation method and hearing fault characteristic frequency, the effective and advanced performance of the proposed method is evaluated by three different rolling bearing faults in low speed bearing vibration signal.

So it should be identified and take the preventive measure. Machine Learning is a fast and computational method which can easily detect any faults in the pumping system. Still now lots of work has been done on a detection of fault in the pumping system, but mainly those work has done based on vibration details and variation of speed. The paper presents how by the help of machine learning algorithm by varying the speed and pressure cavitation can be identified. It is the comparative study between how the vibration and speed together affects the cavitation result and variation of speed and pressure affects the cavitation. Support Vector Machine is one of the classification methods in machine learning algorithm where it can be easily classified the cavitation problem. So this paper analyses how the method of SVM can more efficiently detect the cavitation problem with the centrifugal water pump.	[Dutta, Nabanita; Umashankar, S.; Shankar, Arun V.

The supportive actions of these elements necessitate correctly identifying and isolating faulty section. The fault or an unwanted disturbance can create transient in the system which, if not identified and consequently not been removed, can cause serious damage to the various system components. This paper considers a synchronized phasor measurement based protection scheme which first identifies faulty section then classifies different types of fault. This will provide a quick solution to isolate a faulty section. The proposed algorithm is investigated on 39-bus New England system and the results obtained are found to be promising.

This autonomous power-supply design allows the system to be easily coupled with several kinds of low power sensors to monitor ambient parameters such as temperature, humidity, vibrations and motion inside an industrial area. The device placed near a vibrating source can report data to a central device using the embedded Bluetooth Low Energy transceiver, or can be included inside a smart network.

Fault detection and isolation (FDI) techniques are used to detect failure and deal with them, avoiding losses on parts, tools or robots. However, FDI usually deals with the faults after or at the moment they occur. Thus, we propose a method that predicts potential failures online, based on the forces and torques signatures captured during the task. We demonstrate the approach experimentally using an industrial robot, equipped with a force-torque sensor and a pneumatic gripper, used to align and thread nuts into bolts. All effort information is fed into a supervised machine learning algorithm, based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier. The network was able to predict and classify the threading task outcomes in 3 groups: mounted, not mounted or jammed. Our approach was able to reduce in 10.9% the threading task execution time when compared to a reference without FDI, but had problem to predict jammed cases. The same experiment was also performed with other two additional learning algorithms, and the results were systematically compared.	[Moreira, Guilherme R.; Lahr, Gustavo J.

The mechanical parts such as a motor, gear, bearing are the major components of a process industry and any fault in them may cause a total shutdown of the whole process, which may result in serious losses. Therefore it is very crucial to predict any approaching defects before its occurrence. Several methods exist for this purpose and many research are being carried out for better and efficient models. However, most of them are based on the processing of raw sensor signals, which is tedious and expensive. Recently, there has been an increase in the feature based condition monitoring, where only the useful features are extracted from the raw signals and interpreted for the prediction of the fault. Most of these are handcrafted features, where these are manually obtained based on the nature of the raw data. This of course requires the prior knowledge of the nature of data and related processes. This limits the feature extraction process. However, recent development in the autoencoder based feature extraction method provides an alternative to the traditional handcrafted approaches; however, they have mostly been confined in the area of image and audio processing. In this work, we have developed an automated feature extraction method for on-line condition monitoring based on the stack of the traditional autoencoder and an on-line sequential extreme learning machine (OSELM) network. The performance of this method is comparable to that of the traditional feature extraction approaches. The method can achieve 100% detection accuracy for determining the bearing health slates of NASA bearing dataset. The simple design of this method is promising for the easy hardware implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) based prognostics solutions.

Numerous studies targeting algorithms, software frameworks, and applications on the CAVs scenario have emerged. Meanwhile, several pioneer efforts have focused on the edge computing system and architecture design for the CAVs scenario and provided various heterogeneous platform prototypes for CAVs. However, a standard and comprehensive application benchmark for CAVs is missing, hindering the study of these emerging computing systems. To address this challenging problem, we present CAVBench, the first benchmark suite for the edge computing system in the CAVs scenario. CAVBench is comprised of six typical applications covering four dominate CAVs scenarios and takes four datasets as standard input. CAVBench provides quantitative evaluation results via application and system perspective output metrics. We perform a series of experiments and acquire three systemic characteristics of the applications in CAVBench. First, the operation intensity of the applications is polarized, which explains why heterogeneous hardware is important for a CAVs computing system. Second, all applications in CAVBench consume high memory bandwidth, so the system should be equipped with high bandwidth memory or leverage good memory bandwidth management to avoid the performance degradation caused by memory bandwidth competition. Third, some applications have worse data/instruction locality based on the cache miss observation, so the computing system targeting these applications should optimize the cache architecture. Last, we use the CAVBench to evaluate a typical edge computing platform and present the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the benchmarking results.

However, it is still not optimal for uncertain systems, mainly since the model uncertainties usually have a significant effect on the reliability of the method. As an alternative solution, modeling with PCA for interval-valued data ensures a better monitoring by apprehending the sensor uncertainties and including them in the modeling phase. This article presents an extension of data-driven PCA fault detection to the case of interval-valued data. The PCA model is built based on the complete information principal component analysis (CIPCA) for interval-valued data, and different fault detection indices are generated based on the squared prediction error (SPE) statistic. A fault detection scheme is proposed based on squared interval norm of residuals vector. The performances of the proposed fault detection scheme are illustrated using a simulation example and a milling machine process, along with a Monte Carlo experiment for validation.

Processing these signals by Fourier transform and wavelet transform usually cannot obtain desired fault diagnosis results. In this paper, a machine fault diagnosis method based on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs), Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed, in which HHT and SVM are used for fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis respectively. The proposed fault diagnosis approach by SVM is implemented and tested on the IWSN sensor node, while the fault feature extraction method using HHT is verified by MATLAB simulation. The effectiveness of the presented approach is evaluated by a set of experiments using bearing vibration data. The result indicates that the fault diagnosis accuracy of the presented method reaches 100% for four machine working conditions and 92% for five working conditions.

The prior works on this specific topic have shown that in case of gear tooth localized fault, the amplitude of main torsional resonance frequency of the electromechanical system was amplified in the stator current space vector instantaneous frequency. Following this initial successful attempt, this work is conducted to establish a common procedure which defines the response of electrical signatures to the torsional vibrations induced by a fault located on the mechanical drive train. The most sensitive electrical signature can be considered for feature extraction and non-invasive torsional vibration analysis accordingly. An experimental setup based on a 250W three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine shaft-connected to a single-stage spur gear is utilized for validation of the proposed approach.

The improved wavelet packet analysis method is used to decompose the collected signals by multi-layer wavelet packet, reconstructed decomposition signal by single branch, extracting the wavelet packet energy entropy, formation of feature vectors for fault diagnosis, and using it as input to establish fault diagnosis model for GA optimized SVM to realize the status recognition of the rolling bearing. The experimental results show that this method has higher classification accuracy than the unmodified wavelet packet energy entropy, which can improve the accuracy of the state recognition of rolling bearings and effectively achieve the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.

When unexpected sensor measurements are produced, there is a need to detect and identify, in a timely manner, if they stem from a failure behavior or if they indeed represent some environment-related process. Existing solutions for fault detection in environmental sensor networks do not portray the required sensitivity for the differentiation of these processes or they are unable to meet the time constraints of the affected cyber-physical systems. We have been developing a framework for dependable detection of failures in harsh environments monitoring systems, aiming to improve the overall sensor data quality. Herein we present the application of an early framework implementation to an aquatic sensor network dataset, using neural networks to model sensors' behaviors, correlated data between neighbor sensors, and a statistical technique to detect the presence of outliers in the datasets.

Here, we will discuss the diagnostic and prognostic value of (multi-) omics panels in general. We will have a closer look at breast cancer subtyping and treatment outcome, as case example, using gene expression panels - and we will discuss the current "best practice" in the light of critical statistical considerations. Afterwards, we will introduce computational approaches for network-based medicine aka. systems medicine. We will discuss novel developments in graph-based machine learning using examples ranging from Huntington's disease mechanisms via lung cancer drug target discovery back to where we started, i.e. breast cancer subtyping and treatment optimization - but now from a systems medicine point of view. We conclude that systems medicine and modern artificial intelligence open new avenues to shape future medicine.

Models also may aid in the evaluation of treatments and interventions. A number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various cancer prediction models. Meanwhile, gene selection is very important for cancer classification. We need to deal with high-dimensional gene space and few samples. But the epistasis means that some genes maybe cover or affect other genes. Fuzzy measure can describe the interaction between genes very well. In this article, we proposed one new model based on fuzzy integral with respect to fuzzy measure for cancer prediction with sparse genes. We can obtain a group of combinations of genes with the highest fuzzy measure values. The new method is applied to two cancer data for testifying the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed model has the highest testing accuracy and F-score by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods.

Until now, the Palliative Prognostic Index (PPI) has been used for survival prediction systems. Therefore, in this study, we extracted prognostic factors using machine learning and Random Forest regression and created survival prediction systems using new factors (i.e., based on those extracted) that cannot be used for long-term prediction in PPI. Results show that the new prediction systems yielded higher accuracies than PPI.

It is possible to increase the efficiency of machines which operate with light load levels for extended periods of time by reducing the flux level. The dynamic response of the FOC will depend in this case on the capability of the control to magnetize rotor when the torque must be increased. Such capability can be seriously compromised due to the inverter current limits, as well as due to voltage limits which can affect to the current regulator transient response. A method to improve the transient response of the drive under current constraints is proposed in this paper.

Therefore, fault detection and elimination in electric drive systems is necessary for safety-critical applications in order not to cause catastrophic failure to the machine in a short time. This paper reviews recent fault detection and diagnosis techniques that use signal analysis, model-based techniques and artificial intelligence machine diagnosis methods. Then, feed-forward neural network will be trained, tested and validated whether or not this artificial neural network can classified healthy and different severity inter-turn short circuit levels by using per unit RMS 3 phases current and voltage quantities as well as fundamental and third harmonic components of current and voltage.

The volume depicted by these cells represents the Infarction volume. This volume defines some of the very sensitive treatment decisions that the neurosurgeon has to make; (a) perform a hemicraniectomy? and (b) Prognosis of this surgery's outcome? Current clinical practice does not provide the surgeons with the answers to the above questions. In this paper, a strategy has been presented that utilizes the Infarction Growth Rate (IGR) as the key element in defining the infarction volume reaching critical levels such that a surgery is inevitable within 48 hours. As a current practice, the stroke lesion growth is most frequently assumed linear, or logarithmic. In this paper, a Machine Learning perspective is presented for mapping the infarction volume using several critical clinical parameters into a possible volumetric prediction in time. The same approach is then used for predicting whether the surgery will be needed soon or not, as well as what might be the likelihood of patient's health in a post-surgery state. In this paper, a machine learning platform is presented which is based on the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System [ANFIS], and has been re-structured such that it can predict IGR and IV with reasonable accuracy, over wide time range. ANFIS hypothesize relationships within the data, and newer learning is able to produce complex characterizations of those relationships. The study was conducted on real stroke-registry database from the local hospital and has shown over 90% accurate prediction.

The detecting operation in an EV is simplified by a comparably slow acceleration of the machine rotor. Especially steady-state limited frequency-based approach could benefit from this fact, which consequently will be investigated. Finally, both methods will be applied to an EV drive and the results discussed.

Although induction motor have rugged structure, but still they are most oftenly subjected to unexpected mode of failure because of long operational duty without any predictive maintenance. Consequently, motors have to face various faults, among these faults the beating faults are consider the major problem, if bearing faults are unnoticed at incipient stage, they will result in catastrophic damage to the motor. Therefore, predictive condition monitoring techniques should be introduced which continuously monitor the health of the bearing. The main objective of this paper is to identify and classify bearing localized and distributed defects at Inner for the various levels of fault severity. The conventional statistical analysis based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA), instantaneous power analysis (IPA), and vibrational analysis were unable to classify or discriminate bearing localized defects. Moreover, does not shed any light on the segregation of distributed defects. Hence, this paper present a new method known as autonomous fault identification and fault segregation based on current analysis. The proposed technique use current analysis method. The wellknown combination of Park Vector Analysis (PVA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been carried out to identify and classify the exact class of the bearing faults. In addition, the method is justified through hardware test rig, which was design through this research. Moreover, the results shows that the features of PVA, which are utilized by AI are not only sensitive to diagnose the faults but at the same time they are capable enough to segregate each class of bearing fault. The proposed method can be used a condition monitoring index, which may be generalized to other rotational machines in any industry.

Application of Prognostics and Health Management to Low Demand Systems: Use of Condition Data to Help Determine Function Test Interval	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT (IEEE IEEM)	International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management IEEM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEE IEEM)	DEC 16-19, 2018	Bangkok, THAILAND	IEEE, IEEE TEMS Thailand Chapter, IEEE TEMS Singapore Chapter, IEEE TEMS Hong Kong Chapter		Llow demand system; prognostics and health management; failure rate; function test interval; asset engineering		Many safety instrumented systems (SIS) such as emergency shut down (ESD) are designed as low demand systems, whose functionalities are only triggered under certain conditions once or fewer times a year. Reliability levels of several critical low demand systems were observed to be high on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) over the last 15 years [1]. In general terms, there is a lack of confidence in whether the functionality of a low demand system can be initiated and how well the system can perform upon a real demand. This paper studies such challenges and suggests the application of prognostics and health management (PHM) to evaluate the function test interval instead of remaining useful lifetime. The value of condition data is justified and reflected in the estimation of failure rate and function test interval. The application of PHM to low demand systems can help enhance a company's confidence in system availability and operational reliability and its adherence to a predictive maintenance practice.

Classification algorithms have been widely used in the fields of financial risk identification, fault diagnosis, medical diagnosis, etc. However, the datasets are often unbalanced in these cases and the original methods fail to classify instances correctly. Many methods such as over-sampling, under-sampling and ensemble methods were raised to improve the classifier's performance, but which one to choose for a certain dataset still remains a problem. Therefore, this paper aims at a experimental conclusion on which kind of method can perform best on unbalanced classification problems generally. In detail, we evaluated the performances of 13 kinds of methods for unbalanced classification on several unbalanced datasets which have different amounts of instances and different ratios of positive instances, and finally came to a conclusion.

First, the feature is extracted using wavelet packet transform, and the sample entropy value of each band obtained by decomposition is used as the feature vector. Secondly, the IPSO algorithm is used to optimize the tow structural parameters of SVM, penalty and Gaussian kernel coefficients. Finally, a fault classification model for rolling bearing is established. Results showed that the fault diagnosis classification model based on wavelet packet transform and IPSO-SVM has higher accuracy.	[Zhong, Y. X.; Fan, H. L.; Lu, J.

In this paper, we propose a remote automatic diagnose failure method that uses PV string data. Some string measurement devices are used for continuous remote monitoring of solar power panels. Solar panels generate low power due to panels breaking, shadows from structures, weeds, etc. If these failures can be classified by fault classification using remote string measurement data, a reduction in unnecessary repair actions and more efficient preparations are possible. We use machine learning to automatically classify causes of decreased solar power generation, such as broken panels, shadows, or weeds. We applied this diagnosis method to some large solar plants. The results of our experiment proved that the learning accuracy of this proposed method is 100%. When we tested this classification method in another solar plant, the classification accuracy was 99%. This result suggests that this diagnosis method is useful and can decrease maintenance work.

Its effective implementation enables an unobtrusive method of diagnosis, reducing costs and increasing safety. Conventional methods of analysis rely on the extraction of knowledge-driven, time-based features from the trace, followed by diagnosis through an expert system. Many utility companies rely on the automated feature extraction capabilities provided within the trip coil current recorder. This paper highlights markers of potentially poor circuit breaker health missed when relying solely on such time-based analysis. A supplementary, data-driven method focusing on identifying such cases using machine learning techniques is introduced and demonstrated in this paper. Additionally, attention is drawn to the susceptibility of incorrect feature extraction by the recorders when subject to some of the explained current-based abnormalities.

These particularities are most evident in the unavoidable influence of the machine environment which is reflected through a mixture of the useful diagnostic material with surrounding sounds. On the other hand, there are several obvious advantages of this approach. For instance, a recording microphone can be installed at a certain distance from the tested object, ensuring the complete non-invasiveness of the measuring process. This paper analyses the influence of the surrounding environment in audio-based On-Load Tap Changer transformer diagnostics as well as the ability to apply statistical methods for the purpose of extracting useful diagnostic material that can be used for its condition assessment.

This element is very important for the maintenance of the machine and for the detection of machine faults. The presence of a rolling fault in the machines can affect the overall performance of the machine. For this reason, the bearing faults must be diagnosed in order to be monitored for the machine in a healthy manner. The generated vibration signals as a result of the machine's rolling action should be monitored in order to diagnosis the machine defects. It is assumed that the vibration signals are composed of large-scale features and noise components. The performance of traditional diagnostic methods is based on characterizing faulty vibration signals. The utility of traditional techniques requires signal processing, expert knowledge, and human effort. In the most basic sense, the diagnosis of defective vibration signals is based on a comparison of defective vibration signals to healthy signals. In this study, deep learning technology which has been applied to many fields in recent years has been used to detect defective vibration signals. The ability to learn the complex features of the deep learning architecture provides superiority over traditional diagnostics to fault diagnosis. In this study, four classes of vibration signals have been used as input data. Training and test data for each class have been created. These images have been then trained on the CNN model that has been developed in Keras deep learning library. This model has been developed to automatically diagnose vibration signals. The developed model produced results with high accuracy.

A sliding window based prediction is employed to continuously monitor the change in the SPEF components in pre-fault, during-fault and post-fault stages. A Stacked Potential Energy (SPE) matrix is introduced and subjected to Principal Component Sensitivity (PCS) to discern the effect of events by analyzing the upper and lower dimensional sub-spaces. The effectiveness of the proposed sequence of classification can be observed from the results on a 4-machine, 2-area test system, where a coherency can be noticed between types of events and the corresponding mappings in the respective SPEFs. Highly correlated energy functions can be sought-after by pointing at different events which may trigger some specific components of interconnected power systems.

Reasons for these deviations from the intended functionality can be found in the unpredictability of environmental conditions as well the intrinsic uncertainties of the Machine Learning (ML) functions used to make sense of this complex input space. In this paper, we propose a safety assurance case for a pedestrian detection function, a safety-relevant baseline functionality for an automated driving system.

This method is based on the analysis in frequency domain of the stator current envelope extracted by Hilbert transform. The proposed method, which is one of various demodulation techniques, is theoretically presented then experimentally validated by testing three different induction motors: one in a healthy condition, the second with one broken bar and the third with two broken bars. Each motor is subjected to three load conditions and supplied by voltage inverter which operates at different frequencies. The main results obtained by spectrum analysis of the stator current envelope are compared with these of the traditional MCSA method. The proposed method can successfully detect the fault under various operational situations, even for the lightly load, which makes it more suitable for induction motor fault diagnosis.

The aim is to ensure an accurate condition monitoring and reduced false or missed alarms rate for induction motor operating in critical applications. It investigates the combination of features selection methods with the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) neural network in a fault detection and severity evaluation system. This approach, based on the current analysis, uses multiple features extraction techniques, where the zero crossing times (ZCT) signal and the envelope are extracted from the three-phase stator currents. Then, statistical and frequency domains features are calculated from these extracted signals. The ReliefF feature selection technique is used to select from the extracted features the most sensitive and relevant ones. Next, the SOM neural network is used as a decision-making system. The experimental investigations, conducted using a healthy machine and a machine with broken bars, show the effectiveness of the proposed fault detection technique in terms of the classification accuracy.

First, we installed a three-axis accelerometer sensor on a domestic milling machine with different health conditions. Then in the experimental project, we completed the data acquisition of the 4-step speed, and used the waterfall map to achieve the purpose of data visualization. In signal analysis, we perform data mining for the speed, frequency and amplitude of the frequency domain. Finally, the fuzzy inference system is used to construct the decision mechanism, and the representativeness of the input parameters is weighed by the weight of the rules. From the experimental results, the FIS-based PHM method can effectively identify the spindle motor state and predict the trend of health deterioration from the frequency characteristics.

However, these methods require a lot of manual design of fault features, which needs domain knowledge that makes these methods difficult to generalize. This paper presents a deep contractive auto-encoding network (DCAEN) for machinery fault diagnosis, which is constructed by contractive auto-encoder (CAE), i.e., an unsupervised learning way for feature extraction. In addition, we add a sparsity constraint to the loss function of CAE for removing the redundant information. With the help of deep learning, this model can automatically extract features from raw data without artificially constructing features. In order to validate the superiority of the model, we conduct experiments and compare the model to existing methods with a rolling bearing dataset.

Due to advances in automotive technology such as autonomous driving and further connectivity, the complexity of vehicles and their subsystems increases continuously. As a consequence, models and rule-based systems for fault detection become more complex and require more extensive implementation effort and expert knowledge not only within but also across several domains. Besides, vehicles produce rich amounts of data including valuable information for fault detection. These amounts cannot fully be considered by current fault detection approaches. Deep neural networks offer promising capabilities to address these challenges by allowing automated model generation for fault detection without extensive domain knowledge using vast amounts of in-vehicle data. Hence, in this work a data-driven automotive diagnostics approach to fault detection with deep neural networks is proposed in two steps. First, a novel data-driven diagnostics process to learn data-driven algorithms on in-vehicle data is presented. Second, as a key element of this process, a novel fault detection model is proposed using a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks. To demonstrate the suitability for fault detection, the model is evaluated on internal engine control unit signals for pre-ignition detection in high-pressure turbocharged petrol engines. A classical machine learning processing pipeline and each neural network type separately are used as baselines for a performance comparison. Results show that the proposed model is a promising approach to data-driven automotive diagnostics outperforming all implemented baselines.

Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation technology is used to assess the current health status and make effective maintenance plans for engines. How to estimate RUL accurately to increasing the reliability and safety of systems is a challenge issue. However, the existing estimation methods focus on single size sequence. To address it, this paper proposes a remaining useful life prediction model based on hybrid long-short sequences for engines. For long sequence, long shortterm memory neural network is used to predict RUL by mining smoothed data potential association rules. For short sequence, time window is used to determine the size of short-term sequence, and a direct relation between engine state and RUL is modeled by gradient boosting regression. Finally, back propagation neural network is used to analyze the RUL results of long sequence and short sequence to obtain hybrid sequence prediction result. The proposed model is implemented in a turbofan engine degradation dataset, and the experimental result demonstrate the proposed model is better than other in terms of accuracy.

Faults in RPS increase railway costs of operation and maintenance, and cause delays and even train accidents. Prognostic and health management (PHM) technique can reduce the risks of equipment due to its powerful ability of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. However, RUL prediction for RPS is a challenging task due to the difficulty of identifying the state for each operating phase related with specific failure modes (FMs) and constructing a comprehensive degradation state from the selected features. To cope with this challenge, this study presents a novel framework for the RUL prediction of RPS. Specifically, a segmentation approach of the power signals is first proposed by constructing an optimization model, in order to identify the FM-related operating phases. Then, a construction method of the health index (HI) is put forward to obtain the comprehensive degradation information by fusing the selected features, which indicate the partial information of the degradation state, and are extracted with popular approaches of feature extraction. Next, the RUL prediction model is developed based on the constructed HIs. Final, this framework is evaluated using the monitoring data of RPS collected from China Railway Guangzhou Group. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RUL prediction framework is very effective for RPS.

In order to provide an appropriate maintenance for the turbofan engine to improve the reliability of the system, it is necessary to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the engine. In this paper, a data-based RUL prediction method is proposed using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). To capture more degradation information, the time window of row data and runtime of the turbofan engine are used as inputs to the proposed method after normalization. LightGBM works very well with these high-dimensional inputs and the model is easy to interpret. Moreover, LightGBM is insensitive to noise and can deal with redundant information in the time-window size data, which facilitate the application of the proposed method to turbofan engines. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are performed on C-MAPSS datasets provided by NASA, and the high prognostic accuracy is obtained. By comparing with the existing methods using the same dataset, the promising prospects of the proposed method in industry applications are illustrated.

Increasing amount of data has been collected for patients, such as genome, transcriptome, prognosis, and histology images of the tumor. While previous studies have used mostly mutation profiles miRNA and ctRNA for cancer prognosis, we are interested in evaluating the use of expression levels of candidate genes in cancer prognosis. We used gene expression of 45 candidate genes in breast cancer as an example and showed the effectiveness of using such multivariate expression data in cancer prognosis to predict 5-year survivorship. Applying machine learning techniques, we were able to predict survivorship from expression data alone without incorporating any other information. Our example study urges such expression data to be collected for patients by hospitals, research institutes in the future.

The five circuits allow the calculation of stator and rotor fault-related currents, in form of 2(p +/- 1)-pole space vectors for 2p-pole machines. The formal calculation of fault-related currents is very useful to define fault indicators and tools for diagnosis, and in case of parallel-connected stators (like in many wind generators) the split-phase current signature analysis becomes viable. In fact, by reversing the equations linking split-phase current amplitudes and eccentricity degrees, original fault indicators are carried out in this paper. The new indicators are validated by simulations of a 1800kW wind induction generator with static, dynamic, and mixed faults in full-load conditions. The simulations are carried out by using a full FEA model of the motor, implemented by time-stepping FEM-circuit co-simulation software (Maxwell-Simplorer). A good match is obtained between theoretical calculations and simulations.

To synthesise the flux observer for this machine, we use a third order model for induction machines expressed in term of complex differential equations. Since the equation of the rotor speed of the induction motor is complicated to analyse, we replace it by its behavioural model for the design of the flux observer. Moreover, we use the synthesised observer in order to investigate the effects of two common types of faults (i.e. voltage sag and the stator inter-turn short-circuit) that can occur in these machines. The validity of the proposed methodology is assessed via simulation results using a model of the induction motor.

The main concern of HEVs is their reliability and availability; hence, the ability to detect malfunction at early stage or before it occurs is a must. To assure their proper operation, most researches in the field of fault detection, head toward prognosis being the best alternative among the available maintenance strategies and actions. In this paper, the thermal finite element model will be used to detect and localize the presence of turn to turn short circuit at its early stage. A suggestion for localizing temperature sensors, in the electrical machine, will be presented.

A New Harmonic-based Protection structure for Meshed Microgrids	2018 IEEE POWER & ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING (PESGM)	IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-Power-and-Energy-Society General Meeting (PESGM)	AUG 05-10, 2018	Portland, OR	IEEE Power & Energy Soc		Fault detection; isolation; harmonic injection; Relay coordination; support vector machine (SVM)		This paper presents a novel harmonic-based overcurrent relay which detects and isolates three-phase faults in a meshed microgrid. The harmonic signals are generated by two Distributed Generators (DGs) which each of them communicate with its adjacent DG. In the first step, a set of features are extracted from DG output signal and then fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect occurrence of fault. Once the fault is detected, based on minimum voltage measured by DG, two closest DGs will recognize and these two DGs inject two distinct harmonics to activate harmonic-based relays. As each set of relays located at either beginning or end of each section is activated by current with specific frequency, these relays behave like directional relays without using voltage transformers. As a result, the proposed method is cost-effective solution. The optimum Time Dial Settings (TDSs) of these relays are obtained by solving a coordination problem with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Real-time results are taken by OPAL-RT to show the effectiveness of the proposed method for two different locations of fault in a meshed microgrid.

Active distribution systems interconnecting distributed energy resources (DERs), including generation and storage, along their feeders create new challenges in terms of power system protection. Among other issues, most DERs are interfaced with the grid by means of power electronic converters, which have low short-circuit contributions. This makes it difficult to detect certain types of faults and to selectively isolate the faulty sections. The proposed solution utilizes data for applied intelligence in microgrid protection system design and implementation to ensure reliable protection under different microgrid configurations and operating conditions. It shows that detection features acquired from conventional protective relay measurements are sufficient for machine-learning-based prediction models in microgrid fault detection. A detection feature subset in each microgrid operation mode is suggested, meanwhile, the performance of six types of learning algorithms are evaluated in this paper.

Unlike most existing pattern recognition methods for transient stability prediction, a conservative prediction model for power system transient stability is proposed in this paper, aiming at improving accuracy when predicting the unstable cases. The model is established as an ensemble learning model using multiple Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as sub-learning machines. The generator power angle, rotor speed and the bus voltage amplitudes within a few fundamental cycles after the clearance of the fault, are used as the input features. A proof of the conservatism of the proposed method is also presented based on the conditional probability theory. Numerical tests with the New England 39-bus test system, show that the prediction accuracy for unstable cases is 98.26%, which are at least 2.5% higher than those from six comparative models. The proposed model is more conservative to provide reliable information for potential on-line stability or emergency control applications.

PMU tend to provide tens of measurements per second, therefore automated anomaly detection is required; especially for use in real or near-time applications by power system operators. This paper demonstrates a method of detecting local anomalies in PMU data utilizing multiple linear regression. A window of near-time data is employed to generate a regression function that predicts the live data that arrives. If the error between the observed and predicted values exceeds a threshold an exception is noted. The threshold is dynamically updated based on the error in the regression function, allowing the method to work equally well on data of varying regularity. This anomaly detection method is not tuned to particular events and should detect novel occurrences. The method is evaluated on two numerical case studies, the real data was collected from PMUs placed on the Irish power system.

However, traditional systems such as those in building management are vertically integrated and do not use a standard schema. A typical building can consist of thousands of data points. Third party vendors who seek to deploy applications like fault diagnosis need to manually map the building information into a common schema. This mapping process requires deep domain expertise and a detailed understanding of intricacies of each building's system. Our framework - Scrabble - reduces the mapping effort significantly by using a multi-stage active learning mechanism that exploits the structure present in a standard schema and learns from buildings that have already been mapped to the schema. Scrabble uses conditional random fields with transfer learning to represent unstructured building information in a reusable intermediate representation. This reusable representation is mapped to the schema using a multilayer perceptron. Our novel semantic model based active learning mechanism requires only minimal input from domain experts to interpret esoteric, idiosyncratic data points. We have evaluated Scrabble on five buildings with thousands of different entities and our method outperforms prior work by 59%/162% higher Accuracy/Macro-averaged-F1 in a building when 10 examples are provided by an expert in both cases. Scrabble achieves 99% Accuracy with 100-160 examples for buildings with thousands of points while the other baselines cannot.

The wealth of data opens new opportunities for extracting knowledge through data-driven modeling of occupant presence and actions. In particular, the many opportunities with machine learning techniques including supervised and unsupervised learning for classification, regression and clustering problems. Utilizing these opportunities creates new models and information relevant for generating new knowledge on multi-aspect environmental exposure, building interfaces, human behaviour, occupant-centric building design and operation. Subtask 2 of the new IEA EBC Annex 79 is addressing these opportunities and is inviting researchers and practitioners to participate. The developed data-driven models can, among others, be applied for example for calculating new schedules or models based on the actual conditions observed in buildings, data-driven analysis of the performance design versus the built, model predictive controls for buildings and fault detection and diagnostics.

Prediction of Railway Vehicles' Dynamic Behavior with Machine Learning Algorithms	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Track Assessment; Performance Based Maintenance	TRACK GEOMETRY; PERFORMANCE; NETWORK	The dynamic performance of railway vehicles needs to be carefully monitored to ensure their safe operation. Presently a number of systems such as the Vehicle Track Interaction Monitor and the Instrumented Revenue Vehicles, utilize a number of on-board inertial sensors to obtain near-real time information on the dynamic performance of railway vehicles. These systems provide rich data sets that give an indication of the underlying track condition and the corresponding dynamic response. This paper outlines the use of Machine learning to develop dynamic behavior predictive models for railway vehicles from measured data. This study worked on the development of 2 types of predictive models, viz. regression and classification model. The regression model predicted the time series dynamic response amplitude and the classification model classified the track sections based on the response distribution over it. Train speed and parameters estimated from the unsprung mass were used as predictors in the model. After the trial of a number of predictive models the Ensemble Tree Bagger method was found to have highest overall prediction accuracy. These predictive models can be utilized as a decision making tool to determine safe operational limits and prioritize maintenance interventions.

Ensuring the reliability of motor and timely identifying the fault type of motor can guarantee the properly working and prevent the great loss. In this paper, a turn-to-turn short circuit of motor stator and unbalance power supply fault diagnosis system based on Deep Sparse Auto-Encoder and Soft-max Classifier is proposed. The selection of neural network parameters and their influence are systematic given. A new method where dropout rates of Sparse Auto-Encoder are various in each layer is adopted to increase the stability and convergence speed of training process. Finally, the proposed system is applied to an experiment on a motor in laboratory. The conclusion shows the ability to identify the fault type of motor at the continuous state that the accuracy reaches 100%, when only the data from motor at discrete state point are used in training, which makes the system extensible and promising.

Tray loader section is not only a mechanical link but also an important process link for battery scale production,having a strong process beat requirements. Guaranteeing the correctness of the tray loader section can largely guarantee the correctness of the follow-up process of the automated production of power battery. But,the diagnostic efficiency is very low when the fault diagnosis method is applied to the loading section at this stage. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of the tray loader machine, this paper uses the fault tree analysis method to establish the fault tree model of the loading section. According to this model, a fault diagnosis system based on the fault tree is developed to automatically collect,automatic analysis and automatic diagnosis the data of the loading section. The system has the characteristics of fast diagnosis and high diagnostic accuracy, and can proposed effective solution.

However, the limitations of traditional sensor, the diversity of failure and the complexity of expert knowledge used for mechanical fault diagnosis bring big challenges to online health monitoring and fault diagnosis of gantry crane. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors have been successfully applied to the online health monitoring of larger-scale structures including bridges, dams, petrochemical equipment, etc. This paper implements the online health monitoring of gantry crane by employing FGB sensors to collect strain data of the key points in the steel structure of gantry crane. We have achieved the online monitoring the gantry crane under a virtual reality environment on the platform of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Moreover, we have developed virtual reality system to study the establishing of 3D modeling and the dynamic monitoring of equipment. According the needs of users, this system could determine the health status of gantry cranes and foresee the security risks existing in the steel structures by stress analysis. In this way, the blind maintenance work can be reduced and the advanced predictive maintenance can combine with the technology of virtual reality to present a better monitoring result.

SVM does well in solving the few samples and nonlinear problem, which is suitable for the fault diagnosis of autopilot. To solve the overfitting and underfitting resulted from the improper parameters of SVM, multi-verse optimizer was applied to optimizing the parameters of SVM. By this way, a model of fault diagnosis with better performance was built. The simulation experiment results show that the accuracy of SVM based on MVO can achieve 98.3673% using 50 training samples. However, the accuracy of genetic algorithm (GA)-SVM achieves 91.0204% and the accuracy of SVM based on gravitational search algorithm (GSA) achieves 91.6327%. The simulation experiment results shows that SVM based on MVO has much better performance than others.

Before training the SVM classifier, feature extraction is an essential preprocessing step to enhance the identifiability of the fault samples. However, in the feature set, there exist the redundant and uncorrelated features, which have the inferior influence on the learning performance of the SVM classifier. Feature selection is to select the most representative feature subset to enhance the diagnosis accuracy. In addition, the penalty coefficient and kernel width parameter in SVM also impact the classification performance. Obviously, the selection of feature subset and SVM parameters can be considered as an optimization problem. Flower pollination algorithm (FPA) as a swarm intelligence optimization is derived from the pollination behavior of flowers. In this paper, we propose a novel binary version of FPA and then incorporate a cross search strategy based on chaos theory and cloud model into the novel BFPA to further enhance the solution quality, named BCCFPA. Moreover, different kinds of features are extracted by various wavelet basis functions based wavelet packet energy spectrum (wpes) and wavelet packet energy entropy (wpee) methods. The original feature set is built by combining these feature vectors. BCCFPA is used to simultaneously search the optimal feature subset and SVM parameters. The simulation experimental results prove that BCCFPA can effectively balance the diagnosis accuracy and the dimension of feature subset, and achieves the better diagnosis performance when compared with other methods.

Several fault types could occur in SRM drives, such as, open and short-circuit transistor faults. Thus, this paper presents a new fault detection and diagnosis method for transistor faults in a SRM drive. The method is based on symmetryindexes that are created from the analysis of the currents patterns. The proposed approach results in a fast and robust method, presenting immunity to different mechanical conditions. The characteristics of the proposed method will be verified through several simulation tests.	[Amaral, Tito G.] Inst Politecn Setubal, ESTSetubal, Dept Elect Engn, Setubal, Portugal; [Pires, V.

Their effect is noticeable on the spectrum of the stator currents, which is computed using the FFT. However, for a wind turbine, the spectrum of the currents changes with the wind speed. Therefore, the obtained results may not be accurate. In this paper, the residuals between an Extended Kalman Filter and the measured currents are proposed to be used for fault diagnosis and identification, via the FFT. The spectrum of the residuals is invariant to changes in the wind speed, but sensitive to faults.

Real HVAC sensor data is unfortunately usually unstructured and unlabelled, thus, to ensure better performance of automated methods promoting machine-learning techniques requires raw data to be preprocessed, increasing the overall operational costs of the system employed and makes real time application difficult. Due to the data complexity and limited availability of labelled information, semi-supervised learning based robust automatic fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tool has been proposed here. Further, this method has been tested and compared for more than 50 thousand TUs. Established statistical performance metrics and paired t-test have been applied to validate the proposed work.

Unlike most methods that only detect a single sensor, the proposed method can detect a large number of sensors simultaneously and rapidly. The residual error is generated by sensor values and the prediction model which is established by deep belief network(DBN) in deep learning, to detect faults and locate faulty sensors. Then, by using other non-faulty sensor information to reconstruct the signal through the neural network and combining with the coupling relationship of the 6-DOF platform, the fault sensor signal can be estimated accurately and the error accumulation problem can be also solved. Comparing the two algorithms of neural network and support vector machine(SVM), the reconstruction signal of neural network has higher accuracy. So, the performance of the wheel-legged robot can be guaranteed within a safety range. It is proved that the proposed method has high reliability and stability.

Monitoring of electric machinery is one of the most important challenges in predictive maintenance. Adaptive manufacturing processes/plants may be possible through the monitored conditions. In this respect, several attempts have been made to utilize deep learning algorithms for rotating machinery fault detection and diagnosis. Among them, deep autoencoders are very popular; because of their denoising effect. They are also implemented in electric machinery fault diagnostics in order to obtain lower order representation of signals. However, none of these efforts regard the autoencoders as compression units. Bearing in mind that spectra of vibration and current signals that are collected from electric machinery are critical instruments for detection and diagnosis of their faults, we propose that deep stacked autoencoder can be utilized as spectrum compression units. The performance of the proposed strategy are assessed using a bearing data set in three ways: (1)Rule-based classifiers are implemented on raw and compressed-decompressed spectrum and their performance are compared. (2) It is shown that the several machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks and k-nearest neighbour classifiers on compressed-decompressed spectrum achieves the performance of them on raw data. (3) A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier is implemented on the low dimensional representation and it is demonstrated that the strategy of employing the same autoencoder as pretraining of feature extraction module cannot outperform the performance of this MLP classifier.

The system is called Smart Condition Monitoring and Diagnosis System (S-CMDS). The S-CMDS utilizes various clustering methods in machine learning and Mahalanobis Distance (MD) mechanism to evaluate the fault conditions and indications of cold rolling mills in real time. Those methods to evaluate the machine conditions of rolling mills are operated in the smart data processing engine part of the S-CMDS. We successfully applied the S-CMDS into a real cold rolling process. Operators can intuitively notice the condition and operation problems of cold rolling mills by using the HMI (Human-Machine Interface) of S-CMDS displaying various statistical condition signals and diagnosis results of rolling mills. Therefore, the operators can respond to potential rolling mill faults through the S-CMDS in advance.

Tissue engineered tracheal patches based on electrospun scaffolds and stem cells present ideal solutions to this medical challenge. However, the established engineering process is inefficient and time-consuming. In our research, to optimize the engineering process, core-shell nanofilms encapsulating TGF-3 were fabricated as scaffolds for tracheal patches. The morphological and mechanical characteristics, degradation and biocompatibility of poly(L-lactic acid-co-epsilon-caprolactone)/collagen (PLCL/collagen) scaffolds with different compositions (PLCL:collagen 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75, respectively) were comparatively evaluated to determine the preferable compositional ratio. Then the chondrogenesis-inducing potential is investigated, and tracheal patches based on electrospun scaffolds and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were constructed to restore tracheal defects in rabbit models. The results indicated that core-shell scaffolds with a PLCL/collagen proportion of 75:25 were eligible for tracheal patches. The stable and sustained release of TGF-3 from scaffolds could efficiently promote the chondrogenic differentiation of BMSCs and shorten the incubation time. Tracheal integrity was well maintained for 2months after restoration; meanwhile, re-epithelialization also achieved. In conclusion, TGF-3-encapsulating core-shell electrospun scaffolds with a PLCL/collagen proportion of 75:25 could be used to optimize engineering process of tracheal patches.

The model is based on the combination of conformal mapping method (complex relative permeance) and eccentricity relative air gap permeance and it presents explicit formulas for no-load magnetic field distribution, magnetic flux, and emf in SMPMGs under different eccentricity fault types, some have not been so far considered elsewhere. The analytical and also numerical results show that there are some side-band components in the emf signature which can be used as eccentricity fault index. Analytical results validate by time-stepping finite element method (TSFEM) results.

J	Lin, Y; Liu, S; Huang, S				Lin, Ying; Liu, Shan; Huang, Shuai			Selective sensing of a heterogeneous population of units with dynamic health conditions	IISE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Dynamic system monitoring; heterogeneous population; selective sensing	MENTAL-STATE-EXAMINATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; DEMENTIA; MODEL; CARE	Monitoring a large number of units whose health conditions follow complex dynamic evolution is a challenging problem in many healthcare and engineering applications. For instance, a unit may represent a patient in a healthcare application or a machine in a manufacturing process. Challenges mainly arise from: (i) insufficient data collection that results in limited measurements for each unit to build an accurate personalized model in the prognostic modeling stage; and (ii) limited capacity to further collect surveillance measurement of the units in the monitoring stage. In this study, we develop a selective sensing method that integrates prognostic models, collaborative learning, and sensing resource allocation to efficiently and economically monitor a large number of units by exploiting the similarity between them. We showcased the effectiveness of the proposed method using two real-world applications; one on depression monitoring and another with cognitive degradation monitoring for Alzheimer's disease. Comparing with existing benchmark methods such as the ranking-and-selection method, our fully integrated prognosis-driven selective sensing method enables more accurate and faster identification of high-risk individuals.

Predictive Modeling of Baffle-Former Bolt Failures in Pressurized Water Reactors	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF MATERIALS IN NUCLEAR POWER SYSTEMS - WATER REACTORS, VOL 2	Minerals Metals & Materials Series		English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Environmental Degradation of Materials in Nuclear Power Systems - Water Reactors	AUG 13-17, 2017	Portland, OR			Baffle-former bolt; Stochastic; Semi-empirical; Reliability		Baffle-former bolt failures have been observed in recent inspections of pressurized water reactors (PWRs). These failures are understood to be primarily caused by irradiation-assisted stress corrosion cracking (IASCC). A prognostic method has been developed for simulating the degradation of baffle-former bolts due to IASCC. The method characterizes the evolution of stress in a reactor environment, as well as the redistribution of stress amidst neighboring bolt failures. Empirically-validated Weibull parameters are utilized in a stochastic framework, and the model is exercised as a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate a range of plausible scenarios from which trends of bolt failure rates and patterns can be determined. This semi-empirical methodology is informed by both operating experience and a more detailed, predictive finite element analysis model that encompasses the full range of phenomenological effects common to the operating environment within a PWR.

FLEET MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTICS FRAMEWORK BASED ON DIGITAL TWIN OF AERO-ENGINES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBOMACHINERY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, 2018, VOL 6			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo: Turbomachinery Technical Conference and Exposition	JUN 11-15, 2018	Oslo, NORWAY	Int Gas Turbine Inst				Monitoring aircraft performance in a fleet is fundamental to ensure optimal operation and promptly detect anomalies that can increase fuel consumption or compromise flight safety. Accurate failure detection and life prediction methods also result in reduced maintenance costs. The major challenges in fleet monitoring are the great amount of collected data that need to be processed and the variability between engines of the fleet, which requires adaptive models. In this paper, a framework for monitoring, diagnostics, and health management of a fleet of aircrafts is proposed. The framework consists of a multi-level approach: starting from thresholds exceedance monitoring, problematic engines are isolated, on which a fault detection system is then applied. Different methods for fault isolation, identification, and quantification are presented and compared, and the related challenges and opportunities are discussed. This conceptual strategy is tested on fleet data generated through a performance model of a turbofan engine, considering engine-to-engine and flight-to-flight variations and uncertainties in sensor measurements. Limitations of physics-based methods and machine learning techniques are investigated and the needs for fleet diagnostics are highlighted.

The performance and reliability of the bearing is vital to the safe operation of turbomachinery. Therefore, degradation feature extraction of rolling bearing is important to prevent it from failure. During rolling bearing degradation, machine vibration can increase, and this may be used to predict the degradation. The vibration signals are however complicated and nonlinear, making it difficult to extract degradation features effectively. Here, a novel degradation feature extraction method based on optimal ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and improved composite spectrum (CS) analysis is proposed. Firstly, because only a few IMFs are expected to contain the information related to bearing fault, EEMD is utilized to preprocess the vibration signals. An optimization method is designed for adaptively determining the appropriate EEMD parameters for the signal, so that the significant feature components of the faulty bearing can be extracted from the signal and separated from background noise and other irrelevant components to bearing faults. Then, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and correlation kurtosis (CK) are employed to select the sensitive intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and obtain fault information effectively. Finally, an improved CS analysis algorithm is used to fuse the selected sensitive IMF components, and the CS entropy (CSE) is extracted as degradation feature. Experimental data on the test bearings with single point faults separately at the inner race and rolling element were studied to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method. The results show that it can assess the bearing degradation status and has good sensitivity and good consistency to the process of bearing degradation.

As of the end of 2016, the worldwide total installed electricity generation capacity from wind power amounted to 486,790 MW, presenting an increase of 12.5% compared to the previous year. Nowadays wind turbine manufacturers tend to adopt new business models proposing total health monitoring services and solutions, using regular inspections or even embedding sensors and health monitoring systems within each unit. Regularly planned or permanent monitoring ensures a continuous power generation and reduce maintenance costs, prompting specific actions when necessary. The core of wind turbine drivetrain is usually a complicated planetary gearbox. One of the main gearbox components which are commonly responsible for the machinery breakdowns are rolling element bearings. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to other sources of excitation (e.g. gears). Focusing towards the accurate and early bearing fault detection, a plethora of signal processing methods have been proposed including spectral analysis, synchronous averaging and enveloping. Envelope analysis is based on the extraction of the envelope of the signal, after filtering around a frequency band excited by impacts due to the bearing faults. Kurtogram has been proposed and widely used as an automatic methodology for the selection of the filtering band, being on the other hand sensible in outliers. Recently an emerging interest has been focused on modelling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary, which is a particular class of non stationary stochastic processes. Cyclic Spectral Correlation and Cyclic Spectral Coherence have been presented as powerful tools for condition monitoring of rolling element bearings, exploiting their cyclostationary behaviour. In this work a new diagnostic tool is introduced based on the integration of the Cyclic Spectral Coherence along a frequency band that contains the diagnostic information. A special procedure is proposed in order to automatically select the filtering band, maximizing the corresponding fault indicators. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine gearbox vibration condition monitoring benchmarking dataset which includes various faults with different levels of diagnostic complexity.

In this article, an alternative view on modeling CM signals is proposed. This view draws its roots from multitask learning and is based on treating each CM signal as an individual task. Each task is then expressed as a convolution of a latent function drawn from a Gaussian process (GP), and the transfer of knowledge is achieved through sharing these latent functions between historical and in-service CM signals. Aside from being nonparametric, the flexible and individualistic approach in our model can account for heterogeneity in the data and automatically infer the commonalities between the new testing observations and CM signals in the historical dataset. The robustness and advantageous features of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical studies and a case study with real-world data in the application to find the remaining useful life prediction of automotive lead-acid batteries.

Failure of these components does affect not only performance of the entire machinery but also its reliability, safety and profitability. A comprehensive condition based monitoring techniques, research models along with guidelines by various Industrial sector, ISO standard do exist to predict early failure of bearing. The interoperability based operational model is developed that provides the necessary flexibility to industrial users to infer various modelling and simulation techniques for fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis of bearing. The paper presented with case studies highlighting condition based strategies that can provide savings in many maintenance activities. The case study of bearing failure revels that, lack of standardization is observed for bearing when it is associated with distributed and extended nature of fault under low speed application. Research study based recommendation is discussed at the end of the paper. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The detection of short-circuit fault is the prerequisite of taking preventive steps. In this paper, an online short-circuit fault detection method which is based on search coil is developed for a five-phase 30-slot/32-pole permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). The optimal configuration of search coil is studied with different load conditions and fault-occurring positions considered, further the optimal inserted position is determined. With the parallel strands of windings considered, the performance of the proposed short-circuit fault detection method is evaluated, which provides guidance for the design of the short-circuit fault detection system.

Therefore, bearing fault detection and prognosis of remaining useful life are important to prevent productivity losses. In this study, a novel method is proposed for prognosis of bearing life using an autoencoder and recurrent neural networks-based prediction algorithm. Promising results have been obtained from the experimental data. A monotonic upward trend of the produced health indicator is obtained for all test cases, being one of critical indicators of a proper prognosis. The remaining useful life estimation is moderately accurate under a limited data.

This article presents a multi component fault detection for induction motors and planetary gearboxes of the electric pitch drives using only the three-phase motor line currents. A deep autoencoder is used to extract features from the extended Park's vector modulus of the motor three-phase currents and a support vector machine to classify faults. The methodology is validated in a laboratory setup of a scaled pitch drive, with four commonly occurring faults, namely, the motor stator turns fault, broken rotor bars fault, planetary gearbox hearing fault and planet gear faults, under varying load and speed conditions.

The method adopts real-time SVM classifier to identify the power swing and fault occurring in power system. The data input to SVM using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) extract current signals that calculate Rate of Change of Relative Wavelet Energy and symmetrical components. The process of training the SVM using a K-folded cross validation process for determining the appropriate values of parameter sigma 6 in RBF kernel parameters can minimize the classification error.

C	Marx, J; Gantner, S; Stading, J; Friedrichs, J			ASME	Marx, Jonas; Gantner, Stefan; Staeding, Jorn; Friedrichs, Jens			A MACHINE LEARNING BASED APPROACH OF PERFORMANCE ESTIMATION FOR HIGH-PRESSURE COMPRESSOR AIRFOILS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBOMACHINERY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, 2018, VOL 2D			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo: Turbomachinery Technical Conference and Exposition	JUN 11-15, 2018	Oslo, NORWAY	Int Gas Turbine Inst		high pressure compressor; machine learning; clustering; classification; functional multivariate data		In recent years, the demands of Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) customers to provide resource-efficient after market services have grown increasingly. One way to meet these requirements is by making use of predictive maintenance methods. These are ideas that involve the derivation of workscoping guidance by assessing and processing previously unused or undocumented service data. In this context a novel approach on predictive maintenance is presented in form of a performance based classification method for high pressure compressor (HPC) airfoils. The procedure features machine learning algorithms that establish a relation between the airfoil geometry and the associated aerodynamic behavior and is hereby able to divide individual operating characteristics into a finite number of distinct aero-classes. By this means the introduced method not only provides a fast and simple way to assess piece part performance through geometrical data, but also facilitates the consideration of stage matching (axial as well as circumferential) in a simplified manner. It thus serves as prerequisite for an improved customary HPC performance workscope as well as for an automated optimization process for compressor buildup with used or repaired material that would be applicable in an MRO environment. The methods of machine learning that are used in the present work enable the formation of distinct groups of similar aero-performance by unsupervised (step 1) and supervised learning (step 2). The application of the overall classification procedure is shown exemplary on an artificially generated dataset based on real characteristics of a front and a rear rotor of a 10-stage axial compressor that contains both geometry as well as aerodynamic information. In step 1 of the investigation only the aerodynamic quantities in terms of multivariate functional data are used in order to benchmark different clustering algorithms and generate a foundation for a geometry based aero-classification. Corresponding classifiers are created in step 2 by means of both, the k Nearest Neighbor and the linear Support Vector Machine algorithms. The methods' fidelities are brought to the test with the attempt to recover the aero-based similarity classes solely by using normalized and reduced geometry data. This results in high classification probabilities of up to 96 % which is proven by using stratified k-fold cross-validation.

Energy consumption monitoring in manufacturing plants provides useful information to save energy while reducing CO2 emissions, but also for predictive maintenance or process optimization applications what results in costs reduction. This paper describes an Open-IoT solution to measure energy consumption in factories that reveal in detail the use of energy at each industrial machine and the energy consumed to perform a particular industrial process. This solution, based on BatNET wireless communication technology, has been installed worldwide at 16 factories dedicated to the manufacture of steel and aluminum parts for the automotive industry. BatNET is built on open and standard protocols and it was initially envisaged for building and Smart City applications. Some adaptations in hardware, firmware and software have been required to fulfil the industrial harsh environment. The implementation issues faced when installing this Industrial IoT system in real environments are presented in this paper. Special attention has been paid to the constraints motivated by factory requirements and embedded processing and data storage capabilities, as well as their solutions and the final results.

Finally, the results based on BP neural network fault diagnosis methods and the methods used in this paper were compared. Results shows that the track fault classifier based on least squares support vector machine can effectively achieve the five track circuit fault diagnosis with less computing time.

It's significant to analyze and predict its degradation failure mechanism to improve the reliability of solenoid valve and do research on prolonging life. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element analysis model of solenoid valve is established based on ANSYS Workbench software. A sequential coupling method used to calculate temperature filed and mechanical stress field of solenoid valve is put forward. The simulation result shows the sequential coupling method can calculate and analyze temperature and stress distribution of solenoid valve accurately, which has been verified through the accelerated life test. Kalman filtering algorithm is introduced to the data processing, which can effectively reduce measuring deviation and restore more accurate data information. Based on different driving current, a kind of failure mechanism which can easily cause the degradation of coils is obtained and an optimization design scheme of electro-insulating rubbers is also proposed. The high temperature generated by driving current and the thermal stress resulting from thermal expansion can easily cause the degradation of coil wires, which will decline the electrical resistance of coils and result in the eventual failure of solenoid valve. The method of finite element analysis can be applied to fault diagnosis and prognostic of various solenoid valves and improve the reliability of solenoid valve's health management.

Magic-State Functional Units: Mapping and Scheduling Multi-Level Distillation Circuits for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Architectures	2018 51ST ANNUAL IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICROARCHITECTURE (MICRO)			English	Proceedings Paper	51st Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)	OCT 20-24, 2018	Fukuoka, JAPAN	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc		Quantum Computing; Quantum Error Correction; Surface Code; Magic State Distillation		Quantum computers have recently made great strides and are on a long-term path towards useful fault tolerant computation. A dominant overhead in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the production of high-fidelity encoded qubits, called magic states, which enable reliable error-corrected computation. We present the first detailed designs of hardware functional units that implement space-time optimized magic-state factories for surface code error-corrected machines. Interactions among distant qubits require surface code braids (physical pathways on chip) which must be routed. Magic-state factories are circuits comprised of a complex set of braids that is more difficult to route than quantum circuits considered in previous work [1]. This paper explores the impact of scheduling techniques, such as gate reordering and qubit renaming, and we propose two novel mapping techniques: braid repulsion and dipole moment braid rotation. We combine these techniques with graph partitioning and community detection algorithms, and further introduce a stitching algorithm for mapping subgraphs onto a physical machine. Our results show a factor of 5.64 reduction in space-time volume compared to the best-known previous designs for magic-state factories.

However, there is a need to improve these technologies in various aspects, such as: maintenance, energy storage, cases of overload or mechanical failure. In maintenance, they constantly suffer of damage in blades typically to be in the open air and in constant operation. The most well-known damages in blades are identified as: impact of rays, wearing, fractures by cutting forces, freezing, among others. Because of all these factors, it is necessary to develop a predictive technique to help us to do the inspections of the blades in a safer and more effective way than manual inspection. In that sense, this paper introduces a deep learning vision-based approach to automatically analyze each part of the face of the blade, capable of making the detection of certain faults (impact of rays, wear and fractures). In addition, we present a proof-of-concept using a robot to automatically detect failures in wind turbine blades. Experimental results validate our vision system.

In this paper we present a system called I4TSRS(1), available as a Web Application, that efficiently guides a data engineer in the task of obtaining industrial time-series data reduced representations that preserve their main characteristics. Dealing with those reduced representations, data storage and transmission costs can be decreased, without limiting the future exploitation of the data in different processes. The novel contribution of the I4TSRS is that it is an intelligent system that recommends the best techniques to achieve a reduced representation of time-series captured in industrial settings. Its core element is a machine learning model that combines time-series reduction techniques with extracted features from industrial time-series. We have built the model using several heterogeneous real industrial time-series.

Aging-Related Bugs are hard to discover during software testing and also challenging to replicate. Automatic identification and prediction of aging related fault-prone files and classes in an object oriented system can help the software quality assurance team to optimize their testing efforts. In this paper, we present a study on the application of static source code metrics and machine learning techniques to predict aging related bugs. We conduct a series of experiments on publicly available dataset from two large open-source software systems: Linux and MySQL. Class imbalance and high dimensionality are the two main technical challenges in building effective predictors for aging related bugs. We investigate the application of five different feature selection techniques (OneR, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, RELEIF and Symmetric Uncertainty) for dimensionality reduction and five different strategies (Random Under-sampling, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost) to counter the effect of class imbalance in our proposed machine learning based solution approach. Experimental results reveal that the random under-sampling approach performs best followed by RUSBoost in-terms of the mean AUC metric. Statistical significance test demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the performance of the various feature selection techniques. Experimental results shows that Gain Ratio and RELEIF performs best in comparison to other strategies to address the class imbalance problem. We infer from the statistical significance test that there is no difference between the performances of the five different learning algorithms.

The core of wind turbine drivetrains is a planetary gearbox and its rolling element bearings are often responsible for machinery breakdowns. The failure signs of an early bearing damage are usually weak compared to the gear excitation and are hardly detected. As a result there is a special need for advanced signal processing tools which can detect accurately bearing faults. Cyclic Spectral Coherence (CSC) appears to be a strong diagnostic tool but its interpretation is complicated for a non-expert. In this paper a novel CSC based methodology is proposed in order to extract an Improved Envelope Spectrum exploiting a specific domain of the CSC map optimally selected by a proposed criterion. The methodology is tested and validated on a wind turbine gearbox benchmarking dataset provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), USA.

The synchronous generator (SG) is a very important component of a power system and there are only a few works that deal with the model based approach to fault diagnosis of a wound rotor synchronous generator. This work deals with the application of augmented Extended Kalman Filter (EKE) to obtain the residual signal for an SG. This signal contains the signature of the fault and can distinguish an interturn fault from a load imbalance of similar magnitude.	[Nag, P. V. Sunil; Kumar, C. Santhosh; Isha, T.

The proposed work on this paper is to develop a model for monitoring the condition of the DTC induction motor drive using advanced soft computing technique, fuzzy logic. This paper presents the mathematical modeling of three phase induction motor drives fed by three phase voltage source inverter using direct torque control strategy. hence it is necessary that these machines work all the time with its superior quality. And if any fault occurs in machine, important to identify and diagnosis of the particular fault with minimum time. Here direct torque control of induction motor is developed and also various fault issues of induction motor is presented with the help of fuzzy based fault detection system using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. An intelligent modeling technique is adopted as an identifier for various faults. The three phase stator currents are estimated and applied as input to the fuzzy systems. In this model, time act as an important parameter either in fault detection or in decision making for suitable corrective action according to the type of the fault occurs.	[Kumar, R.

We generate large flight datasets using a Simulink model based on a 6-DoF block and position and attitude PID controllers; these datasets are used to train and validate a random forest classifier that is able to detect if a motor has failed, and identify which one. The algorithm uses as inputs the attitude of the vehicle and the signals commanded to the motors, and outputs a flag per motor that indicates its healthy or faulty state. The classifier achieves a good performance, resulting in a detection of the fault in less than 100mS after it has occurred, with a high rejection of false positives, less than one false positive per hour of flight.

The most prominent features of this structure include limited number of DGs required to inject harmonics, no need for using centralized communication system, and the fault can be detected and located in all conditions such as load disconnection/connection and DC disconnection/connection. The optimum Time Dial Settings (TDSs) of these relays are obtained by solving a coordination problem with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

However, in some applications, these methods may be infeasible or prohibitively complex or expensive. For such applications, we propose an alternative low-complexity strategy for detecting bearing health issues by monitoring the induction motor equivalent circuit impedance. As the equivalent circuit impedance depends on the slip of the machine, abrupt drops of the impedance are indicative of sudden onset of friction in the bearings, which is a precursor of bearing failure. We quantify the sensitivity of this approach and demonstrate the robustness to other variables such as winding resistances. We illustrate the predictive power of impedance-based methods for detecting ball-bearing failures in Xray tube rotors by evaluating the algorithm on data collected from run-to-failure experiments performed on five different tubes. Our results indicate that the method is valuable for short-term failure prediction of induction machines in critical applications.

Most of the research effort focuses on motor current signature analysis (MCSA) as it can provide remote, on-line monitoring at low cost. However, all types of defects that produce asymmetries in the PMSM rotor or load produce identical rotor rotational frequency components. This is a serious limitation when applying MCSA since it can produce false indications and degrade the sensitivity of fault detection. In this paper, the feasibility of using analog Hall sensors signals to complement MCSA for detection and classification of rotor and load related defects is investigated. It is shown that Hall sensors installed in machines for initial rotor position estimation can be used with minimal hardware modifications, to detect and classify signatures produced by the rotor and load, for cases where MCSA fails. Experimental testing performed on an IPMSM under eccentricity, local demagnetization, and load unbalance conditions show that the reliability and sensitivity of fault detection in PMSM systems can be improved at low added cost.

The five-phase machines show inherent higher fault tolerance advantageous over the conventional three-phase machine under different number of open-phase conditions. Ferrite (Fe) magnets are cost effective replacement of the rare-earth material e. g. neodymium (Nd) magnets. Both magnets in PMa-SynRMs show degraded electromagnetic torque characteristics under different open phase faults. Traditional MTPA control method is not able to improve performance under faulty conditions. Advanced fault-tolerant MTPA control method is required to achieve satisfactory performance both under healthy and faulty conditions. In this paper, the fault tolerant control method is modified with MTPA technique to achieve higher performance. The proposed technique is applied on both machines under open phase faults to compare their performances. Detail theoretical analysis is carried out through MATLAB and finite element analysis (FEA). Experimental test results are provided for the Nd-based PMa-SynRM.	[Arafat, A. K. M.] Cummins Inc, Corp R&T, Electrificat, Fridley, MN 55432 USA; [Haque, Moinul Shahidul; Islam, Md.

Since winding inductance is proportional to the square of number of turns, STSC suffers from significantly large circulating current inside the faulted turn. The objective of this paper is to provide practical approaches that enable fault detection and postfault operation. A pervious developed T-type equivalent circuit laid a solid foundation for the proposed methods. High-frequency injection as well as signal processing method are carried out for reliable online fault diagnosis, while postfault operation is based on shorting the remaining turns as well as instantaneous power balance theory. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

These changes reflect in the machine flux linkage, which can be determined by the machine voltage. A novel fault detection and identification technique for interturn- short fault and irreversible demagnetization fault in interior permanent magnet synchronous motor are presented in this paper. The deviation caused by the inter-turn short fault and irreversible demagnetization fault in the angle between daxis voltage and q-axis voltage, which is termed as voltage or load angle is analyzed. It is observed that in case of demagnetization fault the voltage angle increases, whereas in case of inter-turns short fault it decreases. In this study, we used this unique phenomenon for the detection and identification of these faults. The proposed method is verified by simulation and experiments.

This approach is based on MATLAB/Simulink and finite element analysis, and shows a fast and accurate estimation of the electromagnetic behavior for such machine under short-circuit conditions. Due to physical contact between different phase windings in the same stator slot, the inter-turn and inter-phase short-circuit in a double layer FSPM machine becomes a real possibility. However, this is rarely studied in the literature. Thus, this work contributes for the fault analysis of inter-turn and inter phase short-circuit problems. Experimental tests have been carried out to validate the simulations.

Coming with the reliability assessment and improving the life extension of power converters, the approach is to monitor semiconductor on-resistor changes as a precursor signature for diagnostic/prognostic. This paper presents a novel approach for hybrid condition-based prognostic and reliability monitoring of GaN devices. The proposed approach offers a multi-physics co-simulations solution for degradation fatigue modeling of the GaN power devices. With the availability of the most granular information deduced from the advanced devices, the paper develops deep learning based algorithms for online reliability in power electronics. The proposed algorithm is based on the prominent version of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM models are utilized for system training and simulation model calibrations, and eventually predicting the next states within the next time horizon.

The proposed method utilizes the decreasing trend of semiconductor's on-state resistance when its degradation starts. The changed electrical properties and quantities in the circuit due to the change of the on-state resistance are used as indicators to prognose the failure of the semiconductor. Existing fault diagnosis and prognosis methods are first overviewed, and the limitations of these methods are highlighted. The advantages of the proposed prognostic method are 1) Need for a small amount of data for training and 2) Its computational requirements are simpler and faster than existing methods. A 5-level neutral-point-clamped inverter is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed prognostic method.	[Chen, Weiqiang; Bazzi, Ali.

The operator provides a simple and efficient solution to the problem of estimating the instantaneous frequency and envelope of amplitude and frequency-modulated (AM-FM) signals. Furthermore, this method is easy to implement and has a low computational complexity. In the paper, the author proposes using TEO in an automotive application to perform preliminary investigations of the in-cylinder pressure signal. Research in this area is important because it determines fuel consumption, engine durability as well as the emission of air pollutants. Detecting abnormal combustion in spark-ignition (SI) engines is possible by measuring and analysing the engine block vibrations, the ionisation current and the in-cylinder pressure. However, the fundamental variable that provides an in-depth insight into the combustion process is the pressure signal. By analysing the signal, a detailed study of the knock phenomenon can be performed, which is necessary to develop a reliable and efficient knock detection method. By applying the proposed technique, we are able to identify the basic parameters of the pressure trace, such as the starting frequency and the rate of frequency change. By knowing the value of the parameters for various engine operating conditions, the performance of a knock detection system can be improved.

Machine learning based tool condition classification using acoustic emission and vibration data in high speed milling process using wavelet features	INTELLIGENT DECISION TECHNOLOGIES-NETHERLANDS			English	Article						High speed milling; vibration; acoustic emission; wavelet; machine learning; classification	FORCE SENSOR; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WEAR; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	It is important to develop an intelligent tool condition monitoring system to increase productivity and promoting automation in metal cutting process. Many attempts have been made in the past to develop such systems using signals from various sensors such as dynamometer, current, accelerometer, acoustic emission, current and voltage, etc. But the successes of different sensor based systems are limited due to the complexity of tool wear process. The research is still ongoing for improved tool condition monitoring system with applications of advance signal processing techniques and artificial intelligent models. In this study, tool conditions are monitored using the vibration and acoustic emission signatures during high speed machining of titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V). Using discrete wavelet transforms wavelets coefficients of vibration and acoustic emission signals are extracted using haar, daubechies, biorthogonal and reverse biorthogonal wavelets. Machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, naive bayes, support vector machine and artificial neural networks are used to predict the tool condition. Results indicate the effectiveness of acoustic emission and vibration data using wavelets for classifying the tool conditions with the aid of machine learning algorithms. A correlation is established between the tool conditions and sensor data. Support vector machine trained by vibration data appears to be predicting the tool conditions with good accuracy compared to decision trees, naive bayes and artificial neural network. Results obtained in this study will be useful to develop an intelligent on-line tool condition monitoring system.	[Krishnakumar, P.; Rameshkumar, K.; Ramachandran, K.

While covering a smaller area allows for higher detection likelihood, overlapping fields of view introduce a redundancy which is vital to fault tolerance and acquisition of multiple perspectives of targets. In this paper, we study the coverage redundancy problem in visual sensor networks formalised as the k-coverage. We propose a resolution-based detection model that enables the exploration of the zoom level impact on the extension of coverage redundancy. Given mobile targets, we investigate the network-wide best k-coverage using global knowledge of the network. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of this approach and propose a realistic zoom adaptation model for cameras under a new zoom level proximity constraint. Further to the global approach, which aim to provide the highest possible k-coverage across the network, we study the performance of several online heuristics and learning approaches which use only local knowledge to approximate the highest k-coverage under our zoom level proximity constraint. Furthermore, we show that in many scenarios the dynamic behaviour resulting from the online learning approaches is not only computationally less expensive but also leads to a significant improvement on the level of coverage redundancy compared with heuristic approaches. This becomes even more apparent when objects follow scripted movement patterns.

Model-based prognostic health-management algorithms for the freeplay identification in electromechanical flight control actuators	2018 5TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON METROLOGY FOR AEROSPACE (METROAEROSPACE)	IEEE Metrology for AeroSpace		English	Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Workshop on Metrology for AeroSpace (MetroAeroSpace)	JUN 20-22, 2018	ROME, ITALY	IEEE, AESS, IEEE Instrumentation Measurement Soc, IEEE Italy Sect, AESS AES Chapter		electromechanical actuator; model-based prognosis; backlash; fault anticipation; safety; maintenance		The paper deals with the development of a model based prognostic algorithm for the freeplay identification in electromechanical flight actuators. The basic idea underlying the work is that the freeplay implies the onset of limit cycle oscillations in the actuator position response, with amplitudes and frequencies that depend on the freeplay size, so that the limit cycle characterization can provide an estimation of the freeplay. To develop the algorithm, a number of prognostic models are generated from a high-fidelity model of an electromechanical actuator for primary flight controls, in which increasing values of freeplay are imposed. The limit cycles obtained by each prognostic model are characterized, weighed against uncertainties, and collected to create a reference database. The algorithm, designed to be used during maintenance, collects the time histories of the actuator sensors' during position tracking tests capable of inducing freeplay-related limit cycles, and operates a signals' treatment (FFT, normalization, amplification, filtering) aiming to amplify the limit cycle content with respect to both high-frequency disturbances and low-frequency dynamics. The amplitude and the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation are then compared with the expected values of the prognostic database, up to generate a freeplay estimation and a Remaining Useful-Life prediction.

This has motivated the design of soft error detectors to minimize SDCs. However, the detectors have been studied under different contexts, making comparative evaluation difficult. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of four online soft error detection techniques in detecting the adverse impact of soft errors on iterative methods. We observe that, across five iterative methods, the detectors studied achieve high but not perfect detection rates. To understand the potential for improved detection, we evaluate a machine-learning based detector that takes as features that are the runtime features observed by the individual detectors to arrive at their conclusions. Our evaluation demonstrates improved but still far from perfect detection accuracy for the machine learning based detectors. This extensive evaluation demonstrates the need for designing error detectors to handle the evolutionary behavior exhibited by iterative solvers.

Statistical features obtained from a IM current are used as inputs of the classifier. We train the classifier with simulation data, using a qd model of IM. Through simulation, 360 records of 120 cycles were generated in which different IM conditions were considered, healthy, rotor fault and disturbances in torque and voltage. Finally, the classifier was validated with experimental laboratory data, obtained from an IM of 5.5 kW in healthy, 2 and 3 BB, with different load and supply voltage conditions. The results show that the proposed classifier allows detection with 91.67% accuracy, and without false negatives (faulty IMs classified as heathy).

Vibration and acoustics parameter of the machine helps in diagnosing the condition of the machine for early detection of faults in the system. This paper employs a Remote Condition Monitoring approach of two elevator parameters, vibration and acoustics, using an Internet of Things (IoT) device for Remote Data Acquisition (RDA) and Remote Fault Indication (RFI). A remote monitoring set-up was developed comprising of augmented sensors networked connections and Arduino Yun microcontroller, installed on the elevator system to remotely monitor the deterioration in the working condition. The set-up was configured to monitor the conditions online, through email application service. The data from the email were analyzed and notifications generated at the severity level of each parameter. The result showed that, vibration and acoustics parameters are complimentary in fault diagnosis, and that RCM enables faster repair and maintenance decision and prevent the catastrophic breakdown of the machine.

Currently, utility personnel employ an archaic by-hand approach in the analysis of these events. This limits the analysis to roughly 2% of the total recorded events. This work applies pattern recognition and machine learning to perform automated identification of faults cleared by fuses. A critical step in the automation is the accurate detection of the waveform samples associated with the fault itself. Poor detection of these samples negatively impacts the identification performance. This work investigated three detection methods: variance trajectory, binary vectors, and the analytic signal. A naive Bayes classifier was employed to identify seven fuse sizes using let-through energy. Naive Bayes identification performance of 94.3%, 93.6%, and 94.7% was achieved for the variance trajectory, binary vectors, and analytic signal detection approaches, respectively.

Any failure of such components will have a serious impact on the service itself and even jeopardize the safe and reliable operation of the train. However, the limited diagnostic accuracy has become the bottleneck of fault diagnosis. In this paper, an adaptive fault diagnosis method based on deep sparse autoencoder (SAE) network is proposed. Firstly, the original time domain signals collected by sensor are preprocessed and used as input to the diagnostic network. Secondly, the SAE fault diagnosis network model is built. Thirdly, the loss function of SAE is modified to improve the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of network. Finally, experiments verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method.

First of all, a new method of Isomap improvement is proposed in this paper, called Standardized Residuals-Isomap (SR-Isomap), to solve the problem that Isomap algorithm is easily affected by noise. Then based on the statistic-proximity ratio r, the residuals are analyzed and the noise is separated within the confidence intervals 1-2, 2] to accurately extract the low-dimensional principal components in the high-dimensional and Nonlinear manifold under the noisy environment, the robustness of Isomap algorithm to noise is enhanced. Finally, based on the feature of minimizing the structural risk of support vector machines, an SR-Isomap-SVM fault detection model is constructed and the radial basis function suitable for process monitoring signal is chosen to train and learn the low-dimensional clustering data to realize the fault detection of nonlinear monitoring data with noise. The simulation results of Tennessee Eastman(TE) Process show that this method can effectively realize the fault detection of non-linear chemical process with noise.

In this paper, we proposed a novel deep CNN method based on knowledge-transferring from shallow models for rotating machinery fault diagnosis with scarce labeled samples. It is based on the idea that shallow models trained with different hand-crafted features can reveal the latent prior knowledge or diagnostic expertise and have good generalization ability even with scarce labeled samples. First, The raw vibration signal is transformed into time-frequency domain by applying the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to extract integral features accordingly. Then, we train the SVM model with scarce labeled samples and make predictions on unlabeled samples. The predicted labels can be regarded as the data format of expert knowledge learned by the SVM model, which are combined together with the scarce fine labeled samples. Finally, they are used to train a deep CNN model of better discriminative ability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness the proposed method that it achieves better performance than SVM model and original deep CNN model trained with only scarce labeled samples. Moreover, it is computational efficient and is promising for real-time rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

For improving production efficiency, autonomous pump fault diagnosis has been widely adopted by many enterprises and has also attracted great research attentions. Existing studies exploit machine learning algorithms for autonomous pump fault diagnosis, which generally needs human knowledge to select distinctive data features. To avoid the bias of human selection, this paper proposes a multi kernel learning (NIKE) based autonomous pump fault diagnosis method. It trains basic classifiers (BCs) by each feature and weightily combines the basic classifiers to form the combined classifier for fault diagnosis. An autonomous BC weighting algorithm is proposed, which trains the combination weights of the BCs autonomously. We show the NIKE based fault diagnosis method provide more accurate fault detection than the existing methods and without the need of human experts' interventions.

Rotating machines contain bearings which are prone to health degradation with the passage of time. The health degradation of the bearings can result in unexpected machine failure compromising the safety, maintainability, and reliability of the machine, as well as, results in substantial economic losses. So, it is inevitable to develop tools for bearing fault diagnosis. Traditionally, rotating machines fault diagnosis algorithms identify the fault type by using features extracted from signals either in the time domain, frequency domain or time-frequency domain separately. The signals acquired from the bearings under variable working condition and various fault severities are highly nonlinear and nonstationary. The fault diagnosis in such scenarios by considering features from a single domain is ineffective. This paper proposes an efficient bearing fault diagnosis model that uses hybrid feature pool and hierarchical radial basis function (RBF) kernel based one-against-all support vector machines (OOASVM). The proposed model could overcome the nonstationary and nonlinear behavior of the bearing signals, which in turn improves the fault diagnostic performance of the scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed model provides superior fault diagnostic performance as compare to other intelligent algorithm when tested with the bearing's data from various fault severities.

A popular data-driven method to detect incipient failures and anomalies is the training of normal behaviour models by applying a machine learning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning machines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques can be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic environment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical change in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a wind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various kinds can happen unexpectedly. Such concept drift events are desired to be detected by means of statistical detectors and window-based approaches. However, in real complex systems, concept drifts are not as clear and evident as in artificially generated datasets. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of current drift detectors and also to design an appropriate novel technique for this specific industrial application, it is essential to dispose beforehand of a characterization of the existent drifts. Under the lack of information in this regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime of wind turbines is proposed. This methodology will facilitate the creation of a drift database that will serve both as a training ground for concept drift detectors and as a valuable information to enhance the knowledge about maintenance of complex systems.

Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. Industry 4.0, otherwise known as the fourth industrial revolution, integrates people and digitally controlled machines with the internet and information technology. The most commonly used terms to describe the new development that is changing the industrial aspects, are Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical Systems, and the Internet of Things (TOT), which pave the way for smart production factories and the digital transformation. Models of CPS of Industry 4.0 (CPSI 4.0) present a high level of combination and coordination between physical and computational elements aiming to improve productivity and decrease production costs. This paper introduces a testbed for a cyber-physical system of Industry 4.0. The testbed is a serial line equipped with sensors to collect data at both the machine and system level. Various tools were utilized to aggregate, analyze, and display this data and prepare it for processing over the cloud. The implemented system leverages many of Industry 4.0 features such as predictive maintenance, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), condition monitoring, communication technology and simple cyber-physical system security. The work presented is the basis for building a larger research testbed that could allow multidisciplinary research projects in this domain.

In the process design of the equipment, hydraulic crossover and other methods are adopted to meet the needs of the maintenance personnel on different types of EMUs. Therefore, the tipping boards are set up on the actual platform and protection network to ensure the safety of the workers' reaching the top. The EMUs usually use a four line storehouse, and the number of tipping plates is hundreds of them. Most of them are reversing /receiving by cylinder driving, and a large number of flip plates are distributed in the workshop. Besides, the state of the retractable boards and the faults have important influence on the operation. Therefore, it is very important to monitor the state of the flip plate. At present, it is more dependent on the monitoring and controlling system of the mechanical stroke switch in China. Due to the state of the hardware and the stability of the system, the method has the risk of omission and false alarm in some cases. Meanwhile, the switch signal can not directly display the real-time state of the tipping board. Therefore, the present invention provides a high-definition network camera image processing board state detection system based on double plate state real-time monitoring and detection, enhance the safety of EMU maintenance platform. The real-time image acquisition, calculating the specified texture information area gray co-occurrence matrix, generating feature vector descriptor, using support vector machine (SVM) classification method for feature vector classification, training classifier, and use the classifier to recognize the flap, and locate the flap position. And SVM is a novel method of machine learning evolving from statistics. SVM presents many own advantages in solving machine learning problems such as small samples, nonlinearity and high dimension. In this paper, the image texture SVM classification method construct feature vectors through the extraction of image gray level co-occurrence matrix texture information. The metioned texture imformation include gray-level co-occurrence matrix energy, contrast and entropy. And the gray level co-occurrence matrix reflects the image direction, adjacent interval and the change in value of integrated information. The results show that the image texture SVM classification method can effectively combine the method of template matching for the identification of condition detection of overhaul platform..

This paper presents a fault diagnosis system in a cyber-physical manufacturing cloud (CPMC) that allows manufacturers to perform diagnosis and maintenance of manufacturing machine tools through remote monitoring and online testing using Machine Tool Communication (MTComm). MTComm is an Internet scale communication method that enables both monitoring and operation of heterogeneous machine tools through RESTful web services over the Internet. It allows manufacturers to perform testing operations from cloud applications at both machine and component level for regular maintenance and fault diagnosis. This paper describes different components of the system and their functionalities in CPMC and techniques used for anomaly detection and remote online testing using MTComm. It also presents the development of a prototype of the proposed system in a CPMC testbed. Experiments were conducted to evaluate its performance to diagnose faults and test machine tools remotely during various manufacturing scenarios.

EIELM can adaptively select the number of neurons by adding them one by one. For further improving the performance of EIELM, a feedback layer is added between the output layer and the hidden layer for remembering the outputs of hidden layer, and the trend change rate is computed to dynamically update the feedback layer outputs. In addition, as the features of input data have impact on the diagnosis results, AdaBoost algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the output in the training process of REIELM, so that the optimal parameters are obtained. To verify the performance of the proposed method, standard UCI data sets and TE simulation process are selected. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better performances in fault diagnosis than traditional approaches.

Prediction of faults in advance reduces the frequency of breakdown and improves the life time of machines. This paper proposes a machine condition monitoring system, which formulates the fault diagnosis problem as a machine learning based pattern classification problem. The vibration signals acquired from rotating machines are initially processed by a group-sparse denoising algorithm namely Overlapping Group Shrinkage (OGS). In OGS, the group sparse signal denoising problem is casted as a convex optimization problem with a group sparsity promoting penalty function. The denoised signals are then processed by Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), which decomposes the signal into specific frequency modes. For representing the signal in the feature space, energy of each mode is extracted and is classified by LS-SVM classifier. The performance of the proposed condition monitoring system is evaluated in terms of classification accuracies and is compared with statistical features.

In a complex system such as the pitch system, a fault in the gearbox can contaminate the motor current signals and result in a misdiagnosis. This paper investigates a sensor fusion technique to reliably diagnose faults in pitch motors and multistage planetary gearboxes in pitch drives. A support vector machine classifier is used for fault diagnosis based on features extracted from motor currents and gearbox vibration signals. The approach is validated with three commonly occurring pitch drive faults, namely, the stator turns fault in the pitch motor, input shaft bearing and planet gear fault in the planetary gearbox. The developed diagnostic method is validated with artificially seeded faults in a laboratory setup of a scaled pitch drive.

Recently, condition monitoring practices increasingly combine knowledge from fields like signal processing, machine learning, and mechanics. Such a diverse approach becomes necessary when dealing with the vast amount of data that is generated by the multitude of sensors that are typically placed on a wind turbine gearbox. Ideally, this approach needs to be automated and scalable as well, since it is unfeasible to perform all the necessary processing work manually in a continuous manner. This paper focuses on assessing the performance of such an automated processing framework for the case of gearbox fault detection using vibration measurements. A year of vibration measurements on a gearbox is simulated by stochastic variation of the operating conditions and the system behavior. A bearing fault is progressively introduced as to track the detection capabilities of the framework in such stochastic circumstances. The used signal model is based on previously obtained experience with experimental data sets originating from wind turbine gearboxes. The framework itself consists of multiple pre-processing steps where each step tries to deal with compensating for the external or unwanted influences such as speed variation or noise. Finally, multiple features are calculated on the pre-processed signals and trended as to see whether the processing scheme can provide any benefit compared to basic traditional statistical indicators. It is shown that the multi-step pre-processing approach is beneficial and robust for the advanced feature calculation and thus the early fault detection.

Fault detection and classification of permanent magnet synchronous motor in variable load and speed conditions using order tracking and machine learning	SCIENCE OF MAKING TORQUE FROM WIND (TORQUE 2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE)	JUN 20-22, 2018	Milan, ITALY	Politecnico Milano, Dept Aerosp Sci & Technol			DIAGNOSIS	Permanent magnet synchronous machines have gained popularity in wind turbines due to their merits of high efficiency, power density, and reliability. The wind turbines normally work in a wide range of operations, and harsh environments, so unexpected faults may occur and result in productivity losses. The common faults in the permanent magnet machines occur in the bearing and stator winding, being mainly detected in steady-state operating conditions under constant loads and speeds. However, variable loads and speeds are typical operations in wind turbines and powertrain applications. Therefore, it is important to detect bearing and stator winding faults in variable speed and load conditions. This paper proposes an algorithm to diagnose multiple faults in variable speed and load conditions. The algorithm is based on tracking the frequency orders associated with faults from the normalised order spectrum. The normalised order spectrum is generated by resampling the measured vibration signal via estimated motor speeds. The fault features are then generated from the tracking orders in addition to the estimated torque and speed features. Finally, support vector machine algorithm is used to classify the faults. The proposed method is validated using experimental data, and the validated results confirm its usefulness for practical applications.

A robust method for detection and classification of permanent magnet synchronous motor faults: Deep autoencoders and data fusion approach	SCIENCE OF MAKING TORQUE FROM WIND (TORQUE 2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	7th Conference on Science of Making Torque from Wind (TORQUE)	JUN 20-22, 2018	Milan, ITALY	Politecnico Milano, Dept Aerosp Sci & Technol			DIAGNOSIS	Permanent magnet synchronous motors become popular in wind turbines and industrial applications. In critical machines, it is necessary to use robust condition monitoring and fault diagnosis algorithms to prevent faults or shutdowns. The data-driven approach with machine learning algorithms is widely used in industrial and research communities as this method does not require a mathematical model of the system, which is difficult to obtain in practical cases. Most of the successful machine learning methods are based on supervised learning approach, requiring labelled training data. The supervised learning approach cannot use the unlabelled data, while only a few labelled data is in place in the industry. This work uses a deep autoencoder based unsupervised learning method to identify the features of the fault classification algorithm in a self-supervised way, which overcome the shortage of labelled data. The proposed algorithm uses the benefits of available unlabelled data, but it needs only a few labelled data. The fault classification algorithm is based on artificial neural network SoftMax layer and Bayes classifier. The robustness of the algorithm is improved by fusing the current and vibration information. Experimental results are used to validate the robustness of proposed algorithms under noise conditions, and the results show that the algorithm could classify faults robustly.

The proposed method improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis identification after processing the collected vibration signals through wavelet threshold denoising. The global optimization and high computational efficiency of SFLA are applied to the SVM model. Simulation results show that the SFLA-SVM algorithm is effective in fault diagnosis. Compared with SVM and Particle Swarm Optimization SVM (PSO-SVM) algorithms, it is demonstrated that the SFLA-SVM algorithm has the advantages of better global optimization, higher accuracy, and better reliability of diagnosis. Its accuracy is further improved through the integration of the wavelet threshold denoising method.

The kurtosis is a very efficient indicator being sensitive to impulsive components within the vibration signature that often are symptomatic of localized faults. In order to improve the diagnostic performance of the kurtosis, blind deconvolution algorithms can be exploited in order to detect bearing faults and, most importantly, their position. In this scenario, this paper focuses on the development of a novel condition indicator specifically designed for the damage assessment in rolling element bearings. The proposed indicator allows to track the bearing degradation process taking into account three different possible positions: outer race, inner race, and rolling element. This indicator fits real-time monitoring procedures allowing for the automatic detection and identification of the bearing fault. The validation of the proposed indicator has been carried out by means of both simulated signal and a run-to-failure experiment. The results highlight that the proposed indicator is able to detect more efficiently the fault occurrence and, most importantly, quicker than other established techniques.

However, due to leakages in water distributed networks (WDNs), a large amount of water is lost each year that suggests the need for reliable and robust leak detection and localization system. This paper attempts to review the current technologies for leakage detection in WDN as well as several proposed intelligent methodologies (such as support vector machine, neural network, and convolution neural network) over the past few years. The current methodologies and their limitations are discussed. Uncertainties involved in the implementation of WDN leakage detection are also discussed, and several suggestions to overcome such uncertainties are provided for future implementations.	[Chan, T.

To solve the problem that the accuracy of the current fault diagnosis of rolling hearings is not high and the model construction time is long, This paper proposed a new fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings based on invariant moments of three-dimensional vibration spectrogram. The pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution time-frequency analysis method was adopted to generate vibration spectrum images of the rolling bearings by means of signal processing. This method extracts the point cloud three-dimensional invariant moments of the vibration spectrogram as the characteristics of the failure mode, and realizes the bearing fault identification with the BP neural network. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has better recognition rate than the feature extraction method of the two-dimensional Hu invariant moment, but also can effectively identify and classify faults such as inner ring and outer ring, which has strong application value in the fault diagnosis of hearings and other rotating machinery.

Due largely to poor signal to noise ratio, the detection of incipient faults in bearings by current signal is still challenging. To improve this ratio, this paper proposes a current noise cancellation method based on non-Gaussian residues for bearing fault diagnosis in induction motors. Experimental results for inner/outer raceway bearing defects verify the merits and effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, it is experimentally shown that the proposed method is superior to the classic motor current signature analysis and the recent proposed method based on Teager-Kaiser energy Operator on motor current signal. To verify the existence of outer/inner raceway defects throughout experimental results, envelope analysis of vibration signal is used as well.

Unlike digital circuits where ageing causes logical errors, the ageing of analog components is often manifested in terms of performance degradation. When analog components are used inside large integrated circuits, the performance degradation of individual components may not show up in the visible output. In this early position paper we propose a methodology for choosing the conditions to be monitored on-chip for the component to determine that it is no longer fit to work in the context of the overall function of the integrated circuit.

J	Wang, Y; Yang, S; Sanchez, RV				Wang, Yu; Yang, Shuai; Vinicio Sanchez, Rene			Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Based on a Novel Hybrid Feature Reduction Method	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Feature reduction; gearbox; fault diagnosis; principal component analysis; locally linear embedding; hybrid algorithm	NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ROTATING MACHINERY; CLASSIFICATION; BEARING; KPCA; MANIFOLD; PCA	The dimensionality reduction of the high-dimensional feature space is a critical part for data preprocessing, which directly affects the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm named principal component locally linear embedding (PCLLE) is introduced to compress the original high-dimensional feature. This approach combines the optimization objectives of the principal component analysis (PCA) and locally linear embedding (LLE), which attempts to find a mapping that meets the optimization goals of PCA and LLE at the same time. It is applied on the gearbox fault diagnosis. In the experiment, the extracted fault-sensitive feature is compressed by PCLLE method. Then, the compressed feature is embedded with five classifiers for fault detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed new method, the traditional PCA and LLE methods are introduced for comparison. Experimental results show that the PCLLE algorithm has good performance during the classification process compared with the traditional PCA and LLE method.

Any deliberate or non-deliberate faults may cause enormous impact on system performance and server costs. Anomaly detection is a good way to identify anomalies and improve the dependability of the cloud platform. However, some of the anomaly detection methods are labeled data dependency, and some of them are sensitive to the dynamic runtime environment of the cloud platform. To address the problems, an adaptive and incremental clustering anomaly detection algorithm for virtual machines under the cloud platform runtime environment is proposed. Compared with the previous detection methods, the effect of the runtime environment factor is taken into account. Owning to the high level of dynamic cloud platform manages and the resources allocation of virtual machines, the environmental factors play an important role in the running performance of the virtual machines. In this paper, an improved adaptive and incremental clustering algorithm is introduced to perform the detection with the considerations of the cloud platform runtime environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness, two sets of experiments are performed. The experimental results indicate that the proposed anomaly detection method can greatly improve the detection accuracy rate even the cloud platform runtime environment changes.

Its health plays an important role in the fatigue life of the satellite. However, it is rather difficult to diagnose the health state of the bearings due to the complex satellite system. This paper attempts to propose a three-direction correlation dimension method to diagnose the bearings of a satellite flywheel at three typical states based on K-medoids clustering technology. A set of spatial spheres representing different bearings are modeled to recognize these three states of the bearings. To avoid misdiagnosis or loss of the bearing state, a twice-cluster scheme is employed. A series of tests is carried out to observe the effectiveness of the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed method is capable of diagnosing the different states of the bearings and its accuracy is higher than 99% at given conditions.

J	Tong, Z; Li, W; Zhang, B; Jiang, F; Zhou, GB				Tong, Zhe; Li, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Jiang, Fan; Zhou, Gongbo			Bearing Fault Diagnosis Under Variable Working Conditions Based on Domain Adaptation Using Feature Transfer Learning	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; vibration signal; domain adaptation; feature transfer learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FEATURE-EXTRACTION	Bearings, as universal components, have been widely used in the important position of rotating machinery. However, due to the distribution divergence between training data and test data caused by variable working conditions, such as different rotation speeds and load conditions, most of the fault diagnosis models built during the training stage are not applicable for the detection in the test stage. The models dramatically lead to the performance degradation for fault classification. In this paper, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method, domain adaptation by using feature transfer learning (DAFTL) under variable working conditions, is proposed to solve this performance degradation issue. The dataset of normal bearings and faulty bearings are obtained via the fast Fourier transformation of raw vibration signals, under different motor speeds and load conditions. Then, the marginal and conditional distributions are reduced simultaneously between training data and test data by refining pseudo test labels based on the maximum mean discrepancy and domain invariant clustering in a common space. Ultimately, a transferable feature representation for training data and test data is achieved. With the help of the nearest-neighbor classifier built on the transferable features, bearing faults are identified in this common space. Extensive experimental results show that the DAFTL can identify the bearing fault accurately under variable working conditions and outperforms other competitive approaches.

J	Wang, HL; Martinez, A				Wang Hailun; Martinez, Alexander			Application of modified culture Kalman filter in bearing fault diagnosis	OPEN PHYSICS			English	Article						Rolling bearing; fault diagnosis; vibration signal; CKF	ROBUST; SYSTEMS	Rolling bearings are an important part of rotary machines. They are used most widely in various mechanical sectors, which are among the most vulnerable components in machines. This paper uses CKF algorithm to compile a signal analysis system, analyses the vibration signal of the rolling bearing, extracts fault features, and realizes fault diagnosis. In order to improve the estimation accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis under nonlinear model, a nonlinear model of bearing fault diagnosis based on quaternion and low-accuracy high-noise sensors is established, and the attitude estimation has performed using the culture Kalman filter (CKF) algorithm. The sensor data comparison shows that the use of the volumetric Kalman filter algorithm can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis and stability. In this paper, the measured vibration signals of several groups of rolling bearings are analysed, and the signal characteristic frequency has extracted. The results show that using the analysis software designed in this paper, several typical faults of rolling bearings can be correctly identified.

J	Zhu, JL; Ge, ZQ; Song, ZH; Gao, FR				Zhu, Jinlin; Ge, Zhiqiang; Song, Zhihuan; Gao, Furong			Review and big data perspectives on robust data mining approaches for industrial process modeling with outliers and missing data	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL			English	Review						Data mining; Robustness; Process modeling; Statistical process monitoring; Big data analytics	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; PROJECTION-PURSUIT APPROACH; SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DATA-DRIVEN; FEATURE-SELECTION; KALMAN FILTER; SOFT SENSOR	Industrial process data are usually mixed with missing data and outliers which can greatly affect the statistical explanation abilities for traditional data-driven modeling methods. In this sense, more attention should be paid on robust data mining methods so as to investigate those stable and reliable modeling prototypes for decision-making. This paper gives a systematic review of various state-of-the-art data preprocessing tricks as well as robust principal component analysis methods for process understanding and monitoring applications. Afterwards, comprehensive robust techniques have been discussed for various circumstances with diverse process characteristics. Finally, big data perspectives on potential challenges and opportunities have been highlighted for future explorations in the community. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, YJ; Pei, SL				Yu, Yunjun; Pei, Shilei			Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis of Neutral Point Clamped Three-Level Inverter Based on Sparse Representation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Neutral point clamped three-level inverter; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; fault identification	COMPLEX SIGNAL ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ATOMIC DECOMPOSITION; K-SVD; CLASSIFICATION; PCA; RECONSTRUCTION; DICTIONARIES; PURSUITS; ELEMENT	Decomposition of the signal on the orthogonal or nonorthogonal basis of the signal space is the traditional method for fault feature extraction in the field of inverter fault diagnosis. These signal analysis methods make the result of signal decomposition not sparse and they are not self-adaptive. In recent years, sparse representation has received considerable attention in signal processing because the method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods by decomposing the signal on an over-complete dictionary instead of on an orthogonal or nonorthogonal basis. This paper proposes a combination of sparse representation and support vector machine (SVM) for the fault diagnosis of neutral point clamped (NPC) three-level inverter. First, the three-phase phase voltage signals are sampled as the characteristic signals for analysis. Then, the K-SVD algorithm is used as the fault feature extraction technology to obtain an over-complete dictionary and the sparse representation coefficients of the characteristic signals. The latter are used as the feature information for the characteristic signals. Finally, the SVM with powerful generalization capability is used as the fault identification method to identify NPC three-level inverter fault types according to the extracted feature information and analyze the fault diagnosis effect. Simulation experiments show that the combination of sparse representation and the SVM for fault diagnosis of NPC three-level inverters has the advantage of high diagnostic accuracy.

J	Zhu, JL; Yao, Y; Gao, FR				Zhu, Jinlin; Yao, Yuan; Gao, Furong			Transfer of Qualitative and Quantitative Knowledge for Similar Batch Process Monitoring	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault detection and isolation; multiphase Bayesian network; Procrustes analysis; similar batch process; statistical pattern clustering; transfer learning	FAULT-DETECTION; DYNAMIC PCA; FRAMEWORK; MACHINE; PHASE	The operating conditions for industrial batch production often cover a wide range in order to produce different products. Inconsistent working conditions and recipes may change the data properties, but the generated batches may share similar mechanisms in terms of their qualitative and quantitative knowledge domains. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning framework for both domains to improve the efficiency of monitoring in similar batch scenarios. First, a statistical pattern clustering strategy is developed for assessing and separating similar conditions. Based on this strategy, the phase-based generalized Procrustes analysis and the ordinary Procrustes analysis are proposed to produce the nominal representations and also to transfer quantitative knowledge by accommodating batch-wise and recipe-wise discrepancies. Furthermore, a multiphase Bayesian network is constructed for qualitative knowledge transfer and statistical modeling with the nominal representations. Finally, a systematic monitoring flowchart is established for fault detection and isolation based on a just-in-time transfer strategy. Under this framework, the efforts required for similar process modeling can be reduced and the monitoring efficiency can be improved. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed diagram for industrial uses are validated on a fed-batch penicillin fermentation process.

The results of such an analysis can not only be used as information about energy consumption but can also be used for predictive maintenance. The authors present a novel approach that is dedicated to the classification of machine-level energy efficiency that can be applied in the case of multivariate production. The concept was proven by research on the use case of an assembling station that consisted of a number of pneumatic devices. The proposed approach does not require detailed analysis about the production technology that is being used and also does not require additional knowledge about the order of the production variants that are being executed. The algorithm is based on observing the behaviour of the machine and then clustering the machine cycles that are observed.

The vibration was caused by resonance, which was confirmed through a vibration test, and the resonance frequency was acquired. The source of vibration was sought from both flow and structural aspects. Computational fluid dynamics technique was used to calculate typical frequencies excited by flows in the pump. Finite element analysis was executed to locate the structural factors that might contribute to the resonance and to enable a modal analysis of the pump base. The test results demonstrate that the resonance frequencies are slightly less than 100 Hz. Nevertheless, the flow-induced dominant frequencies deviate considerably from the resonance frequencies. Regarding the motor, it is featured by a dominant frequency of 100 Hz under the no-load condition; therefore, the primary reason of the pump unit resonance is manifested. Two strategies of reconstructing the pump base were attempted to eliminate resonance. Through adding reinforcing ribs to the supporting frame under the motor, the natural frequencies of the pump base associated with the second- and third-order modes increase relative to their counterparts of the original scheme. The effect of such a strategy was validated by test results. The other strategy is secondary grouting, with which the resonance frequency was avoided and the stiffness of the pump base was elevated remarkably.

J	Sun, ZX; Sun, HX				Sun, Zexian; Sun, Hexu			Health Status Assessment for Wind Turbine with Recurrent Neural Networks	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROGNOSTIC ALGORITHMS; ROTATING MACHINERY; DEEP	In order to improve the safety, efficiency, and reliability in large scale wind turbines, a great deal of statistical and machine-learning models for wind turbine health monitoring system (WTHMS) are proposed based on SCADA variables. The data-driven WTHMS have been performed widely with the attentions on predicting the failures of the wind turbine or primary components. However, the health status of wind turbine often degrades gradually rather than suddenly. Thus, the SCADA variables change continuously to the occurrence of certain faults. Inspired by the ability of recurrent neural network (RNN) in redefining the raw sensory data, we introduce a hybrid methodology that combines the analysis of variance for each sequential SCADA variable with RNN to assess the health status of wind turbine. First, each original sequence is split by different variance ranges into several categories to improve the generalized ability of the RNN. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is procured on the normal running sequence to learn the gradually changing situations. Finally, a weighted assessment method incorporating the health of primary components is applied to judge the health level of the wind turbine. Experiments on real-world datasets from two wind turbines demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed model.

Firstly, based on the NASA laboratory battery dataset, a Wiener process with time-scale transformation is used to capture battery capacity fading, and then the battery reliability point and interval estimation equation are derived, respectively. Secondly, by analyzing the charge and discharge profiles of the batteries in orbit environments, an accurate capacity prediction model is proposed based on the partial charging curves. Finally, the Bayesian framework is used to perform capacity degradation model online updating, and the analytical expression of residual life distribution is derived to achieve RL prediction for in-orbit satellite lithium-ion batteries.

In this paper, autonomous multidimensional novelty detection algorithms are used to estimate the gearbox' health state based on vectors of features calculated from the vibration signal. The authors examine various feature vectors, various sources of data and many different damage scenarios in order to compare novel detection algorithms based on three different principles of operation: a distance in the feature space, a probability distribution, and an ANN (artificial neural network)-based model reconstruction approach. In order to compensate for non-deterministic results of training of neural networks, which may lead to different network performance, the ensemble technique is used to combine responses from several networks. The methods are tested in a series of practical experiments involving implanting a damage in industrial epicyclic gearboxes, and acquisition of data at variable speed conditions.

J	Li, LL; Cui, YH; Chen, RL; Liu, XL				Li, Longlong; Cui, Yahui; Chen, Runlin; Liu, Xiaolin			Optimal SES Selection Based on SVD and Its Application to Incipient Bearing Fault Diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SINGULAR-VALUE DECOMPOSITION; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; SIGNAL; MATRIX; FREQUENCY; KURTOGRAM; RESONANCE; MACHINES; GEARBOX	Rotating machinery has extensive industrial applications, and rolling element bearing (REB) is one of the core parts. To distinguish the incipient fault of bearing before it steps into serious failure is the main task of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis technology which could guarantee the reliability and security of rotating machinery. The early defect occurring in the REB is too weak and manifests itself in heavy surrounding noise, thus leading to the inefficiency of the fault detection techniques. Aiming at the vibration signal purification and promoting the potential of defects detection, a new method is proposed in this paper based on the combination of singular value decomposition (SVD) technique and squared envelope spectrum (SES). The kurtosis of SES (KSES) is employed to select the optimal singular component (SC) obtained by applying SVD to vibration signal, which provides the information of the REB for fault diagnosis. Moreover, the rolling bearing accelerated life test with the bearing running from normal state to failure is adopted to evaluate the performance of the SVD-KSES, and results demonstrate the proposed approach can detect the incipient faults from vibration signal in the natural degradation process.

Firstly, the Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) is employed to select a proper capture focus (CF) and image size, and the spectrum of vibration signal is computed via fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and adjusted according to the average rotating speed. Then, the spectrum is plotted and captured as a two-dimensional (2D) image with the optimized CF and image size. Two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) is used to reduce the dimension of images, and finally a nearest neighbour method is applied to classify the faults of bearings. Two experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides, a further investigation on the effect of spectrum frequency resolution is conducted and a recommended selection method of frequency resolution is given based on the experimental performances. In our method, the training samples could be from only one operating condition, while the testing samples are from all possible operation conditions. All experiment results have demonstrated that the proposed method could achieve high classification accuracy even with very limited training samples.

J	Zhang, Q; Tian, T; Wen, GR; Zhang, ZF				Zhang, Qi; Tian, Tian; Wen, Guangrui; Zhang, Zhifen			A New Modelling and Feature Extraction Method Based on Complex Network and Its Application in Machine Fault Diagnosis	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SERIES	The application of the existing complex network in fault diagnosis is usually modelled based on the time domain, resulting in the loss of sign frequency-domain features, and the extracted topology features of network are too macroscopic and insensitive to local changes within the network. This paper proposes a new method of local feature extraction based on frequency complex network (FCN) decomposition and builds a new complex network structure feature on this basis, namely, subnetwork average degree. The variation law of signals in frequency domain is obtained with the aid of the structural features of complex network. The local features that are sensitive to local changes of the network are applied to characterize the whole network, with flexible application and without limitation in mechanism. The average degree of subnetwork could be regarded as feature parameters for rolling bearing fault diagnosis and degradation state recognition. Analysis on the experimental data and bearing life cycle data shows that the method proposed in this paper is effective, revealing that the extracted features have effective separability and high accuracy in fault recognition and the degradation detection of the life cycle of rolling bearings combined with neural networks. Moreover, the proposed method has reference value for the processing and recognition of other nonstationary signals.

Typically the lifetime of the whole imaging device is limited due to continuous wear and finally failure of the rotary compressor of the Stirling cooler, especially due to failure of the comprised bearings. MTTF based lifetime predictions, even based on refined MTTF models taking operational scenario dependent scaling factors into account, still lack in precision to forecast accurately the end of life (EOL) of individual coolers. Consequently preventive maintenance of individual coolers to avoid failures of the main sensor in critical operational scenarios are very costly or even useless. We have developed an integrated test method based on 'Micro Electromechanical Systems', so called MEMS sensors, which significantly improves the cooler EOL prediction. The recently commercially available MEMS acceleration sensors have mechanical resonance frequencies up to 50 kHz. They are able to detect solid borne shock pulses in the cooler structure, originating from e. g. metal on metal impacts driven by periodical forces acting on moving inner parts of the rotary compressor within wear dependent slack and play. The impact driven transient shock pulse analyses uses only the high frequency signal >10kHz and differs therefore from the commonly used broadband low frequencies vibrational analysis of reciprocating machines. It offers a direct indicator of the individual state of wear. The predictive cooler lifetime model based on the shock pulse analysis is presented and results are discussed.

Thus, health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings have long been studied to improve operational reliability and maintenance efficiency of rotatory machines. Over the past decade, prognosis that enables forewarning of failure and estimation of residual life attracted increasing attention. To accurately and efficiently predict failure of the rolling element bearing, the degradation requires to be well represented and modelled. For this purpose, degradation of the rolling element bearing is analysed with the delay-time-based model in this paper. Also, a hybrid feature selection and health indicator construction scheme is proposed for extraction of the bearing health relevant information from condition monitoring sensor data. Effectiveness of the presented approach is validated through case studies on rolling element bearing run-to-failure experiments.

Although the distributed control system(DCS) has been introduced to monitor the state of industrial process, it still cannot satisfy all the requirements for fault detection of all the industrial systems. In this paper, we proposed a novel method based on topological features and support vector machine(SVM), for fault detection of industrial process. The proposed method takes global information of measured variables into account by complex network model and predicts whether a system has generated some faults or not by SVM. The proposed method can be divided into four steps, i.e. network construction, network analysis, model training and model testing respectively. Finally, we apply the model to Tennessee Eastman process(TEP). The results show that this method works well and can be a useful supplement for fault detection of industrial process.

A multi-factor intelligent diagnosis model of PT fuel system was built based on KPCA-LSSVM . Firstly, the reduction processing of time domain feature parameters was carried out according to KPCA theory, and the redundant information was eliminated. Secondly, first two principal components were obtained after reduction and input into LSSVM model to train and learn, Finally, the intelligent diagnosis model was established. One hundred and fifty groups of pressure signal were collected, the model was trained and tested according to the proportion of 2:1, and the test results were compared with the results of other five models, The results showed that the KPCA can reduce the data information effectively, the fault diagnosis method based on KPCA-LSSVM is faster and has higher classification accuracy.

Machine faults stop the process flow, and are associated with idle time and additional expenses due to unexpected corrective maintenance. Depending on the fault, the idle time can span from short time actions to long inactivity periods for the machine. This idle time can risk a customer shipment, subsequently putting at risk the customer trust. A complex interaction between process variables cannot be easily traced using conventional condition monitoring approaches. There is an increasing trend to use machine learning methods to assess condition based maintenance. This paper proposes a mobile App for the fault detection assessment of industrial machinery. A proposal for the design and implementation of the mobile is presented, as well as the methodology followed for the fault detection assessment. The fault detection assessment is adressed using machine learning techniques, specifically a majority voting classifier. This majority voting classifier combines the predictions of three classification methods. The results show that the majority voting approach improves the performance of the fault detection assessment in comparison with the invidual classification methods.

In this paper, we mainly focus on noise fault, short-term fault, and fixed fault caused by low battery and calibration. In recent years, a large number of machine learning-based algorithms have been proposed for the anomaly detection of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we compare and analyze the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Gradient Lifting Decision Tree (GBDT) in identifying and classifying fault. We introduce a comparative study of the above methods on experimental data sets. Experiments show that GBDT algorithm obtains a better fault detection rate.

With the appearance of low-cost IoT sensors and storage devices, it has now become possible to get very detailed data from the electricity grid system to be used for further analysis. The coming of the big data era has made the analysis easier. At the same time, we need to establish a safe transmission and distribution facilities for reliable grid operation. In this work-in-progress paper, we contribute an exploration of deep learning approach for intelligent fault detection system. The method works directly on raw temporal signals without any handcrafted feature extraction process.

According to the automatic identification of axis locus of rotating machinery, a characterization of axial trajectory based on Hu invariant moment is studied. The frequency characteristic of the vibration signal improves the search strategy of the matching algorithm, and proposes a fast matching method with variable step size. The method consists of two parts, rough matching and fine matching. The coarse matching ensures the fastness of the algorithm and quick classification of the running state. The fine matching ensures the accuracy of the matching result. The results show that the feature of the axis locus extracted by Hu invariant moments The recognition rate of rotating machinery can provide a reference for the automatic identification of rotor fault diagnosis.

The fault diagnosis is accomplished with residual voltage components (RVCs) that represent the difference between the measured stator voltages and the estimated stator voltages. The fault indicators based on RVCs are proposed to estimate the fault severity; these can distinguish the severity of the ISCF and can also detect the phase where the ISCF occurred. Simulation results from a finite element analysis tool validate the proposed method diagnoses the ISCF in different fault cases. This method can be used for early diagnosis of ISCFs in PMSMs.	[Lee, Hojin; Jeong, Hyeyun; Kim, Sang Woo] Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea		Lee, H (corresponding author), Pohang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Pohang 37673, South Korea.	suvvus@postech.edu; jhy90@postech.edu; swkim@postech.edu	Kim, Sang Woo/ABH-2461-2021		Korea Electric Power Corporation [R18XA01]	This research was supported by Korea Electric Power Corporation.

A Comparative Experimental Study on the Use of Machine Learning Approaches for Automated Valve Monitoring Based on Acoustic Emission Parameters	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL, MANUFACTURING AND PROCESS PLANT ENGINEERING (ICMMPE 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Mechanical, Manufacturing and Process Plant Engineering (ICMMPE)	NOV 22-23, 2017	Penang, MALAYSIA			Faults diagnosis; Acoustic emission; Signal analysis; Machine learning; SVM; ANN	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VECTOR MACHINE	Acoustic emission (AE) analysis has become a vital tool for initiating the maintenance tasks in many industries. However, the analysis process and interpretation has been found to be highly dependent on the experts. Therefore, an automated monitoring method would be required to reduce the cost and time consumed in the interpretation of AE signal. This paper investigates the application of two of the most common machine learning approaches namely artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) to automate the diagnosis of valve faults in reciprocating compressor based on AE signal parameters. Since the accuracy is an essential factor in any automated diagnostic system, this paper also provides a comparative study based on predictive performance of ANN and SVM. AE parameters data was acquired from single stage reciprocating air compressor with different operational and valve conditions. ANN and SVM diagnosis models were subsequently devised by combining AE parameters of different conditions. Results demonstrate that ANN and SVM models have the same results in term of prediction accuracy. However, SVM model is recommended to automate diagnose the valve condition in due to the ability of handling a high number of input features with low sampling data sets.	[Ali, Salah M.; Hui, K.

In this paper, a simple and efficient fault diagnostic approach was proposed to accommodate to the requirements of both real-time monitoring and accurate estimation of fault type as well as severity. Firstly, a four-dimensional feature extraction algorithm using entropy and Holder coefficient theories was developed to extract the characteristic vector from the vibration signals, and secondly a gray relation algorithm was employed for achieving bearing fault pattern recognition intelligently. The experimental study have illustrated the proposed approach can efficiently and effectively improve the fault diagnostic performance compared with the existing artificial intelligent methods, and can be suitable for on-line health status estimation.

The boundary information, the circumference and the area are the essential features in the identification and the classification of flaws. In order to get those information, this paper proposed a novel algorithm to get the boundary information using the boundary tracking, and to make each flaw independent by establishing a balanced binary search tree for data storage. By scanning the image and the image boundaries based on binarization transformation, there is no need to fill the region, nor need to use the chain code to count the number of regions and the boundary information. According to the established balanced binary search tree, we can calculate the number of the pixel of the area of each fault, the edge information of the boundary, and the circumference. The algorithm has the advantages of fast speed, less computation, better noise suppression and accurate results.

The modeling is based on the data-driven approach, in which probabilistic models can be constructed to capture the structure of the time series. These models allow the identification of deviations from the training data during the monitoring of the system. The paper proposes the feature vector, being the data-driven empirical diagnostic model, of mechanical vibrations in the vehicle powertrain. Dynamic analysis of wearing and/or defects of complex rotating systems confirms the presence of non-linear, non-stationary and multiscale properties. The recorded time series exhibits the impulse-like nature and fluctuations. Probability distributions often deviate from the Gaussian distribution and exhibit heavy tails. Both broad density functions, typical for stable distributions, and long-term correlations are two important sources of multifractality. Analyses of fluctuations of the recorded vibration time series were carried out utilising the dependence between selected parameters of alpha-stable distributions and measures of singularity spectra.

In some applications, the continuous operation is necessary, and then the PMSM drive outage is unacceptable or may cause great losses. Thus, several studies have been accomplished in order to detect incipient faults in PMSMs. In this context, the electrical signature analysis (ESA) technique is highlighted, because of the feasibility and non-invasive features. ESA allows the fault detection by only analyzing the electrical machine quantities. This paper proposes a study of ESA for PMSM condition monitoring. The review of some fault patterns is presented as well as the development of a scale model laboratory to simulate faults in a real PMSM in operation. The PMSM is used to drive a fluid pumping system, and different types of fluids are tested, being different load conditions from the PMSM point of view. The presented results are promising, encouraging ESA based methodologies for PMSM fault detection.

The main functions of these metalloproteinases are the degradation of the stromal connective tissue and basement membrane components. Recent data from model systems suggest that MMPs are involved in breast cancer (BC) initiation, invasion, and metastasis. Particularly, MMP-11 (stromelysin-3) is expressed in stromal fibroblasts adjacent to epithelial tumor cells, and high levels of this metalloproteinase were associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis of BC. Consequently, MMP-11 involved in these processes can be a candidate as a new potential prognostic biomarker in BC. Bioimaging techniques based on laser ablation/desorption and mass spectrometry are rapidly growing in biology and medicine for studies of biological systems to provide information of biomolecules (such as proteins, metabolites, and lipids) and metals with lateral resolution at the micrometer scale. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) has been used for the first time to investigate the distribution of MMP-11 in human breast cancer tissues in order to show a possible correlation between cancerous and healthy samples, by differential proteomics and using such differences for possible cancer diagnosis and/or prognosis. Additionally, those human breast tissue samples were analyzed in parallel by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) in order to gather additional information about the elemental distribution of Zn and its possible associations with MMPs.

To overcome existing drawbacks associated to partial nitrification (e.g., non-linearities and time-variant behaviors), our strategy is based on feature extraction over manipulated variables to identify interesting patterns associated to the end-point of nitrification. We use a support vector machine (SVM) classifier as a decision tool to determine the end-point of the aerobic phase. A database of lab-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) cycles selected from ten months of operation was used to train and test the proposed decision-making strategy. Results for all 533 SBR cycles showed 100% correct classifications. Most aerobic phase lengths in the analyzed database had a reduction time around 20 min, although time reductions greater than 60 min were also achieved.

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is essential to a spacecraft as the battery is a critical part and determines the lifetime and reliability. The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a data-driven algorithm used to estimate a battery's RUL due to its sparse feature and uncertainty management capability. Especially, some of the regressive cases indicate that the RVM can obtain a better short-term prediction performance rather than long-term prediction. As a nonlinear kernel learning algorithm, the coefficient matrix and relevance vectors are fixed once the RVM training is conducted. Moreover, the RVM can be simply influenced by the noise with the training data. Thus, this work proposes an iterative updated approach to improve the long-term prediction performance for a battery's RUL prediction. Firstly, when a new estimator is output by the RVM, the Kalman filter is applied to optimize this estimator with a physical degradation model. Then, this optimized estimator is added into the training set as an on-line sample, the RVM model is re-trained, and the coefficient matrix and relevance vectors can be dynamically adjusted to make next iterative prediction. Experimental results with a commercial battery test data set and a satellite battery data set both indicate that the proposed method can achieve a better performance for RUL estimation.

Big Data technologies including Big Data management and utilization based on increasingly collected data from every component of the power grid are crucial for the successful deployment and monitoring of the system. This paper reviews the key technologies of Big Data management and intelligent machine learning methods for complex power systems. Based on a comprehensive study of power system and Big Data, several challenges are summarized to unlock the potential of Big Data technology in the application of smart grid. This paper proposed a modified and optimized structure of the Big Data processing platform according to the power data sources and different structures. Numerous open-sourced Big Data analytical tools and software are integrated as modules of the analytic engine, and self-developed advanced algorithms are also designed. The proposed framework comprises a data interface, a Big Data management, analytic engine as well as the applications, and display module. To fully investigate the proposed structure, three major applications are introduced: development of power grid topology and parallel computing using CIM files, high-efficiency load-shedding calculation, and power system transmission line tripping analysis using 3D visualization. The real-system cases demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of the Big Data platform; therefore, data resources can achieve their full potential value for strategies and decision-making for smart grid. The proposed platform can provide a technical solution to the multidisciplinary cooperation of Big Data technology and smart grid monitoring.

J	Ma, J; Su, H; Zhao, WL; Liu, B				Ma, Jian; Su, Hua; Zhao, Wan-lin; Liu, Bin			Predicting the Remaining Useful Life of an Aircraft Engine Using a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with Multilayer Self-Learning	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							DEGRADATION ASSESSMENT; PROGNOSTICS; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL	Because they are key components of aircraft, improving the safety, reliability and economy of engines is crucial. To ensure flight safety and reduce the cost of maintenance during aircraft engine operation, a prognostics and health management system that focuses on fault diagnosis, health assessment, and life prediction is introduced to solve the problems. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) is the most important information for making decisions about aircraft engine operation and maintenance, and it relies largely on the selection of performance degradation features. The choice of such features is highly significant, but there are some weaknesses in the current algorithm for RUL prediction, notably, the inability to obtain tendencies from the data. Especially with aircraft engines, extracting useful degradation features from multisensor data with complex correlations is a key technical problem that has hindered the implementation of degradation assessment. To solve these problems, deep learning has been proposed in recent years to exploit multiple layers of nonlinear information processing for unsupervised self-learning of features. This paper presents a deep learning approach to predict the RUL of an aircraft engine based on a stacked sparse autoencoder and logistic regression. The stacked sparse autoencoder is used to automatically extract performance degradation features from multiple sensors on the aircraft engine and to fuse multiple features through multilayer self-learning. Logistic regression is used to predict the remaining useful life. However, the hyperparameters of the deep learning, which significantly impact the feature extraction and prediction performance, are determined based on expert experience in most cases. The grid search method is introduced in this paper to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed aircraft engine RUL prediction model. An application of this method of predicting the RUL of an aircraft engine with a benchmark dataset is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Forecasting fault events for predictive maintenance using data-driven techniques and ARMA modeling	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Real case study; Aircraft prognostics; Predictive maintenance; Data-driven techniques; ARMA modeling; Life usage modeling		Presently, time-based airline maintenance scheduling does not take fault predictions into account, but happens at fixed time-intervals. This may result in unnecessary maintenance interventions and also in situations where components are not taken out of service despite exceeding their designed risk of failure. To address this issue we propose a framework that can predict when a component/system will be at risk of failure in the future, and therefore, advise when maintenance actions should be taken. In order to facilitate such prediction, we employ an auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model along with data-driven techniques, and compare the performance of multiple data-driven techniques. The ARMA model adds a new feature that is used within the data driven model to give the final prediction. The novelty of our work is the integration of the ARMA methodology with data-driven techniques to predict fault events. This study reports on a real industrial case of unscheduled removals of a critical valve of the aircraft engine. Our results suggest that the support vector regression model can outperform the life usage model on the evaluation measures of sample standard deviation, median error, median absolute error, and percentage error. The generalized linear model provides an effective approach for predictive maintenance with comparable results to the baseline. The remaining data-driven models have a lower overall performance.

J	Wang, ZP; Jia, LM; Qin, Y				Wang, Zhipeng; Jia, Limin; Qin, Yong			Adaptive Diagnosis for Rotating Machineries Using Information Geometrical Kernel-ELM Based on VMD-SVD	ENTROPY			English	Article						fault diagnosis; information geometry; kernel extreme learning machine; variation mode decomposition	BEARING FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; EXTREME LEARNING MACHINES; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MAHALANOBIS DISTANCE; MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; GEAR; EMD; CLASSIFIER	Rotating machineries often work under severe and variable operation conditions, which brings challenges to fault diagnosis. To deal with this challenge, this paper discusses the concept of adaptive diagnosis, which means to diagnose faults under variable operation conditions with self-adaptively and little prior knowledge or human intervention. To this end, a novel algorithm is proposed, information geometrical extreme learning machine with kernel (IG-KELM). From the perspective of information geometry, the structure and Riemannian metric of Kernel-ELM is specified. Based on the geometrical structure, an IG-based conformal transformation is created to improve the generalization ability and self-adaptability of KELM. The proposed IG-KELM, in conjunction with variation mode decomposition (VMD) and singular value decomposition (SVD) is utilized for adaptive diagnosis: (1) VMD, as a new self-adaptive signal processing algorithm is used to decompose the raw signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). (2) SVD is used to extract the intrinsic characteristics from the matrix constructed with IMFs. (3) IG-KELM is used to diagnose faults under variable conditions self-adaptively with no requirement of prior knowledge or human intervention. Finally, the proposed method was applied on fault diagnosis of a bearing and hydraulic pump. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method by up to 7.25% and 7.78% respectively, in percentages of accuracy.

This paper proposes a novel fault diagnosis method for automotive assembly based on optical coordinate data and machine learning. First, after obtaining large amounts of measured data from sensors, a feature selection method which is based on the subset-level score is performed. Because high-dimensional data will result in high computational cost and irrelevant and redundant features may also degrade the performance of fault diagnosis. The feature selection method which can be classified into filter methods needs to choose a certain evaluation criterion first. By using a fast iterative algorithm, we can finally find the optimal subset of features. Second, for the nonlinear relationship between measured data, we introduced well-known kernel methods to efficiently improve feature extraction effect. In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best known is the support vector machines. Last, Bayesian inference classifier is built to recognize the fault pattern. The experimental on real production process data of automotive assembly show that the proposed method can greatly enhance the diagnosis accuracy.

Vibration method is considered as one of the non-destructive and economical methods to explore transformer operating condition and evaluate transformer mechanical integrity and performance. However, transformer vibration and its evaluation criteria in transformer faulty condition are quite challenging and are not yet agreed upon. At the same time, with the advent of IoT facilities and services, it is expected that classical diagnosis techniques will be replaced with more powerful data-driven prognosis methods that can be used efficiently and effectively in smart monitoring. In this paper, we first discuss in detail an analytical approach to the transformer vibration modeling. Nevertheless, precise interpretation of transformer vibration signal through analytical models becomes unrealistic as higher harmonics are mixed with fundamental harmonics in vibration spectra. Therefore, as the next step, we aim to support the Industry 4.0 concept by utilizing the state-of-the-art machine learning and signal processing techniques to develop prognosis models of transformer operating condition based on vibration signals. Transformer turn-to-turn insulation deterioration and short circuit analysis as one the most important concerns in transformer operation is practically emulated and examined. Along with transformer short-circuit study, transformer over and under excitations are also studied and evaluated. Our constructed predictive models are able to detect transformer short-circuit fault in early stages using vibration signals before transformer catastrophic failure. Real-time information is transferred to the cloud system and results become accessible over any portable device.

J	Ren, L; Sun, YQ; Wang, H; Zhang, L				Ren, Lei; Sun, Yaqiang; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Lin			Prediction of Bearing Remaining Useful Life With Deep Convolution Neural Network	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Cyber-physical-social system; industrial big data; deep learning; RUL prediction; deep convolution neural network		Cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) has drawn tremendous attention in industrial applications such as industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). As the fundamental component of IIoT, bearings play an increasingly important role in CPSS for IIoT. Better understanding of bearing working conditions and degradation patterns so as to more accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL), becomes an urgent demand for industrial prognostics in IIoT. The data-driven approach has indicated good potential, but the prediction accuracy is still not satisfactory. This paper proposes a new method for the prediction of bearing RUL based on deep convolution neural network (CNN). A new feature extraction method is presented to obtain the eigenvector, named the spectrum-principal-energy-vector. The eigenvector is suitable for deep CNN. In the prediction phase, we propose a smoothing method to deal with the discontinuity problem found in the prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such a smoothing method for bearing RUL prediction. Experiments show that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of bearing RUL.

J	Zhang, LJ; Mu, ZQ; Sun, CY				Zhang, Lijun; Mu, Zhongqiang; Sun, Changyan			Remaining Useful Life Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries Based on Exponential Model and Particle Filter	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs); exponential model; particle filter (PF); remaining useful life (RUL) prediction	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; ENERGY-STORAGE SYSTEMS; ELECTRIC VEHICLES; HEALTH ESTIMATION; KALMAN FILTER; STATE; PROGNOSTICS; MANAGEMENT; ISSUES	As the secondary widely used battery, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become the core component of the energy supply for most devices. Accurately predicting the current cycle time of LIBs is of great importance to ensure the reliability and safety of the equipment. In this paper, considering the nonlinear and non-Gaussian capacity degradation characteristics of LIBs, a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method based on the exponential model and the particle filter is proposed. The cycle life test data of LIBs published by prognostics center of excellence in national aeronautics and space administration were exponentially experiencing the rule of degradation. And then the extrapolation method was used to get the quantitative expression of the uncertainty of life expectancy of LIBs, i.e. the prediction mean and the probability distribution histogram. The prognostic horizon index and the new specific accuracy index were applied to evaluate the prediction performance. Moreover, the prediction error under different prediction starting points is given. Compared with other methods such as the auto-regressive integrated moving average model, the fusion nonlinear degradation autoregressive model and the regularized particle filter algorithm, the proposed algorithm has a better prediction performance. According to the accuracy index, the proposed prediction method has better prediction accuracy and convergence.

J	Zhao, L; Wang, X				Zhao, Lin; Wang, Xue			A Deep Feature Optimization Fusion Method for Extracting Bearing Degradation Features	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Centrifugal pump bearings; degradation feature extraction; deep neural network; grey wolf optimizer	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DATA-ACQUISITION; PROGNOSTICS; NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	Centrifugal pumps with bearings are widely used in nuclear power plants. A challenge in data driven prognostic technologies for centrifugal pump bearings is to evaluate their degradation features, which can be combined into degradation trajectory; however, the massive data gathered continuously from condition monitoring systems has created challenges to extracting degradation features effectively. The traditional degradation feature extraction methods are highly reliant on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, have limited capacities for learning the complex relationships between the degradation features and the massive amounts of measurement data, and their feature design processes are not automated and require intensive human labor. Deep neural networks offer remarkable abilities to extract features from massive data, and they can be used to automatically extract highly abstracted features that correlate well with bearing degradation. Therefore, to extract centrifugal pump bearing degradation features from massive amounts of vibration data, this paper proposes a deep feature optimization fusion method. First, data from the vibration-frequency domain are mapped to a nonlinear spatial domain using an enhanced autoencoder. Second, the neural nodes in the last hidden layer of the enhanced autoencoder are divided into several child modules. The minimum quantization errors of each child module are used as the candidate degradation features. Finally, the optimal degradation trajectory is obtained via a weighted fusion of the candidate degradation features. The optimal weighting coefficients are calculated using the grey wolf optimizer algorithm. In this paper, experiments were performed using the IEEE PHM2012 bearing prognostic data set and a centrifugal pump bearing condition monitoring data set. The results demonstrate that the degradation trajectory obtained using the proposed method offers stronger predictive capabilities than do those obtained using other methods, thereby improving the accuracy of predictions of the bearings' remaining useful life.

J	Liu, DT; Yin, XH; Song, YC; Liu, W; Peng, Y				Liu, Datong; Yin, Xuehao; Song, Yuchen; Liu, Wang; Peng, Yu			An On-Line State of Health Estimation of Lithium-Ion Battery Using Unscented Particle Filter	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; on-line SOH estimation; health indicator; unscented particle filter	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; OF-CHARGE ESTIMATION; INDICATOR EXTRACTION; CAPACITY ESTIMATION; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; ALGORITHM; REGRESSION	As one of the key functions in lithium-ion battery management system, the state-of-health (SOH) estimation is of great significance to ensure the safe and reliable operation and reduce the maintenance cost of the battery energy storage system. Unscented particle filter (UPF) algorithm is becoming a promising method for battery state estimation since it combines the latest measurement information to give the proposal distribution which is closer to the true posterior distribution. At the same time, UPF algorithm is able to represent the uncertainty involved in the estimation results, which makes great significance for battery SOH estimation. On the other hand, it is difficult to measure the battery actual capacity in practice despite the capacity is a direct indicator of battery SOH. In this paper, an on-line health indicator (HI) is extracted from the measurable parameters while battery is working. The mapping model between the extracted HI and battery SOH is established and applied as the observation in the state-space model. An online estimator based on UPF algorithm is developed for battery SOH assessment. The maximum estimation error based on battery cycling test data is less than 5%. This indicates that the proposed method has a good adaptability for lithium-ion battery degradation with non-linear and non-Gaussian characteristics. Additionally, the experiments on different types of lithium-ion battery show the good robustness and applicability of this approach.

J	Zhang, LQ; Lyu, C				Zhang, Liqiang; Lyu, Chao			Decomposition Study of Degradation Reasons for LiCoO2-Based 14500 Lithium-Ion Batteries Using a Nondestructive Method	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Degradation analysis; energy storage; lithium-ion batteries; nondestructive method	THERMAL-MODEL; CAPACITY FADE; CHARGE; CELL; QUANTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; SIMULATION; DISCHARGE	Detailed information about the components of degradation is quite beneficial for the prognostics and health management study of lithium-ion batteries. This paper reports a nondestructive method for the decomposition study of the reasons of degradation for LiCoO2 batteries. The values of parameters of the multiphysics model are obtained in a four-pattern aging test and, then, the components of the capacity fade, overpotential rise, and heat behavior are quantitatively calculated by using the identified parameters and model simulation. The capacity fade is divided into three components due to the changes of parameter, the volume fraction of active material (epsilon(s)), and stoichiometric numbers (x(0) and x(end)) during aging process. The overpotential rising is divided into three components according to the reaction overpotential and the terminal voltage equations in the multiphysics model. In addition, the heat generation is divided into three components and the heat exchange is divided into two components based on the thermal part of the multiphysics model. All the decomposition results are graphically shown, and the ratios of the degradation components are presented in tables. The proposed method is expected to extend the applications of the multiphysics model and bring a new idea to the primary diagnosis of lithium-ion battery.

J	Wang, L; Lyu, F; Su, YQ; Yue, JG				Wang, Li; Lyu, Feng; Su, Yongqing; Yue, Jiguang			Kernel Entropy-Based Classification Approach for Superbuck Converter Circuit Fault Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Power electronic circuit; superbuck converter circuit; fault classification; kernel entropy component analysis; extreme learning machine	DC-DC CONVERTERS; HEALTH MANAGEMENT; ANALOG; PROGNOSTICS; SYSTEMS; RELIABILITY; INVERTERS; DESIGN	How to extract the fault feature and how to design the classification algorithm are the two most critical problems in power electronic circuits (PECs) fault diagnosis. Based on a kernel entropy component analysis theory, combining an extreme learning machine classification algorithm, this paper explores the feasibility of applying an ensemble approach, called KECA-ELM, to deal with the hard fault and soft fault diagnosis in a superbuck converter circuit (SCC). This approach can reduce the influence of the complex correlation between the data on the accuracy of fault classification. Furthermore, it can compress the feature dimension of the data while maintaining the feature discriminating power and reduce the computation in the classification stage. We record the signal from the output of the circuit, analyze their static and dynamic electrical performance, and then select the representative feature parameters. These feature parameters are combined into feature vectors which can reflect the health status of the PECs. Finally, simulation and physical experiment are presented in the SCC to demonstrate the fault classification ability of the proposed approach.

As a result, the mortality is high, which seriously threatens the health of the people. Data were collected from the human blood samples of the hospital by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Thirty-five healthy controls and 42 sepsis patients were enrolled. Machine-learning techniques were used to diagnose the sepsis. Using the metabolic data from the sepsis patients, the proposed method has got 81.6% recognition rate, 89.57% sensitivity, and 65.77% specificity. A new learning strategy was proposed to boost the performance of the kernel extreme learning machine, known as, chaotic fruit fly optimization, and two new mechanisms were introduced into the original a fruit fly optimization, including the chaotic population initialization and the chaotic local search strategy. To further enhance the diagnosis accuracy and identify the most important biomarkers, we performed the feature selection using the random forest before the construction of the classification model. The final established model, random forest-improved fruit fly optimization algorithm-kernel extreme learning machine, was used to effectively diagnose the sepsis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results than other methods across four performance metrics. We screened out five biomarkers and performed statistical analysis on these five substances. The level of acetic acid increased (p < 0.05) in the sepsis group, while the level of linoleic acid and cholesterol decreased (p < 0.05). The promising results suggest that the developed methodology can be a useful diagnostic tool for clinical decision support.

The methodology contributes to solve current challenges dealing with classical electromechanical system monitoring approaches applied in industrial frameworks, that is, the presence of unknown events, the limitation to the nominal healthy condition as starting knowledge, and the incorporation of new patterns to the available knowledge. The proposed methodology is divided into four main stages: 1) a dedicated feature calculation and reduction over available physical magnitudes to increase novelty detection and fault classification capabilities; 2) a novelty detection based on the ensemble of one-class support vector machines to identify not previously considered events; 3) a diagnosis by means of eClass evolving classifiers for patterns recognition; and 4) re-training to include new patterns to the novelty detection and fault identification models. The effectiveness of the proposed fault detection and identification methodology has been compared with classical approaches, and verified by experimental results obtained from an automotive end-of-line test machine.

The advances in deep learning introduce new data-driven approaches to this problem. This paper proposes an integrated deep learning approach for RUL prediction of lithium-ion battery by integrating autoencoder with deep neural network (DNN). First, we present a multi-dimensional feature extraction method with autoencoder model to represent battery health degradation. Then, the RUL prediction model-based DNN is trained for multi-battery remaining cycle life estimation. The proposed approach is applied to the real data set of lithium-ion battery cycle life from NASA, and the experiment results show that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of RUL prediction.

At present, most methods based on signal processing and the shallow learning model rely on artificial feature extraction to identify the machine fault type. In practical applications, however, meaningful health management requires correct recognition of not only the health type but also the fault degree, if any occurs. Such recognition is useful for determining the priority level of mechanical maintenance and minimizing economic losses. Deep learning techniques, such as deep belief network (DBN), have demonstrated great potential in exploring characteristic information from machine status signals. In this paper, an end-to-end fault diagnosis model based on an adaptive DBN optimized by the Nesterov moment (NM) is proposed to extract deep representative features from rotating machinery and recognize bearing fault types and degrees simultaneously. Frequency-domain signals are inputted into the model for feature learning, and NM is introduced to the training process of the DBN model. Individual adaptive learning rate algorithms are then applied to optimize parameter updating. The performance of the proposed method is validated using a self-made bearing fault test platform, and the model is shown to achieve satisfactory convergence and a testing accuracy higher than those obtained from standard DBN and support vector machine.

However, sensors themselves are also prone to errors and failure. The quality of data received from these sensors should be verified before being used in system modeling. There is a need for reliable methods and systems that can provide data validation and reconciliation in real-time with high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel method for real-time data validation, gross error detection and classification over multivariate sensor data streams. The validated and high-quality data obtained from these processes is used for pattern analysis and modeling of industrial plants. We obtain sensor data from the power and petrochemical plants of an oil refinery and analyze them using various time-series modeling and data mining techniques that we integrate into a complex event processing engine. Next, we study the computational performance implications of the proposed methods and uncover regimes where they are sustainable over fast streams of sensor data. Finally, we detect shifts among steady-states of data, which represent systems' multiple operating modes and identify the time when a model reconstruction is required using DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Under Varying Working Conditions Based on Domain Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Convolutional neural networks; domain adaptation; deep learning; intelligent fault diagnosis; transfer learning	MACHINERY	Traditional intelligent fault diagnosis works well when the labeled training data (source domain) and unlabeled testing data (target domain) are drawn from the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, the working conditions can vary between training and testing time. In this paper, we address the issues of intelligent fault diagnosis when the data at training and testing time do not come from the same distribution as a domain adaptation problem using domain adaptive convolutional neural networks (DACNN). Our proposed DACNN consists of three parts: a source feature extractor, a target feature extractor, and a label classifier. We adopt a two-stage training process to obtain strong fault-discriminative and domain-invariant capacity. First, we obtain fault-discriminative features by pre-training the source feature extractor with labeled source training examples to minimize the label classifier error. Then, in the domain adaptive fine-tuning stage, we train the target feature extractor to minimize the squared maximum mean discrepancy between the output of the source and target feature extractor, such that the instances sampled from the source and target domains have similar distributions after the mapping. Furthermore, to enable training efficiency in domain adaptation, the layers between the source and target feature extractors in our DACNN are partially untied during the training stage. Experiments on the bearing and gearbox fault data showed that DACNN can achieve high fault diagnosis precision and recall under different working conditions, outperforming other intelligent fault diagnosis methods.

The fault diagnosis of rotating machines plays a vital important role to reduce the catastrophic failures and heavy economic loss. However, the measured vibration signal of rotating machinery often represents non-linear and non-stationary characteristics, resulting in difficulty in the fault feature extraction. As a statistical measure, entropy can quantify the complexity and detect dynamic change through taking into account the non-linear behavior of time series. Therefore, entropy can be served as a promising tool to extract the dynamic characteristics of rotating machines. Recently, many studies have applied entropy in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. This paper aims to investigate the applications of entropy for the fault characteristics extraction of rotating machines. First, various entropy methods are briefly introduced. Its foundation, application, and some improvements are described and discussed. The review is divided into eight parts: Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy, approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, permutation entropy, and other entropy methods. In each part, we will review the applications using the original entropy method and the improved entropy methods, respectively. In the end, a summary and some research prospects are given.

Implementation of self-aware components by prognostics and health management-based cyber-physical systems is a promising technology that can address this problem. This paper developed a precursor-based prognostics method to create self-aware low-voltage electromagnetic coils for incipient insulation degradation monitoring. Electromagnetic coils are fundamental energy conversion and transformation components of a variety of machines, such as electric motors and solenoid valves, and their insulation failure can cause catastrophic effects. Conversion of sensory data to insulation health information and development of a component/cyber-interface for integrating insulation health information to cyberspace are described. This method presents opportunities for companies to develop transparency and thus predictive maintenance of machines that incorporate electromagnetic coils.

J	Qian, WW; Li, SM; Wang, JR				Qian, Weiwei; Li, Shunming; Wang, Jinrui			A New Transfer Learning Method and Its Application on Rotating Machine Fault Diagnosis Under Variant Working Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adaptive signal processing; artificial neural network; fault diagnosis; softmax regression; sparse filtering; transfer learning	FEATURE-EXTRACTION	Effective data-driven rotating machine fault diagnosis has recently been a research topic in the diagnosis and health management of machinery systems owing to the benefits, including safety guarantee, labor saving, and reliability improvement. However, in vast real-world applications, the classifier trained on one dataset will be extended to datasets under variant working conditions. Meanwhile, the deviation between datasets can be triggered easily by rotating speed oscillation and load variation, and it will highly degenerate the performance of machine learning-based fault diagnosis methods. Hence, a novel dataset distribution discrepancy measuring algorithm called high-order Kullback-Leibler (HKL) divergence is proposed. Based on HKL divergence and transfer learning, a new fault diagnosis network which is robust to working condition variation is constructed in this paper. In feature extraction, sparse filtering with HKL divergence is proposed to learn sharing and discriminative features of the source and target domains. In feature classification, HKL divergence is introduced into softmax regression to link the domain adaptation with health conditions. Its effectiveness is verified by experiments on a rolling bearing dataset and a gearbox dataset, which include 18 transfer learning cases.

The method is designed with the ability of faulty signal automatic clustering without human knowledge. A dataset in which each sample is given a random label is configured after extracting the features of vibration signals from the frequency domain. The dataset is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) to obtain the initial classification. The classification results are assessed by testing the subsignals extracted from the raw data, and the sample labels are modified according to the evaluation result. The modified dataset is used to train the DNN a second time. Samples with characteristic faults are clustered in various classes after iterating the DNN training and testing. The proposed method is tested with the bearing data provided by the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center, which is a standard reference to test fault detection algorithms. The 12k drive end, 48k drive end, and 12k fan end CWRU bearing data are classified into 7, 6, and 4 groups, respectively. The testing results show that the proposed method can achieve automatic clustering for vibration signals with a variety of faults.

It mainly consists of three main aspects: construction of health indicators, remaining useful life prediction, and health management. Construction of health indicators aims to evaluate the system's current health condition and its critical components. Given the observations of a health indicator, prediction of the remaining useful life is used to infer the time when an engineering systems or a critical component will no longer perform its intended function. Health management involves planning the optimal maintenance schedule according to the system's current and future health condition, its critical components and the replacement costs. Construction of health indicators is the key to predicting the remaining useful life. Bearings and gears are the most common mechanical components in rotating machines, and their health conditions are of great concern in practice. Because it is difficult to measure and quantify the health conditions of bearings and gears in many cases, numerous vibration-based methods have been proposed to construct bearing and gear health indicators. This paper presents a thorough review of vibration-based bearing and gear health indicators constructed from mechanical signal processing, modeling, and machine learning. This review paper will be helpful for designing further advanced bearing and gear health indicators and provides a basis for predicting the remaining useful life of bearings and gears. Most of the bearing and gear health indicators reviewed in this paper are highly relevant to simulated and experimental run-to-failure data rather than artificially seeded bearing and gear fault data. Finally, some problems in the literature are highlighted and areas for future study are identified.

J	Tootooni, MS; Rao, PK; Chou, CA; Kong, ZY				Tootooni, Mohammad Samie; Rao, Prahalad K.; Chou, Chun-An; Kong, Zhenyu (James)			A Spectral Graph Theoretic Approach for Monitoring Multivariate Time Series Data From Complex Dynamical Processes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Anomaly detection; chemical mechanical planarization (CMP); data fusion; Fiedler number; multisensor monitoring; sensor fusion; spectral graph theory; ultraprecision machining (UPM)	NEURAL-NETWORKS	The objective of this paper is to monitor complex process dynamics manifest in multivariate (multidimensional) time series data using a spectral (algebraic) graph theoretic approach. We test the hypothesis that the spectral graph-based topological invariants detect incipient process drifts earlier [lower average run length (ARL1)] and with higher fidelity (consistency of detection) when compared with the conventional statistics-based approaches. The presented approach maps a multidimensional sensor data stream X-Nxd (visualize N as time and d as the number of sensors) as an unweighted and undirected network graph G(V, E), indexed by its vertices V and edges E, i.e., X bar right arrow G(V, E). The rationale is that the graph-based topological invariants are surrogate representatives of the system state. We compare the monitoring performance of spectral graph theoretic invariants with conventional statistical features in an exponentially weighted moving average control chart setting. The practical utility of the approach is substantiated in the context of process monitoring in two advanced manufacturing scenarios, namely, ultraprecision machining (UPM) and semiconductor chemical mechanical planarization. These studies corroborate the hypothesis that graph theoretic invariants, when used as monitoring statistics, lead to lower ARL1 and more consistent detections in contrast to conventional statistical features. For instance, in the UPM case, the fault detection delay using graph theoretic invariants is less than 160 ms, compared with over 8 s of delay with statistical features. Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the critical problem of capturing process drifts from multidimensional (multisensor) data. The novelty of this paper is the development of a graph theoretic approach that combines signals from multiple in situ sensors for detecting abnormal process drifts. We show that this approach, which invokes graph-based topological invariants instead of statistical feature mining, is capable of capturing process drifts at an earlier stage (in terms of detection delay or lower average run length) and higher consistency of detection than conventional statistical features. As a practical consequence of this research, the operator can track the status of a complex process in a tractable control chart setting with only two graph theoretic topological invariants, as opposed to complex black-box models involving several features.

J	Zhu, KP; Liu, TS				Zhu, Kunpeng; Liu, Tongshun			Online Tool Wear Monitoring Via Hidden Semi-Markov Model With Dependent Durations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM); remaining useful life (RUL); tool condition monitoring	MACHINING PROCESSES; PROGNOSTICS; DIAGNOSTICS; ALGORITHM	The tool wear monitoring (TWM) system that could estimate tool wear conditions and predict remaining useful life (RUL) is important to meet the high precision requirement and improve productivity in automated machining. Due to its good properties in representing nonstationary and complex physical process, hidden semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is adapted to model the progressive tool wear in this paper. In order to describe the time-variant transition probability of tool wear states and the state duration dependency, the HSMM is improved by learning the duration parameters and RUL distribution database. The Forward algorithm is utilized for online tool wear estimation and remaining life prognosis, and an online implementation approach is developed to reduce computational cost. Experimental results show that the approach is effective and the proposed method of duration dependency modeling leads to more accurate TWM in high speed milling.

J	Sun, JD; Yan, CH; Wen, JT				Sun, Jiedi; Yan, Changhong; Wen, Jiangtao			Intelligent Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method Combining Compressed Data Acquisition and Deep Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bearing fault; compressed sensing (CS); deep neural network (DNN); intelligent diagnosis; stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; TRANSFORM	Effective intelligent fault diagnosis has long been a research focus on the condition monitoring of rotary machinery systems. Traditionally, time-domain vibration-based fault diagnosis has some deficiencies, such as complex computation of feature vectors, excessive dependence on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, and limited capacity for learning complex relationships in fault signals. Furthermore, following the increase in condition data, how to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis has become an urgent need to solve. Inspired by the idea of compressed sensing and deep learning, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed for fault identification of rotating machines. In this paper, a nonlinear projection is applied to achieve the compressed acquisition, which not only reduces the amount of measured data that contained all the information of faults but also realizes the automatic feature extraction in transform domain. For exploring the discrimination hidden in the acquired data, a stacked sparse autoencoders-based deep neural network is established and performed with an unsupervised learning procedure followed by a supervised fine-tuning process. We studied the significance of compressed acquisition and provided the effects of key factors and comparison with traditional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using data sets from rolling element bearings and the analysis shows that it is able to obtain high diagnotic accuracies and is superior to the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the need of human labor and expertise and provides new strategy to handle the massive data more easily.

J	Duran, MJ; Gonzalez-Prieto, I; Rios-Garcia, N; Barrero, F				Duran, Mario J.; Gonzalez-Prieto, Ignacio; Rios-Garcia, Natalia; Barrero, Federico			A Simple, Fast, and Robust Open-Phase Fault Detection Technique for Six-Phase Induction Motor Drives	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault detection; multiphase induction motor drives; open-phase faults (OPFs)	PERMANENT-MAGNET MACHINES; MULTIPHASE MACHINES; TOLERANT CONTROL; PARAMETER-IDENTIFICATION; OPERATION; DIAGNOSIS; CONTROLLERS; CONVERTERS; DESIGN	Fault tolerance is much appreciated at industry in applications with high-reliability requirements. Due to their inherent fault-tolerant capability against open-phase faults (OPFs), drives with multiple three-phase windings are ideal candidates in such applications and for this reason many efforts have been devoted to the development of different fault-tolerant control strategies. Fault detection is, however, a previous and mandatory stage in the creation of fault-tolerant drives, and the study of specific OPF detection methods for six-phase drives is still scarce. Taking advantage of the secondary currents (so called x-y currents) that are unique in multiphase machines, this study proposes new fault indices that detect and locate the OPFs without additional hardware. The method proves to be simple and independent of the operating point, control technique, and drive parameters. Comparative experimental results confirm the capability of the proposed method to achieve fast detection times with good robustness.

The structure function is a good tool for tracking the magnitude and location of degradation in power modules. The ability to keep regular track of the actual degradation level of themodules enables the adoption of preventive maintenance, reducing or even eliminating altogether the appearance of failures during operation, significantly improving the availability of the power devices. The novelty in this work is the complete system that is used to achieve degradation monitoring, combining the heating technique and the measurement without additional power components except the measurement circuit which can be integrated into the gate drive board and the challenges encountered. Experimental results obtained from this show that it is possible to implement an on-board health monitoring system in converters which measures the degradation on power modules.

J	Deutsch, J; He, D				Deutsch, Jason; He, David			Using Deep Learning-Based Approach to Predict Remaining Useful Life of Rotating Components	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bearing; condition monitoring; gearbox; machine learning; prediction methods; prognostics	NETWORKS	In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, prognostic and health management (PHM) systems are used to collect massive real-time data from mechanical equipment. PHM big data has the characteristics of large-volume, diversity, and high-velocity. Effectively mining features from such data and accurately predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the rotating components with new advanced methods become issues in PHM. Traditional data driven prognostics is based on shallow learning architectures, requires establishing explicit model equations and much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and prognostic expertise, and therefore is limited in the age of big data. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for RUL prediction of rotating components with big data. The presented approach is tested and validated using data collected from a gear test rig and bearing run-to-failure tests and compared with existing PHM methods. The test results show the promising RUL prediction performance of the deep learning-based approach.

This deficiency implies serious obstructions in the development of using those signals as a complete and reliable condition monitoring technology. This study presents a new method to translate single point outer and inner race bearing faults into specific movements of the rotor with respect to the stator. The method contains the excitation of a simplified mass-spring-damper bearing model by analytical constructed fault-related force functions. Furthermore, a novel approach in order to emulate those obtained specific fault-related rotor movements with the use an experimental test setup is described, dimensioned, simulated and validated. Replacing the drive-end bearing of the induction machine under test by an active magnetic bearing creates the opportunity to continuously manipulate the rotor's position. The estimated single point bearing fault-related rotor movements serve as set-point for the magnetic bearing, resulting in the achievement of a single point bearing fault emulator with high relevance and reproducibility. This study includes experimental results of an emulated single point outer race bearing fault on an 11 kW induction machine.

Missing data imputation is used to avoid information loss (due to downsampling or discarding incomplete records). A recent deep -learning technique, variational autoencoders (VAEs), has been used for missing data imputation in image data, and was compared here to imputation by mean replacement and by principal component analysis (PCA) imputation. The techniques were compared using a synthetic, nonlinear dataset, and a simulated milling circuit dataset, which included process disturbances, measurement noise, and feedback control. Each dataset was corrupted with missing values in 20% of records (lightly corrupted) and in 90% of records (heavily corrupted). For both lightly and heavily corrupted datasets, the root mean squared error of prediction for VAE imputation was lower than the traditional methods. Possibilities for the extension of missing data imputation to inferential sensing are discussed. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Then the collected information is further used for different purposes, such as performance evaluation, anomaly detection and fault diagnosis of the complex systems. The first step of analyzing the large data sets is to discover the degree of similarity between preliminary given pairs of data sets. In this paper the similarity analysis of large data sets is performed by using the so called grid fuzzy models (GFM), combined with a procedure of fuzzy decision making The GFM are defined over an incomplete grid in the multidimensional input space and the number of the fuzzy rules depends on the concrete distribution of the data sets in this input space. The GFM is used to generate two important characteristics of the data set that are further processed by the fuzzy decision unit in order to produce the similarity degree.

Among these methods, Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machines (DAG-SVM) has been widely adopted due to its ability to handle the multi-class problem. Different from traditional DAG-SVM, a structure-selected DAG-SVM (ssDAG-SVM) is proposed such that the diagnosis performance will not degrade because of inappropriate node structure. By introducing the concept of class separability, the principle of evaluating the degree of class separability is integrated into the process of constructing the DAG-SVM structure. Subsequently, a proper structure can be selected to realize the planetary gearbox fault diagnosis with high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is illustrated by some practical experiments. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While PdM can be administered using various methods, growing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has lead to current state of the art PdM relying on machine learning (ML) technology. Like other tools used in PdM for asset management, standards for applying ML technology for PdM are required. This work introduces a standard of practice in regards to usage of asset data to develop ML analytic tools for PdM. It provides a standard method for ensuring asset data is in a form conducive to ML algorithms, and ensuring retention of asset information necessary for optimum PdM during the data transform. In the ML domain, it has been proven through research initiatives that the data structure used to train and test ML algorithms has a great impact on their performance and accuracy. Using poorly trained models for estimation due to improper data usage, can leave some AI-based PdM tools vulnerable to high rates of inaccurate estimations. Thus, leading to value loss during an asset's life cycle. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Since most energy systems and machines show a degradation in energy performance when a failure is starting to develop, monitoring this parameter can result in early behavioral anomalies identification and consequently in the implementation of more timely countermeasures. As the presence of energy consumption monitoring systems is becoming increasingly more widespread, the use of energy consumption monitoring as a way to detect failures is quite interesting because it can enable the introduction of early detection methods for a broad spectrum of failures without the need of specific instrumentation. Furthermore, the promotion of energy performance is also useful as a quality indicator of the process itself. Thus, this paper describes a methodology to monitor the energy consumption performance of a compressed air generation system in an industrial plant to detect anomalies using artificial neural networks. The use of ANNs allows an accurate characterization of the system in a healthy state. Then, by comparing the model prediction and the actual energy consumption, residuals are calculated and plotted in a control chart. The setting of limits and frequency of control enables the management to decide the sensitivity of the control system itself.

Traditional parity space-based FD is usually difficult to achieve acceptable tradeoff between missed alarm rate (MAR) and false alarm rate (FAR) without the exact stochastic properties of unknown input. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel method of parity space-based FD by MEMPM. Firstly, the integrated design of parity space vector, threshold, MAR and FAR is formulated as a problem of binary classification, i.e., the fault-free case and faulty case. By using the method of MEMPM, a bank of parity space vectors corresponding to different faulty scenarios and a threshold are then obtained, while an optimal trade-off between MAR and FAR is achieved in the worst-case setting.

J	Song, CY; Liu, KB				Song, Changyue; Liu, Kaibo			Statistical degradation modeling and prognostics of multiple sensor signals via data fusion: A composite health index approach	IISE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Indirect supervised learning; multisensor fusion; quantile regression	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; INVERSE GAUSSIAN PROCESS; PREDICTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; DIAGNOSTICS; ALGORITHMS; ENSEMBLE	Nowadays multiple sensors are widely used to simultaneously monitor the degradation status of a unit. Because those sensor signals are often correlated and measure different characteristics of the same unit, effective fusion of such a diverse "gene pool" is an important step to better understanding the degradation process and producing a more accurate prediction of the remaining useful life. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel data fusion method that constructs a composite Health Index (HI) via the combination of multiple sensor signals for better characterizing the degradation process. In particular, we formulate the problem as indirect supervised learning and leverage the quantile regression to derive the optimal fusion coefficient. In this way, the prognostic performance of the proposed method is guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that provides the theoretical analysis of the data fusion method for degradation modeling and prognostics. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the proposed method in different scenarios. A case study on the degradation of aircraft engines is also performed, which shows the superior performance of our method over existing HI-based methods.

It is not a rare case that a multi-rotor aircraft is severely damaged or crushed when an actuator or sensor is malfunctioned. This paper aims at the resilience of an aircraft when a rotor is malfunctioned. Design/methodology/approach The reliability of a multi-rotor aircraft can be measured in terms of stability, robustness, resilience and fault tolerance. All of these four aspects are taken into consideration to improve overall reliability of aircrafts. When a rotor malfunction occurs, the control algorithm is cable of adjusting the operation conditions of the rest of rotors to achieve system stability. Findings In this paper, the authors first present a research topic on the development of a resilient multi-robot aircraft. A multi-rotor aircraft usually possesses more actuated motions than the required degrees of freedom. Originality/value The authors proposed to equip the multi-rotor aircraft with malfunction detecting sensors, and they developed the self-repairing algorithm to re-stabilize the aircraft when a malfunction of a rotor occurs. The design concept and methods were implemented on an eight-rotor aircraft, and the performance of the proposed instrumentation and self-repairing algorithm have been verified and validated.

In order to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and obtain the global optimal solutions with a higher probability, two strategies, i.e. a hybrid particle position updating strategy and a fixed iteration interval intervention updating strategy, are designed to balance the effect of the local and the global search. These methods increase the diversity of particles, expand the particles ability of searching the entire solution space, and guide the particles adaptively jumping out of the local optimal area. Meanwhile, based on the shorter intra-class distance, longer inter-class distance and maximum classification accuracy of training samples, a fitness function is designed to constraint the output optimal class centers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed S-PSO classification algorithm can overcome the problems in the classical clustering algorithms, which only consider the similarity of data instead of their physical meanings. The comparison on GE90 engine borescope image texture feature classification is also conducted. The results show that the performance of S-PSO classification algorithm is robust.

Product quality management based on CNC machine fault prognostics and diagnosis	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, AUTOMATION AND CONTROL SYSTEMS 2017	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering, Automation and Control Systems (MEACS)	DEC 04-06, 2017	Tomsk, RUSSIA				MAINTENANCE	This paper presents a new fault classification model and an integrated approach to fault diagnosis which involves the combination of ideas of Neuro-fuzzy Networks (NF), Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) and Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm on a single platform. In the new model, faults are categorized in two aspects, namely first and second degree faults. First degree faults are instantaneous in nature, and second degree faults are evolutional and appear as a developing phenomenon which starts from the initial stage, goes through the development stage and finally ends at the mature stage. These categories of faults have a lifetime which is inversely proportional to a machine tool's life according to the modified version of Taylor's equation. For fault diagnosis, this framework consists of two phases: the first one is focusing on fault prognosis, which is done online, and the second one is concerned with fault diagnosis which depends on both off-line and on-line modules. In the first phase, a neuro-fuzzy predictor is used to take a decision on whether to embark Conditional Based Maintenance (CBM) or fault diagnosis based on the severity of a fault. The second phase only comes into action when an evolving fault goes beyond a critical threshold limit called a CBM limit for a command to be issued for fault diagnosis. During this phase, DBN and PF techniques are used as an intelligent fault diagnosis system to determine the severity, time and location of the fault. The feasibility of this approach was tested in a simulation environment using the CNC machine as a case study and the results were studied and analyzed.	[Kozlov, A. M.; Al-jonid, Kh M.; Kozlov, A.

Since most industries and plants make use of rotational equipment, vibration analysis plays a major role in detecting machine defects and developing flaws before the equipment fails and potentially damages other related equipment and to avoid unwanted breakdowns and downtime. Vibration analysis can help increase the lifetime of equipment when the faults are diagnosed at the right time. Vibration analysis of a rotating table top model is also done to show that some faults might exist even though they are not visible to the naked eye.

J	Liu, J; An, YC; Dou, RL; Ji, HP				Liu, Jing; An, Yacheng; Dou, Runliang; Ji, Haipeng			Dynamic deep learning algorithm based on incremental compensation for fault diagnosis model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning; Dynamic compensation; Fault diagnosis; Denoising Autoencoder; Incremental learning	REPRESENTATION; NETWORK	As one of research and practice hotspots in the field of intelligent manufacturing, the machine learning approach is applied to diagnose and predict equipment fault for running state data. Despite deep learning approach overcomes the problem that the traditional machine learning approaches for fault diagnosis is difficult to characterize the complex mapping between the massive fault data, the exponentially grown and newly generated data is learned repeatedly, and these approaches cannot incrementally correct the model to adapt the situation that the states and properties of equipment are changed over time, resulting in the increase of time costs and the decrease of diagnosis accuracy of model. In this paper, a dynamic deep learning algorithm based on incremental compensation is proposed. Firstly, the feature modes of the newly generated data are extracted by using deep learning algorithm; it is then compared with the fault modes extracted from the historical data. Next, a similarity computing model is presented to dynamically adjust the weights of incrementally merged modes. Finally, the SVM algorithm is employed to classify the weighted modes by supervised way, and the BP algorithm utilized to fine tune the model, in order to complete the dynamic and compensatory adjustment of deep learning with original modes and incremental modes. The experimental results of bearing running data demonstrate that the proposed approach could significantly improve the accuracy of diagnosis and save the time cost, contributing to meet the varied needs of the real- time equipment fault diagnosis.

The learning phase of the algorithm is executed during the regular production process and is based on observations of the behaviour of the production station and energy consumption measurements. The collected information is then processed using data-mining procedures in order to find the clusters that reflect the energy consumption profiles that are specific for different variants of production. The profiles are used to monitor energy efficiency and detect anomalies. The main benefit of the proposed approach is its flexibility. No additional calibrating operations or technological knowledge are required. Although the presented proof by research results are focussed on pneumatic air installations, the proposed methodology can also be used for other media. The output of the proposed solution is a very precise estimation of energy consumption in reference to a given variant of production. It allows for the accurate detection of compressed air consumption anomalies. Such anomalies can be caused by technical (machine faults) and technological (human errors) problems. The proposed methodology can be applied for the optimisation of energy consumption and for the detection of machine maintenance problems that are visible through abnormal compressed air consumption.

To perform efficient diagnostic results the cross-validation procedure input data is partitioned into three sets: a training set, a validation set and a test set. The stator RMS values of three-phase voltages and currents are used as model inputs to identify the different types of faults and the normal operating mode. Efficiency of these three neural based methods is compared using a test set of 100 data.

Nanoparticles based on superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) provide a promising delivery system. In this study, we aimed to explore a novel nanoparticle, which is composed of SPIO. Materials and methods: The particles have a core of iron oxide that is modified by galactose (Gal) and polyethylenimine (PEI), which act as shells, providing targeted delivery of therapeutic siRNA to the liver cancer. Gal-PEI-SPIO nanoparticles were synthesized, and the characteristics of the Gal-PEI-SPIO encapsulated with siRNA were analyzed. Results: The particles remained nanoparticles and displayed negligible cytotoxicity when loaded with siRNA. In a serum stability assay, the Gal-PEI-SPIO nanoparticles could shield the siRNA from serum degradation and prolong the half-life of the siRNA in the system. Simultaneously, we found that the mixture could be efficiently taken up by Hepa1-6 cells in a flow cytometry assay. To study the anticancer effect, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to validate the silencing efficacy of the complexes in vitro. Subsequently, the nanoparticle mixtures were administered intravenously to tumor-bearing mice to explore the tissue distribution and the effect of the siRNA against cancer. We found that the nanoparticles could provide targeted siRNA delivery, accumulate easily in orthotopic tumors, enhance siRNA accumulation in the tumor tissues for 24 h and protect the siRNA from serum nuclease degradation in comparison with the control group. After these study procedures, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were removed to compare the tumor size and analyze the therapeutic effect on tumor growth. The tumor volume and the liver/body weight ratio were significantly reduced in the si-c-Met therapy groups. Additionally, the mRNA levels were also lower than those observed in the controls. Conclusion: Based on these results, we concluded that Gal-PEI-SPIO represents a promising and efficient platform for siRNA delivery in tumor therapy.

This paper presents a novel autonomous health management scheme on rail vehicles driven by permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Firstly, the PMSMs are modeled based on first principle to deduce the initial profile of pneumatic braking (p-braking) force, then which is utilized for realtime demagnetization monitoring and degradation prognosis through similarity-based theory and generate prognosis-enhanced p-braking force strategy for final optimal control. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and benefit of using the real-time prognostics and health management (PHM) information in vehicle 'drive-brake' control automatically. The results show that accurate demagnetization monitoring, degradation prognosis, and real-time capability for control optimization can be obtained, which can effectively relieve brake shoe wear.

J	Duan, LX; Xie, MY; Wang, JJ; Bai, TB				Duan, Lixiang; Xie, Mengyun; Wang, Jinjiang; Bai, Tangbo			Deep learning enabled intelligent fault diagnosis: Overview and applications	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning; machinery fault diagnosis; feature learning; conventional machine learning	KAISER ENERGY OPERATOR; NEURAL-NETWORK; ALGORITHM; FUSION	With movement toward complication and automation, modern machinery equipment encounters the problems of diversity and complex origination of faults, incipient weak faults, complicated monitoring systems, and massive monitoring data, which are all challenging current fault diagnosis technologies. Conventional machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine and back propagation, have disadvantages in handling the non-linear relationships and complicated structure of massive data. Deep learning (DL) methods have a greater capability to address complex and heterogeneous machinery signals, and identify faults more accurately. This paper presents a review of DL methods in emerging research in the machinery fault diagnosis field. First, common DL models are briefly described. Then, the application of DL to machinery fault diagnosis is described in detail, including the problems DL aims to solve and the achievements it has accomplished thus far. To demonstrate the capability of DL to handle the multiplicity and complexity of equipment faults and massive data, we examine experimental results for typical reciprocating compressor and bearing. Finally, the limitations and trends of further DL development are discussed.

Through extracting the statistical features were extracted from the sub-bands of vibration signals decomposed by wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), the high-dimensional feature set could be obtained. Following that, the improved kernel space distance evaluation method was applied to remove non-sensitive fault features. Then, a semi-supervised manifold learning method (OSSLLTSA) was proposed to reduce the dimensionality of the fault feature set, and thus to extract fused fault features with high clustering performance. OSSLLTSA overcomes the over-learning of supervised manifold learning and projection aimlessness of unsupervised manifold learning. Finally, the low-dimensional feature set after dimension reduction was inputted into TSVM for fault diagnosis. TSVM was able to completely utilize the fault information contained in unlabelled samples to modify the model, and the trained fault diagnosis model has better generalization ability. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified based on the case of gearbox fault. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is able to achieve very high fault diagnosis accuracy even when labeled samples were insufficient.

The consequences of a bearing fault range from production losses to critical safety issues. To mitigate these consequences condition based maintenance is gaining momentum. This is based on a variety of fault diagnosis techniques where fuzzy clustering plays an important role as it can be used in fault detection, classification, and prognosis. A variety of clustering algorithms have been proposed and applied in this context. However, when the extensive literature on this topic is investigated, it is not clear which clustering algorithm is the most suitable, if any. In an attempt to bridge this gap, in this study four representative fuzzy clustering algorithms are compared under the same experimental realistic conditions: fuzzy c-means (FCM), the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm, FN-DBSCAN, and FCMFP. The study considers only real-world bearing vibration data coming from both a benchmark data set (CWRU) and from a lab setup where interference between bearing faults can be studied. The comparison takes into account the quality of the generated partitions measured by the external quality (Rand and Adjusted Rand) indexes. The conclusions of the study are grounded in statistical tests of hypotheses.

In general, most models used for fault diagnosis are based on the same data distribution, whereas applying equipment to practical productions and operations are mostly done under variable conditions. This often produces changes in data distribution and makes the model unavailable. As one of the most commonly used pieces of equipment in industry, a reciprocating compressor operates under various operating conditions (e.g., variable speed), which may produce changes in data distribution. Thus, the current model established under stable conditions is no longer applicable for fault diagnosis under variable conditions. To solve this problem of variable conditions, a model should be established that 1) reduces the differences caused by different operating conditions as much as possible, and 2) learns representative fault features under different working conditions. Thus, a new strategy that employs an auxiliary model is proposed that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a marginalized stacked denoising autoencoder (mSDA). In our method, 1) the pre-training model CNN is used for feature learning, and 2) the learned features are transformed by mSDA to eliminate data distribution differences between different conditions. A statistical measure based on kernel maximum mean discrepancy is used to evaluate the differences across different domains. Experimental results of a reciprocating compressor under different operating conditions demonstrate that the proposed method can learn class sensitive features and eliminate differences with changing working conditions. It also obtains higher classification accuracy for reciprocating compressor diagnosis under different working conditions.

Characterization of such signals using nonlinear time series analysis can be a good alternative for identifying gear faults. This paper presets a recurrence network based approach to extract features from vibration signals for gear fault diagnosis. Quantitative parameters (such as mean degree centrality, global clustering coefficient, assortativity of the recurrence network, or network entropy) related to the dynamical complexity of the vibration signals are calculated from the generated recurrence network to help classify different gear faults with two kinds of classifiers, i.e., support vector machine and extreme learning machine. Experimental studies performed on two different gear test systems have verified the effectiveness of the presented recurrence network approach for gear fault severity evaluation, as well as gear fault classification.

J	Liao, YX; Zhang, L; Li, WH				Liao, Yixiao; Zhang, Lei; Li, Weihua			Regrouping particle swarm optimization based variable neural network for gearbox fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Gearbox fault diagnosis; regrouping particle swarm optimization; neural network; variable	ROTATING MACHINERY; ALGORITHM; DECOMPOSITION; AUTOENCODER	Machine learning based intelligent diagnosis methods can adaptively generate the fault diagnosis model by historical data, which have attracted much attention. Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the most important tools for gearbox intelligent diagnosis. However, the training of ANN has the problem of local optima, and it is hard to determine the ANN structure. These problems have great influence on the diagnosis performance of ANN. In this paper, a variable neural network (RegPSOVNN) is proposed for gearbox fault diagnosis based on regrouping particle swarm optimization. Ten time-domain features are selected to form the input of the ANN. Regrouping particle swarm optimization (RegPSO) is utilized for the optimization of ANN structure and network training. It can simultaneously optimize the structure and parameters of ANN and effectively avoid the problem of local optima. To evaluate the diagnosis performance of the proposed method, gearbox failure experiments were conducted, and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), firefly variable neural network (FAVNN) and particle swarm optimization based variable neural network (PSOVNN) were used for comparison. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method can effectively optimize the network structure and diagnosis the gearbox faults.

However, current studies cannot fully consider the influence of imperfect maintenance activities that the equipment may experience on the degradation process and prognostic result. In this paper, we propose a degradation model subjected to the influence of imperfect maintenance for life prediction. Firstly, the multi-stage Wiener process is employed to characterize the influence of imperfect maintenance activities on the degradation level and degradation rate. Then, the theoretical expression of life probability distribution is derived under the concept of first hitting time using the convolution operation, and the approximate expression of life probability distribution is evaluated by the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. Furthermore, we utilize the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate unknown parameters in the concerned model. Finally, a numerical example and a practical case study are provided to substantiate the practicality and effectiveness of the newly proposed life prediction method. The results indicate that the proposed model can guarantee that the relative error (RE) is almost below 5%.

J	Cheng, ZW; Cai, B				Cheng, Zhiwei; Cai, Bin			Predicting the remaining useful life of rolling element bearings using locally linear fusion regression	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Remaining useful life; multi-feature fusion; regression; locally linear embedding; rolling element bearings	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of rolling element bearings (REBs) has emerged as a vital technique for guaranteeing the safety, availability, and efficiency of rotating machinery systems. An approach using locally linear fusion regression (LLFR) is developed for the RUL prediction of REBs. The original features, derived from the time domain and time-frequency domain of the vibration signal of the REBs, are extracted first. Utilizing locally linear embedding, the extracted features are then fused into a condition indicator reflecting the entire degradation process. The adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system is then introduced for the RUL prediction. The reported approach is investigated with real REB data. Peer models are employed to validate the performance of the proposed method in this work. The derived experimental results indicate that LLFR has superior prediction ability as compared to the peer models in terms of the introduced performance criteria and that it can obtain more reliable and precise prediction results.

J	Li, XC; Duan, F; Bennett, I; Mba, D				Li, Xiaochuan; Duan, Fang; Bennett, Ian; Mba, David			Canonical variate analysis, probability approach and support vector regression for fault identification and failure time prediction	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Condition monitoring; canonical variate analysis; cox proportional hazard model; support vector regression	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORKS	Reciprocating compressors are widely used in oil and gas industry for gas transport, lift and injection. Critical compressors that compress flammable gases and operate at high speeds are high priority equipment on maintenance improvement lists. Identifying the root causes of faults and estimating remaining usable time for reciprocating compressors could potentially reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and improve safety and availability. In this study, Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPHM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models are employed to identify fault related variables and predict remaining usable time based on sensory data acquired from an operational industrial reciprocating compressor. 2-D contribution plots for CVA-based residual and state spaces were developed to identify variables that are closely related to compressor faults. Furthermore, a SVR model was used as a prognostic tool following training with failure rate vectors obtained from the CPHM and health indicators obtained from the CVA model.

J	Kan, C; Yang, H; Kumara, S				Kan, Chen; Yang, Hui; Kumara, Soundar			Parallel computing and network analytics for fast Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) machine information processing and condition monitoring	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); Big data analytics; Parallel computing; Large-scale network; Machine condition monitoring; Power consumption	TOOLS	Rapid advancement in sensing, communication, and mobile technologies brings a new wave of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). IIoT integrates a large number of sensors for smart and connected monitoring of machine conditions. Sensor observations contain rich information on operational signatures of machines, thereby providing a great opportunity for machine condition monitoring and control. However, realizing the full potential of IIoT depends to a great extent on the development of new methodologies using big data analytics. This paper presents a new methodology for large-scale IIoT machine information processing, network modeling, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis. First, we introduce a dynamic warping algorithm to characterize the dissimilarity of machine signatures (e.g., power profiles during operations). Second, we develop a stochastic network embedding algorithm to construct a large-scale network of IIoT machines, in which the dissimilarity between machine signatures is preserved in the network node-to-node distance. When the machine condition varies, the location of the corresponding network node changes accordingly. As such, node locations will reveal diagnostic information about machine conditions. However, the network embedding algorithm is computationally expensive in the presence of large amounts of 11 T-enabled machines. Therefore, we further develop a parallel computing scheme that harnesses the power of multiple processors for efficient network modeling of large-scale IIoT-enabled machines. Experimental results show that the developed algorithm efficiently and effectively characterizes the variations of signatures in both cycle-to-cycle and machine-to-machine scales. This new approach shows strong potentials for optimal machine scheduling and maintenance in the context of large-scale IIoT. (C) 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

The rapid development of sensor and communication technologies has enabled multiple sensors to simultaneously monitor and track the health status of a unit in real time. However, one challenging question that remains to be resolved is how to leverage data from multiple sensors for better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis, especially when there are multiple failure modes. Currently, many of the existing approaches in prognostics either (a) fail to capture the dependency between sensors and instead focus on analyzing each sensor independently or (b) fail to incorporate the failure-mode diagnosis for better degradation modeling and prognostics during condition monitoring. To address the limitations in the existing literature, we propose a data-level fusion methodology to construct a composite failure-mode index, named FM-INDEX, via the fusion of multiple sensor data. Our goal is to utilize the FM-INDEX to better characterize the failure mode of an operating unit in real time, thus leading to better degradation modeling and prognostic analysis. A case study that involves the degradation data set of an aircraft gas turbine engine with two potential failure modes is conducted to numerically evaluate the performance of our proposed method compared to other techniques in the related literature.

Parametric vibration Analysis of Rotating Machinery	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Applications (IConAMMA)	AUG 17-19, 2017	Bengaluru, INDIA	Amrita Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn		Ball bearing; Rotating Machinery; Parametric vibration Analysis	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; DEFECTS; MODEL	In rotating machinery, the most extensively used element is the rolling bearing element around 90%. Based on the size speed and lubrication technique the classification of the bearing is done. The premature failure of this rolling bearing element is most common and the factors are countless. A very small percentage of these bearings are able to work for full life span provided with operating condition subjected. For all the types of defects in bearings can be studied and characterized by vibration spectrums. In the different types of measurement technique for detecting, the defects in the bearings vibration signature play prominent role. In this paper, a new parametric Analysis of ball bearing in rotating machinery with respect to vibration spectrum is carried out for that an experimental test rig is designed considering the outer race defect in the ball bearing. For these the vibration spectrum obtained for the test ball bearing based on the time and frequency domain is parametrically studied under radial load and constant speed. And these parametric data obtained from the vibration signatures measured for the different time span, is used as statistics for accurate assessment of bearing failure with respect to time and ascertain the exact defect locations in outer race of the bearings.

In this paper, the degradation model of ball screw is proposed based on wear calculation-based degradation analysis and experimental data-based validation. At first, fatigue wear is analyzed to be the predominant degradation mode of ball screw. The wear volume formula of ball screw is derived as the function of working load and stroke number. Secondly, the degradation rate of ball screw is analyzed to be affected by the total degradation and wear rate. Based on this finding, the degradation model of ball screw is theoretically derived as an exponential model by inputting wear volume formula. Thirdly, experimental data-based cross-validation method is proposed to validate the exponential degradation model. Determination coefficients are calculated to evaluate the fitting degree between the degradation model and real degradation path. Next, run-to-failure test of ball screw is carried out to collect experimental data in different working conditions. The average determination coefficient of different working conditions is calculated as 0.7848, which indicates that the proposed model can well fit the actual degradation path. In addition, the proposed model is applied to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of the tested ball screwby using collected data. RUL is estimated in a high and stable accuracy after 168000 strokes. For further validation, comparison with linear model is performed. All results show that the exponential degradation model is reasonable and correct in reflecting the degradation process of ball screw.

J	Chen, AY; Kurfess, TR				Chen, Aoyu; Kurfess, Thomas R.			A new model for rolling element bearing defect size estimation	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bearing diagnostics; Condition based maintenance; Defect size estimation; Machine monitoring	SPALL SIZE; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSTICS; PROGNOSTICS; SIGNAL; PATH	A new model based on the Hertzian contact theorem is proposed to estimate the size of a line spall defect located on the bearing's outer race. The entry point can be determined from the ball-race geometry relation, while the exit point can be identified from the time domain signal. Therefore, the defect size can be estimated from the vibration signal without requiring additional bearing load and stiffness measurements. Experiments were performed on a 3-axis CNC machine tool at speeds ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm and three line spall defects were estimated using the proposed method. The proposed model is demonstrated to estimate defect size with minimal speed related error, offset error, and standard deviation.

The presented technique was used for a single-phase induction motor. The authors measured and analysed following states of the motor: healthy single-phase induction motor, single-phase induction motor with faulty bearing, single-phase induction motor with faulty bearing and shorted coils of auxiliary winding. A feature extraction method called MSAF-20MULTIEXPANDED (Method of Selection of Amplitudes of Frequency -Multiexpanded) was discussed. The MSAF-20-MULTIEXPANDED was used to create feature vectors. The obtained vectors were classified by NN (Nearest Neighbour classifier), NM (Nearest Mean classifier) and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models). The proposed technique can be used for diagnosis of the single-phase induction motors. It can be also used for other types of rotating electric motors.

J	Zhao, MD; Jia, X; Lin, J; Lei, YG; Lee, J				Zhao, Ming; Jia, Xiaodong; Lin, Jing; Lei, Yaguo; Lee, Jay			Instantaneous speed jitter detection via encoder signal and its application for the diagnosis of planetary gearbox	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Planetary gearbox; Local polynomial differentiator; Instantaneous angular speed; Health monitoring; Fault diagnosis	WIND TURBINE GEARBOX; ANGULAR SPEED; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; LOAD CONDITIONS; ENGINE	In modern rotating machinery, rotary encoders have been widely used for the purpose of positioning and dynamic control. The study in this paper indicates that, the encoder signal, after proper processing, can be also effectively used for the health monitoring of rotating machines. In this work, a Kurtosis-guided local polynomial differentiator (KLPD) is proposed to estimate the instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of rotating machines based on the encoder signal. Compared with the central difference method, the KLPD is more robust to noise and it is able to precisely capture the weak speed jitters introduced by mechanical defects. The fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox has proven to be a challenging issue in both industry and academia. Based on the proposed KLPD, a systematic method for the fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox is proposed. In this method, residual time synchronous time averaging (RTSA) is first employed to remove the operation-related IAS components that come from normal gear meshing and non-stationary load variations, KLPD is then utilized to detect and enhance the speed jitter from the IAS residual in a data-driven manner. The effectiveness of proposed method has been validated by both simulated data and experimental data.

Due to harsh working environments, bearing performance degrades over time. To prevent unexpected bearing failures and accidents, bearing performance degradation assessment becomes an emerging topic in recent years. Bearing performance degradation assessment aims to evaluate the current health condition of a bearing through a bearing health indicator. In the past years, many signal processing and data mining based methods were proposed to construct bearing health indicators. However, the upper and lower bounds of these bearing health indicators were not theoretically calculated and they strongly depended on historical bearing data including normal and failure data. Besides, most health indicators are dimensional, which connotes that these health indicators are prone to be affected by varying operating conditions, such as varying speeds and loads. In this paper, based on the principle of squared envelope analysis, we focus on theoretical investigation of bearing performance degradation assessment in the case of additive Gaussian noises, including distribution establishment of squared envelope, construction of a generalized dimensionless bearing health indicator, and mathematical calculation of the upper and lower bounds of the generalized dimensionless bearing health indicator. Then, analyses of simulated and real bearing run to failure data are used as two case studies to illustrate how the generalized dimensionless health indicator works and demonstrate its effectiveness in bearing performance degradation assessment. Results show that squared envelope follows a noncentral chi-square distribution and the upper and lower bounds of the generalized dimensionless health indicator can be mathematically established. Moreover, the generalized dimensionless health indicator is sensitive to an incipient bearing defect in the process of bearing performance degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saari, J; Odelius, J				Saari, Juhamatti; Odelius, Johan			Detecting operation regimes using unsupervised clustering with infected group labelling to improve machine diagnostics and prognostics	OPERATIONS RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						Maintenance; Operation regime; Clustering; Data mining; LHD	FAULT-DETECTION; PREDICTION; LIFE; ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION; SYSTEMS	Estimating the stress level of components while operation modes are varying is a key issue for many prognostic models in condition monitoring. The identification of operation profiles during production is therefore important. Clustering condition monitoring data with regard to operation regimes will provide more detailed information about the variation of stress levels during production. The distribution of the operation regimes can then support prognostics by revealing the cause-and-effect relationship between the operation regimes and the wear level of components. In this study unsupervised clustering technique was used for detecting operation regimes for an underground LHD (load-haul-dump machine) by using features extracted from vibration signals measured on the front axle and the speed of the Cardan axle. The clusters were also infected with a small portion of the data to obtain the corresponding labels for each cluster. Promising results were obtained where each sought-for operation regime was detected in a sensible manner using vibration RMS values together with speed.

This paper presents the application of a novel metaheuristic approach named chaos-enhanced stochastic fractal search (CFS) to train feedforward neural networks (FNNs) for monitoring a ball bearings system. The vibration response data are analyzed using statistical methods to characterize several defects of ball bearings and generate vibration signature features. Then, a novel CFS-based FNNs approach is applied to classify these ball bearings conditions. The results show that the proposed approach produces comparable classification accuracy as parameters of the FNNs were optimized systematically using CFS algorithm.	[Rahman, Tuan A.

In the past few years, there have been many intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms for it. Support vector machine is one of them. But it also has many shortcomings for fault diagnosis. For example, how to select kernel and parameters makes the classifier more accurate. In this paper, in order to find the best global parameters, we choose the PSO algorithm, and we also use the adaboost algorithm to improve the classification accuracy. By comparing the experimental results of other classifiers, the proposed PSO-AdaBoostSVM algorithm is superior to SVM and AdaBoostSVM in classification accuracy. So the proposed algorithm can be used in the fault diagnosis of wind Turbines' Bearing.

Different methods of machine learning are explored in the field of turbofan health estimation and prognosis, to save maintenance cost and enhance aviation safety. An algorithm used for turbofan engines residual user life estimation called gaussian mixture model and hidden Markov model is one of the most effective method many researchers used in complex system health estimation and prognosis. However, Gaussian Mixture Model and Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) has N2 computational complexity, which is always time consuming under the condition of large dataset is available. During past two decades, along with more and more advanced sensors are used for turbofan engine health monitoring, since a large amount of data is available for observation and analyzation. Parallel computing library such as CUDA is extremely necessary. In this paper, CUDA library is adopted for turbofan engines RUL estimation. The performance of algorithms is demonstrated on a simulated aviation dataset generated by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS).

The changing characteristics are very complex. The current model can not get high accuracy vehicle engine condition monitoring results. In order to improve the monitoring precision of vehicle engine state, a vehicle engine state monitoring model based on data mining technology is proposed. Based on the current research status of vehicle engine condition monitoring are analyzed, pointed out the deficiencies of the current vehicle engine condition monitoring model, then using wavelet analysis to decompose the state of vehicle engine, and the chaotic processing for each decomposed component, finally data mining technology -- support vector machine to monitor the decomposition rate of chaos treated by data mining, and monitoring their results reconstructed.

Classical data-driven approaches rely on manually extracted features from raw sensor data followed by an estimation of a health indicator, the degradation states and the prediction of RUL using a failure threshold. Based on the recent success of deep neural networks in various artificial intelligence domains, we propose an end-to-end deep framework for RUL estimation based on convolutional and long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent units. First the neural network extracts the local features directly from sensor data using the convolutional layer, then an LSTM layer is introduced to capture the degradation process, finally the RUL is estimated using the LSTM outputs and the prediction time value. Experiments are conducted on the ball bearing data provided by FEMTO-ST Institute. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is becoming normal to analyze data from hundreds, or even thousands of buildings at once. Mechanistic, manual analysis of such data sets is time-consuming and not realistic using conventional techniques. Thus, a significant body of literature has been generated using unsupervised statistical learning techniques designed to uncover structure and information quickly with fewer input parameters or metadata about the buildings collected. Further, visual analytics techniques are developed as aids in this process for a human analyst to utilize and interpret the results. This paper reviews publications that include the use of unsupervised machine learning techniques as applied to non-residential building performance control and analysis. The categories of techniques covered include clustering, novelty detection, motif and discord detection, rule extraction, and visual analytics. The publications apply these technologies in the domains of smart meters, portfolio analysis, operations and controls optimization, and anomaly detection. A discussion is included of key challenges resulting from this review, such as the need for better collaboration between several, disparate research communities and the lack of open, benchmarking data sets. Opportunities for improvement are presented including methods of reproducible research and suggestions for cross-disciplinary cooperation.

To meet the portability requirement for instruments used in the diagnosis of dysphagia in clinical settings, a novel sensor for measuring tongue pressure is designed to help doctors evaluate the severity of dysphagia. A sensor with a special beam structure converts the deformation of strain gauges to analog voltage signals through a Wheatstone bridge, then translates the result to a value for tongue pressure. The relationship between the tongue pressure and voltage is fitted by a least squares method and also by using an extreme learning machine. The two sets of results are compared and the superiority of using the extreme learning machine is verified. For the designed tongue-pressure sensor with an outer diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 3 mm, the detection range is from 0 to 15 kPa, and the relative error of measurement can be controlled within 0.91%.

J	Raptodimos, Y; Lazakis, I				Raptodimos, Yiannis; Lazakis, Iraklis			Using artificial neural network-self-organising map for data clustering of marine engine condition monitoring applications	SHIPS AND OFFSHORE STRUCTURES			English	Article						Ship condition monitoring; data clustering; ANN; self-organising maps; ship machinery		Condition monitoring is the process of monitoring parameters expressing machinery condition, interpreting them for the identification of change which could indicate developing faults. Data processing is important in a ship condition monitoring software tool, as misinterpretation of data can significantly affect the accuracy and performance of the predictions made. Data for key performance parameters for a PANAMAX container ship main engine cylinder are clustered using a two-stage approach. Initially, the data is clustered using the artificial neural network (ANN)-self-organising map (SOM) and then the clusters are interclustered using the Euclidean distance metric into groups. The case study results demonstrate the capability of the SOM to monitor the main engine condition by identifying clusters containing data which are diverse compared to data representing normal engine operating conditions. The results obtained can be further expanded for application in diagnostic purposes, identifying faults, their causes and effects to the ship main engine.

J	Jiang, ZN; Hu, MH; Feng, K; Wang, H				Jiang, Zhinong; Hu, Minghui; Feng, Kun; Wang, Hao			A SVDD and K-Means Based Early Warning Method for Dual-Rotor Equipment under Time-Varying Operating Conditions	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Under frequently time-varying operating conditions, equipment with dual rotors like gas turbines is influenced by two rotors with different rotating speeds. Alarm methods of fixed threshold are unable to consider the influences of time-varying operating conditions. Hence, those methods are not suitable for monitoring dual-rotor equipment. An early warning method for dual-rotor equipment under time-varying operating conditions is proposed in this paper. The influences of time-varying rotating speeds of dual rotors on alarm thresholds have been considered. Firstly, the operating conditions are divided into several limited intervals according to rotating speeds of dual rotors. Secondly, the train data within each interval is processed by SVDD and the allowable ranges (i.e., the alarm threshold) of the vibration are determined. The alarm threshold of each interval of operating conditions is obtained. The alarm threshold can be expressed as a sphere, whose controlling parameters are the coordinate of the center and the radius. Then, the cluster center of the test data, whose alarm state is to be judged, can be extracted through K-means. Finally, the alarm state can be obtained by comparing the cluster center with the corresponding sphere. Experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method.

J	Tong, Z; Li, W; Zhang, B; Zhang, M				Tong, Zhe; Li, Wei; Zhang, Bo; Zhang, Meng			Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Domain Adaptation Using Transferable Features under Different Working Conditions	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION	Bearing failure is the most common failure mode in rotating machinery and can result in large financial losses or even casualties. However, complex structures around bearing and actual variable working conditions can lead to large distribution difference of vibration signal between a training set and a test set, which causes the accuracy-dropping problem of fault diagnosis. Thus, how to improve efficiently the performance of bearing fault diagnosis under different working conditions is always a primary challenge. In this paper, a novel bearing fault diagnosis under different working conditions method is proposed based on domain adaptation using transferable features(DATF). The datasets of normal bearing and faulty bearings are obtained through the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of raw vibration signals under different motor speeds and load conditions. Then we reduce marginal and conditional distributions simultaneously across domains based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) in feature space by refining pseudo test labels, which can be obtained by the nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier built on training data, and then a robust transferable feature representation for training and test domains is achieved after several iterations. With the help of the NN classifier trained on transferable features, bearing fault categories are identified accurately in final. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed method under different working conditions can identify the bearing faults accurately and outperforms obviously competitive approaches.

A small fault in reciprocating compressor may cause serious issues in operation. Traditional regular maintenance and fault diagnosis solutions cannot efficiently detect potential faults in reciprocating compressors. This paper proposes a fault-diagnosis system for reciprocating compressors. It applies machine-learning techniques to data analysis and fault diagnosis. The raw data is denoised first. Then the denoised data is sparse coded to train a dictionary. Based on the learned dictionary, potential faults are finally recognized and classified by support vector machine (SVM). The system is evaluated by using 5-year operation data collected from an offshore oil corporation in a cloud environment. The collected data is evenly divided into two halves. One half is used for training, and the other half is used for testing. The results demonstrate that the proposed system can efficiently diagnose potential faults in compressors with more than 80% accuracy, which represents a better result than the current practice.

J	Pan, HH; He, XX; Tang, S; Meng, FM				Pan, Honghu; He, Xingxi; Tang, Sai; Meng, Fanming			An Improved Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method using One-Dimensional CNN and LSTM	STROJNISKI VESTNIK-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bearing fault diagnosis; CNN; LSTM	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; NEURAL-NETWORKS	As one of the most critical components in rotating machinery, bearing fault diagnosis has attracted many researchers' attention. The traditional methods for bearing fault diagnosis normally requires three steps, including data pre-processing feature extraction and pattern classification, which require much expertise and experience. This paper takes advantage of deep learning algorithms and proposes an improved bearing fault diagnosis method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network whose input is the raw sampling signal without any pre-processing or traditional feature extraction. The CNN is frequently used in image classification as it could extract features automatically from high-dimensional data, while LSTM is most applied in speech recognition as it considers time coherence. This paper combined one-dimensional CNN and LSTM into one unified structure by using the CNN's output as input to the LSTM to identify the bearing fault types. First, a part of raw bearing signal data is used as the training dataset in the model, and the simulation ends when the number of iterations reaches a specific value. Second, the rest of the signal data was input in the trained model as the testing dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the average accuracy rate in the testing dataset of this proposed method reaches more than 99 %, which outperforms other algorithms for bearing fault diagnosis.

The FD is based on the computation of the off-diagonal term of the sequence components (SCs) impedance matrix. This technique was proven efficaciously for direct on-line (DOL) IM, as it deciphers its abnormal impedance behavior with neither additional hardware nor IM parameter's knowledge. Additionally, the FD technique is immune to sensor errors. The hypothesis of this article is that the off diagonal sequence impedance is not affected by the Direct Torque Control (DTC) and therefore, the contribution of this article is the adaptation of the FD to an inverter-fed IM under DTC. Simulation reinforced by experimental results demonstrated the correctness of the hypothesis, as well as the robustness of the FD method for closed-loop controlled IM, against other detectors used in DOL IM, where their signatures are hidden by the controller.

In the proposed PPSO algorithm, the velocity of each particle is perturbed whenever the particles strike into a local optimum, in order to achieve a higher quality solution to optimization problems. Furthermore, the concept of proposed perturbation is applied to three variants of PSO, and improved corresponding algorithms are named perturbed C-PSO (PC-PSO), perturbed T-PSO (PT-PSO), and perturbed K-PSO (PK-PSO). For the purpose of fault diagnosis, the time domain reflectometry (TDR) method with pseudorandom binary sequence (PRBS) excitation is considered to generate the necessary fault simulation data set. The proposed approaches are tested on a typical two-lateral radial distribution network.

The technique is composed by three separated stages, a first one which evaluates testability and ambiguity groups of the Converter (or, more in general, the Circuit) Under Test (CUT), a second one which localizes the fault, classifying it in an appropriate Fault Class (FC) and a last one (optional) that can extract the value of the faulty component. The fabrication tolerances of the healthy components are taken into account at each stage of the method.

In order to suppress such ' nuisance' imperfections, this paper proposed a sparsityaware RVM model for multi-class classification (denoted as SaMRVM) by developing a configurable singular entropy decision mechanism. Multiple driven data sets captured from both emulational and actual circuits under test (CUTs) are involved to further improve the model's generalization ability and judging confidence. Experimental results carried out on two CUTs indicate that our proposed learning methodology is speedy and accurate enough for real world fault diagnosis tasks of analog and mixed-signal circuits.

Reliability of electrical devices such as coils, motors, relays, solenoids and transformers is heavily dependent on the Electrical Insulation System (EIS). Accelerated aging methods are used to rapidly simulate the conditions in real life, which is typically years (20,000 hours) depending on the operating conditions. The purpose of accelerated aging is to bring lifetime of an EIS to hours, days or weeks. Shortening the lifetime of an EIS to such an extent, allows for the study of the insulation materials behavior as well as investigate ways to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) for the purpose of predictive maintenance. Unexpected failures in operation processes, where redundancy is not present, can lead to high economical losses, machine downtime and often health and safety risks. Conditions, under which thermal aging methods are generally reported in the literature, typically neglect other factors, owing to the sheer complexity and interdependence of the multifaceted aging phenomena. This paper examines some existing thermal aging tests, which are currently used to obtain data for enamel degradation in order to try to better understand of how the thermal stresses degrade the EIS. Separation of these stresses, which the EIS operate under, can yield a better understanding of how each of the Thermal, the Electrical, the Ambient and the Mechanical (TEAM) stresses behave.

Prevailing decision-making techniques typically consider each manufacturing function in isolation to reduce the complexity, which in turn leads to sequential decision-making where prior decisions become constraints for subsequent decisions. This paper proposes a unified approach for simultaneously controlling the timing of production events, the timing of maintenance events, and physical processing capacity. Moreover, the control algorithms can be fully distributed and exploit physics-based models for processes and remaining useful-life of machinery components in real-time decision making. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing process is used as an example in the paper to demonstrate the unified approach. Dynamics of the resulting unified control system is modeled using non-linear discontinuous differential equations. Computer simulations are used to illustrate dynamic interactions between production and maintenance functions.

An artificial neural network (ANN) model based on cross relationships among operating parameters was established. In particular, this paper adopted the pre-training of Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and analyzed the training errors of model. A new approach was proposed to monitor parameters by predicted value of model and distribution law of training error, and the reasonable range of each parameter was defined to detect the early warnings in real time. Combining the historical operational data of the No. 1 induced draft fan of No. 3 generating unit in Shajiao C Power Plant in China, this work used MATLAB to verify and analyze the proposed method. The numerical examples shown that the proposed method has better detection performance than the fixed upper and lower limits in the safety instrumented system (SIS). Moreover, this work can expand to other machinery that could be used in manufacturing easily.

PHM can take many different forms when implemented, and measures of effectiveness are highly dependent on the techniques implemented. A test bed has been built, and a use case designed, to represent common manufacturing tasks performed in robot work cells where PHM can provide greater equipment and process health intelligence. The physical and functional relationships within the work cell are mapped using a hierarchical deconstruction method to gain a better understanding of the propagation of effects of both equipment and process degradation. The test bed has been built so PHM techniques and technologies can be integrated and tested in a realistic scenario. Data is recorded for post processing and analysis for the verification and validation (V&V) of the implemented PHM techniques. The test bed will serve as a platform to develop, test, verb and validate PHM techniques at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and provide industry participants a standard platform for testing their PHM technologies. Having a common testing platform will provide industry a foundation for sets of tests to evaluate PHM. This paper presents the test bed and use case, the relationships therein, and the data management and collection approaches used to enable future research.

Economic factors motivate facilities and factories to improve maintenance operations to monitor robot degradation and detect faults and failures, especially to eliminate unexpected shutdowns. Since robot systems are complex, with sub-systems and components, it is challenging to determine these constituent elements' specific influence on the overall system performance. The development of monitoring, diagnostic, and prognostic technologies (collectively known as Prognostics and Health Management (PHM)), can aid manufacturers in maintaining the performance of robot systems by providing intelligence to enhance maintenance and control strategies. This paper presents the strategy of integrating top level and component level PHM to detect robot performance degradation (including robot tool center accuracy degradation), supported by the development of a four-layer sensing and analysis structure. The top level PHM can quickly detect robot tool center accuracy degradation through advanced sensing and test methods developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The component level PHM supports deep data analysis for root cause diagnostics and prognostics. A reference data set is collected and analyzed using the integration of top level PHM and component level PHM to understand the influence of temperature, speed, and payload on robot's accuracy degradation.

MULTI-MODE PARTICLE FILTER FOR BEARING REMAINING LIFE PREDICTION	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 13TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2018, VOL 3			English	Proceedings Paper	13th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 18-22, 2018	Coll Stn, TX	Asme, Mfg Engn Div			PROGNOSIS; MODEL	As a critical element in rotating machines, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of rolling bearings plays an essential role in realizing predictive and preventative machine maintenance in modern manufacturing. The physics of defect (e.g. spall) initiation and propagation describes bearing's service life as generally divided into three stages: normal operation, defect initiation, and accelerated performance degradation. The transition among the stages are embedded in the variations of monitored data, e.g., vibration. This paper presents a multi-mode particle filter (MMPF) that is aimed to: 1) automatically detect the transition among the three life stages; and 2) accurately characterize bearing performance degradation by integrating physical models with stochastic modeling method. In MMPF, a set of linear and non-linear modes (also called degradation functions) are first defined according to the physical/empirical knowledge as well as statistical analysis of the measured data (e.g. vibration). These modes are subsequently refined during the particle filtering (PF)-based bearing performance tracking process. Each mode corresponds to an individual performance scenario. A finite state Markov chain switches among these modes, reflecting the transition between the service life stages. Case studies performed on two run-to-failure experiments indicate that the developed technique is effective in tracking the evolution of bearing performance degradation and predicting the remaining useful life of rolling bearings.

While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of physics- and model-based diagnosis and prognosis for additive manufacturing, very little research has been reported on real-time monitoring and prediction of surface roughness in fused deposition modeling (FDM). This paper presents a new data-driven approach to surface roughness prediction in FDM. A real-time monitoring system is developed to monitor the health condition of a 3D printer and FDM processes using multiple sensors. A predictive model is built by random forests (RFs). Experimental results have shown that the predictive model is capable of predicting the surface roughness of a printed part with very high accuracy.

J	Nistane, V; Harsha, S				Nistane, Vinod; Harsha, Suraj			Performance evaluation of bearing degradation based on stationary wavelet decomposition and extra trees regression	WORLD JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bearing dynamics; Extra trees regression (ETR); Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regression; Performance degradation evaluation; Random forest regression (RFR); Stationary wavelet decomposition	FAILURE; PROGNOSTICS; TRANSFORM	Purpose In rotary machines, the bearing failure is one of the major causes of the breakdown of machinery. The bearing degradation monitoring is a great anxiety for the prevention of bearing failures. This paper aims to present a combination of the stationary wavelet decomposition and extra-trees regression (ETR) for the evaluation of bearing degradation. Design/methodology/approach The higher order cumulants features are extracted from the bearing vibration signals by using the stationary wavelet decomposition (stationary wavelet transform [SWT]). The extracted features are then subjected to the ETR for obtaining normal and failure state. A dominance level curve build using the dissimilarity data of test object and retained as health degradation indicator for the evaluation of bearing health. Findings Experiment conducts to verify and assess the effectiveness of ETR for the evaluation of performance of bearing degradation. To justify the preeminence of recommended approach, it is compared with the performance of random forest regression and multi-layer perceptron regression. Originality/value The experimental results indicated that the presently adopted method shows better performance for detecting the degradation more accurately at early stage. Furthermore, the diagnostics and prognostics have been getting much attention in the field of vibration, and it plays a significant role to avoid accidents.

J	Keshri, JP; Tiwari, H				Keshri, Jay Prakash; Tiwari, Harpal			Fault detection, classification in multiterminal HVDC transmission system with MC-SVM	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Signals, Machines and Automation (SIGMA)	FEB 23-25, 2018	New Delhi, INDIA			Support vector machines (SVM); hyper plane; multiclass SVM; multiterminal HVDC; regression; confusion matrix; receiver operating characteristic (ROC)		Due to the recent advancement in power electronics devices in past few decades, HVDC system became mature but still has some protection issues, like tripping of the circuit breaker for a temporary fault as to load changes. Therefore, in this paper, a scheme of complete protection for fast, and accurate classification and detection of a fault in HVDC transmission line using support vector machine (SVM) is presented. In the proposed scheme, ac and dc side voltage and current at each converter station are measured and treated as the input of SVM binary classifier. For classification of fault, SVM module with multi-classification feature is used. For the normalization purposes of the signals, the standard deviation is used over half cycle before and after the occurrence of the fault. Features have been extracted through wavelet transform of predefined function for detection and classification of a fault. The proposed scheme is easy to use as it requires only one end data and a standard deviation over one cycle data.

Induction motor bearing fault classification using WPT, PCA and DSVM	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Signals, Machines and Automation (SIGMA)	FEB 23-25, 2018	New Delhi, INDIA			Bearing damage index (BDI); dendogram; support vector machine (DSVM); principal component analysis (PCA); wavelet packet transform (WET)	NONLINEAR FEATURE-EXTRACTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; TRANSFORM	In industry loading on bearing and its fault severity in an induction motor is unpredictable. Hence, in the present article wide range of vibration data from induction motor bearing surface has been taken for extraction of fault features and classified for the detection of mechanical faults presents in the bearing so that condition based monitoring possible. The vibration data which is selected in this paper includes four different kinds of loading and three different types of fault with three different fault sizes. Firstly, Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is applied to decompose the vibration signal and develop Bearing Damage Index (BDI) from the decomposed signal to select the useful signal from the original recorded signal. This BDI based useful signal is further applied for extraction of statistical features and fed to the classifier. Total eleven time domain features has been calculated and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for the selection of significant features. The selected features further used as input to the Dendogram Support Vector Machine (DSVM) classifier to identify the faults. This proposed method shows significant improvement in classification rate as compared to conventional method, which is quite promising and encouraging.	[Agrawal, Sudhir; Giri, V. K.; Tiwari, A.

For the faults that have already occurred, the expert system inference mechanism can be used to realize quick localization of failure, and we can use the expert solution in the knowledge base to run the self-healing decision until the failure is resolved. For the failure the knowledge base doesn't have, we can use human-machine interface to achieve real-time update of the knowledge base. For the faults that didn't occurred, the trained adaptive BP neural network is used to fit the parameters of the telescope running status, to monitor the running status of the telescope in real time and to realize the fault warning of the telescope operation. Fault diagnosis and seamless self-healing technology is one of the key technologies to realize intelligent, its research is of great significance.

Previous research assumes that its structure and parameters are all known before application. Since the initial model is always constructed by experts, it is possible that it is inconsistent with practical systems, which may impact the diagnostic accuracy. In order to improve the model by applying the practical data, this paper develops a machine learning method for the DDCFD model. A parameter learning method and three structure learning methods are studied. Using this approach, prior knowledge and test data can be combined together to get a better diagnostic model. The methods are tested and compared on simulated examples and an application case. The result indicates that diagnostic accuracy can be improved by means of parameter learning compared to the initial model, and it can be further improved by structure learning. The score-based algorithm is the best choice for learning the structure of the DDCFD model.

J	Wang, HY; Zhao, Y; Ma, XB				Wang, Hongyu; Zhao, Yu; Ma, Xiaobing			Remaining Useful Life Prediction Using a Novel Two-Stage Wiener Process With Stage Correlation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Two-stage degradation modeling; stage correlation; remaining useful life prediction; Gibbs sampling	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; DEGRADATION DATA; MODEL; ALGORITHM	Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of products is a critical component of prognostics and health management. Recently, the RUL prediction based on a two-stage degradation process has received increasing attention. However, existingworks generally assume that the two stages are mutually independent, which is not reasonable in many applications. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage Wiener process model with stage correlation and a Bayesian approach for RUL prediction. Different from previous studies, we incorporate the stage correlation into the prior distributions of model parameters to improve the accuracy of predictions. We also derive the RUL distribution through the total probability formula to comprehensively consider the possibilities that the product fails at different stages. Once real-time monitoring data are available, we employ the Gibbs sampling algorithm to update the posterior distributions of model parameters as well as the RUL distribution. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated through a simulation study and an application to the bearing degradation data.

The knowledge we extract this way might not be suitable for immediate use and one or more data postprocessing methods could be applied as well. Data postprocessing includes the integration, filtering, evaluation, and explanation of acquired knowledge. Nomograms, graphical devices for approximate calculations of functions, are a useful tool for visualising and comparing prediction models. It is well known that any generalised additive model can be represented by a quasi-nomogram - a nomogram where some summation performed by the human is required. Nomograms of this type are widely used, especially in medical prognostics. Methods for constructing such a nomogram were developed for specific types of prediction models thus assuming that the structure of the model is known. In this chapter we extend our previous work on a general method for explaining arbitrary prediction models (classification or regression) to a general methodology for constructing a quasi-nomogram for a black-box prediction model. We show that for an additive model, such a quasi-nomogram is equivalent to the one we would construct if the structure of the model was known.

S	Lughofer, E		Zhou, J; Chen, F		Lughofer, Edwin			Model Explanation and Interpretation Concepts for Stimulating Advanced Human-Machine Interaction with "Expert-in-the-Loop"	HUMAN AND MACHINE LEARNING: VISIBLE, EXPLAINABLE, TRUSTWORTHY AND TRANSPARENT	Human-Computer Interaction Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							FUZZY-SYSTEMS; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; SURFACE INSPECTION; FAULT-DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	We propose two directions for stimulating advanced human-machine interaction in machine learning systems. The first direction acts on a local level by suggesting a reasoning process why certain model decisions/predictions have been made for current sample queries. It may help to better understand how the model behaves and to support humans for providing more consistent and certain feedbacks. A practical example from visual inspection of production items underlines higher human labeling consistency. The second direction acts on a global level by addressing several criteria which are necessary for a good interpretability of the whole model. By meeting the criteria, the likelihood increases (1) of gaining more funded insights into the behavior of the system, and (2) of stimulating advanced expert/operators feedback in form of active manipulations of the model structure. Possibilities how to best integrate different types of advanced feedback in combination with (on-line) data using incremental model updates will be discussed. This leads to a new, hybrid interactive model building paradigm, which is based on subjective knowledge versus objective data and thus integrates the "expert-in-the-loop" aspect.

S	Li, ZD; Wang, Y		Zhou, J; Chen, F		Li, Zhidong; Wang, Yang			Domain Knowledge in Predictive Maintenance for Water Pipe Failures	HUMAN AND MACHINE LEARNING: VISIBLE, EXPLAINABLE, TRUSTWORTHY AND TRANSPARENT	Human-Computer Interaction Series		English	Article; Book Chapter								In this chapter, the water pipe failure prediction is used as an example to show the integration of machine learning and domain knowledge. It is crucial for the risk management strategy of water distribution systems to minimise the water pipe failure impacts. Prediction of water pipe conditions through statistical modelling is an important element for the task. When applying the models to practical problems, domain experts can provide invaluable suggestions that can be used as constraints or informative prior knowledge. Alternatively, the models can also help domain experts to explore more insights.

Firstly, the original acoustic impulse response signals are analysed by statistical analysis and local mean decomposition (LMD), in order to construct the mixed domain features, which are made up of time, frequency and time-frequency domain features. Then the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is adopted to reduce the high-dimensional features of mixed domain and extract the main features which reflect the operation state of main components. Finally, the main features are input to extreme learning machine (ELM) for state recognition. After the feature extraction by KPCA, the redundancy of input features is eliminated. The simulation results show that KPCA is more sensitive to the nonlinear characteristics of the pipeline blockage signal when compared with PCA. Meanwhile, ELM is superior to BP in terms of classification accuracy and time consuming.

Automated Delineation of Organs-at-Risk in Head and Neck CT Images using Multi-output Support Vector Regression	MEDICAL IMAGING 2018: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS IN MOLECULAR, STRUCTURAL, AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	SPIE Conference on Medical Imaging - Biomedical Applications in Molecular, Structural, and Functional Imaging	FEB 11-13, 2018	Houston, TX	SPIE, DECTRIS Ltd		multiple output support vector regression; machine learning; head and neck; organs-at-risk; segmentation	SEGMENTATION	Accurate segmentation of organs-at-risk (OAR) is essential for treatment planning of head and neck (HaN) cancers. A desire to shift from manual segmentation to automated processes allows for more efficient treatment planning. However, the technology of automated segmentation is hindered by complex and irregular morphology, poor soft tissue contrast, artifacts from dental fillings, variablity of patient's anatomy, and inter-observer variability. In this study, we propose a state-of-the-art automated segmentation of OAR using a multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) machine learning algorithm to address these challenges under various selectable parameters. Shape image features were extracted using the histogram of oriented gradients and ground truth boundaries were obtained from physicians. Automated delineation of the OAR was performed on CT images from 56 subjects consisting of the brain stem, cochleae, esophagus, eye globes, larynx, lenses, lips, mandible, oral cavity, parotid glands, spinal cord, submandibular glands, and thyroid. Testing was done on previously unseen CT images. Model performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and leave-one-subject-out strategy. Segmentation results varied from 66.9% DSC for the left cochlea to 93.8% DSC for the left eye globe. Analysis of the performance of a state-of-the-art algorithm reported in literature compared to MSVR demonstrated similar or superior performance on the segmentation of the OAR listed in this study. The proposed MSVR model accurately and efficiently segmented the OAR using a representative database of 56 HaN CT images. Thus, this model is an effective tool to aid physicians in reducing diagnostic and prognostic time.	[Tam, C.

If these faults are not detected and dealt with in time, the running safety of the railway vehicle will be seriously affected. To detect these components' early failure and extend their fatigue life, a regular maintenance becomes critical. Currently, the regular maintenance of axle box bearings mainly depends on manual off-line inspection, which has low working efficiency and precision of fault diagnosis. In order to improve the maintenance efficiency and effectiveness of railway vehicles, this study proposes a method of integrating the vibration monitoring system of the axle box bearing in the underfloor wheelset lathe, where the integration scheme and work flow of the system are introduced followed by the detailed fault diagnosis method and application examples. Firstly, the band-pass filter and envelope analysis is successively performed on the original signal acquired by an accelerometer. Secondly, the alpha-stable distribution (ASD) and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) analysis of the envelope signal are performed, and five characteristic parameters with significant stability and sensitivity are extracted and then brought into the least squares support vectors machine based on particle swarm optimization to determine the state of the bearing quantitatively. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is validated by bench test data. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can accomplish effective diagnosis of axle box bearings' fault location and fault degree and can yield better diagnosis accuracy than the single method of ASD or MFDFA.

In electric vehicles, many parts are used in the bearing, and rolling bearings in the miming process, often accompanied by a large number of interference signals. In this paper, the time-domain synchronous average method is used to denoise the electric vehicle rolling bearing, and then the signal is denoised. Experiments show that, after time domain synchronous average method noise reduction, can get a clearer power spectrum, through the power spectrum can better judge the type of electric vehicle rolling bearing failure.

Indoor positioning methods based on WLAN and RSS with advantage of low cost are most widely used. In this paper, we propose an improved indoor positioning method based on received signal strength to obtain better accuracy. We apply selected weighed K nearest neighbor (WSKNN) to get a better initial point of the gradient-descent-based location search (GLS) which is combined with exhaustive location search (ELS) to achieve a better result. Experimental results conducted in the real environments show that our proposed algorithm can obtain improvement of the mean error distance of 7.17% and 22.54%, compared with the GLS-CF method and traditional KNN method, respectively.

The State of health (SOH) estimation for batteries often needs to be implemented under uncertain situations for the complicated operating conditions. In this work, a novel integrated approach based on a mixture of Gaussian process (MGP) model is presented for lithium-ion battery SOH estimation under uncertain conditions, where the degradation process parameters distribution can be learnt from the multiple available capacity measurements. To capture the time-varying degradation behavior, the distribution information of the degradation model parameter is extracted by fusing the training data from different battery conditions with the MGP model. Moreover, by exploiting the degradation model parameter distribution information, the PF algorithm is employed to predict the battery SOH. The correlation case study and comparison analysis are provided to show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method.

It can detect and diagnosis different faults with a signal, such as delamination, mud or ice on blades of wind turbines. This methodology allows to avoid the redundancy of sensors, since a specific number of ultrasonic transducers can determine the structural condition using guided waves. The signal is pre-processed with the aim of removing the noise, then extracted and selected features to be later classified by Machine Learning and Neural Networks. Finally, for each damage or anomaly, the best classifier will be evaluated. The best classifier of each damage will act on a parallel network that will process the signal sent by the sensor.

Moreover, due to the particularity of high density packaging devices, quantitative analysis of its application reliability is often difficult to carry out. In this situation, we evaluate the remaining useful life (RUL) using data-driven prognostic method through the analysis of the performance change of solder joints under temperature cycling test. The health state can be indicated by the current state and the future trend is obtained by RUL prediction. The resistivity is extracted as the characteristic parameter expressing by time series data, and ARMA model is established as mathematical description, with genetic algorithm (GA) optimizing the order estimation. The prediction presents well-fitted for the degradation of microelectronic packaging device characterized by the resistivity of solder joints, showing an effective performance of application in microelectronic packaging device reliability evaluation.

Accelerometer is a kind of wearable sensor. It is characterized by low energy consumption, small volume and low cost, which is widely used. At present, the action recognition process based on acceleration sensing is mainly divided into 3 steps: feature extraction, feature selection and recognition algorithm. In this paper, a recognition algorithm based on three-dimensional acceleration signal is proposed to identify different types of strokes according to the motion characteristics of people playing table tennis. The data used are collected from the accelerometer tied to the wrist and collected in the training process of table tennis. The threshold value of acceleration signal is judged by fixed threshold method. And the key characteristics of signal energy and gesture length are extracted.

Here, an OCSVM based fault detection method is applied to detect faults in closed loops. By training data from normal samples and establishing OCSVM model, the fault detection of closed loop system is realized. This method not only overcomes the influence of non Gauss nonlinear process data to closed-loop process, but also considers the dynamic characteristics of the data. Finally the method is verified with the three-tank system.

Deep learning has powerful feature extraction and pattern recognition ability, and once the model is established, it can perform rapid pattern recognition. Based on this, a fault diagnosis method based on deep Boltzmann machines is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to solve the problem that DBMs can only deal with binary data, the Gaussian units are used to replace the binary visible units of the deep Boltzmann machines to construct the improved deep Boltzmann machines model, enabled the deep Boltzmann machines to process real-valued data. After the model is constructed, it is applied to process vibration signals for fault diagnosis. We present result on the CWRU bearing datasets, which shows that the improved DBMs learn generative models well and are good at fault recognition tasks.

The ability to predict the degradation of such power electronic devices can minimise the risk of their failure during operation and support maintenance planning operations. In this study, a data driven prognostics approach using system identification and machine learning modelling technique is developed and used to predict the time-to-failure of MOSFET TO-220 packages associated with delamination failure mode of the die attachment. Run-to-failure data under thermal overstress loading conditions for power chip devices, available from the NASA Prognostics Centre data repository, is used to develop a data-driven prognostic model that can be used to predict the time-to-failure (TtF) of power MOSFETs under accelerated test loads. An increment in ON-state resistance of the MOSFET is used as precursor for device failure through die-attach degradation. Results from this research show that when monitored data from a damage indicator for a particular failure mode of an electronic package changes dynamically, data-driven modelling using engineering control techniques such as State-Space representation is capable of producing reliable, multi-step ahead predictions for the time-to-failure of the device.

Traditional approaches use a local Information Technology (IT) framework centralized in a server in order to provide these services. Cost of equipment and IT manpower are associated with the implementation of a condition monitoring based on machine learning. Nowadays, cloud computing can replace local IT frameworks with a remote service, which can be paid according to the customer needs. This paper proposes a cloud-based architecture for condition monitoring based on machine learning, which the end-user can assess through a web application. The condition monitoring is implemented using a fusion of classification methods. The fusion is implemented using Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory (DSET). The results show that the use of DSET improves the overall result.

An important feature of this protection is a protocol-specific monitoring within the process control networks that identifies faults and attacks which already have overcome the firewall protection. For a wide-spread application in various sites, this monitoring must be self-adaptive to the different traffic characteristics of the respective networks. Protocol knowledge combined with unsupervised machine learning algorithms can leverage this task. In this paper we present the latest results of applying two machine learning methods on real-world traffic datasets from two plant process control networks. The results for different mappings of the considered packet features are discussed in terms of f-score, precision, and recall. They demonstrate the high potential of using unsupervised learning for training anomaly detectors to identify intrusions in industrial networks.

At the same time the production and consumption patterns are changing from large centralized generation of electric power and pure consumers to distributed generation (DG) and more complex consumers. This transition causes higher stress on an aging infrastructure and major investments are required over the coming years to maintain a reliable supply of electric energy. Better monitoring solutions and predictive methods can increase the possible utilization of the existing grid and reduce the fault frequency. This paper presents some current challenges in the grid and a possible monitoring solution and fault prediction method. This is exemplified with statistics and field-measurements from the Norwegian power grid.

J	Liu, J; Zio, E; Hu, Y				Liu, Jie; Zio, Enrico; Hu, Yang			Particle Filtering for Prognostics of a Newly Designed Product With a New Parameters Initialization Strategy Based on Reliability Test Data	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Prognostics; remaining useful life; particle filtering; parameters initialization; reliability test; failure times data	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; BOND GRAPH FRAMEWORK; HYBRID PROGNOSTICS; FUEL-CELL; UNCERTAINTY	In particle filtering-based prognostic methods, state and observation equations are used in which one or more parameters are uncertain. These parameters are estimated with collected monitoring data. The choices of the initial value ranges and distributions of the unknown parameters in the state and observation equations influence the performance of the particle filtering approaches, in terms of convergence, speed, and stability of prognostic results. For new products with little or even no degradation process data, uniform distributions over experience-based value ranges are the most common choice for parameters initialization. In this paper, the failure times' data collected during reliability tests executed before volume production are used for defining the initial value ranges and distributions of uncertain parameters. This is expected to increase the convergence speed of the parameters estimation with monitored data and to reduce the uncertainty of the predicted remaining useful life. Numerical experiments on synthetic degradation processes of PEM fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries are considered. The convergence speed of the parameters estimation and the sensitivity of the proposed method to the duration and number of product samples in the reliability tests are analyzed. Comparisons with particle filtering methods with standard initialization are also carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new strategy for parameters initialization.

Experts begin to use big data more frequently for the solution of their specific objectives. One of the probable big data tasks in the construction industry is the determination of the probability of contract execution at a stage of its establishment. The contract holder cannot guarantee execution of the contract. Therefore it leads to a lot of risks for the customer. This article is devoted to the applicability of machine learning methods to the task of determination of the probability of a successful contract execution. Authors try to reveal the factors influencing the possibility of contract default and then try to define the following corrective actions for a customer. In the problem analysis, authors used the linear and non-linear algorithms, feature extraction, feature transformation and feature selection. The results of investigation include the prognostic models with a predictive force based on the machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, randomize forest. Authors have validated models on available historical data. The developed models have the potential for practical use in the construction organizations while making new contracts.

First , the signal from different working condition is decomposed by LCD, to obtain the Intrinsic Scale Component (ISC)whose instantaneous frequency with physical significance. Then, calculate of the cross correlation coefficient between ISC and the original signal, signal denoising based on the principle of mutual information minimum. At last, calculate the sum of absolute Vector mutual information of the sample under different working condition and the denoised ISC as the characteristics to classify by use of Support vector machine (SVM) .The wind turbines vibration platform gear box experiment proves that this method can identify fault characteristics under different working conditions. The advantage of this method is that it reduce dependence of man's subjective experience, identify fault directly from the original data of vibration signal. It will has high engineering value.

This paper deals with the problem of fault diagnosis of electric motor based on power signal, and a data driven fault diagnosis method based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimized support vector machine (SVM) is presented. The feature presentation, feature selection and feature extraction are applied as data preprocessing methods to reduce data dimensions, that is, we implement feature representation by the time domain analysis method and the range analysis method, and the fisher discriminant analysis is used for feature selection, and the locally linear embedding (LLE) is used for feature extraction. Then the GA is used to optimize the SVM classifier for fault classification after data preprocessing. Our method can obtain good fault classification effect, and the experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed method is better than that of probabilistic neural network, and the feasibility and effectiveness of this proposed method in fault diagnosis of electric motor are proved.

Avoiding unexpected breakdowns while maintaining productivity is possible through continuously monitoring machine performance, predicting when and where a failure will occur. This allows not only to reduce downtime but also to apply the best maintenance strategy and assure production targets. In this paper, a Continuous Maintenance System to achieve this is proposed. This system joins a Predictive Maintenance module with optimization and simulation modules. The Predictive Maintenance module makes use of a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict which machine component will fail and schedule its maintenance. The optimization module uses a Genetic Algorithm to find the throughput values that reveal the best balance between production and degradation rates, and therefore, changing maintenance schedules according to production targets and machine degradation. Finally, a statistical simulation model based on real data distribution was used to examine effects of a certain throughput and maintenance schedule for each machine. Several classifiers were tested for the predictor, comparing their performance. Also, 3 different scenarios of a parallel production line were used to evaluate the proposed system.

In order to reduce these conflicts, a multi-agent system SCEMP (Supervisor, Customer, Environment, Maintainer and Producer) is proposed in this paper, making sure that these two entities collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. It consists of scheduling the production activities according to the health states of the machines. The main idea is to use the prediction of the durations of use and remaining useful lifetimes of the machines devices, which can be obtained using prognostic techniques. This enables simultaneous scheduling of production and maintenance activities.

The objective is to propose an integrated model that coordinates production schedule and predictive maintenance planning so that the total time to complete the schedule after predictive maintenance insertion is minimized. Predictive maintenance interventions are scheduled based on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) results using a new proposed heuristic. To jointly establish an integrated scheduling of production jobs and predictive maintenance actions, we propose a tailored genetic algorithm incorporating properly designed operators. Computational experiments carried out on Taillard well known benchmarks, to which we add both PHM and maintenance data, show the efficiency of the newly proposed maintenance planning heuristic and genetic algorithm.

However, in actual work environments operator qualification and experience is quite diverse, which leads to an immense variability in the time required for fault diagnosis and in the quality of corrective actions. Both time and quality of fault diagnosis and correction are vital parameters in the functioning of a plant, because downtimes have severe economic consequences and thus should be kept to a minimum. With the introduction of highly complex and flexible cyber-physical production systems, these problems are aggravated as fault sources vary and diagnosis becomes even more challenging. The paper presents a concept for a self-learning assistance system that supports operators in finding and evaluating solution strategies for complex faults. This concept applies a question-answer approach which allows for an incremental, dialogue-based establishment of common ground between operators and the assistance system.

Thus, an industrial machinery condition monitoring methodology based on novelty detection and classification is proposed in this study. The methodology is divided in three main stages. First, a dedicated feature calculation and reduction over each available physical magnitude. Second, an ensemble structure of novelty detection models based on one-class support vector machines to identify not previously considered events. Third, a diagnosis model supported by a feature fusion scheme in order to reach high fault classification capabilities. The effectiveness of the fault detection and identification methodology has been compared with classical single model approach, and verified by experimental results obtained from an electromechanical machine.

Depending on the process data, one classifier can assess target classes better than others. It often happens that the classifiers complement each other. A fusion strategy is needed in order to exploit the strength of each classifier. This paper presents fault detection assessment architectures based on information fusion and classification methods. It proposes the use of information fusion methods and different architectures, in order to improve the overall result of the fault detection assessment. Dempster-Shafer and Yager rules of combination are used to fuse the classification method predictions. The rules of combination improve the results by complementing the classifiers performance. A comparison between centralized and decentralized architectures is presented. The results show that the information fusion using decentralized architectures improves the overall performance of the fault detection assessment.

Indeed, most of the machinery involved in industrial processes are intended to be digitalized aiming to obtain enhanced information to be used for an optimized operation of the whole manufacturing process. In this regard, condition monitoring strategies are being also reconsidered to include improved performances and functionalities. Thus, the contribution of this research work lies in the proposal of an incremental learning framework approach applied to the condition monitoring of electromechanical systems. The proposed strategy is divided in three main steps, first, different available physical magnitudes are characterized through the calculation of a set of statistical-time based features. Second, a modelling of the considered conditions is performed by means of self-organizing maps in order to preserve the topology of the data; and finally, a novelty detection is carried out by a comparison among the quantization error value achieved in the data modelling for each of the considered conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed novelty fault identification condition monitoring methodology is proved by means of the evaluation of a complete experimental database acquired during the continuous working conditions of an electromechanical system.

The fast and accurate fault diagnosis is very important for improving the reliability. The present study proposes a novel fault diagnosis method based on the Probabilistic Principle Component Analysis (PPCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for controlled switches in single phase Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter (CHMLI). The output voltage signals under different fault conditions of the CHMLI are taken as fault features by using Phase Shift PWM technique. PPCA is used to optimize the data and reduce dimension of fault features. Finally, SVM classifier is used to diagnose the different fault modes. An experimental setup of CHMLI has been designed to validate the proposed fault diagnosis method. The simulation and experimental results show that by using PPCA-SVM, we can improve the accuracy of the fault location and reduce the time taken to diagnosis the fault in CHMLI.

We present an automated fault detection technique using Machine Learning via Artificial Neural Network. The Camera will capture images of railway track which will be provided as an input to the system consisting of neural network. The Artificial Neural Network(A.N.N) will be trained on the basis of Dataset (made from the scratch) and on the basis of this training A.N.N will then provide absolute output whether the track is faulty or not. And hence proper measures can be taken by the authorities.

The wind turbine gear running in variable conditions and variable speed state, so traditional method which studying fault mechanism through fault feature frequency under certain speed is no longer applicable. This paper describes the evolutionary trajectory of spalling fault of wind turbine gearbox transmission system. Deterioration evolutionary matrix has been proposed based on higher-order cumulant method, and the mapping mechanism is established between the fault evolution and fault state migration. Fault evolution parameter such as mean value and variance of normal distribution has been extracted and used to depict fault evolutionary track. Finally, the graphical representation of fault evolution process is explored. Concerning the fault of gearbox transmission system, this research mainly emphasizes on fault evolution. It will provide scientific means to implement predictive maintenance, and avoid occurrence of fatal accidents.

This paper will address the problem of fault identification for refrigeration showcases, which also follows the aforementioned setting, and whose continuous and ample use in commerce requires that unusual conditions and faults to be identified as quickly (and reliably) as possible. While the data for one class is available in problems of this nature, we will be considering not only specific algorithms for unary classification, but also the performance in the application of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Data set from a faulty and healthy gearbox are obtained and the gear faults namely gear tooth damage, bearing damage in gearbox and lubrication drain are investigated by analyzing the motor's current and voltage signature. A comparison between the conventional vibrational analysis and motor electrical signature analysis (MESA) is carried out using two specific machine-learning algorithms-Decision Tree Algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It is observed that MESA is more accurate than the Vibrational analysis and SVM is a better classifier compared to decision tree. Both single and multiple faults are examined and SVM stands out for multiple fault detection in gear box.

Prediction of surface roughness and material removal rate in laser assisted turning of aluminium oxide using fuzzy logic	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Materials Processing and Characterization (ICMPC)	MAR 16-18, 2018	Hyderabad, INDIA			Ceramics; Laser assisted machining; fuzzy logic; surface roughness; material removal rate	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TITANIUM	Processing of ceramics with good surface integrity and high material removal rate is a challenging task in the manufacturing industry. Laser assisted machining (LAM) is one of the benchmark technique currently used in industry to process difficult to machine materials. In LAM, laser is used as source to heat the work piece and simultaneously remove the softened material by cutting tool without changing the material microstructure. Since many process parameters are involved in LAM, experimental investigation of processing of ceramics is expensive. So the main objective of this present work is to develop an Artificial Intelligence model to understand the process mechanics and for the prediction of surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) during laser assisted turning of Aluminium oxide using fuzzy logic. Input parameters are assumed as triangular and Gaussian function and output parameters are assumed as trapezoidal function. It is inferred that increase in cutting speed and pulsed frequency of laser, there is an improvement in surface finish, whereas increase of feed rate results in deterioration of surface integrity. The material removal rate is directly proportional to feed, speed, depth of cut and pulsed frequency of laser. There is a better agreement between experimental and fuzzy model values. The proposed model predicts the surface roughness and MRR with prediction error of 15.76 and 7.69 % respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, this is usually not the case in real practice, especially when it is a highly complex industry as is the case for semiconductor fabrication. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to detect the root causes of machine/chamber mismatching in real time by exploiting all the available data, such as product measurements, machine sensor readings and maintenance data.

This paper studies a practical production scheduling problem for the hot metal pretreatment-steelmaking-continuous casting process involving preventive maintenance consideration (denoted as PSCCPM scheduling). A mathematical programming model is designed for the PSCCPM scheduling by considering constraints related to the maintenance plan and other production process requirements. An effective heuristic containing a machine allocation procedure and a conflict eliminate procedure is developed first to obtain a good feasible schedule of this model. Subsequently, by using the heuristic as a decoding algorithm, an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) featuring a novel adaptive evolutionary strategy is presented to obtain a suboptimal solution. Experimental results based on instances generated from a realistic steel plant show the effectiveness of the proposed AGA for solving PSCCPM scheduling problems.

Evaluation of surface roughness during turning of Al-SiC and Al-SiC-Gr composites	MULTIDISCIPLINE MODELING IN MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						RSM; Surface roughness; ANN; Turning; Aluminium composites	METAL-MATRIX COMPOSITES; MACHINING PARAMETERS; FUZZY ALGORITHM; WEAR; OPTIMIZATION; ALLOY; PARTICLES; INTEGRITY; GRAPHITE; BEHAVIOR	Purpose In the current scenario, new materials are gaining popularity due to higher specific properties of strength and stiffness, increase in wear resistance, dimensional stability at higher temperature, etc. Subsequently, the need for precise machining has also been increased enormously. The purpose of this paper is to study the surface roughness during the turning of Al-10%SiC and Al-5%SiC-5%Gr composites under different cutting conditions. Design/methodology/approach Artificial neural network (ANN) has been effectively employed in solving problems with effortless computation in the areas such as fault diagnosis, process identification, property estimation, data smoothing and error filtering, product design and development, optimisation and estimation of activity coefficients. Response surface method is also used to analyse the problems involving a number of input parameters and their corresponding relationship between one or more measured dependent responses. Using Design Expert.8 evaluation software package, a simpler and more efficient statistical RSM model has been designed. RSM models are created by using 27 experimental data measurements obtained from different turning conditions of aluminium alloy composites. Findings In this work, the surface roughness during turning of Al-10%SiC and Al-5%SiC-5%Gr composites under different cutting conditions has been studied. The surface roughness value is proportional with the increase in feed rate and depth of cut while inversely proportional with the cutting speed. In all turning conditions, Al-10%SiC composite has lower surface roughness values than Al-5%SiC-5%Gr hybrid composite. An ANN and response surface models have been developed to predict the surface roughness of machined surface. The experimental results concur well with predicted models. Originality/value In the present trend, new materials are gaining popularity due to higher specific properties of strength and stiffness, increase in wear resistance, dimensional stability at higher temperature, etc. Subsequently, the need for precise machining has also been increased enormously. In this work, the surface roughness during turning of Al-10%SiC and Al-5%SiC-5%Gr composites under different cutting conditions has been studied.

This work proposes a new computational model for detecting oil whirl faults in induction motors using orbital patterns. Signal vibrations are measured and pre-processed in order to obtain a characteristic orbit that represents the motor condition where an oil whirl fault is present.

Firstly, two novel shape descriptors, respectively, named accurate Fourier height functions 1 (AFHF1) and accurate Fourier height functions 2 (AFHF2) are presented based on height function (HF) and Fourier transformation. Both AFHF1 and AFHF2 shape descriptors are constant to similarity transforms and also have intrinsic invariance to the starting point change and are more compacted than HF.) Therefore, they perform well on the global or local features of the contours of shaft orbits.) en, the AFHF1 and AFHF2 shape descriptors are utilized to extract features of shaft orbits in the simulated dataset and measured dataset. Taking extracted feature vectors as the input, SVM is adopted in order to classify the fault types according to the shapes of shaft orbits. Finally, a series of descriptors including shape context (SC), inner-distance shape context (IDSC), triangular centroid distances (TCDs), and HF were compared to verify the performance of the proposed AFHF1 and AFHF2 shape descriptors.) The average accuracy of our method in simulated dataset and measured dataset are all higher than 99.83%, the average recognition time of each sample is no more than 19 milliseconds.) The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has the best recognition accuracy and real-time and antinoise performance.

J	Li, ZX; Shi, BQ				Li, Zhixing; Shi, Boqiang			Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Based on Stochastic Resonance with a Bistable Confining Potential	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							LOCAL MEAN DECOMPOSITION	Since the weak fault characteristics of mechanical equipment are often difficult to extract in strong background noise, stochastic resonance (SR) is widely used to extract the weak fault characteristics, which is able to utilize the noise to amplify weak fault characteristics. Although classical bistable stochastic resonance (CBSR) can enhance the weak characteristics by adjusting the parameters of potential model, when potential barrier height is adjusted potential well width is also changed and vice versa. The simultaneous change of both potential well width and barrier height is difficult to obtain a suitable potential model for better weak fault characteristic extraction and further fault diagnosis of machinery. For this reason, the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of CBSR is greatly reduced, and the corresponding enhancement ability of weak fault characteristics is limited. In order to avoid the shortcomings, a new SR method is proposed to extract weak fault characteristics and further diagnose the faults of rotating machinery, where the classical bistable potential is replaced with a bistable confining potential to get the optimal SR. The bistable confining potential model not only has the characteristics of the classical bistable potential model but also has the ability to adjust the potential width, barrier height, and wall steepness independently. Simulated data are used to demonstrate the proposed new SR method. The results indicate that the weak fault characteristics can be effectively extracted from simulated signals with heavy noise. Experiments on the bearings and planetary gearboxes demonstrate that the proposed SR method can correctly diagnose the faults of rotating machinery and moreover has higher spectrum peak and better recognition degree compared with the CBSR method.

J	Ben Ali, J; Saidi, L				Ben Ali, Jaouher; Saidi, Lotfi			A new suitable feature selection and regression procedure for lithium-ion battery prognostics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ISOMAP; ISVR; Li-ion battery; PHM; RUL	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; HEALTH ESTIMATION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; STATE; PREDICTION; FUSION; SYSTEM; MODEL	The accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is indispensable for safe and lifetime-optimised operation. Thereby, the monitoring of this vital component is very necessary for planning repair work and minimising unexpected electricity outage. However, the study and the investigation of internal battery parameters show several value changes within the battery lifetime and it is highly influenced by environmental and load conditions. Consequently, this paper presents a new prognostic method for online battery monitoring based on isometric feature mapping technique (ISOMAP) and incremental support vector regression (ISVR). ISOMAP is used to reduce some features extracted from lithium-ion batteries, with different health states, in both modes of charge and discharge, and ISVR is used to regress online the selected feature. Experimental results show that the proposed methodology provides a new suitable trend parameter for battery RUL prediction.

Diagnostic / Prognostics Strategies Applied to Physical Dynamic Systems: a Critical Analysis of Several Model-Based Fault Identification Methods	MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING II	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Mathematical Methods & Computational Techniques in Science & Engineering	FEB 16-18, 2018	Cambridge, ENGLAND				ALGORITHM	The development of adequate diagnostic/prognostic methodologies, suitable to provide a timely and reliable evaluation of the health status of a given system on the basis of some representative parameters (measured in a direct or indirect way), is fundamentally started in engineering fields, but, especially in recent years, it is encountering more and more interest and application in many technical fields and nowadays it represents an important task in various scientific disciplines. The health status of a given dynamic system (e.g. environmental, mechatronic, structural, etc.) and the eventual incipient failures that concern it, especially if related to progressive evolutions, can be identified and quantified by means of different approaches widely described in the literature. It must be noted that, particularly in recent years, there has been a strong impulse in the development of strategies aimed to design prognostic algorithms able to identify precursors of the progressive failures affecting a system: in fact, if it is correctly identified the degradation pattern, an early warning can be triggered, leading to proper corrective actions (i.e. proper remedial or maintenance tasks, replacement of the damaged components, etc.). Since these algorithms are strictly technology-oriented, they can show great effectiveness for some specific applications, while they may fail for other applications and technologies: therefore, it is necessary to properly conceive the specific prognostic method as a function of several parameters such as the given (dynamic) system, the available sensors (physical or virtual), the considered progressive failures and the related boundary conditions. This work proposes a critical comparison between several diagnostic/prognostic strategies in order to put in evidence their strengths and the eventual shortcomings.	[Dalla Vedova, Matteo D.

Faulty conditions in such systems can cause system outages that could lead to losses. In order to prevent potential system faults, it is important that anomalous conditions that lead to these faults are detected effectively. Nevertheless, the high complexity of the system components makes anomaly detection a high dimensional machine learning problem. This paper presents the application of a deep learning neural network known as Variational Autoencoder (VAE), as the solution to this problem. We show that, when used in an unsupervised manner, VAE outperforms the well-known clustering technique DBSCAN. Moreover, this paper shows that higher recall can be achieved using the semi-supervised one class learning of VAE, which uses only the normal data to train the model. Additionally, we show that one class learning of VAE outperforms semi-supervised one class SVM when training data consist of only a very small amount of anomalous samples. When a tree based ensemble technique is adopted for feature selection, the obtained results evidently demonstrate that the performance of the VAE is highly positively correlated with the selected feature set.

J	Yuan, R; Lv, Y; Song, GB				Yuan, Rui; Lv, Yong; Song, Gangbing			Fault Diagnosis of Rolling Bearing Based on a Novel Adaptive High-Order Local Projection Denoising Method	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAVELET PACKET DECOMPOSITION; NOISE-REDUCTION; EMBEDDING DIMENSION; ENTROPY; SVD	Rolling bearings are vital components in rotary machinery, and their operating condition affects the entire mechanical systems. As one of the most important denoising methods for nonlinear systems, local projection (LP) denoising method can be used to reduce noise effectively. Afterwards, high-order polynomials are utilized to estimate the centroid of the neighborhood to better preserve complete geometry of attractors; thus, high-order local projection (HLP) can improve noise reduction performance. This paper proposed an adaptive high-order local projection (AHLP) denoising method in the field of fault diagnosis of rolling bearings to deal with different kinds of vibration signals of faulty rolling bearings. Optimal orders can be selected corresponding to vibration signals of outer ring fault (ORF) and inner ring fault (IRF) rolling bearings, because they have different nonlinear geometric structures. The vibration signal model of faulty rolling bearing is adopted in numerical simulations, and the characteristic frequencies of simulated signals can be well extracted by the proposed method. Furthermore, two kinds of experimental data have been processed in application researches, and fault frequencies of ORF and IRF rolling bearings can be both clearly extracted by the proposed method. The theoretical derivation, numerical simulations, and application research can indicate that the proposed novel approach is promising in the field of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing.

J	Cao, XC; Zeng, NY; Chen, BQ; He, WP				Cao, Xincheng; Zeng, Nianyin; Chen, Binqiang; He, Wangpeng			Sparsity Enhanced Topological Fractal Decomposition for Smart Machinery Fault Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Rotating machinery; fault diagnosis; topology fractal multi-resolution analysis (TFMRA); sparse representation; rub-impact	VARIATIONAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FILTER BANK; BEARING; ALGORITHM; GEARBOX	Automatic fault feature extraction-based smart fault diagnosis is becoming more and more popular, as it does not require excessive expertise of on-site staff. Advanced signal processing techniques are of significant importance in order to ensure efficient and effective fault feature analysis. Multi-resolution analysis is an effective tool utilized to decouple multiple signal modes within the measured vibration signal. However, current multi-resolution analyzing methods still cannot enable continuous spectral refinements around fixed analyzing frequencies. To address this problem, a novel theory of topological fractal multi-resolution analysis (TFMRA) is proposed. With the concept of nested centralized wavelet packet cluster (NCWPC), TFMRA is equipped with the ability to extract multiple fault features simultaneously. Mathematically, we prove that: 1) each NCWPC is a topology subset of spectral domain of the investigated signal and 2) all sets of NCWPC share a common self-similar fractal property in geometry. This paper reveals an important intrinsic relation between classical dyadic multi-resolution analysis and TFMRA. That is, each dyadic wavelet packet can be uniquely associated with an NCWPC according to the definitions of TFMRA, and classical wavelet packet spaces are regarded as proper subsets of the proposed NCWPCs. Combining signal decomposition using TFMRA and damage information of a mechanical system, we propose an improved sparsity promoted vibration signature analyzing methodology to investigate repetitive transient fault features. This method was applied to extract abnormal vibration signatures from an experimental rotor test rig with rub-impact faults. Processing results demonstrate that nanocomponents of transient vibrations, which are produced by rub-impact faults, were successfully identified. These results are compared with those of some other comparison techniques based on sparse representation.

Although various subspace clustering methods have been developed to deal with high-dimensional and non-linear data, analyzing the intrinsic structure from the data is still challenging. To address this issue, a new subspace clustering method based on locality-preserving robust latent low-rank recovery (L2PLRR) was developed. Unlike conventional subspace clustering methods, the developed method maps the high-dimensional and non-linear data into a low-dimensional latent space by preserving local similarities of the data with the goal of resolving the difficulty in analyzing the high-dimensional data. Likewise, in the developed L2PLRR method, learned features correspond to low-rank coefficients of the data in the latent space, which will be further used for fault diagnosis (e.g., identification of health states of an object system). The efficacy of the developed L2PLRR method was verified with a bearing fault diagnosis application by comparing with conventional and state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods in terms of diagnostic performance.

For fault diagnosis, chronicles describe the nominal and faulty behaviors of the process. Powerful algorithms allow the recognition of chronicles in the flow of observations of the system and appropriate actions can be taken when a faulty situation is recognized. However, designing chronicles is not a trivial thing to do. The increasing complexity and capacity of data generation of highly-advanced processes cause the acquisition of a complete model difficult. This paper focuses on the problem of discovering chronicles that are representative of a system behavior from direct observations. A clustering approach to this problem is considered. The chronicle discovery algorithm proposed here designs chronicles with minimal knowledge of the system to diagnose. Furthermore, unprocessed data obtained directly from the system can be used in this clustering algorithm. Finally, the chronicle discovery algorithm proposed in this paper is illustrated on a sport performance monitoring device for a diagnosis of movement deviations in the temporal domain, in the event domain, or both, considered as faults for the athlete.

In the paper it is motivated that in many cases there are more possible candidate residuals than needed for detection and single fault isolation and key sources of varying performance in the candidate residuals are model errors and noise. This paper formulates a systematic method of how to select, from a set of candidate residuals, a subset with good diagnosis performance. A key contribution is the combination of a machine learning model, here a random forest model, with diagnosis specific performance specifications to select a high performing subset of residuals. The approach is applied to an industrial use case, an automotive engine, and it is shown how the trade-off between diagnosis performance and the number of residuals easily can be controlled.

First of all, a nonlinear analytical model of the degradation that depends on loading inputs is established. Then, a joint estimation of the unknown loading inputs and of the degradation state is performed with a particle filter. Moreover, a two-sided cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm is implemented to detect abrupt load variations and help the particle filter to adapt and learn new loading inputs values. With the combination of these two techniques, the prognosis module could be informed of the sudden crack length increase, and will correct the predicted remaining useful life. Real data from fatigue tests on fiber-reinforced metal matrix composite materials are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology for crack growth prognosis.

Most of the existing approaches assume degradation occurrence in a single component with a single degradation mode for the simplification of RUL prediction. However, in such system, degradation of many components may occur simultaneously and those may show different unknown linear or nonlinear degradation behaviors in their life cycle. Practically, RUL prediction is complicated when the degradation information is unknown a priori and shows nonlinear behaviour. Thus, this article proposes to progressively obtain the degradation estimates of the components through estimation process after their detection and thus multiple degradation models are postulated on-the-fly using the estimates of the degradations. RULs are regularly updated through adaptive degradation models identified by using the concept of sliding window estimation technique. The proposed technique is demonstrated through simulation on a multi-component electrical system. This article also includes the accelerated ageing experimental result which strongly supports the concept of activation of different degradation modes of the component during its life cycle.

The objective of this paper is to describe a process enabling to schedule simultaneously the production activities and maintenance operations. The proposed process is based on a multi-agents system that has shown its effectiveness in dealing with conflict situations. It consists in scheduling the production activities on the resources taking into consideration their health states. Thus, instead of waiting for the resource to fail or of planning in advance preventive maintenances where some would be unneeded, the health assesment functions provide information about the reliability of the production technical resources. Among this information, degradation measurements permit the prediction of the remaining durations of use also known as remaining useful lifetimes. Thus they enable prior planning for maintenance orders and scheduling the production activities, so that conflicts can be managed between maintenance and planning activities.

The proposed methodology consists of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, different time-domain health indicators (HIs) are extracted and the best indicator of degradation is selected by filter-based methods. Then, a degradation model is defined and its parameters are estimated using the selected HI. In the online phase, the k-means clustering is utilized to detect a change(s) in the system's health state and to trigger failure prognostics for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The degradation model parameters are updated as new data are available, and the RUL is predicted iteratively. The proposed methodology is implemented on point machine sliding chair degradation using in-field condition monitoring (CM) data. The results show that the methodology can be effectively used in machine degradation-level assessment and in online RUL predictions.

The proposed diagnostic scheme extracts the informative features from each component by resorting to the second generation wavelet transform. Undoubtedly, a large dimension of features brought more challenges to detect healthy and defective bearings. In this regard, the dimensionality reduction phase makes use of linear discriminant analysis that aims to obtain a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data as well as achieves maximum separability between different classes. Furthermore, self organizing maps (SOM) helps in evaluating and facilitating visual comprehension of the extracted features. In the following step, support vector machine (SVM) is used for identifying faulty and fault-free bearings. Finally, the performance of the proposed technique is compared with the previous works.

To ensure the system safety and reliability, many conventional model based fault diagnosis methods have been proposed. However, with the increase in the complexity and uncertainty of engineering system, it is not feasible to establish accurate mathematical models most of the time. Rotating machinery, due to the complexity in its mechanical structure and transmission mechanics, is within this category. Thus, data-driven method is required for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis scheme based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed. With the available data measurement signals from multiple sensors in the system, both spatial and temporal dependencies can be utilized to detect the fault and classify the corresponding fault types. A hardware experimental study on wind turbine drivetrain diagnostics simulator (WTDDS) is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

First, the model of an inverter-fed permanent magnet motor, simulated using Matlab/Simulink, is briefly presented. The proposed model enables the generation of electrical, magnetic and vibration signals under healthy and faulty behaviors. The presented work focuses mainly on the rotor demagnetization and eccentricity faults. Then, different indicators including time, frequency, space and space harmonic characteristics are extracted from vibrations for different cases. These features are analyzed with respect to fault type and severity to select the most discriminative ones. For fault detection, a statistical test is used to compare each of the selected indicators with a decision threshold to detect the occurrence of a fault in the motor. The values of different thresholds are calculated in order to achieve a given low false alarm rate (alpha). The test power (1 - beta) of each fault indicator is also evaluated for its corresponding threshold. The fault isolation is then realized using a fault signature table. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on two sets of noisy simulated data related to different machine conditions.

The uncertainties mainly include the inherent uncertainty associated with the progression of the degradation over time and the inevitable uncertainty caused by noise and disturbance. Handling uncertainties is important to improve the prediction accuracy of remaining useful life (RUL) in the degraded process from fault to failure. This study takes uncertainties into consideration via the relevant vector machine (RVM) approach in order to achieve a good accuracy. Firstly, a target vector is derived by first hitting time (FHT) to characterize the RUL. This is fulfilled off-line based on historical sample data. Then, a stochastic model is established by RVM under Bayesian framework. Further, parameters are updated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for an optimized RVM model. And then, the on-line RUL prediction is implemented with the updated RVM model. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated by two real case studies of traction faults occurred in the high-speed train. The prediction results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A function for a degradation process is numerically determined by using a first stage and a second stage diagnostic bond graph model (DBG). Evaluation of the Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARRs) from the first stage DBG provides residuals that enable to detect the onset of incipient faults. The second stage DBG model accounts for parametric degradation by means of an unknown function. ARRs derived from the second stage DBG make use of the residuals of the first stage ARRs and constitute an implicit relation for the unknown degradation function. The computation takes place online concurrently to the monitoring of a real system and the measurement of its output signals. Once the time evolution of a degradation process has been computed up to some time instant, the time evolution of an ARR residual using it can be projected into the future in order to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a system. With progress of time the computation of a degradation process can be repeated and estimations of a RUL can be improved.

The approach deals with nonlinear Multiple-Input Multiple-Output system subject to degradations. The aim of this work was to estimate online the duration before the system performance requirement is no longer met, this without adding sensors. To carry out this aim, we used a Nonlinear Unknown Input Observer to estimate relevant parameters which are able to characterize system performance and a statistical inference method which is the maximum likelihood estimation to identify the models describing the parameter dynamics To illustrate the performances of the approach, a simulated coupled four tank system was used.

In the presented paper, the detection of the degradation beginning, the isolation of the faulty component, and the estimation of the degradation profile are performed in an integrated way by using the Bond Graph tool. Regarding the remaining useful lifetime, it is predicted from the considered dynamic of parametric degradation described by ordinary differential equations.

The greater structural flexibility of such machines necessitates considerations of reliable load mitigation techniques in order to alleviate the effects of asymmetric wind loads and fatigue. This paper proposes a reliable load mitigation scheme, referred to as 'fault-tolerant individual pitch control', which involves adjustments in pitch angles of the wind turbine blades individually in the presence of blade pitch actuator faults. The proposed scheme consists of a collective pitch control augmented with an individual pitch control, and a fault detection and diagnosis system. Simulation results obtained for a large-scale offshore wind turbine with a stochastic wind field illustrate effectiveness as well as fault-tolerance of the proposed scheme compared to the scheme based on control of pitch angles collectively. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only ensures more uniform output power with reduced loads on the turbine, but also tolerates the effects of possible faults in pith actuators of the blades.

To avoid operational downtime and, even more, accidents timely maintenance of the railway infrastructure becomes a crucial aspect. Current maintenance policies are mostly reactive or periodic, which give surge to a high O&M cost. Reducing maintenance cost while enhancing asset reliability may be achieved through the adoption of predictive maintenance policies. This requires the availability of a condition monitoring system able to assess the infrastructure health state through diagnosis and prognosis of degradation processes occurring on the different railway components. Central to any condition monitoring system is the a-priori knowledge about the process to be supervised in the form of either mathematical models of different complexity or signal features characterizing the health state. This paper proposes a statistical model for the switch panel of railway turnouts that characterizes two key components: railpad and ballast. Exploiting vibration data collected during train passages their natural frequencies are estimated through an estimation scheme based on empirical mode decomposition and subspace identification. By analysing vertical acceleration data corresponding to 400 train passages the estimated resonance frequencies associated with the ballast and the railpad have been well characterized by normally distributed random variables.

The prediction of the expected RUL is very useful to decrease maintenance cost, operational downtime and safety hazards. This paper proposes a new strategy of health-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system that includes as an additional goal extending the system RUL via their estimation using reliability tools. In this approach, the RUL maximization is included in the objective function of the LPV-MPC controller. The RUL is included in the MPC model as an extra parameter varying equation that considers the control action as scheduling variable. The proposed control approach allows the controller to accommodate to the parameter changes. Through computing an estimation of the state variables during prediction, the MPC model can be modified to the estimated state evolution at each time instant. Moreover, for solving the optimization problem by using a series of Quadratic Programs (QP) in each time instant, a new iterative approach is exhibited, which improves the computational efficiency. A pasteurization plant control system is used as a case study to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.

Therefore, anti-islanding protection is a critical concern. A novel reactive power variation (RPV) islanding detection method based on correlation function data fusion and support vector machine (CFDF-SVM) approach is presented to reduce the non-detection zone (NDZ) and avoid the false detection caused by pseudo islanding phenomenon (PIP). The feature data sets (frequency, injected reactive power, fundamental and third harmonics of point of common coupling (PCC) voltage and current) are acquired by Fourier transform and fused by CFDF approach After that, the fused data sets are classified into two categories by an SVM approach: islanding and non-islanding. In addition, the proposed approach is based on the active intermittent RPV method which reduced the NDZ fundamentally. Compared with the traditional RPV method, the proposed method could detect islanding event accurately, and the false detection rate caused by PIP is significantly reduced. Then a single-phase-inverter is built by Simulink, the detection results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In the case of machining systems, timely fault diagnosis avoids products that are out of specification and/or extreme damage. Optimum machining is highly dependent on the performance and condition of the spindle, within which the bearing system represents the mechanical components with the greatest likelihood of failure. The advances in the use of the Wavelet Transform (WT) was analyzed and a fault detection method for spindles was proposed. This method automatically detects the frequency range where most information of the fault is located and separates it from other noisy frequencies. Furthermore, faults can be detected at early stages. Early results, validated with experimental data, are promising for an automatic system.

Effect of Entropy Generation on Wear Mechanics and System Reliability	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT ADVANCES IN MATERIALS & MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Technologies (IMMT)	NOV 28-29, 2017	Dubai, U ARAB EMIRATES					Wear is an irreversible phenomenon. Processes such as mutual sliding and rolling between materials involve entropy generation. These processes are monotonic with respect to time. The concept of entropy generation is further quantified using Degradation Entropy Generation theorem formulated by Michael D. Bryant. The sliding-wear model can be extrapolated to different instances in order to further provide a potential analysis of machine prognostics as well as system and process reliability for various processes besides even mere mechanical processes. In other words, using the concept of 'entropy generation' and wear, one can quantify the reliability of a system with respect to time using a thermodynamic variable, which is the basis of this paper. Thus in the present investigation, a unique attempt has been made to establish correlation between entropy-wear-reliability which can be useful technique in preventive maintenance.

Towards a Comprehensive DGA Health Index	2018 IEEE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIELECTRICS (ICD)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd IEEE International Conference on Dielectrics (ICD)	JUL 01-05, 2018	Budapest, HUNGARY	IEEE		Dissolved gas analysis (DGA); transformer; health index; condition monitoring; machine learning		Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a widely adopted method for transformer diagnostics and maintenance decision-making. Traditional methods for DGA estimation classify the transformer health state according to predefined gas ratios and intervals. However, these methods are unable to deal with conflicting outputs because their diagnostics output is a single value. There are data-driven DGA classification methods which overcome the limitations of traditional methods, but usually, the DGA result is not considered in isolation and the analysis of other complementary variables can enhance the transformer health state estimation process. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel DGA-based health index formulation combining data-driven models with expert knowledge. Results confirm that the proposed approach is effective for classifying transformer faults and for identifying incipient abnormal patterns.	[Aizpurua, Jose, I; Stewart, Brian G.; McArthur, Stephen D.

For this purpose, a finite element method (FEM) based model has been designed to check the behavior of the generator under normal and inter turn short circuit fault condition in the rotor windings. In this paper, a field-circuit coupled model of machine was designed using ANSYS Maxwell 2D. The circuit is modeled by a small elements mesh. Three phase AC current source is provided to the rotor windings and the excitations on rotor winding side are set in the external circuit. The stator and rotor slot number are 72/60 and number of turns per phase for stator and rotor are 228/100. The outer diameter of stator is 520mm and the inner diameter is 350mm. The outer diameter of rotor is 346.6mm and the inner diameter is 110mm. Different rotor inter turn short circuit fault conditions are accomplished by reducing the number of turns in rotor slot. Based on the simulation, it was found that phase difference and positive and negative sequence of current analysis were effective methods to diagnosis the rotor inter turn short circuit fault. During the normal operation, all the three phases are equally distributed and are 120 degrees degrees apart and start to distracted from 120 degrees degree when inter turn short circuit happened. Under normal condition, the negative sequence of current is low. However, as the fault degree enlarges, negative sequence of current becomes larger, thus ratio of negative to positive sequence of current also increases. The simulation results illustrate that the analysis done in this paper is quite appropriate as desired, also proposed technique is advanced in wind turbines.

In this paper, an investigation of faulty conditions in an industrial base metal refinery is conducted using standard statistical fault detection and diagnosis methods, and the IntelliSenzo (TM) monitoring dashboard. A workflow for offline fault investigation is described, and demonstrated on the industrial data, highlighting the need for careful record keeping, a structured approach, and iterative investigative steps. Potential propagation paths established links between the identified fault, process variables of interest, and engineering hypotheses, guiding the investigation and leading to recommendations of corrective action to the operating plant. The root cause of the fault (leaking and choked feed valves) were identified as potential causes in the investigation. Plant personnel confirmed that this structured approach, using process data, statistical techniques, and engineering knowledge, could speed up fault investigations, and reduce the costs of production losses and plant downtime.

To this end, approaches such as prognostics and health management (PHM) are being developed by researchers to support making predictive maintenance decisions by relaying on quantitative indicators such as remaining useful life (RUL); that is basically the projected time to failure of a given system. In general, an industrial system is composed of many components which failure may lead to the failure of the system; so that identification of such components which are referred to as critical components, constitute therefore an important stake. The process of identifying such components is based on many methods encountered in the literature among which experience feedback is drawing more and more attention of researchers because of, among other reasons, the fact that companies dispose nowadays of huge amount of functioning data of their systems. The aim of this paper is to develop a methodology based on experience feedback to identify critical components of a given industrial system. The proposed methodology will be applied to a real world case in broadcast industry to show its feasibility. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Maintenance scheduling decides, in a tactical way, when theses maintenance activities will be carried out according to the appearance of opportunities. Numerous works on opportunistic maintenance have been proposed in order to take profit of stochastic, structural and economic dependence. In the real context, the duration of an opportunity is not known accurately. Very few papers take into account the stochastic nature of opportunities duration. In this paper, we present an opportunistic maintenance scheduling methodology considering the stochastic nature of opportunities duration in a predictive maintenance strategy. The prognostic information is used to select opportunities coming before the failure. The proposed maintenance scheduling methodology is based on an optimal stopping problem algorithm known as Bruss algorithm. The originality of this paper is to consider the stochastic nature of opportunities duration using a Monte-Carlo simulation. A numerical study is finally presented to illustrate the use and the strengths of the proposed strategy. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

For these reasons, Sustainable Manufacturing is one of the most important issue to address for reaching a Sustainable Development of our society. In this frame, maintenance process that must ensure availability, reliability and safety of equipment, has a key role for sustainable operations. However, how maintenance can integrate the sustainability goal and contribute to this objective is not clearly defmed: few studies addressing this topic are available in the current literature. These reasons have led the authors to conduct a Scoping Literature Review to investigate the role of maintenance for sustainable manufacturing, with particular focus on the 4th industrial revolution and the enabling technologies 4.0, with the aim of identifying future research directions in this field. The review was conducted following a protocol that minimizes subjectivity and allowing the critical evaluation of relevant studies. Two databases (Scopus and Web of Science) and a set of specific keywords were used to identify and select peer-reviewed papers that presented evidence on the relationship between maintenance and sustainability in the industrial field. The selected papers were assembled respect to specific thematic sections that allowed us to create research clusters in the field of interest. The analysis sheds light on the increasing interest in the last years on "maintenance & sustainability" and the big potentiality of enabling technologies 4.0 in this frame. This paper motivates future researches aimed at the development of sustainable maintenance methodologies/policies, with particular focus on industry 4.0 context, and points out research challenges and opportunities for researchers/practitioners working on maintenance field.

In recent years, the extensive instrumentation of machines and the advancements in Information Communication Technologies are re-shaping the role of assets in our industrial systems. An emerging concept here is that of 'social assets': assets that collaborate with each other in order to improve system optimisation. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are formed by embedding the assets with computers, or microcontrollers, which run real-time decision-making algorithms over the data originating from the asset. These are known as the 'Digital Twins' of the assets, and form the backbone of social assets. It is essential to have an architecture which enables a seamless integration of these technological advances for an industry. This paper proposes a Multi Agent System (MAS) architecture for collaborative learning, and presents the findings of an implementation of this architecture for a prognostics problem. Collaboration among assets is performed by calculating inter-asset similarity during operating condition to identify 'friends' and sharing operational data within these clusters of friends. The architecture described in this paper also presents a generic model for the Digital Twins of assets. Prognostics is demonstrated for the C-MAPSS turbofan engine degradation simulated data-set (Saxena and Goebel (2008)).

The main approach is to identify a correlation between the process settings and the quality of the final product. In this work, a two steps approach is presented to modelling an industrial process. The first step uses a fault detection method, a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based method, to retain only individuals from a normal production process. The second step consists in using a Support Vector machines Regression (SVR) method to build a model of the considered process. It is based on the historic process data defined by an output (a criterion on the product quality) and multiple inputs (various production line settings). The proposed framework is tested on a fluidized bed combustion boiler in the context of paper industry. The experiments confirm the efficiency of our approach.

Sensor accuracy can be affected by many factors such as extreme working conditions, sensor deterioration and interferences from other devices. It may be difficult to distinguish sensor errors and real dynamic changes in a system. A hybrid online multi-sensor error detection and functional redundancy (HOMSED&FR) algorithm is developed to monitor the performance of multiple sensors and reconcile the erroneous sensor signals. The algorithm relies on two methods, outlier-robust Kalman filter (ORKF) and a locally-weighted partial least squares (LW-PLS) regression model. The two methods have different way of using data, ORKF is comparing current signal samples with the signal trace indicated by previous samples and LW-PLS is comparing samples in the past window with the samples from a database and uses the samples with the most similarity to build a model to predict the current signal values. The performance of this system is illustrated with a clinical case involving artificial pancreas experiments, which include data from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and energy expenditure (EE) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) information based on wearable sensors that collect data from people with type 1 diabetes. The results indicate that the proposed method can successfully detect most of the erroneous signals and substitute them with reasonably estimated values computed by the functional redundancy system.

First, according to the requirement of fault prognosis, an incomplete time slice Bayesian network with unknown future observed node is constructed. Moreover, the future states are described by the current measurements and his historic data in the form of conditional probability. Second, according to the completed part of historical data, a parameter-learning algorithm is used to obtain network parameters and the weight coefficients of distribution components. After that, using such weight coefficients as input-output data, the subspace identification method is employed to build a forecasting model which can predict weight coefficients at next sampling time. To achieve fault prognosis, an inference algorithm is developed to predict hidden faults based on the distribution of the measurements directly. Furthermore, the remaining useful life of process is estimated via iterative one-step ahead prognosis. As an example, the proposed method is applied to a continuous stirred tank reactor system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently predict and identify the fault, and estimate the remaining useful life of process, even though the measurements are partly missing.

J	Jiang, ZQ; Banjevic, D; Mingcheng, E; Jardine, A; Li, Q				Jiang, Zengqiang; Banjevic, Dragan; Mingcheng, E.; Jardine, Andrew; Li, Qi			Remaining useful life estimation of metropolitan train wheels considering measurement error	JOURNAL OF QUALITY IN MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Kalman filter; Measurement error; Metropolitan train wheels; Remaining useful life estimation; Wear model	PREDICTION; MODEL; WEAR	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop an approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of metropolitan train wheels considering measurement error. Design/methodology/approach The paper proposes a wear model of a metropolitan train wheel based on a discrete state space model; the model considers the wheel's stochastic degradation and measurement error simultaneously. The paper estimates the RUL on the basis of the estimated degradation state. Finally, it presents a case study to verify the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed method is superior to methods that do not consider measurement error and can improve the accuracy of the estimated RUL. Findings RUL estimation is a key issue in condition-based maintenance and prognostics and health management. With the rapid development of advanced sensor technologies and data acquisition facilities for the maintenance of metropolitan train wheels, condition monitoring (CM) is becoming more accurate and more affordable, creating the possibility of estimating the RUL of wheels using CM data. However, the measurements of the wheels, especially the wayside measurements, are not yet precise enough. On the other hand, few existing studies of the RUL estimation of train wheels consider measurement error. Practical implications The approach described in this paper will make the RUL estimation of metropolitan train wheels easier and more precise. Originality/value Hundreds of million yuan are wasted every year due to over re-profiling of rail wheels in China. The ability to precisely estimate RUL will reduce the number of re-profiling activities and achieve significant economic benefits. More generally, the paper could enrich the body of knowledge of RUL estimation for a slowly degrading system considering measurement error.

Machinery Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Variational Mode Decomposition and Support Vector Machine as a Classifier	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING APPLICATIONS (ICONAMMA-2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Applications (IConAMMA)	AUG 17-19, 2017	Bengaluru, INDIA	Amrita Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn		Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD); Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Crack propagation	WAVELET; GEAR	Crack propagation is a major cause of failure in rotating machines. It adversely affects the productivity, safety, and the machining quality. Hence, detecting the crack's severity accurately is imperative for the predictive maintenance of such machines. Fault diagnosis is an established concept in identifying the faults, for observing the non-linear behaviour of the vibration signals at various operating conditions. In this work, we find the classification efficiencies for both original and the reconstructed vibrational signals. The reconstructed signals are obtained using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), by splitting the original signal into three intrinsic mode functional components and framing them accordingly. Feature extraction, feature selection and feature classification are the three phases in obtaining the classification efficiencies. All the statistical features from the original signals and reconstructed signals are found out in feature extraction process individually. A few statistical parameters are selected in feature selection process and are classified using the SVM classifier. The obtained results show the best parameters and appropriate kernel in SVM classifier for detecting the faults in bearings. Hence, we conclude that better results were obtained by VMD and SVM process over normal process using SVM. This is owing to denoising and filtering the raw vibrational signals.	[Krishna, K.

Prediction of the shop floor activities has a great potential to reduce manufacturing costs, by providing the information required for operational decisions like preventive maintenance, automatic remediation or scheduling optimization. Research has been focusing on how machine learning algorithms can be used to better understand and extract insights from historical data collected from manufacturing systems. However, in the current manufacturing environments, driven by mass customization and short time to market, these approaches fail to be agile enough to be useful. In this paper we propose a real-time machine learning approach for large scale manufacturing systems that can predict various scenarios before service degradation occurs, thus allowing for corrective actions. At the same time, outliner detection algorithms can be used to evaluate the system's health at a holistic level. Scalability requirements are achieved by modelling the architecture around data streams processed in real time by map-reduce operations. The concepts presented in this paper build on recent developments on flexible, distributed and cloud based manufacturing, where these real time actions can be efficiently implemented.

This paper applies a feedforward chaotic neural network (FCNN) to recognize acoustic emission (AE) source in rotor rubbing and diagnose the rotor operational condition. This method adds the dynamic chaotic neurons based on logistic mapping into the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to avoid the network falling into a local minimum, the delayed and feedback structure for maximum efficiency of recognition performance. The AE data was rotor rubbing process sampled from the test rig of rotatory machine, classification by fault degree. The experimental results indicate that the recognition rate is superior to the traditional BP network models. It is an effective method to recognize the rubbing faults for the machine normal operation.

Three methods, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Yule Walker Estimate by Auto Regression (YUL-AR), and Matching Pursuit (MP), are considered for feature selection purpose. These methods are implemented on stator current signals of an induction motor under healthy and different number of broken rotor bars (BRBs) conditions simulated by the finite element analysis software ANSYS. It is found that the proposed MP method offers the most effective feature selection among the three methods, and is able to classify BRB faults accurately through support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN).

Authors researches have already shown the limits of the usual diagnostic procedures based on the sum of both left and right current sidebands. A proper faulty machine model leading to a more robust diagnosis has been proposed and the effect of machine size and load conditions on current space vector sidebands, flux, torque and speed spectral components is shown. These physical quantities, in case of small faults, can be described by their representative phasors in a synchronous reference frame. The analytical links among the phasors are validated by simulations and experiments. The prominent role of mechanical inertia in the diagnostic process is highlighted, assessing the range of validity of the usual diagnostic index versus machine size and load, eventually an alternative procedure is here proposed.

Among multiphase machines, permanent magnet synchronous motors is an attractive alternative to induction machines, for a large variety of applications, principally because of their reliability and higher dynamic performances. In this context, rotor magnet anomalies diagnosis is crucial and is receiving an increasing attention to ensure the required application performances. In this paper, a newly developed technique for the detection of rotor magnet demagnetization, due to stator over currents in six-phase surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors, is presented. The proposed approach is mainly based on the spectral analysis of the back-emf, leading to an effective detection of rotor magnet demagnetization. The performance of the proposed non-invasive approach has been, firstly, validated by means of two dimensional finite element analysis, and then by experimental results, showing a very good agreement.

Currently, the identification of switch failures mainly depends on the experience of railway staff and the use of simple thresholding methods. However; these basic methods are highly inaccurate and frequently result in false and missing alarms. This paper aims to develop a hybrid fault diagnosis (HFD) method for railway switches. The method is an intelligent diagnosis method that uses massive current curves collected by microcomputer monitoring systems. We first divide the switch operation current curves into three segments based on the three mechanical processes that occur during switch operation. Then, a standard curve is selected from the fault-five curves, and common typical faults are ascertained through a microcomputer monitoring system. Finally, derivative dynamic time warping and a quartile scheme are employed to identify fault curves. An experiment based on current curves collected from the Guangzhou Railway Bureau in China demonstrates that the HFD method is extremely accurate and has low false and missing alarm rates.

The proposed method can work under multiple open-switch faults by bypassing the faulty part with the minimum number of switches. Matlab/Simulink package is used to verify the proposed method. Simulation results for 3-phase 12/8 SRM under multiple open-switch faults are provided at low and high speeds when current chopping control (CCC) and voltage modulation control is used, respectively. The proposed method also characterizes by providing a complete tolerance at low speeds up to four open-switch faults, so that system dynamics is similar to healthy conditions.

However, due to the complex physical phenomena inside the fuel cell, which are strongly inter-coupled, the conventional semi-empirical model-based prognostics approach may fail to predict the aging phenomena under varies fuel cell operating conditions. In order to improve prognostics accuracy, this paper proposed a data-driven approach to predict the fuel cell performance based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN). Compared with traditional RNN, LSTM can be used to avoid gradient exploding and vanishing problems. Such a prediction model for the short-term memory can last for a long period of time, which makes LSTM suitable for time series forecasting. In order to validate the performance of the proposed LSTM approach, two different types of PEMFC along with five aging experimental data sets have been used. The results show that the proposed LSTM approach can accurately predict PEMFC degradation. An accurate degradation prediction plays an important role in PEMFC optimization used in transportation applications.

This is done in order to to determine the state of health of electrical machines, especially those used in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) and Electric Vehicle (EV) applications, whose state of health needs to be monitored continuously. Feature extraction is the key step in vibration diagnosis. Usually, the time domain vibration signal is transformed into another domain like Fourier or wavelet for feature extraction. In this paper, a dictionary learning method is proposed for finding an optimal transformation for feature extraction. A label consistent sparse representation is applied to vibration data collected from an electric machine to diagnose three classes of bearing faults with a higher accuracy, compared to other extraction methods found in the literature. The trained transform projects the vibration signal from different classes of faults to different basis function which improves the classification task.

Battery aging is caused by factors that carry heavy uncertainty, such as battery usage depending on driver behavior, temperature profile depending on location and thermal management system, etc. with all these variations complicating the battery aging modeling with traditional frameworks. That is why we propose that the modeling should be carried out in a Bayesian Network framework that is capable of incorporating uncertainty and causality. The battery aging model is developed in the Bayesian framework and set of training and test data are used to validate the model. Results show that the BN model has a promising performance in the battery aging modeling. The model is also used to estimate the battery capacity loss in real driving cycles.

C	Haque, MS; Bin Shaheed, MN; Choi, S			IEEE	Haque, Moinul Shaidul; Bin Shaheed, Mohammad Noor; Choi, Seungdeog			RUL Estimation of Power Semiconductor Switch using Evolutionary Time series Prediction	2018 IEEE TRANSPORTATION AND ELECTRIFICATION CONFERENCE AND EXPO (ITEC)	IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference and Expo		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Transportation and Electrification Conference and Expo (ITEC)	JUN 13-15, 2018	Long Beach, CA	IEEE		Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors; Prognostics and Health Management; Particle Filter; Statistical analysis; and Remaining Life Estimation	MODULES	Electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid EV (HEV) are popular for their low fuel cost per mile and near zero carbon emission. These vehicles utilize power semiconductor switches for high efficiency power conversion. These switches experience electrical, thermal, mechanical stresses during their operation and these stresses result in degradation and subsequently, wire-bond lift-off and solder fatigue. This degradation can be identified at an early stage by monitoring the tendency of fault precursor trajectory. Moreover, remaining useful life (RUL) is estimated from prediction and projection of this trajectory. Bayesian filters such as Kalman filter (KF), extended KF and generic particle filtering (GPF) methods have been recently used for trajectory tracing and projection. These methods suffer large variance in tendency projection when trajectory has both linear and non-linear tendencies and subject to harsh measurement noise. Moreover, these methods require large number of samples for probability density function (PDF) construction. In this paper, a hybrid Auto regression integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)-Neural Network (NN) model is utilized for tendency prediction and RUL estimation. The contribution of these two models is estimated and optimized using a nature inspired Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA) evolutionary technique. This hybrid algorithm combines the advantages of ARIMA and NN model to precisely trace and project fault precursor trajectory even under harsh noise. Simulation results verify its effectiveness under different noise level. The experimental validation of the proposed method is shown using RUL estimation of collector-emitter on-state voltage (VCE, ON) of IGBT. The performance of this method is compared to ARIMA model, NN, and PF model.

One popular option is to remove phase current sensors and to estimate the missing currents using the ones remaining. This paper proves that it is possible to estimate the three-phase currents of an anisotropic permanent magnet synchronous machine drive when only one phase current sensor is present. The necessary conditions for observability and stability have been derived, providing certainty for the design of a permanent magnet synchronous machine drive controller. The concept has been verified with high-fidelity simulations that show the one phase current sensor observer is capable of controlling the drive system in the presence of sensor noise and parameter errors.

Several machine learning techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), bagged tree (BT), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) are utilized by employing the sensor and smart meter data containing the voltage and current measurements in the presence of distributed generations (DG) at certain buses on the feeder. Considering the strength of each technique, a new method is applied to combine the predictions of different classifiers at three different steps: (a) classification of faulty phase, (b) detection of impedance level, and (c) identification of faulty line segment to improve the overall accuracy. The proposed method is validated on the modified IEEE 13 bus test system for phase to ground (L-G) type faults. The performance of the proposed method is also evaluated considering system uncertainties like missing sensor data and varying DG penetration level. K-means clustering method is used to predict the missing data to improve overall accuracy.	[Maruf, H. M. Mesbah; Hossan, Md.

According to statistics, when the harvesting machinery works in the field, the fault of the electrical system accounts for about 30%, and there are even fire accidents caused by electrical failures. Therefore, the harvester should comprehensively diagnose its electrical system performance before leaving the factory to improve the quality of the combined harvester and reduce the accident rate. In this paper, according to the needs of the detection of the combine harvester production off-line, electrical detection parameters are proposed and an overall plan for the electrical system performance test stand is formulated. The current and voltage detection methods are used to detect the electrical parameters of the whole machine. The starting current curve evaluation method is used to detect the engine startup parameters. In order to verify the feasibility of the test stand, on-site verification tests were carried out on the combine harvester production line, and a comprehensive test was conducted on the detection efficiency, static parameters, and dynamic parameter detection flow of the whole electrical system. Off-line tests show that the test stand can meet the rapid detection requirements of the electrical system of the combined harvester production line, improve the detection efficiency.

In this article, model-based multiple fault identification technique is presented to estimate speed-dependent coupling misalignment and bearing dynamic parameters in addition with speed independent residual unbalances. For brevity in analysis, a simple coupled rotor bearing system is considered and analytical approach is used to develop the identification algorithm. Equations of motion in generalized co-ordinates are derived with the help of Lagrange's equation and least squares fitting approach is used to estimate the speed-dependent fault parameters. Present identification algorithm requires independent sets of forced response data which are generated with the help of different sets of trial unbalances. To avoid/suppress the ill-conditioning of regression equation, independent sets of forced response data are obtained by rotating the rotor in clock-wise and counter clock-wise directions, alternatively. Robustness of algorithm is checked for different levels of measurement noise.

In order to show the superiority of LWT-SPSR-SVD-based RVM with BGSA (LSS-BGSA-RVM), the traditional RVM trained by the training samples with the features based on LWT-SVD (LS-RVM) is used to compare with the proposed LSS-BGSA-RVM method. The experimental result demonstrates that compared with LS-RVM, LSS-BGSA-RVM can achieve the higher diagnosis accuracy for bearing.

In this study, improved permutation entropy (IPE) is defined as the feature for bearing fault diagnosis. In this method, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), a self-adaptive time-frequency analysis method, is used to process the vibration signals, and a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) can thus be obtained. A feature extraction strategy based on statistical analysis is then presented for IPE, where the so-called optimal number of permutation entropy (PE) values used for an IPE is adaptively selected. The obtained IPE-based samples arc then input to a support vector machine (SVM) model. Subsequently, a trained SVM can be constructed as the classifier for bearing fault diagnosis. Finally, experimental vibration signals are applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method can effectively and accurately diagnose bearing faults, such as inner race faults, outer race faults, and ball faults.

Compressive Sampling and Feature Ranking Framework for Bearing Fault Classification With Vibration Signals	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Bearing fault classification; multiple measurement vector; compressive sampling; feature ranking; classification; algorithms	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FEATURE-SELECTION; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	Failures of rolling element bearings are amongst the main causes of machines breakdowns. To prevent such breakdowns, bearing health monitoring is performed by collecting data from rotating machines, extracting features from the collected data, and applying a classifier to classify faults. To avoid the burden of much storage requirements and processing time of a tremendously large amount of vibration data, the present paper proposes a combined compressive sampling (CS)-based on multiple measurement vector (MMV) and feature ranking framework to learn optimally fewer features from a large amount of vibration data from which bearing health conditions can be classified. The CS-based on the MMV model is the first step in this framework and provides compressively sampled signals based on compressed sampling rates. In the second step, the search for the most important features of these compressively sampled signals is performed using the feature ranking and selection techniques. For that purpose, we have investigated the following: 1) two compressible representations of vibration signals that can be used within CS framework, namely, fast Fourier transform-based coefficients and thresholded Wavelet transform-based coefficients and 2) several feature ranking and selection techniques, namely, three similarity-based techniques, fisher score, Laplacian score, Relief-F; one correlation-based technique, Pearson correlation coefficients; and one independence test technique, Chi-Square (Chi-2) to select fewer features that can sufficiently represent the original vibration signals. These selected features, in combination with three of the popular classifiers-multinomial logistic regression classifier, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines, have been evaluated for the classification of bearing faults. Results show that the proposed framework achieves high classification accuracies with a limited amount of data using various combinations of methods, which outperform recently published results.

Several thousand vibration patterns were acquired from vertically distributed accelerometers along the string of motors, pumps and protectors. Intermediate features are extracted from the raw vibration signals originating from the set of accelerometers. Each pattern was labelled by a human expert to provide ground truth with respect to the different operation classes (normal, sensor fault, rubbing, unbalance or misalignment). A software framework is used to compare several classifier architectures (K-Nearest-Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes and Decision Trees) in a bias aware performance evaluation. In order to boost the classification performance, an ensemble of different versions of a classifier architecture is constructed using the Decision Templates fusion function. The robustness of the system with respect to the emergence of new faults (i.e., untreated faults so far) is corroborated by a systematic analysis methodology.

Since, the fault detection is fundamental for any active system, isolation is similarly vital, and identification is decisive for fault reconfiguration as well as maintenance addition to monitoring purposes. The need for man-made dynamic system to work automatically when sensor, actuator, or system faults occur was constantly developed in order to increase reliability and decrease unavailability and maintenance costs. The key step of our approach based on extraction of mean features from sensors measurements by applying the statistical methods such as Moving Standard Deviation (MSD) and the Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA). The fault detection step is invoked later based on the multi-class SVM classifier that decides the presence or not of the fault. Another important contribution of this paper is the simulation of combined sensor and actuator faults simultaneously for the first time in wind turbine benchmark model. The FDI performances are illustrated through simulation study for seven different scenario tests. The results demonstrate clearly the effectiveness of statistical and SVM approach to detect and isolate single, multiple sensor and actuator faults and outperforms many results reported in the literature for solving this problem.

In order to save costs and prevent accidents caused by bearing failures, the rolling bearing fault diagnosis technology has been widely used in the industrial field. At present, the proposed methods include wavelet transform, morphological filtering, empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), which have obvious shortcomings. As it is difficult to extract the fault characteristic frequency caused by nonlinear and nonstationary features of the rolling bearing fault signal, this paper presents a fault feature extraction method of rolling bearing based on nonlinear mode decomposition (NMD) and wavelet threshold denoised method. First of all, the fault signal was preprocessed via wavelet threshold denoising.) en, the denoised signal was decomposed by using NMD. Next, the mode component envelope spectrum was made. Finally, the fault characteristic frequency of rolling bearing was extracted.) The method was compared with EMD through the simulation experiment and rolling bearing fault experiment. Meanwhile, two indicators including signal-noise ratio (SNR) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were also established to evaluate the fault diagnosis ability of this method, and the results show that this method can extract the fault characteristic frequency accurately.

J	Niu, Q; Yang, SX				Niu, Qian; Yang, Shi-xi			Study on Fatigue Degradation Behavior of a Cracked Rotor Subjected to Lateral Vibration	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							STABILITY ANALYSIS; BEARING SYSTEM; SURFACE CRACKS; EDGE CRACK; GROWTH; STIFFNESS; MODEL; DYNAMICS	Fatigue crack in a rotary shaft is a common failure observed in rotor systems. Since vibration of the shaft causes alternating fatigue loads, the crack propagates slowly. Meanwhile, the propagating crack may cause nonlinear or unstable vibration of the rotor system. In fact, growth of the crack and vibration of the shaft are coupled with each other. Hence, it is necessary to study the fatigue degradation behavior of the cracked rotor accounting for this coupling effect. In this paper, a coupling model of rotor vibration and crack growth is established through dynamic theory and fracture mechanics, and a sequential iterative procedure is proposed to solve the coupling model. Then, the competing degradation failure mode of the cracked rotor is analyzed with regard to the rapid crack growth failure and the unstable vibration failure. And degradation measures are proposed based on the competing degradation failure criterion. At last, degradation behaviors with the coupling effect of nonlinear vibration behavior and multiple parameters including rotation speed, unbalance eccentricity and orientation angle, and damping are investigated by numerical simulation. The results indicate that nonlinear vibration behavior and multiple parameters have considerable influence on the degradation behaviors, which present complex regularity. The findings are of significance to guide the safety design of the rotor system for long time operation and help to the further research on prognostics and lifetime prediction.

Prognostics are necessary for predictive maintenance of bearings in manufacturing systems. The findings show that in general the composite integrated GPR models perform better than the simple mean simple covariance GPR models, irrespective of whether the training or test sets are dependent or independent. In this investigation the Affine Mean GPR (AMGPR) was found to be the most effective prognostic model for prognostics of slow speed bearings on both dependent and independent data samples.

Diagnostics and evaluation of the residual life of an induction motor according to energy parameters	MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UPDATE (MSTU-2018)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	Mechanical Science and Technology Update (MSTU)	FEB 27-28, 2018	Omsk State Technical Univ, Omsk, RUSSIA		Omsk State Technical Univ			The various devices based on vibration, thermal, electromagnetic and other methods are used to diagnose an asynchronous motor today. The use of vibration diagnostics is common for large machines. The emergency stop of the large machines leads to significant downtime and non-produced products meaning that the enterprise incurs significant material losses. However, for low-power engines, vibration diagnostics are used only as a periodic assessment of the state without accumulation of data and their subsequent analysis. It should also be noted that the vibration signals measured from the rolling bearing are affected by varying operating conditions and noise that distort the signal and complicate the faults identification for further evaluation of the residual life. In a number of cases, such as submersible pumps, nuclear power plant safety aggregates, mining equipment, it is practically impossible to use vibration, thermal and other methods for diagnosing asynchronous motors. Therefore, the actual task of this research is the development of a method for diagnosing and estimating the residual life in conditions of the systems without any maintenance, based on the electric motor energy parameters.

Examples range from factory-scale industrial robotics to regional-scale smart grids. Therefore, to enable dynamic coordination at scale among geo-distributed physical endpoints, the intelligence behind these systems will often be hosted in the cloud. However, most CPS applications are inherently safety-critical, and require low-latency responses. Hence, a hierarchy of edge cloudlets and the cloud can be used to offload computationally and data-intensive workloads. While low latency is key, a shared sense of time with the added notion of Quality of Time (QoT) is useful for fault detection, and enables fault-tolerant coordinated action in distributed CPS [1][2]. Given that most public clouds and cloudlets provide multi-tenancy using virtualized units of computing, we aim to introduce the notion of QoT to virtual machines. The use of virtual machines entails the use of a hypervisor, which adds additional timing uncertainty due to relatively higher jitter in clock-read and timer-interrupt latencies. Hence, the use of virtualization presents a challenge in terms of observing and guaranteeing the QoT delivered to an application. To meet these challenges, we present the QuartzV extension to the QoT Stack for Linux [1], to make virtual machines QoT-aware. We utilize the open-source QEMU-KVM [3] hypervisor, and illustrate the para-virtual design choices that are key for delivering near-native levels of timing performance in virtual machines. We also demonstrate the utility of QuartzV by using it in the development of an industrial-automation application. Experimental evaluations also show the efficacy of QuartzV with respect to the native and fully-virtualized cases.

An efficient approach for the diagnosis of faults in turbo pump of liquid rocket engine by employing FFT and time-domain features	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Time domain feature; root mean square; Kurtosis factor; Crest factor; Skew factor; support vector machine		The turbo pump is the propulsion machinery used in liquid rocket engine. The fault caused due to the bearing and rotating components in the turbo pump would lead to a great damage to the pump or to the whole rocket engine and thus creates failure to the mission. For diagnosing the faults in the turbo pump, a technique based on the Fast Fourier Transform and time domain features is proposed in this study. The vibration produced in the turbo pump during dry run test gives the information about the condition of the turbo pump rotating components. The vibration of turbo pump is analysed by the extraction of statistical time domain features such as Mean, Standard Deviation, Root Mean Square, Kurtosis Factor, Crest Factor and Skew Factor. The faults present in the turbo pump are detected using support vector machine classifier, and the data are classified either as Normal or Abnormal data. The historical data-set obtained from Indian Space Research Organization is used for validation of this method. The obtained results indicate that this method diagnoses the fault effectively with 100% accuracy.	[Aiswarya, N.; Priyadharsini, S.

J	Li, JM; Li, M; Yao, XF; Wang, H				Li, Jimeng; Li, Ming; Yao, Xifeng; Wang, Hui			An Adaptive Randomized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit Algorithm With Sliding Window for Rolling Bearing Fault Diagnosis	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Rolling bearing fault diagnosis; sparse representation; adaptive randomized orthogonal matching pursuit; sliding window; periodic impulse components extraction	EMPIRICAL WAVELET TRANSFORM; ROTATING MACHINERY; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; DECOMPOSITION; FREQUENCY; TOOL	Sparse representation, as a powerful signal processing method, is widely used in rolling bearing fault diagnosis. As an algorithm for solving the sparse model, randomized orthogonal matching pursuit (RandOMP) algorithm shows excellent performance in impulse features extraction. However, the sparsity of impulse features is difficult to be determined accurately which influenced the effect of feature extraction. In order to more accurately obtain the fault information of rolling bearing, a method named adaptive RandOMP algorithm with a sliding window (AdRaOMP-SW) is proposed in this paper. The method consists of the adaptive RandOMP (AdRaOMP) algorithm and the sliding window. The AdRaOMP algorithm is an improvement of RandOMP, and it solves the problem that the sparsity of impulse features is difficult to determine and improves the efficiency of feature extraction by selecting a plurality of atoms in each iteration. The sliding window is a data segmentation strategy for the original signal which can be used to weaken the influence of noise. First, the vibration signal of the rolling bearing is segmented into multiple sub-signals by the constructed sliding window. Then, each sub-signal is processed by the AdRaOMP algorithm to obtain the corresponding sparse representation result. Finally, the sparse representation results of all sub-signals are spliced together to obtain the final fault features. The experiments and engineering application demonstrate that AdRaOMP-SW has better feature extraction performance compared with the RandOMP and spectral kurtosis.

A diagnosis of the technical conditions of the engines is performed using a lubricant analysis, vibration analysis, and thermography. With these data from a statistical analysis, it is possible to predict when an engine will fail and to consider this phenomenon in the load predispatch. To increase the engine reliability and power supply, a maintenance management program is developed using MANAGEMENT tools, applying only 4 total productive maintenance pillars and combining them with predictive maintenance and diagnostics, thus reducing failures in plant equipment. Some results achieved after this implementation are as follows: a reduction in the annual cost of maintenance, a reduction in the corrective maintenance, an increase in the mean time between failures, and a decrease in the mean time to repair in all areas.

Two quality control algorithms are developed. The first is the Monte Carlo (MC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) iteration algorithm, i.e. the MC_SVM algorithm. The MC is used to generate random values of the assembly correction data, while the SVM is employed to forecast the assembly quality degree of IFOG. Then, the MC_SVM can tune the multi-type assembly errors. The second algorithm is the Series Feature Analysis (SFA) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) ranking algorithm, i.e. the SFA_AHP algorithm. The SFA is used to calculate the signal features of multi-type data from an IFOG environment adaptability test experiment. The AHP is employed to analyse the importance ranking of potential faults. Then, the SFA_AHP can detect and locate product faults. The above methods can correct errors before the product assembly and locate faults after the assembly. The experiential knowledge of assembly can be inherited and the multidisciplinary restriction of complex manufacturing can be broken. Their analysis results are easy to be understood by users. Many experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.

Since failures often occur on cloud platforms, how to detect OpenStack system failures becomes an important issue. This paper proposes an algorithm for fault diagnosis, which requires only the raw logs. The raw logs are first unified and stored in the database. Then a well designed time window is selected to extract features. The extracted features are then used to locate the fault time period in the logs. Through the analyzing of the log fragment, the components of OpenStack system which account for the failure are determined. And detailed reasons are further confirmed. Experimental results showed that our proposed algorithm performed well in detecting OpenStack failures.

For easy and maintenance-free retrofitting an autonomous power supply is necessary. This work presents results on a foil-based inductive energy harvester as part of a condition monitoring system (system-on-a-foil) which can be retrofitted to pneumatic pistons. A maximum of 180 mu J of energy was generated with a single coil of the best layout for one motion cycle (back-and-forth motion) of the piston with a speed of 1 m/s. The total setup with five coils and an additional flux guide generates 1 mJ per motion cycle. This setup allows measuring the capacitor voltage and environmental data and transmitting them via bluetooth low energy to a portable device.

This paper proposes a methodology for the online quantification of the CD amount. The method is based on the combination of an incremental learned classifier (Hyperplane Distance- Support Vector Machines (HD-SVM)) and a non-automatic clustering method (K-means technique). The incremental learned classifier is employed to examine and characterized the classes (i.e. noimal, fault-type 1, fault-type 2, etc.) of the measured online datasets. Then, the CD amount is tracked through the monitoring of the matching extent between the latent pattern of the online dataset (regarding each class) and the latent pattern extracted from a certain reference dataset (for the corresponding class). The results of the method application to a benchmark case study involving a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) indicate promising capabilities for tracking the CD amount along the operating time.

Since machinery faults are always caused by performance deterioration of components, learning the deteriorating mode from observed sensor data facilitates the prognostics of impeding faults and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL). In modern CPSs, several key performance indicators (KPIs) are monitored to detect the corresponding fine-grained deteriorating modes of industrial machines. However, the overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on these KPIs with various patterns have been a great challenge, especially without labels of deteriorating index or uninterpretable of root causes. In this paper, we proposed K-PdM, a cluster-based hidden Markov model for the machinery deterioration estimation and RUL prediction based on multiple KPIs. The method uncovers the fine-grained deteriorating modes of machines through each unlabeled KPI data and learns a mapping between each deteriorating KPI index and RULs. Accordingly, an overall deterioration estimation and RUL prediction of machine are able to be achieved based on the combination of each KPI's deterioration estimation. Moreover, a set of interpretable semantic rules are setup to analyze the root cause of performance deterioration among KPIs.

J	Sultan, K; Ali, H; Zhang, ZS				Sultan, Kashif; Ali, Hazrat; Zhang, Zhongshan			Call Detail Records Driven Anomaly Detection and Traffic Prediction in Mobile Cellular Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Anomaly; call data records; data analytics	BIG DATA; 5G	Mobile networks possess information about the users as well as the network. Such information is useful for making the network end-to-end visible and intelligent. Big data analytics can efficiently analyze user and network information, unearth meaningful insights with the help of machine learning tools. Utilizing big data analytics and machine learning, this paper contributes in three ways. First, we utilize the call detail records data to detect anomalies in the network. For authentication and verification of anomalies, we use k-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Through effective detection of anomalies, we can proceed to suitable design for resource distribution as well as fault detection and avoidance. Second, we prepare anomaly free data by removing anomalous activities and train a neural network model. By passing the anomaly and anomaly free data through this model, we observe the effect of anomalous activities in training of the model and also observe mean square error of the anomaly and anomaly free data. At last, we use an autoregressive integrated moving average model to predict future traffic for a user. Through simple visualization, we show that the anomaly free data better generalizes the learning models and performs better on prediction task.

With access to data logs and a model of the CPS, the physical effects of an attack could potentially be detected before any damage is done. Manually building a model that is accurate enough in practice, however, is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing models of CPS automatically, by applying supervised machine learning to data traces obtained after systematically seeding their software components with faults ("mutants"). We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on the simulator of a real-world water purification plant, presenting a framework that automatically generates mutants, collects data traces, and learns an SVM-based model. Using cross-validation and statistical model checking, we show that the learnt model characterises an invariant physical property of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of the invariant by subjecting the system to 55 network and code-modification attacks, and showing that it can detect 85% of them from the data logs generated at runtime.

It is centred around using clustering techniques to identify archetypes and eliminate redundant zones. An experiment was conducted in this paper using a detailed EnergyPlus model generated from building information modelling directly. A total number of four reduced models were generated and compared against the original model, random select models and an expert model. The reduced models estimated annual energy simulation and parametric simulation results within 5% error margin, while reducing the overall simulation time by 95%. The proposed method - which is aimed at large models where inter-zone heat transfer is not significant - can be used to approximate parametric simulations or optimizations with greatly reduced runtime.

LHD machines execute ore haulage from mining faces to dumping points in a cyclic way. Time-varying and harsh environmental conditions determine high workload, so effectiveness demands are big challenges for maintenance staff. One of the most important issue is related to engine overheating, what is the main cause of unjustifiable loader stoppages and unwanted disturbances in production. Operator is obligated to react quickly and switch machine to idle operation until it cools down. Existing on-board monitoring systems dedicated for LHD machines provide data necessary to perform diagnostics of the engine as well as its cooling system. Understanding how load, wear level of machine and ambient temperature influence diagnostic data is the key in development of fault detection algorithms. In this paper, authors propose to use longterm temperature data. The Anderson-Darling statistic is applied in order to detect segments of different statistical properties which are related to different technical condition. Analysis of obtained two-dimensional data structure allows to find points of change of technical condition of the machine. It could be considered as training for diagnostic system that could be used for machine monitoring.

Detection of the presence of bearing faults in rotating systems requires understanding of the transfer way between the defect and its manifestation in the measured signal. This step is mainly performed by the development of numerical models describing the couplings between the defects and the rest of the device. To the authors' knowledge, the majority of the models in the literature are lump parameter models, with no regard between the dynamic of the bearing and the rotational degree of freedom of the shaft. The influence that the dynamics of a faulted bearing has over the rotating shaft leading to IAS variations has been presented in a previous work. This influence has been introduced by means of a roller bearing model which dynamics, modified by the defect, introduces torque perturbations to the shaft. The aim of this paper is to couple the faulted bearing model to a multiple gear stage simplified wind turbine transmission. The model is built with a classic finite element approach and is suitable for the test of non-stationary simulations. First results show bearing faults are detectable in different locations of the geared system by the measurement of IAS. Even if experimental validation have not been yet performed, numerical results appear very promising to deepen the understanding of the IAS variation phenomena.

Fault Diagnostic of Machines Under Variable Speed Operating Conditions Using Order Tracking and Novelty Detection	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS, CMMNO 2016	Applied Condition Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	SEP 12-16, 2016	Gliwice, POLAND	Silesian Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Polish Soc Tech Diagnost		Non-stationary vibration signals; Order tracking; Novelty detection	TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS	Condition-Based Monitoring (CBM) of rotating machinery is becoming increasingly important because it allows improving the machine performance. Nevertheless, most of the real-world machinery operate unique pieces, which are not suitable for inducing faults, and thus making unfeasible to collect useful data from undamaged machine conditions. To this end, novelty detection (ND) had been developed, modeling the normal state to detect machine faults. Therefore, the extraction of a representative feature set must be carried out accurately to represent the target class under different machine states. However, there can be several operating conditions that reflect the dynamic behavior of the machinery, often resulting in non-stationary signals. To improve the stochastic description of non-stationary operating conditions, we propose a CBM methodology that relies on a set of the time-varying narrow-band features that are extracted from the order tracking approach, aiming to encode the time-varying behavior of the acquired vibration signals. With the goal of modeling the target machine condition, the key point here is conceiving the order components like dynamic features, and then, estimating several statistical and similarity parameters for those features to characterize each narrow-band component. Afterward, the multi-dimensional outlier detection problem is solved using both distance-and distribution-based data description classifiers. The ND scheme is tested on test-rig databases holding different types of machine faults when the machine operates under variable speed. As a result, the proposed methodology improves the classification rates compared with the state-of-the-art features and allows characterizing the machine state under its actual operating conditions.

Bearing Fault Identification Based on Blind Extraction of Cyclostationary Signals Using Order Tracking	ADVANCES IN CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINERY IN NON-STATIONARY OPERATIONS, CMMNO 2016	Applied Condition Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Condition Monitoring of Machinery in Non-Stationary Operations (CMMNO)	SEP 12-16, 2016	Gliwice, POLAND	Silesian Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Polish Soc Tech Diagnost		Cyclostationary vibration signals; Order tracking; Blind signal extraction	LOCAL DAMAGE DETECTION; DIAGNOSTICS	Mostly, a vibration signal from rotating machines comprises stationary and non-stationary components, whose description should be as accurate as possible to infer the internal and external forces that affect the system behavior. Moreover, either component can provide diverse but relevant information about the machine health. Thus, bearing faults foster the non-stationary component that is characterized by time-varying statistical moments, periodically changing through the time (or cyclostationary signals). Therefore, the problem to detect a bearing fault signal is usually addressed to separate the deterministic and the stochastic components of the vibration signal to make clear the damage characteristics. To this end, we present the novel order tracking (OT) method that decomposes the non-stationary vibration signal into narrow-band spectral components, aiming to enhance the cyclostationary characteristics. Moreover, a similarity measure is computed between the envelopes of the raw signal and each component, allowing to quantify the cyclic behavior of signal components. Since the proposed method acts as a narrow-band filter, a comparison with the spectral kurtosis (SK) is performed using a rolling element bearing dataset that includes an inner race, outer race, and rolling element defects. Specifically, the Case Western Reserve University data is carried out aiming to improve the diagnosis of bearing failures that are categorized in a recent work using the benchmark methods. As a result, the proposed blind extraction method allows capturing the cyclostationary behavior hidden in the signal and improves the identification of the bearing faults when the signal is noisy.

Due to the need of reduction of production costs, machine downtime must be held at the lowest possible limits. This forces maintenance services to predict possible failures and plan repairs in advance. Rolling bearing faults are among the major reasons for breakdown of industrial machinery and bearing diagnosing is one of the most important topics in machine condition monitoring. Vibration signals offer great opportunity to provide reliable information about machine condition. However, in complex industrial environments the vibration signal of the rolling bearing may be covered or concealed by other vibration sources, such as gears. In case of masking the informative bearing signal by machine noise, extraction of useful diagnostic information from vibration signals becomes very difficult. The following paper presents two rolling bearing diagnosing approaches enabling early detection of rolling bearing faults at the low-energy stage of their development. By using empirical signal decomposition methods a raw vibration signal is divided into two parts: an informative bearing signal and a signal emitted from other machinery elements. For further bearing fault-related feature extraction from the informative bearing signal, the spectral analysis of the empirically determined local amplitude is applied. To test the operational effectiveness of the developed signal decomposition methods, raw vibration signals generated by complex mechanical systems employed in the industry are used. The test results show that the developed methods allow early identification of bearing fault in case of masking the informative bearing signal by signals derived from other sources.

The paper presents energetic characteristics of vibration signals as a promising new approach in condition monitoring of rolling bearings. The presented approach is based on application of the differential Teager-Kaiser energy operator. The operator makes possible to the detection of short-time disturbances in the signal which are caused by developing faults. Authors assumed that the energetic characteristics and measures would be good tool for detection of faults and defects in rolling bearings, especially when vibration signals are non-stationary in the amplitude and/ or the frequency sense. The paper presents the energetic characteristics of the bearing vibration signal in the form of the time history, the energetic trajectories and measures parameterizing them. The obtained results give ability to determine the basic features of characteristics and measures,. The presentation of qualitative changes in the form of characteristics caused by different kinds of faults of rolling bearings was one of the main aims of the research. From practical point of view the assessment of the sensitivity of the above-mentioned energetic measures on changes in technical condition of bearings was also crucial. The presented results have been obtained by testing the set of tapered roller bearings of the same type and size. New bearings, defective ones and bearings with artificially introduced faults were tested.

It is therefore necessary to explore spectral measures of higher order, like the bispectral measures, to detect various forms of phase coupling between frequency components. In the paper was analyzed the impact of nonlinearity of the sub-section on the behaviour of the whole system by using of bispectral measures: diagonal bispectrum, maximum bispectrum and residual bispectrum. The results pointed to high sensitivity of bispectral measures to changes of the signal's frequency structure and to the possibility of using these relations while constructing models of development of degradation-and-fatigue-related processes. In the paper was build effective and sensitive diagnostic measure of quality changes of fatigue crack growth at low-amplitude fatigue testing, fatigue process of toothed wheel damage or electric motors bearings faults. To do this, It was create a new measure (nobody else didn't that way) which is able to extract the relevant diagnostic information. Integral of bispectral noise from bispectral maximum diagrams and integral of bispectral noise from bispectral residual diagrams were calculated with maximum given level (everything higher than maximum level was equalized to this maximum level) for every measurements.

In this paper, an intelligent method is introduced in order to enhance the classification and achieves a higher precision for the diagnosis of degradation of rolling bearings operating under condition variations. The method uses the coefficients of autoregressive modeling (AR) of the bearing vibration signal as the features of a classifier. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) of the matrix feature obtained from AR analysis is applied in order to extract the components that discriminate the different fault modes since it is insensitive to the working conditions. Finally, the results obtained from LDA are used as the input of a support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to automatically identify the bearing state. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is effective and achieve a good accuracy.

In particular, the activity focuses on the cutting process that divides a continuous flow of packaging paper into single packages. The cutting process is made by a steel knife driven by a hydraulic system. Actually the knives are frequently substituted, causing frequent stops of the machine and consequent lost production costs. The aim of this paper is developing a diagnostic procedure to assess the wear condition of the blades, reducing the stops for maintenance. The packaging machine was sensorized with pressure sensor that monitors the hydraulic system driving the blade. Processing of the pressure data comprises three main steps: the selection of scalar quantities that could be indicative of the health state of the knife. A clustering analysis to setup a threshold between healthy and faulted knives. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify the health state of knife during its lifetime.

The authors characterize consequences of wear margin loss of the compressor, present design solutions of hydrogen piston compressor and divide its construction into functional units. The compressor fault analysis is based on post-repair documentation of compressors maintained according to their service life, and making use of technical diagnostics applied to 21 compressors, covering the last 20 years. The analysis distinguishes the loss of compressor wear margin due to loss of functional unit wear margin and due to damage to a compressor component. Faults typical of hydrogen compressor elements have been described. Besides, the authors estimate fault risks for selected elements and risks of wear margin loss of selected functional units. Statistical data are given in tables and bar charts. The analysis outcome indicates the need to implement methods and tools for diagnosing the cylinder unit, comprising several functional units.

Given the specific behavior of signals coming from the faulty component, it is reasonable to provide methods allowing for distinction between healthy and damaged components. The proposed approach is based on the measurement of the distance between empirical distribution and Gaussian one in terms of comparing statistical properties and power law tail index behavior. The choice of the mentioned statistics is motivated by their properties when applied to the impulsive signals. The introduced methodology is illustrated by analysis of the real vibration signals acquired from healthy and faulty drive pulley bearing of the belt conveyor. The results provide a way to easily select an informative frequency band and distinguish between healthy and faulty component.

The mill diagnostic can be carried out with vibration measurements, machine vision or infrared imaging. Milling process is an extremely energy-and cost-consuming process, thus diagnostics process should be performed with high efficiency. Method proposed in this paper is based on the online examination of the final product during the milling process using real-time digital images. Determination of the total number of the grain, size of each grain, also classification of the grains is main goal of proposed method. In the proposed method, the visible camera with lightning mounted at two assumed angles has been used, what increases the grain detection process. Proposed method uses an adaptive segmentation to match correctly the grains, the information about particles shape and context is used to optimize the grain classification process in the next step. Finally, during image processing, the simple rule-based method is used to obtain information about overall quality of the product and possible faults in the milling process based on the evaluated parameters.

Point device failure can significantly affect railway operations, with potentially disastrous consequences. Therefore, early detection of anomalies is critical for monitoring and managing the condition of rail infrastructure. The article presents a concept of a simple fault detection system dedicated to health monitoring of point machines in a remote and automatic way. A fundamental element of the system is a fault detection module, which operates on the basis of residual signal calculated on the basis of output of object models. Autoregressive (ARX) and neural (ANN) models were identified using real data collected during 1 year at the turnout localized in Poland. Obtained results show that simple analytical ARX model is a sufficient solution for efficient fault detection of the investigated point machine and can be easily applied in the proposed condition monitoring system.

The context-based reasoning is developed to increase the effectiveness of well-known classification methods due to the need for designing high-efficient fault diagnosis systems. The most important problem to solve in this approach is to find optimal structures as well as optimal values of behavioural parameters of component classifiers. This problem has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization task, and in the next step, the global criterion method was adapted for expressing the meta-criterion function taking into account different statistical measures (objectives) obtained from a table of confusion. It was decided to make use of the generational genetic algorithm in order to search for the optimal solution. The subject of the case study was the scraper conveyor simulator. A few variants of the meta-learning scheme for context-based fault detection were elaborated using common machine learning methods such as decision tree, naive Bayes, Bayesian network and k-nearest neighbours. The obtained results prove that the proposed approach has both theoretical and practical relevance and thus it should find potential applications in real-world conditions.

The biggest challenge in the remaining useful life (RUL) estimation are features that exhibit monotonic behaviour correlated with the level of deterioration of the machine's condition. This is particularly challenging under variable operating conditions. The proposed RUL estimation approach is based on characterising the energy distribution of vibration signals. The features hereupon quantify the departure from the initial healthy state by calculating the f-divergence measures. Then the divergence measure is modelled as the output of a hidden Markov process in state space. In the general case, the states of the nonlinear model are estimated by means of unscented Kalman filter. Future evolution of the states and the outputs can be evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. Hereupon, one can evaluate the distribution of times at which the calculated output hits the limit value marking the end of operability. The approach was applied to the problem of monitoring the turbine of a milling machine.

Presented schemes were based on various machine learning algorithms using single classifiers and different types of ensemble-classification methods. Besides the well-known methods of ensemble-classification, the author also implemented and used context-based meta-learning method. Presented schemes were tested using artificial datasets generated by the benchmark of a longwall scraper conveyor. Model allows for testing various scenarios of operation modes of the conveyor, including the possibility of modelling operational faults. Signals generated by model were connected with velocity sensor of the conveyor and current sensors of motors. Collected data was divided into smaller parts dependent on the values of discrete contextual feature. The contextual feature cannot be used directly by a classifier, but can be useful when it is combined with other features. It does not have direct information about operational faults of the device. Speaker's sex, nationality and age are examples of contextual features for speech recognition problem. Operational states of the conveyor and a longwall shearer was used to determine contextual feature for case study described in the article. In the next step each part of data was used to calculate single value of the feature like average value, median, skewness, etc. New dataset containing only features of measured signals was used during training and verification process of classifiers using a cross-validation method. The author compared results of reasoning processes based on the proposed schemes and basic types of the classifiers. The achieved results confirm the effectiveness of the new proposed approach based on context and also show its limitations.

Due to the difference in the topography between the traditional DC filed excitation system and the three-phase exciter, the existing method for rotating rectifier fault detection of DC filed excitation system is not effective in WSSG. To solve this problem, this study points out that the ratio of the second to fourth harmonic's amplitude and the fundamental amplitude can be used as the signature after having analysed harmonic components of the exciter rotor current which is estimated by stator flux under the healthy and fault condition. The novel method puts forward that the ratio's Euclidean distance can determine whether the rotating rectifier is faulty or not, and discriminate which phase becomes a fault. By comparing the sum of the maximum and minimum faulty phase current within one cycle with a set threshold value, the location of failure diode is confirmed. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In such applications, system reliability is a crucial feature. Therefore, here, a new fault-tolerant control strategy with real-time fault diagnosis for power transistor faults in SRM drives is proposed. The developed fault-tolerant topology is composed of four additional power switches and a relay network based on the conventional asymmetric converter. Moreover, an online fault diagnostic algorithm based on high-frequency (HF) signal injection is proposed. In contrast to the existing strategies that use additional sensors, this diagnostic algorithm extracts the fault signatures from the fundamental current by injecting an HF voltage signal into the upper switches of the asymmetric converter. Open- and short-circuit faults of the power switches are analysed by monitoring the variation in frequency and amplitude of the resulting HF current along with the amplitude variation in fundamental current with the occurrence of fault. Simulations performed on a three-phase 12/8 SRM drive and results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

With this approach, the IPMSM's operation effectively alternates between the three-phase mode and the two-phase mode. Thus, the electric power is evenly distributed between three-phase windings as much as possible, and the remaining healthy power devices are all utilised. The post-fault drive performance is analysed. A simulation model has been built to verify the proposed principle. Finally, the approach has been implemented on an IPMSM test rig. Both the simulation and experimental results confirm the feasibility of the method.

When the inter-turn short-circuit fault occurs in phase windings of the generator, a large short-circuit current would be introduced inside the armature windings, which could cause severe damages to the system for overheat in the windings and irons as well as huge electromagnetic forces on the end coils. To improve the reliability of the MEA, this study researches on the inter-turn fault of the multiphase generator-rectifier system, including the theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental verification. A 12-phase system is taken for example, and a multi-loop mathematical model is built up to calculate all voltages and currents in the multiphase synchronous generator-rectifier system with armature inter-turn fault. Many factors are thoroughly considered in the model, including the location and short-turns of fault, space harmonics of air-gap magnetic field and the changing circuit topology of the system. The mathematical model is verified by fault experiment results. Moreover, the electric characteristics of the fault are summarised, which could provide a quantitative basis for early detection of the inter-turn faults in the multiphase generator-rectifier system.

Among various diagnosis methods, data-driven approaches are gaining popularity with the widespread development of data analysis techniques. In this research, an effective deep learning method known as stacked autoencoders (SAEs) is proposed to solve gearbox fault diagnosis. The proposed method can directly extract salient features from frequency-domain signals and eliminate the exhausted use of handcrafted features. Furthermore, to reduce the overfitting problem in training process and improve the performance for small training set, dropout technique and ReLU activation function arc introduced into SAEs. Two gearbox datasets are employed to conform the effectiveness of the proposed method; the result indicates that the proposed method can not only achieve significant improvement but also is superior to the raw SAEs and some other traditional methods.

J	Cheng, CS; Shueng, PW; Chang, CC; Kuo, CW				Cheng, Chien-Sheng; Shueng, Pei-Wei; Chang, Chi-Chang; Kuo, Chi-Wen			Adapting an Evidence-based Diagnostic Model for Predicting Recurrence Risk Factors of Oral Cancer	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Medical and Health Informatics (ICMHI)	MAY 20-22, 2017	Chung Shan Med Univ, Taichung, TAIWAN		Chung Shan Med Univ	Oral Cancer; Recurrence; Machine Learning Techniques; Diagnostic Model	LEARNING ALGORITHMS; RESECTION; DISEASE	Although the relationship between prognosis and oral cancer has been extensively investigated, its impact on recurrence and surgical margin has not been well studied. Clinical evaluation of a positive surgical margin in recurrent oral cancer is often challenging. The aim of this study was to propose an evidence-based diagnostic model using machine learning techniques for the prediction of risk factors of recurrent oral cancer. In addition, the performance of each technique was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Fallout, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). An oral cancer dataset was provided by cancer registries of three hospitals in Taiwan. Of the 1,428 patients included in the current study, each patient in the dataset had 20 predictor variables. The results indicated that the KSTAR technique showed the best performance compared with other techniques. The GainRaito (RT) method was used in the screening to exclude five insignificant variables. The KSTAR technique also showed larger values for accuracy (77.04%), recall (77.98%), specificity (75.48%), Fallout (36.62%), F1 score (81.17%), and MCC (50.54%). Furthermore, the important risk factors for predicting recurrence in relation to the surgical margin in oral cancer were pathologic stage, behavior code, and lifestyle factors (smoking and betel nut chewing). Application of this proposed diagnostic model may facilitate targeted intervention to reduce the incidence of recurrence; however, our results suggest that adaptive machine learning techniques require incorporation of significant variables for optimal prediction.

Their failure may result in a system crash, so its health condition and reliability are related to the safety of an engineering system. In order to explore the basis of condition-based maintenance or replacement of SVs, it is necessary to develop a prognostic approach to predict its operation condition and remaining useful life (RUL). In this paper, a particle filter (PF) technique, an online tracking method, is proposed to make prognostics for SV. Moreover, the Brownian motion degradation model is proposed, and the distortion of dynamic driven current curve is assumed as the indicator of degradation state. To validate the proposed PF-based prognostics method, a degradation experiment is designed. The result shows that the predicted degradation state accurately reflects the real time filtered degradation state of SV and a good RUL prediction can be calculated by this method.

With new algorithms and methodologies growing across different learning methods, it has remained a challenge for industries to adopt which method is fit, robust and provide most accurate detection. Fault detection is one of the critical components of predictive maintenance; it is very much needed for industries to detect faults early and accurately. In a production environment, to minimize the cost of maintenance, sometimes it is required to build a model with minimal or no historical data. In such cases, unsupervised learning would be a better option model building. In this paper, we have chosen a simple vibration data collected from an exhaust fan, and have fit different unsupervised learning algorithms such as PCA T-2 statistic, Hierarchical clustering, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means clustering and model-based clustering to test its accuracy, performance, and robustness. In the end, we have proposed a methodology to benchmark different algorithms and choosing the final model.

These techniques have largely improved the efficiency of industrial production and increased the level of production autonomy. However, demands on advance hardware design and image processing algorithms are needed for the quality inspection of a large-complex-surface. In order to solve this problem, a hybrid surface defect detection method is developed. An image of the product surface is first divided into two areas: background with similar features and special pattern area, such as product trademarks. For the background area, defects have significant differences in gray intensity from the normal area. Fault detection is conducted using a gradient threshold segmentation method that can limit segmentation errors arising from uneven illuminations. For the special pattern area, image registration and image difference are adopted to detect defects, which are adaptive to irregular image contents with discontinuous shapes and appearances. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves about 1.21 times and 2.94 times higher accuracy, in F-measure, for large-complex-surface defect detection than the traditional methods of gradient threshold segmentation and template matching, respectively. The proposed image processing technique can be applied in product quality inspections.

To deal with the problem, a novel fault diagnosis approach for rotating machinery is presented by combining improved local mean decomposition (LMD) with support vector machine-recursive feature elimination with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (SVM-RFE-MRMR). Firstly, an improved LMD method is developed to decompose vibration signals into a subset of amplitude modulation/frequency modulation (AM-FM) product functions (PFs). Then, time and frequency domain features are extracted from the selected PFs, and the complicated faults can be thus identified efficiently. Due to degradation of fault diagnosis methods resulting from redundant features, a novel feature selection method combining SVM-RFE with MRMR is proposed to select salient features, improving the performance of fault diagnosis approach. Experimental results on reducer platform demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of revealing the relations between the features and faults and providing insights into fault mechanism.

Unconventional behavior or fault modes of structures, devices, and various components can be detected by mapping of temperature distribution in heated or cooled structures. It is possible to monitor disorders and inhomogenities, with respect to the resolution of the diagnostic device, at both microscopic and macroscopic level. The infrared (IR) thermography is a powerful tool for monitoring imperfections and damages of various types of electrical machines, devices and components of power systems (e.g. corroded electrical connections with high transient resistance, broken parts, etc.). Vast majority of damages in machinery and electrical components are accompanied by abnormal temperature distribution. The advantage of the IR thermography (IRTG) method lies in the non-contact real time measurement during the operation of the device. Over the past three decades enormously increasing number of applications of infrared thermography can be observed in such fields as construction industry (building monitoring, building energy efficiency), engineering industry (corrosion monitoring, welding damage, material deformation) and power engineering (diagnostics of machines, equipment, electrical installations, photovoltaics). The IR thermography methodology has found its place in nuclear technology, space research, food, paper and wood processing industry, too. Experimental data obtained from practical IRTG measurements on the DC traction system of the Slovak railway network are presented and analyzed in this paperwork.

Predictability property is defined with respect to a subset of discrete states, called critical set, representing for example faulty states or, more generally, any subset of states which is of particular interest from the system's behavior point of view. We define and characterize eventual and critical predictability properties by means of a set-membership-based formalism. Using the proposed framework, it is possible to check predictability properties with polynomial time algorithms.

J	Deng, W; Zhang, SJ; Zhao, HM; Yang, XH				Deng, Wu; Zhang, Shengjie; Zhao, Huimin; Yang, Xinhua			A Novel Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Integrating Empirical Wavelet Transform and Fuzzy Entropy for Motor Bearing	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Motor bearing; fault diagnosis; empirical wavelet transform; fuzzy entropy; support vector machine; Fourier spectrum segmentation; AM-FM components	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARING; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MODE DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM; ENVELOPE; SPECTRUM; MACHINE; SYSTEM	Motor bearing is subjected to the joint effects of much more loads, transmissions, and shocks that cause bearing fault and machinery breakdown. A vibration signal analysis method is the most popular technique that is used to monitor and diagnose the fault of motor bearing. However, the application of the vibration signal analysis method for motor bearing is very limited in engineering practice. In this paper, on the basis of comparing fault feature extraction by using empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and Hilbert transform with the theoretical calculation, a new motor bearing fault diagnosis method based on integrating EWT, fuzzy entropy, and support vector machine (SVM) called EWTFSFD is proposed. In the proposed method, a novel signal processing method called EWT is used to decompose vibration signal into multiple components in order to extract a series of amplitude modulated-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components with supporting Fourier spectrum under an orthogonal basis. Then, fuzzy entropy is utilized to measure the complexity of vibration signal, reflect the complexity changes of intrinsic oscillation, and compute the fuzzy entropy values of AM-FM components, which are regarded as the inputs of the SVM model to train and construct an SVM classifier for fulfilling fault pattern recognition. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by using the simulated signal and real motor bearing vibration signals. The experiment results show that the EWT outperforms empirical mode decomposition for decomposing the signal into multiple components, and the proposed EWTFSFD method can accurately and effectively achieve the fault diagnosis of motor bearing.

In the case of machining systems, timely fault diagnosis avoids products out of specification and/or extreme machines damage. Optimum machining depends of several parameters, including the spindle performance, within which the bearings system represents the mechanical component with the greatest likelihood of failure. From an exhaustive bibliographic review, the advances in the use of the Wavelet Transform (WT) for the analysis of mechanical vibrations of spindle bearings are presented. A fault detection method is proposed, which automatically detects the frequency range where most information of the faults are located and separates them from other frequencies associated with noise. Early results validated with experimental data are promising. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the extraction of malfunction features is not accurate enough by using traditional vibration signal processing techniques, owing to their intrinsic shortcomings. In this paper, the relationship between effective eigenvalues and frequency components was investigated, and a new characteristic frequency separation method based on PCA (CFSM-PCA) was proposed. Certain feature frequency could be purified by reconstructing the specified eigenvalues. Furthermore, three significant perspectives were studied via the distribution of effective eigenvalues, and theoretical derivations were subsequently illustrated. More importantly, this proposed scheme could also be used to synthesize axis orbits of larger machines. Purified curves were so explicit and the CFSM-PCA exhibited higher efficiency than harmonic wavelet and wavelet packet.

Without a systematic way to ensure reliable operation however, a very conservative operational strategy is often chosen, which can lead to sub-optimal operation and the loss of large potential profits. We propose to integrate condition monitoring and prognostics into the production planning problem to reduce conservativeness by actively steering plant degradation and preventing violation of health-critical constraints. We achieve this by combining equipment degradation models with regular process models and solving a shrinking horizon real-time optimization problem until the next planned maintenance horizon. A network of oil and gas producing wells with artificial gas lift, subject to particle induced choke erosion is used as a case example.

Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in. There are however some challenges in keeping up with the ever-increasing pace of the development. For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system. Some of the concepts that are presented in this paper have yet to be implemented during 2018. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Frequency-based features are extracted by fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The changes in frequency spectral data and amplitude are used to separate the normal condition from the fault conditions. These features indicate that the characteristic frequencies are 1 x f, 2 x f, 3 x f, and two other frequency bands, < 0.4 x f and > 3 x f, where the frequency f is the rotor frequency. The power spectral data shows the mechanical vibration fault at particular characteristic frequencies. Then, radial-based color relation analysis (CRA) is applied to identify mechanical faults, including normal condition, oil-membrane oscillation, imbalance, and no orderliness. Using practical records, the experimental results will show that the proposed method has a higher accuracy in mechanical vibration fault detection.

Ensuring early, effective, and accurate detection of fan malfunctions first requires confirming the characteristics of anomalies resulting from initial damage to rotating machinery. In addition, sensing and detection must rely on the use of sensors and sensing characteristics appropriate to various operational abnormalities. This research proposes an online industrial fan monitoring and fault detection technique based on acoustic signals as a physical sensing index. The proposed system detects and assesses anomalies resulting from preliminary damage to rotating machinery, along with improved sensing resolution bandwidth features for microphone sensors as compared to accelerometer sensors. The resulting Intelligent Prediction Integration System with Internet (IPII) is built to analyze rotation performance and predict malfunctions in industrial fans. The system uses an NI cRIO-9065 embedded controller and a real-time signal sensing module. The kernel algorithm is based on an acoustic signal enhancement filter (ASEF) as well as an adaptive Kalman filter (AKF). The proposed scheme uses acoustic signals with adaptive order-tracking technology to perform algorithm analysis and anomaly detection. Experimental results showed that the acoustic signal and adaptive order analysis method could effectively perform real-time early fault detection and prediction in industrial fans.

'his paper develops an improved remaining useful life (RUL) prediction method for bearings based on a nonlinear Wiener process model. First, the service life of bearings is divided into two stages in terms of the working condition. Then a new prognostic model is constructed to reflect the relationship between time and bearing health status. Besides, a variety of factors that cause uncertainties toward the degradation path are considered and appropriately managed to obtain reliable RUL prediction results. The particle filtering is utilized to estimate the degradation state, qualify the uncertainties, and predict the RUL. The experimental studies show that the proposed method has a better performance in RUL prediction and uncertainty management than the exponential model and the linear model.

J	Wei, JL; Gao, XW				Wei, Jingliang; Gao, Xianwen			Electric-Parameter-Based Inversion of Dynamometer Card Using Hybrid Modeling for Beam Pumping System	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; SIMULATION	Conventional fault diagnosis and production calculation of an oil well can be conducted with the surface dynamometer cards, which are obtained by load sensor installed on the horse head. This method to measure the dynamometer cards is limited by the sensor maintenance and calibration, battery replacement, and safety hazards for staff. As the basic parameter of the oil extraction industry, electric parameters have the advantages of low cost and high efficiency. So the inversions of dynamometer card with electric parameters are attracting more and more attention. In order to solve the problem of insufficient data and consider the real-time performance in the actual oil extraction process, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model which consists of two parts: the mechanism model of polished rod load and the suspension displacement calculated with the space vector equations of motor and a data-dependent kernel online sequential extreme learning machine (DDKOS-ELM) model proposed to correct the output error of the mechanism model, which improves the kernel function selection and makes it real-time. Thus, the highlights of this paper can be summed up in two points: (1) under the circumstance of the bottom dead point detection without sensors, the mechanism modeling of the polished rod load and suspension displacement has been carried out from the perspective of mathematical model of AC motor; (2) a novel data-driven model based on data-dependent kernel online sequential extreme learning machine (DDKO-SELM) has been proposed to improve the kernel functions selection. The coefficients in the data-dependent kernel function are optimized with improved free search algorithm (IFSA). The proposed hybrid model has been applied to a normal working oil well and the prediction results show better accuracy than the pure data-driven model and mechanism model.

Tumor histopathology and computed tomography (CT) features have been used as prognostic factors, but they still present challenges. This work addressess the problem of lung cancer pattern recognition in terms of histopathology and nodal and distant metastasis, using radiomic CT image features and machine learning classifiers. We retrospectively analyzed 52 tumors and semiautomaticaly segmented the CT images. Tumors were characterized by clinical factors and quantitative image attributes of gray level, histogram, texture, shape, and volume. Three classifiers used relevant selected features to perform the analysis. An artificial neural network presented stabled performances on pattern recognition, obtaining areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 for histopathology, 0.88 for nodal metastasis, and 0.98 for distant metastasis. The radiomic pattern recognition presented high performance and great potential to aid the lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

Three-phase controlled rectifier and inverter are the most important analog circuit in power electronics. These circuits have also gained immense importance in modern grid-connected system synchronized with renewable energy sources. In this context, it requires maximum attention for smooth operation of these devices at minimum recovery time during faulty condition. And hence detection of faulty component during running condition becomes extremely important. Considering these particulars, this paper presents a proficient defect-oriented parametric test method for two power electronic circuits like three-phase rectifier and inverter based on artificial neural network using discrete wavelet decomposition as preprocessor for feature extraction. Two types of feed forward neural network such as BPMLP and PNN are employed here for fault event detection. Results are found to be very promising with utmost of 99.95%.

Consequently, these systems are susceptible to a number of faults such as bearing failures, shaft misalignments, or gear tooth deterioration. Due to the continual operative nature of many APM systems, downtimes due to faults or superfluous maintenance can result in significant economic losses. Recently, preventative maintenance strategies have become an attractive alternative to traditional run-to-failure or scheduled maintenance strategies. Condition-based maintenance is a preventative maintenance strategy that works by detecting incipient faults within the critical components of a system through the identification of anomalies within condition indicators extracted from their vibration signatures. A fault is detected when a condition indicator exceeds a prescribed failure threshold. Traditionally, these failure thresholds are based on historical precedents or failure data obtained from similar specimens. However, due to their longevity and bespoke construction, many APMs lack the historical failure data required to define these failure thresholds in the traditional way. In this paper, an automated CBM framework developed specifically for a cable-driven APM gearbox is presented. The framework utilizes a state-based Gaussian mixture modeling approach to account for variations in operating conditions resulting from frequent start and stop phases, variations in passenger load, and fluctuations in cable tension, among other variables. Failure threshold setting is accomplished using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, which utilizes past and present data to set thresholds that adapt to changing health state of the machine over its lifespan. In addition to real-time monitoring, the proposed framework utilizes the collected data to model the degradation of the system in order to generate an estimate of its remaining useful life. The combination of short-term preventative maintenance (real-time fault detection) and long-term predictive maintenance coupled with automation, makes the presented approach a highly efficient tool for maintenance planning.

The proposed approach is based on the principles of hyperdimensional computing. In particular, the recently proposed method called Holographic Graph Neuron is used. We present a distributed version of Holographic Graph Neuron and evaluate its performance on the problem of fault isolation in a complex power plant model. Compared to conventional machine learning methods applied in the context of the same scenario the proposed approach shows comparable performance while being distributed and requiring simple binary operations, which allow for a fast and efficient implementation in hardware.

J	Chen, JY; Zhou, D; Wang, Y; Fu, HY; Wang, MF				Chen, Jiayu; Zhou, Dong; Wang, Yang; Fu, Hongyong; Wang, Mingfang			Image feature extraction based on HOG and its application to fault diagnosis for rotating machinery	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rotating machinery; bi-spectrum; histogram of oriented gradient (HOG); image processing; fault diagnosis	EMD ENERGY ENTROPY; BISPECTRUM ESTIMATION; DECOMPOSITION; SIGNAL	Rotating machinery is one of the most typical types of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in industrial applications. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has gained wide attention for its significance in preventing catastrophic accidents and guaranteeing sufficient maintenance. This paper presents a method based on image processing for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Different from traditional methods of signal analysis in the one-dimensional space, this study employs computing methods in the field of image processing to realize automatic feature extraction and fault diagnosis in a two-dimensional space. The proposed method mainly includes the following steps. First, the vibration signal is transformed into a bi-spectrum contour map utilizing bi-spectrum technology, which provides a basis for the following image-based feature extraction. Then, an emerging approach in the field of image processing for feature extraction, histogram of oriented gradient (HOG), is employed to automatically exact fault features from the transformed bi-spectrum contour map and finally form the feature vector. In the case study, two typical rotating machineries, gearbox and self-priming centrifugal pumps, are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method achieves a high accuracy, thus providing a highly effective means to fault diagnosis for rotating machinery.

The new manifold learning framework contains two stages: unsupervised manifold learning for nonlinear denoising and supervised manifold learning for feature extraction. Firstly, the nonlinear denoising method with unsupervised manifold learning was introduced, which combined advantages of manifold learning in revealing nonlinear manifold structure as well as advantages of phase space reconstruction in representing spatial distribution of signal and noise. Then, fault feature extraction was carried out according to the frequency spectrum of vibration signals after denoising. In order to reduce the high dimension and remove redundant information of frequency spectrum, an improved supervised local tangent space alignment (ISLTSA) was proposed to further enlarge diversity of the fault samples and thus increase separability. Finally, the extracted low-dimensional fault features were inputted into a pattern recognition method for fault identification. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by studying the fault diagnosis of bearings.

Bearing failures will accelerate failures of other adjacent components and finally result in the breakdown of systems. To prevent any unexpected accidents and reduce economic loss, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings should be immediately conducted. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) as an improvement on empirical mode decomposition is a data-driven algorithm to adaptively decompose vibration signals collected from the casing of machinery for bearing fault feature extraction without the requirement of expertise and thus its easy usage attracts much attention in recent years from readers and engineers. The direct applications of EEMD to preprocessing bearing fault signals for intelligent bearing fault diagnosis can be found in lots of publications and conferences every year. However, such applications are not always effective in extracting bearing fault features because the Fourier spectrum of the first intrinsic mode function is too wide and contains many unwanted strong low-frequency periodic components. In this paper, according to results from the analyses of industrial railway axle bearing fault signals, we experimentally show that the direct use of EEMD is not always effective in extracting bearing fault features. Further, to make EEMD more effective, we introduce the concept of blind fault component separation to separate low-frequency periodic vibration components from high-frequency random repetitive transients, such as bearing fault signals. Results show that the idea of blind fault component separation is much helpful in enhancing the effectiveness of EEMD in extracting bearing fault features in the case of industrial railway axle bearing fault diagnosis.

The proposed method has been successfully applied to the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. In the proposed method, the frequency domain information of vibration signal is used as input signal, and the deep neural network is obtained by layer-by-layer feature extraction from denoising autoencoder (DAE). Then the dropout method is used to adjust the network parameters, and reduces the over-fitting phenomenon. In additional, the principal component analysis is used to extract fault features. The experiment result shows that the proposed method is very effective, and can effectively extract the hidden features in the vibration signal of rotating machinery.

From an extensive set of available features, some of them are more adequate than other ones, to classify properly certain fault modes. The classic approach for feature selection aims at ranking the set of original features; nevertheless, in feature selection, it has been recognized that a set of best individually features does not necessarily lead to good classification. This paper proposes a framework for feature engineering to identify the set of features which can yield proper clusters of data. First, the framework uses ANOVA combined with Tukey's test for ranking the significant features individually; next, a further analysis based on inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances is accomplished to rank subsets of significant features previously identified. Our contribution aims at discovering the subset of features that discriminates better the clusters of data associated to several faulty conditions of the mechanical devices, to build more robust multi-fault classifiers. Fault severity classification in rolling bearings is studied to verify the proposed framework, with data collected from a test bed under real conditions of speed and load on the rotating device.

There-fore, early diagnoses are sought to avoid unplanned shutdowns, catastrophic damage to the machine or human losses; additionally, an appropriate diagnosis contributes to increase productivity and reduce maintenance costs. This paper addresses a methodological framework for the diagnosis of multi-faults in rotating machinery through the use of features rankings. The classification uses K nearest neighbors and random forest, based on the information that comes from the measured vibration signal. Thirty features in time domain are calculated from the vibration signal, twenty-four features commonly used in fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, and six features are used from the field of electromyography. Feature ranking methods such as ReliefF algorithm, Chi-Square, and Information Gain are used to select the ten most relevant features, the same ones that enter the classifiers. Five databases were used to validate the proposed methodological framework. The results show good accuracy in classification for the five databases; furthermore, in all the databases in the first ten features ranked by the three rankings methods are present at least two nonconventional features.

To acquire this fault information, many diagnostic methods have been reported in the past decades. Among them, the envelope spectrum analysis is usually used as the final diagnostic tool; however, its success highly depends on the correct informative frequency band selection. The key problem is how to find the correct centre frequency and its related bandwidth associated to the fault. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for selection of the optimal frequency band parameters. This method improves the informative frequency band selection performance with two aspects. One is that it incorporates the normal data as a health reference, and the other is that an objective indicator that could fuse multidimensional information is proposed. An optimal frequency band can be obtained through this algorithm, and fault mode is then determined via comparing the squared envelope spectrum between the test and normal signals. At the end of this paper, the proposed method is validated on two diagnosis cases and is compared with two of the other diagnostic methods: the conventional envelope analysis and the kurtogram. Though comparison of the results, the validity and superiority of the proposed method have been proven.

In this paper, a new method called feature fusion deep belief network is proposed for the intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. Firstly, a deep belief network (DBN) is constructed with several pre-trained restricted Boltzmann machines for feature learning of the raw vibration data. Secondly, locality preserving projection (LPP) is adopted to fuse the deep features to further enhance the quality of the learned deep features. Finally, the fusion deep features are fed into Softmax for automatic and accurate fault diagnosis. The proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental rolling bearing signals, and the results show that the proposed method is more effective than the traditional intelligent diagnosis methods.

J	Li, XJ; Ren, YM; Tan, XY				Li, Xuejiao; Ren, Yongmei; Tan, Xiaoyong			Fuzzy feature fusion and multimodal degradation prognosis for mechanical components	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Degradation prognosis; fuzzy fusion; degradation index; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; extreme learning machine	FAULT; ROBUST; MODEL	Reliable degradation prognosis of mechanical components is very important for condition-based maintenance to improve the reliability and reduce the cost of maintenance. This paper reports the development of a fuzzy feature fusion and multimodal regression method for the degradation prognosis of mechanical components. Initially, the raw features from the vibration signals of the mechanical components are extracted. A degradation index is subsequently yielded by merging the obtained features through/using the fuzzy fusion technique. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition is then introduced to decompose the fusion index into several multimodal sub-series to acquire more detailed information. Extreme learning machines are established to predict the sub-series in different modes. The predicted results are obtained by integrating the multimodal sub-results. The reported approach was evaluated with real data from a rolling element bearing. Moreover, two peer models were imported to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Cerrada, M; Sanchez, RV; Cabrera, D				Cerrada, Mariela; Sanchez, Rene-Vinicio; Cabrera, Diego			A semi-supervised approach based on evolving clusters for discovering unknown abnormal condition patterns in gearboxes	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Knowledge discovery; machine learning; semi-supervised learning; fault detection; fault diagnosis; gearboxes	FAULT SEVERITY ASSESSMENT; FEATURE-SELECTION; ROTATING MACHINERY; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; BEARINGS	Fault diagnosis plays a crucial role to maintain healthy conditions in rotating machinery. In real industrial applications, a Machine Learning based Classifier (ML-C) analyses data from a current machinery condition to detect abnormal behaviours. Usually, this is achieved through a previous training of the ML-C model, under supervised learning; however, for new machinery conditions, the classifier is not able to correctly identify these new condition. This paper proposes a framework to detect new patterns of abnormal conditions in gearboxes, that could be associated to new faults. The framework relies on an algorithm to build evolving models in simultaneous scenarios of classification and clustering. The design is inspired by the main principles of the K-means and the One Nearest Neighbour (1-NN) algorithms. A heuristic metric is defined to analyse the new discovered clusters; as a result, these new clusters can be labelled as new classes corresponding to new faulty patterns. Once a new pattern is identified, the associated data feeds a dedicated supervised classifier which is updated through a new training phase. The proposed framework is tested on data collected from a gearbox test bed under realistic conditions of faults. Experimental results show that the algorithm is able to discover new valuable knowledge than can be identified as new faulty classes.

Signal processing based fault detection is usually performed by considering classical techniques for alternative representation of significant signals in time domain, frequency domain or time-frequency domain. An approach based on dictionary learning for sparse representations of vibration signals aiming at gearbox fault detection and classification is proposed. A gearbox signal dataset with 900 records considering the normal case and nine fault classes is analyzed. A dictionary is learned by using a training set of signals from the normal case. This dictionary is used for obtaining the sparse representation of signals in the test set and the norm metric is used to measure the residual from the sparse representation. The extracted features are useful for machine learning based fault detection. The analysis is performed considering different load conditions. ANOVA statistical analysis shows that there are significant differences between features in the normal case and each of the faulty classes, and best ranked features form well separated clusters. An experiment of fault classification is developed using a support vector machine for multi-class classification of faults. The accuracy obtained is 95.1% in the cross-validation testing.

Since the gear faults usually generate the repetitive impulses, an integrated approach using the optimized Morlet wavelet transform, kurtosis index and soft-thresholding is applied to extract impulse components from original signals. Then time-domain features and frequency-domain features are calculated by both original signals and impulsive signals, and probability density functions are applied to study the sensitivities of the features to the faults. The extracted features are fed into DBNs to identify the fault types, and the results show that the DBN-based fault diagnosis method is feasible and the impulsive signals play a positive role to improve the accuracies. Finally, by the mean value of various signals under multiple load conditions, uniformed time-domain features are constructed to reduce the interference of loads, and the experimental results validate that feature uniformation can improve the accuracies and robustness of intelligent fault diagnosis approach.

J	Liu, KJ; Feng, YW; Xue, XF				Liu, Kuijian; Feng, Yunwen; Xue, Xiaofeng			Fault diagnosis of hydraulic retraction system based on multi-source signals feature fusion and health assessment for the actuator	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; feature fusion; hydraulic retraction system; multi-source signals; health assessment	CLASSIFICATION; METHODOLOGY; NETWORK	In order to solve the problems that traditional diagnostic method is heavily dependent on the signal processing techniques and expert experience, and the diagnostic accuracy is difficult to have big improvement anymore with the accumulation of operational data, which cannot meet the needs of fault diagnosis in the big data age, a multi-source signals feature fusion method by deep learning model is proposed in this paper. The stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) is used to extract the abstract and deep features from original features, and then locality preserving projections (LPP) is used for dimensionality reduction to complete the feature fusion. Finally, the fused low-dimensional features act as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) to realize the failure detection and fault location of typical fault modes of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system. The inhibitory effect of the feedback control on the incipient fault is discussed as well. Moreover, a severity assessment method is presented considering the gradual degradation of leakage fault of the actuator. The diagnostic results show that the proposed method has a better feature fusion ability and higher diagnostic accuracy. The health assessment model can evaluate the health state of the actuator. The significance of this paper is to provide a feasible idea for the fault diagnosis of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system and health assessment of the actuator.

J	Sun, FQ; Wang, N; Li, XY; Cheng, YY				Sun, Fuqiang; Wang, Ning; Li, Xiaoyang; Cheng, Yuanyuan			A time-varying copula-based prognostics method for bivariate accelerated degradation testing	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Prognostics; ADT; s-dependency; time-varying copula; reliable life bounds	HIGHLY RELIABLE PRODUCTS; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; INFERENCE; MODELS; PREDICTION	Accelerated degradation testing (ADT) has been widely used to accelerate failure/degradation processes and to quickly evaluate the reliability and lifetime of products. In particular, the application of copula function provides a convenient and efficient way to model the ADT data of products that have two or more s-dependent degradation measures. However, little effort has focused on the pointwise infimum and supremum of the multivariate joint-distribution function. For this paper, a novel prognostics method was developed for bivariate ADT data on the basis of Brownian motion and time-varying copula method, which can estimate the pointwise best-possible bounds on bivariate joint reliable life function with a given measure of association, such as Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho. The proposed model is applied to the real ADT data of microwave assembly to illustrate its performance and effectiveness.

J	Wang, YX; Li, HX; Yang, JW; Yao, DC				Wang, Yanxue; Li, Huaxin; Yang, Jianwei; Yao, Dechen			Sparse coding based RUL prediction and its application on roller bearing prognostics	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Prognostic and health management; trend prediction; remain useful life; sparse coding; roller bearing	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS	Roller bearings are among the most frequently encountered components in the majority of rotating machines. Thus, prognostic and health management of roller bearing plays an important role on the working conditions of the machine. Remaining useful life prediction is one of keys to apply PHM for practical applications. The collected bearing vibration signals are generally non-linear and non-stationary. However, those auto-regression model based methods are only suitable for the prediction of linear and stationary time series. Moreover, most of the existing machine learning based techniques require considerable training and parameter tunings which are time consuming and difficult for practical applications. To overcome these issues, a novel remaining useful life prediction method for rolling bearing prognostics is proposed in this work based on the sparse coding and sparse linear auto-regression model without training and parameter tunings. Sparse coding is formulated as a basis pursuit L-1-norm problem, where a sparse set of weight can be estimated for each test vector. Sparse local linear and neighbor embedding are employed to construct the proposed weight constraint sparse coding method. Two different experimental validations are conducted to well demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method for remaining useful life prediction of bearing via root-mean-square, peak-to-peak and kurtosis indicators in time-domain.

In this situation, trying to predict a future state or to classify internal features in the system becomes a challenging task that requires adequate conceptual and computational tools as well as appropriate datasets. A specially difficult case can be found in the problems framed under one-class learning. In an attempt to sidestep this issue, we present a machine learning methodology based in Reservoir Computing and Variational Inference. In our setting, the dynamical system generating the time series is modeled by an Echo State Network (ESN), and the parameters of the ESN are defined by an expressive probability distribution which is represented as a Variational Autoencoder. As a proof of its applicability, we show some results obtained in the context of condition-based maintenance in rotating machinery, where vibration signals can be measured from the system, our goal is fault detection in helical gearboxes under realistic operating conditions. The results show that our model is able, after trained only with healthy conditions, to discriminate successfully between healthy and faulty conditions and overcome other classical methodologies.

Therefore, an efficient diagnosis method is necessary to detect faults in bearings. In the present, a simulation model based fault diagnosis method for bears is proposed by combination of finite element method (FEM), wavelet packet transform (WPT) and support vector machine (SVM). In this method, firstly, the agreeable finite element models to simulate faulty bearings are presented to obtain the vibration response signals. Secondly, the vibration signals are decomposed into eight signal components using WPT. Ten time-domain feature parameters of all the signal components are calculated to generate the training samples to train the SVM. Finally, the eight signal components decomposed by WPT from the measured vibration signal in a bear, which are serve as a test sample into the trained SVM, and the work condition of the bearing can be determined. Experimental investigations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the present method. The classification accuracy rates for four type faults, i.e., inner race fault, rolling body fault, outer race fault and the combination of rolling body and outer race faults, are 79%, 81%, 71% and 76%, respectively.

GBAS improves the accuracy of the satellite navigation system significantly. However, some flight accidents still occur occasionally due to lack of availability and it makes more stringent requirements on availability that CAT II/III precise approach is trying to introduce GBAS. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective prediction algorithm for GBAS. The protection level is a key parameter in the process of evaluating the availability. There are three relevant parameters: quantile K represents the fault-free missed detection multiplier; projection matrix S is the vertical projection factor in the along-track coordinate system; variance of measurement noise is the standard deviation of the uncertainties of the residual differential error, which consists of the root sum square of uncertainties introduced through ionospheric and tropospheric decorrelation as well as the contribution of the ground and airborne multipath and noise. Some researchers have found that the model for the standard deviation of GBAS pseudo-range correction error is conservative, which causes decline of prediction accuracy. However, it is hard to explicitly model this parameter. We made a reevaluation based on support vector machine and improved the prediction algorithm for availability. We developed the simulation software and make practical measurement. Considering the influence of different distributions of based stations of GBAS, the availabilities of EWR, GIG and IAH are evaluated, and the results were compared with the actual values. The result shows that the prediction errors are 3.17%, 1.96% and 0.98% respectively.

J	Feyzi, F; Parsa, S				Feyzi, Farid; Parsa, Saeed			Kernel-based detection of coincidentally correct test cases to improve fault localisation effectiveness	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						coincidental correctness; support vector machine; SVM; spectrum-based faults localisation; SBFL; kernel function	SPECTRUM	Although empirical studies have confirmed the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localisation (SBFL) techniques, their performance may be degraded due to presence of some undesired circumstances such as the existence of coincidental correctness (CC) where one or more passing test cases exercise a faulty statement and thus causing some confusion to decide whether the underlying exercised statement is faulty or not. This article aims at improving SBFL effectiveness by mitigating the effect of CC test cases. In this regard, a new method is proposed that uses a support vector machine (SVM) with a customised kernel function. To build the kernel function, we applied a new sequence-matching algorithm that measures the similarities between passing and failing executions.

Along with the reliability enhancement for GaN-based power converters, it is essential to monitor a precursor signature identification for diagnostics/prognostic's techniques. With the availability of the most granular information deduced from advanced devices, a new data-driven scheme is proposed for system monitoring and possible lifetime extension of 400W power GaN converters at 100kHz. The approach relies on the real-time R-ds(on) data extraction from the power converter, and calibration of an adaptive model using multi-physics co-simulations under thermal cycling. More specifically, the locus is on deploying machine learning algorithms to exploit for the parameter estimation in power electronics engineering reliability.

The conventional method of embedding temperature sensors into the stator winding is reliable for localized measurements but could be blind to hot-spots depending on sensor proximity and fault severity. The more recent Infra-red (IR) camera based thermographic techniques are non-invasive and non-contact in obtaining machine's casing temperature distribution. However, they suffer from low sensitivity in detecting incipient winding faults. To overcome these limitations, a sensor array composed of discrete IR thermopile sensors mounted along the inner wall of the stator's casing is proposed in this paper. Although the system is invasive, it is non-intrusive and provides direct temperature distribution along the end-winding region in a non-contact way. The effectiveness of the sensor array in providing temperature distribution and inter-turn short circuit hot-spot detection is validated with experiments conducted using an induction motor.

Recently, external rotor motors are proposed as high power density motors for traction applications in electric vehicles and more electric aircraft. However, these in-wheel external rotor motors are usually under continuous stress of rotational forces due to the tire-road friction which can result in eccentricity faults due to stator and rotor misalignment. Therefore, it is critical to assess the external rotor motors performance under eccentricity faults in traction motors. In this study, various failure modes due to eccentricity faults such as SE, DE, and ME conditions are analyzed on optimal 3.8kW rare-earth based and 3.7kW rare-earth free external rotor PMa-SynRMs. Effects of these eccentricity conditions are translated to performance loss in terms of increased torque ripple and unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) in the electric motor designs. Also, 3rd harmonics of back-electromotive force (back-EMF) have been analyzed for both motors in all eccentricity conditions to compare their performance in fault detection. Experimental setup is developed to test the motors under load conditions and finite element simulation results are presented to validate the proposed theory.

Towards an Autonomic Bayesian Fault Diagnosis Service for SDN Environments based on a Big Data Infrastructure	2018 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE DEFINED SYSTEMS (SDS)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Software Defined Systems (SDS)	APR 23-26, 2018	Barcelona, SPAIN			SDN; Bayesian network; fault diagnosis; Machine Learning		Software Defined Networks (SDN) are gaining momentum as a solution for current and future networking issues. Its programmability and centralised control enables a more dynamic management of the network. But this feature introduces the cost of a potential increase in failures, since every modification introduced on the control plane is a new possibility for failures to appear and cause a decrement of the quality for the offered service. Following a classical approach, this kind of problems could be solved increasing the number of high skilled human operators, which would dramatically increase network operation cost. Our approach is to apply Machine Learning and Data Analysis for monitoring and diagnosis SDN networks with the goal of automating these tasks. In this paper, we present an architecture for a self-diagnosis service which is deployed on top of a SDN management platform. In addition, a prototype of the proposed service with different diagnosis models for SDN networks has been developed. The evaluation shows encouraging results which will be explored in future works.

Research on vibration signal analysis and extraction method of Gear local fault	FOURTH SEMINAR ON NOVEL OPTOELECTRONIC DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATION	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	4th Seminar on Novel Optoelectronic Detection Technology and Application	OCT 24-26, 2017	Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Soc Opt Engn, Chinese Soc Astronaut, Photoelectron Technol Comm, Chinese Acad Engn, Div Informat & Elect Engn, Sci & Technol Low Light Level Night Vis Lab, N Night Vis Technol Co Ltd Corp		Wavelet transform; Hilbert transform; Feature extraction; Gear partial fault; Vibration mechanism	DIAGNOSIS	Gear is the main connection parts and power transmission parts in the mechanical equipment. If the fault occurs, it directly affects the running state of the whole machine and even endangers the personal safety. So it has important theoretical significance and practical value to study on the extraction of the gear fault signal and fault diagnosis of the gear. In this paper, the gear local fault as the research object, set up the vibration model of gear fault vibration mechanism, derive the vibration mechanism of the gear local fault and analyzes the similarities and differences of the vibration signal between the gear non fault and the gears local faults. In the MATLAB environment, the wavelet transform algorithm is used to denoise the fault signal. Hilbert transform is used to demodulate the fault vibration signal. The results show that the method can denoise the strong noise mechanical vibration signal and extract the local fault feature information from the fault vibration signal.	[Yang, X.

In this paper, we propose a road-map towards achieving a self-reliant grid surveillance using power line communications (PLC). To this end, we exploit the principle that cable faults or degradations manifest themselves as changes in the PLC channel conditions. In particular, by monitoring the channel transfer functions that are already computed in legacy PLC receivers, we enable power line modems with intelligent grid sensing abilities to identify and assess cable anomalies using machine learning techniques. Through simulations, we show that our proposed monitoring and diagnostics solutions successfully empower power line modems to independently detect and predict the extent of water-tree degradations commonly seen in cross-linked polyethylene insulated power cables.
