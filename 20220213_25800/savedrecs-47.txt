J	Kim, NH				Kim, Nam-Hun			Rotor fault detection system for inverter driven induction motors using currents signals and an encoder	JOURNAL OF POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; induction motor; rotor fault; inverter driven system; currents signal	ECCENTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES	In this paper, an induction motor rotor fault diagnosis system using current signals, which are measured using the axis-transformation method is presented. Inverter-fed motor drives, unlike line-driven motor drives, have stator currents which are rich in harmonics and therefore fault diagnosis using stator current is not trivial. The current signals for rotor fault diagnosis need precise and high resolution information, which means the diagnosis system demands additional hardware such as a low pass filter, high resolution ADC, an encoder and additional hardware. Therefore, the proposed axis-transformation method is expected to contribute to a low cost fault diagnosis system in inverter-fed motor drives without the need for any additional hardware. In order to confirm the validity of the developed algorithms, various experiments for rotor.,faults are tested and the line current spectrum of each faulty situation, using the Park transformation, is compared with the results obtained from the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform).

On sliding mode observers for systems with unknown inputs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						unknown input observers; sliding mode; sliding mode differentiators; actuator faults	ROBUST FAULT-DETECTION; EXACT DIFFERENTIATION; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; DESIGN; ORDER	This paper considers the problem of designing an observer for a linear system subject to unknown inputs. This problem has been extensively studied in the literature with respect to both linear and nonlinear (sliding mode) observers. Necessary and sufficient conditions to enable a linear unknown input observer to be designed have been established for many years. One way to express these conditions is that the transfer function matrix between the unknown input and the measured output must be minimum phase and relative degree one. Identical conditions must be met in order to design a 'classical' sliding mode observer for the same problem. This paper shows how the relative degree condition can be weakened if a classical sliding mode observer is combined with sliding mode exact differentiators to essentially generate additional independent output signals from the available measurements. A practical example dedicated to actuator fault detection and identification of a winding machine demonstrates the efficacy of the approach. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Biswas, S; Sarkar, D; Bhowal, P; Mukhopadhyay, S				Biswas, Santosh; Sarkar, Dipankar; Bhowal, Prodip; Mukhopadhyay, Siddhartha			Diagnosis of delay-deadline failures in real time discrete event models	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						failure detection and diagnosis; discrete event systems; real time systems		In this paper a method for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of real time systems has been developed. A modeling framework termed as real time discrete event system (RTDES) model is presented and a mechanism for FDD of the same has been developed. The use of RTDES framework for FDD is an extension of the works reported in the discrete event system (DES) literature, which are based on finite state machines (FSM). FDD of RTDES models are suited for real time systems because of their capability of representing timing faults leading to failures in terms of erroneous delays and deadlines, which FSM-based ones cannot address. The concept of measurement restriction of variables is introduced for RTDES and the consequent equivalence of states and indistinguishability of transitions have been characterized. Faults are modeled in terms of an unmeasurable condition variable in the state map. Diagnosability is defined and the procedure of constructing a diagnoser is provided. A checkable property of the diagnoser is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability. The methodology is illustrated with an example of a hydraulic cylinder.

J	Qi, KY; He, ZJ; Zi, YY				Qi, Keyu; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang			Cosine window-based boundary processing method for EMD and its application in rubbing fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						boundary processing; EMD; cosine window; rubbing fault	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT SPECTRUM	A troublesome problem in application of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is boundary distortion. A novel boundary processing method based on cosine window is proposed here to solve this problem. With this method, a cosine window is firstly defined that its values equal to I in middle of the window and reduced by cosine/sine functions in both ends. Secondly, the analyzed signal is preprocessed by multiplying with the defined window, so that the amplitudes of the signal remain in middle and reduce in both ends. Lastly, EMD method is used to analyze the preprocessed signal. With the proposed method, the boundary distortion can be controlled in ends of the signal and the middle component can be correctly decomposed. Simulative and experimental studies verified that the proposed method can enormously decrease the boundary distortion of EMD and is useful in rubbing fault diagnosis of rotor system. The application in fault diagnosis of a practical machine set shows that the proposed method has strong practicability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Enhanced eigenvector algorithm for recovering multiple sources of vibration signals in machine fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						blind equalization; eigenvector algorithm; multiple sources; bearing vibration; machine fault diagnosis	BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; EQUALIZATION; DECONVOLUTION; CHANNELS; SYSTEMS	Many advanced techniques have been developed for vibration-based machine fault diagnosis. One of the prerequisites to use vibration for fault diagnosis is the vibration signal measured from a machine component must be well isolated from other vibrations that are generated by adjacent components. Many machines have numerous and small components that are closely packed together. Due to limited space or accessibility for installing sensors on the inspected machine component, sometimes only one sensor is allowed to be installed. An aggregated source of vibrations could be collected rather than just the vibration generated by the inspected component. Hence, an effective algorithm must be employed to recover the desired vibration out of the aggregated source of vibrations. The blind equalization-(BE)based eigenvector algorithm (EVA) has proven its effectiveness in recovering the overwhelmed vibration signal in the application of machine fault diagnosis. However, the conventional type of EVA can recover only one dominant source from the aggregated vibration. This dominant vibration may belong to the larger vibration generated by the inspected component or a nearby component. Hence, the ability of EVA in recovering signals besides the dominant signal is deemed necessary. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced EVA that consists of channel extension and a post-processing method to recover multiple sources of vibrations. The post-processing method includes the use of correlation and higher order statistics. With the help of these proposed algorithms, the enhanced EVA can recover other vibrations that are less dominant but highly relevant to existing faults. To verify its effectiveness, the ability of recovering the overwhelmed bearing faulty vibration is demonstrated. The results of the experiments using simulated signals and real machine vibrations have proven the effectiveness of the method. Hence, the enhanced EVA is suitable for vibration-based fault diagnosis on machines that have many closely packed components. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Eltabach, M; Antoni, J; Najjar, M				Eltabach, Mario; Antoni, Jerome; Najjar, Micheline			Quantitative analysis of noninvasive diagnostic procedures for induction motor drives	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						noninvasive diagnostic; mechanical fault signature; signal processing; rotating machinery	CAGE FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS	This paper reports quantitative analyses of spectral fault components in five noninvasive diagnostic procedures that use input electric signals to detect different types of abnormalities in induction motors. Besides the traditional one phase current spectrum analysis "SC", the diagnostic procedures based on spectrum analysis of the instantaneous partial powers "P-ab", "P-cb", total power "P-abc", and the current space vector modulus "csvm" are considered. The aim of this comparison study is to improve the diagnosis tools for detection of electromechanical faults in electrical machines by using the best suitable diagnostic procedure knowing some motor and fault characteristics. Defining a severity factor as the increase in amplitude of the fault characteristic frequency, with respect to the healthy condition, enables us to study the sensitivity of the electrical diagnostic tools. As a result, it is shown that the relationship between the angular displacement of the current side-bands components at frequencies (f +/- f(osc)) is directly related to the type of induction motor faults. It is also proved that the total instantaneous power diagnostic procedure was observed to exhibit the highest values of the detection criterion in case of mechanical faults while in case of electrical ones the most reliable diagnostic procedure is tightly related to the value of the motor power factor angle and the group motor-load inertia. Finally, simulation and experimental results show good agreement with the fault modeling theoretical results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rolling element bearings multi-fault classification based on the wavelet denoising and support vector machine	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault classification; wavelet denoising; support vector machine	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION	Due to the importance of rolling bearings as one of the most widely used industrial machinery elements, development of proper monitoring and fault diagnosis procedure to prevent malfunctioning and failure of these elements during operation is necessary. For rolling bearing fault detection, it is expected that a desired time-frequency analysis method has good computational efficiency, and has good resolution in both, time and frequency domains. The point of interest of this investigation is the presence of an effective method for multi-fault diagnosis in such systems with optimizing signal decomposition levels by using wavelet analysis and support vector machine (SVM). The system that is under study is an electric motor which has two rolling bearings, one of them is next to the output shaft and the other one is next to the fan and for each of them there is one normal form and three false forms, which make 8 forms for study. The results that we achieved from wavelet analysis and SVM are fully in agreement with empirical result. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As peritoneal damage in long-term peritoneal dialysis therapy is a major problem correlated to patient prognosis, diagnosis of peritoneal damage is important. To develop a diagnostic method for peritoneal damage, we focused on hyperpermeability across the peritoneum in a pathogenic peritoneal damage condition. In this study, disposition characteristics of an intraperitoneally injected marker substance in peritoneal damaged rats were analyzed. Materials and Methods. Peritoneal damaged rats were prepared by intraperitoneal injection of a glucose degradation product, methylglyoxal (MGO), for five or ten consecutive days. Phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP), as a marker substance, was intraperitoneally or intravenously injected into MGO-treated rats. Subsequently, the PSP disposition characteristics were pharmacokinetically analyzed. Results. In both cases of 5 and 10 days treatment of MGO, absorption of PSP after intraperitoneal injection was significantly enhanced. Plasma concentration and urinary excretion of PSP in MGO-treated rats were also higher than those in saline-treated rats in the early phase. On the contrary, there was no significant difference in terms of the pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenously injected PSP in saline- or MGO-treated rats. These results indicated that intraperitoneally injected MGO primarily acts on the peritoneal membrane; therefore, the peritoneal permeability of the marker substance was enhanced. Conclusion. We demonstrated that pharmacokinetic analysis of peritoneum permeability might be a potent diagnostic method for peritoneal damage in experimental animals and patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.

J	Khan, L; Awad, M; Thuraisingham, B				Khan, Latifur; Awad, Mamoun; Thuraisingham, Bhavani			A new intrusion detection system using support vector machines and hierarchical clustering	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article								Whenever an intrusion occurs, the security and value of a computer system is compromised. Network-based attacks make it difficult for legitimate users to access various network services by purposely occupying or sabotaging network resources and services. This can be done by sending large amounts of network traffic, exploiting well-known faults in networking services, and by overloading network hosts. Intrusion Detection attempts to detect computer attacks by examining various data records observed in processes on the network and it is split into two groups, anomaly detection systems and misuse detection systems. Anomaly detection is an attempt to search for malicious behavior that deviates from established normal patterns. Misuse detection is used to identify intrusions that match known attack scenarios. Our interest here is in anomaly detection and our proposed method is a scalable solution for detecting network-based anomalies. We use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The SVM is one of the most successful classification algorithms in the data mining area, but its long training time limits its use. This paper presents a study for enhancing the training time of SVM, specifically when dealing with large data sets, using hierarchical clustering analysis. We use the Dynamically Growing Self-Organizing Tree (DGSOT) algorithm for clustering because it has proved to overcome the drawbacks of traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms ( e. g., hierarchical agglomerative clustering). Clustering analysis helps find the boundary points, which are the most qualified data points to train SVM, between two classes. We present a new approach of combination of SVM and DGSOT, which starts with an initial training set and expands it gradually using the clustering structure produced by the DGSOT algorithm. We compare our approach with the Rocchio Bundling technique and random selection in terms of accuracy loss and training time gain using a single benchmark real data set. We show that our proposed variations contribute significantly in improving the training process of SVM with high generalization accuracy and outperform the Rocchio Bundling technique.

Dissection of genetic abnormalities critical to leukemia initiation provides insights into the elusive leukemogenesis, identifies distinct subsets of leukemia and predicts prognosis individually, and can also provide rational therapeutic targets for curative approaches. The past three decades have seen tremendous advances in the analysis of genotype-phenotype connection of leukemia, and in the identification of molecular biomarkers for leukemia subtypes. Intriguingly, differentiation therapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy have turned several subtypes of leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable. The use of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, which trigger degradation of PML-RAR alpha, the causative fusion protein generated by t (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), has led to a dramatic improvement of APL clinical outcome. Imatinib mesylate/ Gleevec/STI571, which inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL oncoprotein, has now become the new gold standard for the treatmtent of chronic myeloid leukemia. Optimal use of chemotherapeutic agents together with a stringent application of prognostic factors for risk-directed therapy in clinical trials has resulted in a steady improvement in the treatment outcome of acute lympho-blastic leukemia. Hence, the pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of leukemia control in the twenty-first century.

J	Sun, RX; Tsung, FG; Qu, LS				Sun, Ruixiang; Tsung, Fugee; Qu, Liangsheng			Evolving kernel principal component analysis for fault diagnosis	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						kernel principal component analysis; genetic algorithms; fault diagnosis	SPACE	Feature extraction is the core of a fault diagnosis system. This paper presents a novel approach, called evolving kernel principal component analysis (EKPCA), to transform the original features to a more effective nonlinear combination in fault classification. EKPCA is based on the integration of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and an improved evolutionary optimization algorithm. As a coordinate transformation technique, KPCA is a superset of principal component analysis (PCA), which is utilized to project the original data space to a nonlinear feature space via the appropriate kernel function, and then PCA is performed in the projected feature space. Compared with PCA, KPCA is more flexible in extracting a group of new nonlinear features. However, the efficiency of KPCA in real-world applications depends mainly on the kernel function chosen a priori. It remains an issue of how to select the kernel function from the viewpoint of optimization. This paper addresses this issue using the techniques from evolutionary computation (EC). An improved evolutionary algorithm incorporated with a Gaussian mutation operator that is inspired from evolutionary strategies (ES) and evolutionary programming (EP) can enhance both the global and the local search performances without substantially increasing the computational effort. The application in fault diagnosis to a large-scale rotating machine shows that EKPCA is effective and efficient in discovering the optimal nonlinear features corresponding to real-world operational data. Thus, this method can improve the recognition power of a fault diagnosis system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Azizur			Real-time implementation of wavelet packet transform-based diagnosis and protection of three-phase induction motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						digital signal processors; fault diagnosis; induction motors; wavelet transforms	EXTRACT HEURISTIC KNOWLEDGE; NEURAL FUZZY SYSTEM; PARTIAL DISCHARGE; INCIPIENT FAULTS; STATOR; MACHINES	This paper presents a real-time implementation of an online protection technique for induction motor fault detection and diagnosis. The protection system utilizes a wavelet packet transform (WPT)-based algorithm for detecting and diagnosing various disturbances occurring in three-phase induction motors. The criterion for the detection is the comparison of the coefficients of the WPT of line currents using a mother wavelet at the second level of resolution with a threshold determined experimentally during the healthy condition of the motor. The algorithm is implemented in real-time using the Texas Instrument TMS320C31 32-b floating-point digital signal processor with the help of objectoriented programming. The proposed technique is tested on two three-phase induction motors. The online test results give a response signal at the instant or within one cycle of disturbance in all cases of investigated faults. In addition, the algorithm is also tested during no load and full load operating conditions of the motor.

In this paper, a new approach for monitoring the condition of the stator insulation for inverter-fed machines is proposed. The main concept of the proposed approach is to apply various types of test voltages to the motor stator insulation using the inverter, to perform standard offline insulation tests whenever the motor is not operating. Two methods for testing the insulation with modifications to the inverter circuit are proposed and verified experimentally. The results show that the proposed technique provides a simple low cost solution for detecting stator insulation degradation at an early stage for reliable operation of inverter-fed machine systems, since the insulation condition can be monitored frequently. This not only helps prevent forced outages and safety risks due to insulation breakdown, but also helps perform maintenance in an efficient manner since individual motor maintenance can be prioritized and scheduled based on its present condition.

Dynamic eccentricity and demagnetized rotor magnet detection in trapezoidal flux (Brushless DC) motors operating under different load conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Power Electronics, Machines and Drives (PEMD 2004)	MAR 31-NOV 10, 2004-2005	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND			brushless dc (BLDC); condition-monitoring; eccentricity; electric machines; finite-element analysis (FEA); varying load		Brushless de (BLDC) machines are finding increasing use in applications that demand high and rugged performance. Automotive and aerospace are some such areas where these machines may be used. In this context, condition monitoring of these machines would provide added value. This paper investigates the effect of several potential rotor faults on the current spectrum of BLDC motors with a view to develop an effective condition-monitoring scheme. The effect of load unbalances, misalignments, and varying load torques on the diagnosis of such machines is investigated. A method to estimate the strength of the rotor magnets is also provided. Simulation and experimental results are presented to substantiate that current signature analysis could be a viable tool for diagnosing the condition of BLDC machines.

This framework has two levels: one is local to a single ATM, while the other is network-wide. The framework employs vaccination and adaptability analogies of the immune system. For discriminating between normal and erroneous states, an immune-inspired one-class supervised algorithm was employed, which supports continual learning and adaptation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was confirmed in terms of classification performance and impact on availability. The overall results are encouraging as the downtime of ATMs can de reduced by anticipating the occurrence of failures before they actually occur.

The application of support vector regression to machine health monitoring was recently investigated; however, such implementation is based on batch processing of the available data. Therefore, the addition of new sample to the already existing dataset requires that the technique should retrain from scratch. This disadvantage makes the technique unsuitable for online systems that will give real-time information to field engineers so that corrective actions could be taken before there is any damage to the system. This paper presents an application of accurate online support vector regression (AOSVR) approach that efficiently updates a trained predictor whenever a new sample is added to the training set using shaft misalignment and nuclear power plant feedwater flow rate data. The results show that the approach is effective for online machine condition monitoring where it is usually difficult to obtain sufficient training data prior to the installation of the online systems.

A semiautomatic approach to deriving turbine generator diagnostic knowledge	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						expert systems; fault diagnosis; knowledge acquisition; knowledge-based systems; learning systems; power system monitoring	SYSTEM; NETWORK	Condition monitoring of turbine generators, housed at British Energy nuclear power stations throughout the U.K., is implemented to diagnose incipient faults at an earl stage, so corrective action can be taken to avoid the associated high costs of an unplanned shutdown. A prototype expert system has been developed that provides decision support to condition monitoring experts who monitor British Energy turbine generators. The expert system automatically interprets data from strategically positioned sensors and transducers on the turbine generator by applying expert knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. This paper reviews the application domain and describes the work undertaken in developing the prototype expert system. The paper also outlines a learning module design that uses an approach based on an analytical symbolic machine learning technique, explanation-based generalization, to semiautomatically derive heuristic rules for turbine generator fault diagnosis. The approach adopted by the learning module is explained. in detail and a worked example demonstrates how the learning module can derive a fault heuristic from a single training example. The modular approach to capturing the causal fault and behavioral models is described, and the method in which the module will beintegrated with the existing expert system has been outlined. A preliminary evaluation of the learning module design is discussed.

Hierarchical fault diagnosis: Application to an ozone plant	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Letter							DISCRETE-EVENT SYSTEMS	A framework for diagnosis in hierarchical finite-state machines is presented and applied to an ozone plant. In this approach, the model of the system is broken into simpler substructures called D-holons. At any instant, instead of the complete system model, only the D-holons associated with the ongoing phase of operation are used for diagnosis, which reduces memory requirement. Furthermore, within the above setup, a semimodular diagnosis method is presented and used to reduce design computations. Following the proposed framework, a diagnosis system is designed for the ozone plant. It is shown that the proposed approach significantly reduces the complexity of constructing and storing the diagnosis system.

Distance relaying for transmission line using support vector machine and radial basis function neural network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS			English	Article						distance protection; change in energy; standard deviation; RBFNN; SVM; wavelet transform	FAULT CLASSIFICATION	The proposed technique consists of preprocessing the fault current signal samples using discrete wavelet transform to yield the change in energy (cc) and standard deviation (sd) at the appropriate level of decomposition of fault current and voltage signal for faulty phase identification and fault location determination. After feature extraction (ce and sd) from fault current signal, support vector machine (SVM) is used for decision of fault or no-fault on any phase or multiple phases of the transmission line. The ground detection is done by a proposed indicator 'index' with a threshold value. Once the faulty phases are identified, the fault location from the relaying point can be accurately estimated using RBFNN (radial basis function neural network) with recursive least square algorithm. For fault location both current and voltage signals are preprocessed through wavelet transform to yield change in energy (cc) and standard deviation (sd) which are used to train and test the RBFNN to provide fault location from the relaying point accurately. The combined SVM and RBFNN based technique is tested for faults with wide range of operating conditions and provides accurate results for fault classification and location determination, respectively.

J	Boutros, T; Liang, M				Boutros, Tony; Liang, Ming			Mechanical fault detection using fuzzy index fusion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						condition indicators; fuzzy fusion; Sugeno inference engine; tool condition; bearing condition	ACOUSTIC-EMISSION SIGNALS; TOOL WEAR; VIBRATION; BREAKAGE; FRACTURE	This paper reports a simple, effective and robust fusion approach based on fuzzy logic and Sugeno-style inference engine. Using this method, four condition-monitoring indicators, developed for detection of transient and gradual abnormalities, are fused into one single comprehensive fuzzy fused index (FFI) for reliable machinery health assessment. This approach has been successfully tested and validated in two different applications: tool condition monitoring in milling operations and bearing condition assessment. The FFI differentiates clearly between the normal and abnormal conditions using the same fuzzy rule base. This certainly shows the versatility and robustness of the FFI. As the FFI value always falls between zero and one, it facilitates threshold setting in monitoring conditions of different tools or machinery components. Our experimental study also indicates that the FFI is sensitive to fault severity, capable of differentiating damages caused by an identical fault at different bearing components, but not susceptible to load changes.

J	Liang, J; Du, R				Liang, J.; Du, R.			Model-based fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC systems using support vector machine method	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DU FROID			English	Article						air conditioning; process; detection; anomaly; maintenance	AIR-HANDLING UNIT; AHU	Preventive maintenance plays a very important role in the modern Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems for guaranteeing the thermal comfort, energy saving and reliability. Its key is a cost-effective Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) method. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a new method by combining the model-based FDD method and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. A lumped-parameter model of a single zone HVAC system is developed first, and then the characteristics of three major faults, including the recirculation damper stuck, cooling coil fouling/block and supply fan speed decreasing, are investigated by computer simulation. It is found that the supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, outlet water temperature and control signal are sensitive to the faults and can be selected as the fault indicators. Based on the variations of the system states under the normal and faulty conditions of different degrees, the faults can be detected efficiently by using the residual analysis method. Furthermore, a multi-layer SVM classifier is developed, and the diagnosis results show that this classifier is effective with high accuracy. As a result, the presented Model-Based Fault Detection and Diagnosis (MBFDD) method can help to maintain the health of the HVAC systems, reduce energy consumption and maintenance cost.

Analytical study, modeling and detection of inter-turn short-circuits in stator windings of induction motors	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-IREE			English	Article						diagnosis; induction motors; inter-turns short-circuit; stator faults	MACHINES; FAULT	In this paper an analytical approach is presented to study in a more efficient way, the spectral contents of the stator line current of three-phase squirrel cage induction motors under healthy conditions and with inter-turn short-circuit. This study is based on analytical expressions for the stator and the cage rotor magnetomotive forces (MMF) which are derived using the winding Junction approach. Also, an accuracy mathematical model of the induction motor operating under stator inter-turns short-circuits is established This model is based on the multiplied coupled circuit approach. The inductances calculations are performed thanks to an extension in 2-D of the modified winding function approach (eMWFA), which is able to take into account the space harmonics in addition to the effects of rotor bar skewing and the linear rise of MMF across the slots. It is found that inter-turn short circuit does not induce any new frequency components in the stator current spectrum; but, it increases only the magnitudes of the rotor slot harmonics. Experimental tests which are carried out on a special three-phase induction motor validate the theoretical analysis. Copyright (C) 2007 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l - All rights reserved.

Gearbox fault feature extraction using hilbert transform, S-transform, and a statistical indicator	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						gearbox; fault features extraction; Hilbert transform; S-transform; feature indicator	WAVELET TRANSFORM; SPECTRUM	Vibration analysis has been widely used in machine fault feature extraction and diagnosis of rotating machinery. The effects of modulation and nonstationarity in vibration signals collected from a faulty gearbox present challenges for fault feature extraction. Hilbert transform and S-transform have the ability to address these issues through demodulation and time-frequency analysis, respectively. In this paper, we propose to use a feature indicator to represent the S-transform coefficients. The proposed method integrates the advantages of Hilbert transform, S-transform, and the proposed feature indicator (FI). The validity of the proposed method is verified with a simulated signal and real gearbox vibration signals. Comparison studies show that the proposed method is more effective and does not require the operators to have a lot of diagnostic experience.

Recently, there has been an increasing requirement of selecting special sensors, which are cheap, robust, easily installed, and good classifiers that have accurate classification, stable performance, and short calculating time. This article carries out a comparative study of various classification algorithms for fault diagnosis of electric motors using different types of signals. The authors evaluate experimentally the relative performances of five classifiers using five types of steady-state signals based on three kinds of performance evaluation strategies: training-test, cross-validation, and similar measure. First, the raw signals are collected and features are extracted from the collected signals. Then, the extracted features are classified using the five classification algorithms. Next, an overall comparison of the five classifiers is described, and experiment results are discussed. Finally, conclusions are summarized and suggestions are offered.

J	Shi, JZ; Gu, F; Goulding, P; Ball, A				Shi, John Z.; Gu, Fengshou; Goulding, Peter; Ball, Andrew			Integration of multiple platforms for real-time remote model-based condition monitoring	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						remote condition monitoring; model-based approach; real-time systems; WorldFip fieldbus; control systems; distributed monitoring	FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS; NETWORKS	Model-based condition monitoring has been demonstrated to have superior performance in process condition monitoring. However, it demands increased computational resources to support its more advanced intelligence. This requirement imposes difficulties in integration into an existing control system that typically has resources dedicated solely to control applications. To overcome this problem, this paper presents an integration of multiple platforms, in which tasks are allocated in different machines with different levels of software platform. Time synchronisation between the local and remote devices is implemented by means of Fieldbus network with published-subscriber architecture. A client-server arrangement is used to deal with the data communication between Matlab and Labwindows. A temporary data buffer provides variable time accuracy while using a small fraction of system resources. This approach has been realised in an electro-hydraulic control system, demonstrating the full use of existing rich software resources and the convenience of configuring the systems.

Rubbing between the rotor and the stator can produce abundant AE signals. These signals are very useful for ;the feature extraction and fault diagnosis. According to impulsive and periodic characteristic of the rubbing signals, Morlet wavelet is selected and the wavelet parameter is optimized based on the principle of minimal wavelet entropy. The generalized soft-threshold de-noising method is used to select the reconstructed coefficients. By Morlet wavelet transformation, the noise is eliminated and the impulses are distinguished in the purified signals. Having been tested using the signals generated in experimental test rig, it can be seen that the AE technique is effective in diagnosis of early rubbing fault of rolling machines.

J	Kia, SH; Henao, H; Capolino, GA				Kia, Shahin Hedayati; Henao, Humberto; Capolino, Gerard-Andre			A high-resolution frequency estimation method for three-phase induction machine fault detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						electric variables measurement; fault diagnosis; Fourier transforms; frequency estimation; induction machines; multidimensional signal processing; pattern classification	DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; MUSIC	Fault detection in alternating-current electrical machines that is based on frequency analysis of stator current has been the interest of many researchers. Several frequency estimation techniques have been developed and are used to help the induction machine fault detection and diagnosis. This paper presents a technique to improve the fault detection technique by using the classical multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method. This method is a powerful tool that extracts meaningful frequencies from the signal, and it has been widely used in different areas, which include electrical machines. In the proposed application, the fault sensitive frequencies have to be found in the stator current signature. They are numerous in a given frequency range, and they are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the MUSIC method takes a long computation time to find many frequencies by increasing the dimension of the autocorrelation matrix. To solve this problem, an algorithm that is based on zooming in a specific frequency range is proposed with MUSIC in order to improve the performances of frequency extraction. Moreover, the method is integrated as a part of MUSIC to estimate the frequency signal dimension order based on classification of autocorrelation matrix eigenvalues. The proposed algorithm has been applied to detect a rotor broken bar fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine under different loads and in steady-state condition.

Via numerical examples, it is demonstrated that constant-step procedures are inefficient. This relates to the practice of energy-conserving symplectic integration, assuming constant time steps, and is compared to direct numerical simulations using Runge-Kutta integrators with variable time-step control. It is concluded that the latter with automatic variable time-step control is the more efficient, and should be applied. The practice and efficiency of a stabilization procedure for the time-step selection is described and illustrated. An important point of the method is that the linear part of the prognostic equations is integrated analytically, which means that this part is obtained to machine presicion for any (large) time step (time interval). The evolution and instabilities of highly nonlinear water waves in three dimensions are exemplified through an accurate and efficient time-integration procedure.

Directionally independent failure prediction of end-milling tools during pocketing maneuvers	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORKS; WEAR; SYSTEM	Tracking the health of cutting tools under typical wear conditions is advantageous to the speed and efficiency of manufacturing processes. Existing techniques monitor tool performance through analyzing force or acceleration signals whereby prognoses are made from a single sensor type. This work proposes to enhance the spectral output of autoregressive (AR) models by combining triaxial accelerometer and triaxial dynamometer signals. Through parallel processing of force and acceleration signals using single six degree of freedom modeling, greater spectral resolution is achieved. Two entirely independent methods of tracking the tool wear are developed and contrasted. First, using the discrete cosine transform, primary component analysis will be applied to the spectral output of each AR auto and cross spectrum (Method 1). Each discrete cosine transform of the six-dimensional spectral data is analyzed to determine the magnitude of the critical (primary) variance energy component of the respective spectrum. The eigenvalues of these selected spectral energies are then observed for trends toward failure. The second method involves monitoring the eigenvalues of the spectral matrices centered at the toothpass frequency (Method 2). The results of the two methodologies are compared. Through the use of the eigenvalue method, it is shown that, for straight and pocketing maneuvers, both methods successfully track the condition of the tool using statistical thresholding. The techniques developed in this work are shown to be robust by multiple life tests conducted on different machine platforms with different operating conditions. Both techniques Successfully identify impending fracture or meltdown due to wear providing sufficient time to remove the tools before failure is realized.

The time-frequency distribution of the signal is viewed as a series of time signals corresponding to different firequency variables, and each time signal is processed with the technique of synchronous average scanning over a frequency region of interest. The energies of the outputs Corresponding to different frequency bands and different average reference frequencies are recorded in a 2D array and depicted as a gray level image. Detection of the signal of interest leads itself to the identification of the spot in the image.

Inverse approach to the reconstruction and quantification of vibratory sources	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						vibratory sources; inverse problems; modal analysis	FORCES	Vibratory analysis allows us to interpret the fundamental conditions of rotating machines. This interpretation is useful in the diagnosis of faults. In practice, the vibratory measurements made by sensors come from a mixture of vibratory sources corresponding to different machine components. Thus, it becomes hard to conduct state interpretation for each individual component. This fact leads us to consider the inverse problem, reconstruction of the vibratory sources based on measurements. However, the inversion is unfortunately unstable. To limit the instability, previous studies proposed use of a large number of sensors and the processing of measurements using regularization methods. However, regularization requires estimation of the regularization parameter, which is a hard task. In addition, regularization can remove some vibratory sources. Moreover, the sensor positions are "random", but the stability is significantly influenced by the sensor positions and by the mixture properties described by modal analysis. This article proposes to link modal analysis and stability. This link allows us to reduce the number of sensors and to avoid regularization methods. Thus, two complementary approaches are developed to determine optimal sensor positions: A numerical approach with a numerical updated model and an experimental approach using modal analysis. Thanks to the use of these optimal positions, stability is improved and vibratory sources are correctly reconstructed.

By distinguishing the different patterns of the PQ components in the PQ plane, the rotor broken bar fault can be detected. The magnitude of power component directly resulted from rotor fault is used as the fault indicator and the distance between the point of no-load condition and the center of the ellipse as its normalization value. Based on these, the fault severity factor which is completely independent of the inertia and load level is defined. Moreover, a method to reliably discriminate between rotor faults and periodic load fluctuation is presented. Experimental results from a 4 kW induction motor demonstrated the validity of the proposed method.

Fault detection in water supply systems using hybrid (theory and data-driven) modelling	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						water supply systems; neural networks; fuzzy logic; hybrid modelling	INDEX	In this paper we present a complex hybrid model in the water management field based on a synergetic combination of deterministic and machine learning model components. The objective of a Water Supply System (WSS) is to convey treated water to consumers through a pressurized network of pipes. A number of meters and gauges are used to take continuous or periodic measurements that are sent via a telemetry system to the control and operation center and used to monitor the network. Using this typically limited number of measures together with demand predictions the state of the system must be assessed. Suitable state estimation is of paramount importance in diagnosing leaks and other faults and anomalies in WSS. But this task can be really cumbersome, if not unachievable, for human operators. The aim of this paper is to explore the possibility for a technique borrowed from machine learning, specifically a neuro-fuzzy approach, to perform such a task. For one thing, state estimation of a network is performed by using optimization techniques that minimize the discrepancies between the measures taken by telemetry and the values produced by the mathematical model of the network, which tries to reconcile all the available information. But, for another, although the model can be completely accurate, the estimation is based on data containing non-negligible levels of uncertainty, which definitely influences the precision of the estimated states. The quantification of the uncertainty of the input data (telemetry measures and demand predictions) can be achieved by means of robust estate estimation. By making use of the mathematical model of the network, estimated states together with uncertainty levels, that is to say, fuzzy estimated states, for different anomalous states of the network can be obtained. These two steps rely on a theory-driven model. The final aim is to train a neural network (using the fuzzy estimated states together with a description of the associated anomaly) capable of assessing WSS anomalies associated with particular sets of measurements received by telemetry and demand predictions. This is the data-driven counterpart of the hybrid model. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Better narrowband spectral measurements	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						spectrum analysis; time aliasing; system identification; modal analysis; rotating machinery fault diagnosis; narrowband signals; bias error; spectral leakage		Spectrum analysis based on traditional FFT techniques is a widely available, commonly understood and general purpose tool for use with mechanical systems. In applications such as system identification, modal analysis and rotating machinery signature analysis, relevant information content in signals is greatest near narrowband phenomena in the frequency domain. Effort should be focused on reducing bias error in these regions in preference to reducing variance error. Time aliasing methods of spectrum analysis can result in superior bias error reduction, producing an accurately sampled spectral estimate and permitting window function characteristics to be decoupled from the DFT resolution, or frequency line spacing. Windows created with time aliasing can be optimized by adjusting the amount of time or frequency localization, according to the type of spectrum being measured. Assuming conventional criteria, time aliased windows can achieve better mainlobe and sidelobe characteristics than other windows. An innovative approach, appropriate with continuous spectra, is to use the window as a discrete sampling function in frequency to eliminate bias error inherent in the effective convolution between window and signal transform. Both approaches have been successfully implemented and results are presented using time aliased spectral estimates showing more accurate measurements of narrowband phenomena when used in applications of rotating machinery vibration and system identification.

J	Widodo, A; Yang, BS				Widodo, Achmad; Yang, Bo-Suk			Support vector machine in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review						support vector machine; machine condition monitoring; fault diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Recently, the issue of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis as a part of maintenance system became global due to the potential advantages to be gained from reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and increased machine availability. This paper presents a survey of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM). It attempts to summarize and review the recent research and developments of SVM in machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Numerous methods have been developed based on intelligent systems such as artificial neural network, fuzzy expert system, condition-based reasoning, random forest, etc. However, the use of SVM for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is still rare. SVM has excellent performance in generalization so it can produce high accuracy in classification for machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Until 2006, the use of SVM in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is tending to develop towards expertise orientation and problem-oriented domain. Finally, the ability to continually change and obtain a novel idea for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using SVM will be future works. (c) Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DWT analysis of numerical and experimental data for the diagnosis of dynamic eccentricities in induction motors	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						dynamic eccentricities; startup transient; discrete wavelet transform; fault diagnosis; electromechanical faults	ROTOR-BAR DETECTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SYSTEM	The behaviour of an induction machine during a startup transient can provide useful information for the diagnosis of electromechanical faults. During this process, the machine works under high stresses and the effects of the faults may also be larger than those in steady-state. These facts may help to amplify the magnitude of the indicators of some incipient faults. In addition, fault components with frequencies dependant on the slip evolve in a particular way during that transient, a fact that allows the diagnosis of the corresponding fault and the discrimination between different faults. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an ideal tool for analysing signals with frequency spectrum variable in time. Some research works have applied with success the DWT to the stator startup current in order to diagnose the presence of broken rotor bars in induction machines. However, few works have used this technique for the study of other common faults, such as eccentricities. In this work, time-frequency analysis of the stator startup current is carried out in order to detect the presence of dynamic eccentricities in an induction motor. For this purpose, the DWT is applied and wavelet signals at different levels are studied. Data are obtained from simulations, using a finite element (FE) model of an induction motor, which allows forcing several kinds of faults in the machine, and also from experimental tests. The results show the validity of the approach for detecting the fault and discriminating with respect to other failures, presenting for certain applications (or working conditions) some advantages over the traditional stationary analysis.

J	Widodo, A; Yang, BS				Widodo, Achmad; Yang, Bo-Suk			Application of nonlinear feature extraction and support vector machines for fault diagnosis of induction motors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; kernel independent component analysis; kernel principal component analysis; support vector machines; feature extraction	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS	Recently, principal components analysis (PCA) and independent components analysis (ICA) was introduced for doing feature extraction. PCA and ICA linearly transform the original input into new uncorrelated and independent features space respectively. In this paper, the feasibility of using nonlinear feature extraction is studied and it is applied in support vector machines (SVMs) to classify the faults of induction motor. In nonlinear feature extraction, we employed the PCA and ICA procedure and adopted the kernel trick to nonlinearly map the data into a feature space. A strategy of multi-class SVM-based classification is applied to perform the faults diagnosis. The performance of classification process due to various feature extraction method and the choice of kernel function is presented and compared to show the excellent of classification process.

Data-driven modeling, fault diagnosis and optimal sensor selection for HVAC chillers	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						chillers; data-driven modeling; fault diagnosis; heating; sensor selection; ventilation and air-conditioning systems	BUILDING SYSTEMS; PROGNOSTICS; PERFORMANCE	Chillers constitute a significant portion of energy consumption equipment in heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The growing complexity of building systems has become a major challenge for field technicians to troubleshoot the problems manually; this calls for automated "smart-service systems" for performing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The focus of this paper is to develop a generic FDD scheme for centrifugal chillers and also to develop a nominal data-driven ("black-box") model of the chiller that can predict the system response under new loading conditions. In this vein, support vector machines, principal component analysis, and partial least squares are the candidate fault classification techniques in our approach. We present a genetic algorithm-based approach to select a sensor suite for maximum diagnosabilty and also evaluated the performance of selected classification procedures with the optimized sensor suite. The responses of these selected sensors are predicted under new loading conditions using the nominal model developed via the black-box modeling approach. We used the benchmark data on a 90-t real centrifugal chiller test equipment, provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, to demonstrate and validate our proposed diagnostic procedure. The database consists of data from sixty four monitored variables of the chiller under 27 different modes of operation during nominal and eight faulty conditions with different severities. Note to Practitioners-Heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute largest portion of energy consumption equipment. Even though safety is not a critical issue in HVAC industry, the complexity of modern HVAC systems, the operational and maintenance costs associated with the equipment are calling for sophisticated automatic fault diagnosis tools. Among the HVAC components chillers are primarily known for significant energy consumption. Presently, very little of the existing research on fault diagnosis of HVAC systems is aimed at chillers and suffers from certain drawbacks. The primary goal of this paper is to address these issues and develop a generic fault diagnosis tool applicable to any HVAC component. In this vein, we proposed a data-driven approach based on neural network and statistical tools for fault diagnosis, and nominal model development. Since chillers are an example of a data-rich environment we adopted a genetic algorithm based approach for optimal sensor selection for maximizing the diagnosibility. The approach is also validated on an experimental data from 90-t centrifugal chiller provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers and also has a potential for practical application.

In this paper, an adaptive observer scheme is proposed. The proposed observer is capable of simultaneously estimating the speed of the motor, the amount turns involved in the short circuit, and an expression of the current in the short circuit. Moreover, the states of the motor are estimated, meaning that the magnetizing currents are made available even though a fault has occurred in the motor. To be able to develop this observer, a model that is particularly suitable for the chosen observer design, is also derived. The efficiency of the proposed observer is demonstrated by tests performed on a test setup with a customized designed induction motor. With this motor it is possible to simulate interturn short-circuit faults.

Building knowledge for substation-based decision support using rough sets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article						circuit breakers (CBs); discernibility; fault section estimation; relays; rough sets; rules discovery; voting algorithm		This paper describes a new technique based on rough sets to extract decision rules from large volumes of data captured by protection, control, and monitoring intelligent electronic devices. The methodology correctly identifies faults from large datasets and could be used to assist operators in their decision-making processes. Building knowledge for a fault diagnostic system is a time-consuming and costly process. The quality of a knowledge base can sometimes be hampered by a large number of superfluous decision-making rules that can lead to an unnecessarily large knowledge base system and inefficient or even detrimental rule maintenance. The methodology proposed cannot only induce decision rules efficiently but can also reduce the size of the knowledge base without causing loss of useful information. Results can be used by an expert system to generate supervisory automation and to support operators, for example, during an emergency situation. This methodology involves the generation of human-machine interface alarms. These can then be used for diagnosis of the type and cause of a fault event to give suggestions for network restoration and post-emergency repair. A Power Systems Computer Aided Design/Electromagnetic Transients including dc simulator has been used to investigate the effect of faults and switching actions on the protection and control equipment associated with a typical distribution network. The fundamental ideas of rough set theory are discussed, followed by a rule assessment method that is outlined using an illustrative example.

Fault detection, diagnostics, and prognostics: Software agent solutions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						diagnostics; electric ship; fault detection; multiagent system (MAS); prognostics	FAILURE-DETECTION; ARCHITECTURE; DESIGN	Fault diagnosis and prognosis are important tools for the reliability, availability, and survivability of navy all-electric ships (AES). Extending the fault detection and diagnosis into predictive maintenance increases the value of this technology. The traditional diagnosis can be viewed as a single diagnostic agent having a model of the component or the whole system to be diagnosed. This becomes inadequate when the components or system become large, complex, and even distributed as on navy electric ships. For such systems, the software multiagents may offer a solution. A key benefit of software agents is their ability to automatically perform complex tasks in place of human operators. After briefly reviewing traditional fault diagnosis and software agent technologies, this paper discusses how these technologies can be used to support the drastic manning reduction requirements for future navy ships. Examples are given on the existing naval applications and research on detection, diagnostic, and prognostic software agents. Current work on a multiagent system for shipboard power systems is presented as an example of system-level application.

The main purpose is to investigate different fault conditions for rotating machinery, such as imbalance, misalignment, base looseness and combination of imbalance and misalignment. In this study, we measured the non-stationary vibration signals induced by these fault conditions. Applying wavelet packets transform to these signals, the fractal dimension of each frequency channel was extracted and the box counting dimension was used to depict the failure characteristics of the fault conditions. The failure modes were then identified by a radial basis function neural network. An experiment was conducted and the results showed that the proposed method can detect and recognize different kinds of fault conditions. Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of wavelet packets-fractal technology and neural networks can provide an effective method to diagnose fault conditions of rotating machinery.

A novel feature of this approach is that the vibration signals acquired from the water hydraulic motor are employed for analysis. Wavelet transform (WT) is first applied as a feature extraction technique to analyze the time-domain vibration signal. The performance of support vector machine (svm) is then investigated and compared with the conventional neural network. The results confirm the applicability of the proposed method for the fault detection in a modern water hydraulic system.

J	Gupta, S; Ray, A				Gupta, Shalabh; Ray, Asok			Real-time fatigue life estimation in mechanical structures	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						symbolic time series analysis; anomaly detection; fatigue damage; ultrasonic sensing	SERIES ANALYSIS; DAMAGE	The paper addresses the issue of online diagnosis and prognosis of emerging faults in human- engineered complex systems. Specifically, the paper reports a dynamic data- driven analytical tool for early detection of incipient faults and real- time estimation of remaining useful fatigue life in polycrystalline alloys. The algorithms for fatigue life estimation rely on time series data analysis of ultrasonic signals and are built upon the principles of symbolic dynamics, information theory and statistical pattern recognition. The proposed method is experimentally validated by using 7075- T6 aluminium alloy specimens on a special- purpose fatigue test apparatus that is equipped with ultrasonic flaw detectors and an optical travelling microscope. The real- time information, derived by the proposed method, is useful for mitigation of widespread fatigue damage and is potentially applicable to life extending and resilient control of mechanical structures.

J	Zhan, YM; Mechefske, CK				Zhan, Yimin; Mechefske, Chris K.			Robust detection of gearbox deterioration using compromised autoregressive modeling and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Part II: Experiment and application	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						gearbox vibration; non-stationary operation; Kohnogorov-Smirnov test statistic; autoregressive model residuals; gear tooth breakage	VIBRATION ANALYSIS; TOOTH FAILURE; MAINTENANCE; DIAGNOSIS; BEARING	Optimal maintenance decision analysis is heavily dependent on the accuracy of condition indicators. A condition indicator that is subject to such varying operating conditions as load is unable to provide precise condition information of the monitored object for making optimal operational maintenance decisions even if the maintenance program is established within a rigorous theoretical framework. For this reason, the performance of condition monitoring techniques applied to rotating machinery under varying load conditions has been a long-term concern and has attracted intensive research interest. Part I of this study proposed a novel technique based on adaptive autoregressive modeling and hypothesis tests. The method is able to automatically search for the optimal time-series model order and establish a compromised autoregressive model fitting based on the healthy gear motion residual signals under varying load conditions. The condition of the monitored gearbox is numerically represented by a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. Part II of this study is devoted to applications of the proposed technique to entire lifetime condition detection of three gearboxes with distinct physical specifications, distinct load conditions, and distinct failure modes. A comprehensive and thorough comparative study is conducted between the proposed technique and several counterparts. The detection technique is further enhanced by a proposed method to automatically identify and generate fault alerts with the aid of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and thus requires no supervision from maintenance personnel. Experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed technique applied to automatic identification and generation of fault alerts also features two highly desirable properties, i.e. few false alerts and early alert for incipient faults. Furthermore, it is found that the proposed technique is able to identify two types of abnormalities, i.e. strong ghost components abruptly appearing in and disturbing the nominal operating process and the breakage of gear teeth, whereas conventional condition indicators are usually not capable of detecting the presence of the former.

J	Yang, JY; Zhang, YY; Zhu, YS				Yang, Junyan; Zhang, Youyun; Zhu, Yongsheng			Intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearing based on SVMs and fractal dimension	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fractal dimension; support vector machines; time domain statistical feature; feature extraction; fault diagnosis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	The development of non-linear dynamic theory brought a new method for recognising and predicting the complex nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Fractal dimension can quantitatively describe the non-linear behaviour of vibration signal. In the present paper, the capacity dimension, information dimension and correlation dimension are applied to classify various fault types and evaluate various fault conditions of rolling element bearing, and the classification performance of each fractal dimension and their combinations are evaluated by using SVMs. Experiments on 10 fault data sets showed that the classification performance of the single fractal dimension is quite poor on most data sets, and for a given data set, each fractal dimension exhibited different classification ability, this indicates that various fractal dimensions contain various fault information. Experiments on different combinations of the fractal dimensions demonstrated that the combination of all these three fractal dimensions gets the highest score, but the classification performance is still poor on some data sets. In order to improve the classification performance of the SVM further, I I time-domain statistical features are introduced to train the SVM together with three fractal dimensions, and the classification performance of the SVM is improved significantly. At the same time, experimental results showed that the classification performance of the SVM trained with I I time-domain statistical features in tandem with three fractal dimensions outperforms that of the SVM trained only with I I time-domain statistical features or with three fractal dimensions.

The signs are very small when the fault is at an early stage. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is often utilised to detect these signs, but it is very difficult to detect minute signs. In this paper, harmonic wavelet transform is utilised to detect the minute signs of small faults in a monitored signal. The monitored signal of a machine element, in ordinary operation, is regarded as periodic or quasi-periodic. It is important for the effectual detection of the minute signs to reduce the obstructive noise and the end effects in the signal. The end effect is a peculiar phenomenon to wavelet transform and hampers effective detection. Useful methods to reduce the obstructive noise and the end effects are devised herein by the authors. Even if no visible information pertaining to a fault appears in the monitored waveform, the present method is able to detect a minute sign of a small fault. It is demonstrated that the present method is capable of detecting minute signs arising from slight collisions caused by a loose coupling and a fatigue crack. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sugumaran, V; Ramachandran, KI				Sugumaran, V.; Ramachandran, K. I.			Automatic rule learning using decision tree for fuzzy classifier in fault diagnosis of roller bearing	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						feature selection; decision tree; roller bearing; rule learning; fuzzy; fault detection	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS	Roller bearing is one of the most widely used elements in rotary machines. Condition monitoring of such elements is conceived as pattern recognition problem. Pattern recognition has two main phases: feature extraction and feature classification. Statistical features like minimum value, standard error and kurtosis, etc. are widely used as features in fault diagnostics. These features are extracted from vibration signals. A rule set is formed from the extracted features and input to a fuzzy classifier. The rule set necessary for building the fuzzy classifier is obtained largely by intuition and domain knowledge. This paper presents the use of decision tree to generate the rules automatically from the feature set. The vibration signal from a piezo-electric transducer is captured for the following conditions-good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race fault. The statistical features are extracted and good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing are selected using decision tree. The rule set for fuzzy classifier is obtained once again by using the decision tree. A fuzzy classifier is built and tested with representative data. The results are found to be encouraging.

J	Dong, M; He, D				Dong, Ming; He, David			A segmental hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM)-based diagnostics and prognostics framework and methodology	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						hidden semi-Markov model; diagnostics; prognostics; integrated framework; state duration modelling; state-changing point		Diagnostics and prognostics are two important aspects in a condition-based maintenance (CBM) program. However, these two tasks are often separately performed. For example, data might be collected and analysed separately for diagnosis and prognosis. This practice increases the cost and reduces the efficiency of CBM and may affect the accuracy of the diagnostic and prognostic results. In this paper, a statistical modelling methodology for performing both diagnosis and prognosis in a unified framework is presented. The methodology is developed based on segmental hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs). An HSMM is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with temporal structures. Unlike HMM, an HSMM does not follow the unrealistic Markov chain assumption and therefore provides more powerful modelling and analysis capability for real problems. In addition, an HSMM allows modelling the time duration of the hidden states and therefore is capable of prognosis. To facilitate the computation in the proposed HSMM-based diagnostics and prognostics, new forward-backward variables are defined and a modified forward-backward algorithm is developed. The existing state duration estimation methods are inefficient because they require a huge storage and computational load. Therefore, a new approach is proposed for training HSMMs in which state duration probabilities are estimated on the lattice (or trellis) of observations and states. The model parameters are estimated through the modified forward-backward training algorithm. The estimated state duration probability distributions combined with state-changing point detection can be used to predict the useful remaining life of a system. The evaluation of the proposed methodology was carried out through a real world application: health monitoring of hydraulic pumps. In the tests, the recognition rates for all states are greater than 96%. For each individual pump, the recognition rate is increased by 29.3% in comparison with HMMs. Because of the temporal structures, the same HSMMs can be used to predict the remaining-useful-life (RUL) of the pumps.

J	Lei, Y; He, Z; Zi, Y; Hu, Q				Lei, Yaguo; He, Zhengjia; Zi, Yanyang; Hu, Qiao			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on multiple ANFIS combination with GAS	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						empirical mode decomposition; feature extraction; feature selection; improved distance evaluation technique; multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system combination; fault diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FUZZY INFERENCE; CLASSIFIER; MAP	This paper presents a novel method for fault diagnosis based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), an improved distance evaluation technique and the combination of multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs). The method consists of three stages. First, prior to feature extraction, some preprocessing techniques, like filtration, demodulation and EMD are performed on vibration signals to acquire more fault characteristic information. Then, six feature sets, including time- and frequency-domain statistical features of both the raw and preprocessed signals, are extracted. Second, an improved distance evaluation technique is proposed, and with it, six salient feature sets are selected from the six original feature sets, respectively. Finally, the six salient feature sets are input into the multiple ANFIS combination with genetic algorithms (GAs) to identify different abnormal cases. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, and testing results show that the multiple ANFIS combination can reliably recognise different fault categories and severities, which has a better classification performance compared to the individual classifiers based on ANFIS. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method based on the improved distance evaluation technique is also demonstrated by the testing results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Choi, YC; Kim, YH				Choi, Young-Chul; Kim, Yang-Hann			Near field impulsive source localization in a noisy environment	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							FAULT-DETECTION; MOVING WINDOW; SPECTRUM; BEARING; FAMILY	When a machine has faults in its rotating parts, it normally generates a periodic vibration or acoustic signals. These signals are often periodic but impulsive. This paper addresses the way in which we can find out where the impulsive sources are. We propose a signal processing method that can identify an impulsive sources' location. The method is robust with respect to noise; a spatially distributed noise. Numerical simulation and experiments are performed to verify the method. Results show that the proposed technique is quite powerful for localizing the sources in noisy environments. The method also required less microphones than the conventional beamforming method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Online tracking of bearing wear using wavelet packet decomposition and probabilistic modeling: A method for bearing prognostics	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; VIBRATION SIGNALS; LOCALIZED DEFECTS; FAULT-DETECTION; DIAGNOSIS	Bearings are common and vital elements in rotating machinery. By tracking the condition of a bearing, unscheduled machinery outages and costly damage caused by a bearing failure can be avoided. In this paper, we developed a new scheme based on wavelet packet decomposition and hidden Markov modeling (HMM) for tracking the severity of bearing faults. In this scheme, vibration signals were decomposed into wavelet packets and the node energies of the decomposition tree were used as features. Based on the features extracted from normal bearing vibration signals, an HMM was trained to model the normal beating operating condition. The probabilities of this HMM were then used to track the condition of the bearing. Experimental data collected from a bearing accelerated life test showed that unlike many of the other commonly used trend parameters whose distinguishing features diminished to normal bearing-like levels as the damage grew, the probabilities of the normal bearing HMM kept decreasing as the bearing damage progressed toward bearing failure. As the bearing approached the end of its life (10% of remaining life), the HMM probabilities dropped dramatically signaling severe damage and imminent bearing failure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sanz, J; Perera, R; Huerta, C				Sanz, Javier; Perera, Ricardo; Huerta, Consuelo			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on auto-associative neural networks and wavelet transforms	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DAMAGE DETECTION; CRACK IDENTIFICATION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; BEAM	This paper presents a new technique for monitoring the condition of rotating machinery from vibration analyses. The proposed method combines the capability of wavelet transform (WT) to treat transient signals with the ability of auto-associative neural networks to extract features of data sets in an unsupervised mode. Trained and configured networks with WT coefficients of nonfaulty signals, are used as a method to detect the novelties or anomalies of faulty signals. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using the numerical data and experimental vibration data of a gearbox. Despite the fact that noise is present in both cases, results demonstrated that the proposed method is a good candidate to be used as an online diagnosis tool for rotating machinery.

Influence of magnetic saturation upon performance of induction motor using time stepping finite element method	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						induction motor; transient operation; steady-state performance	SPACE MODELING ENVIRONMENT; TRANSIENT ANALYSIS; ABC FRAME; MACHINE; ROTOR; COMPUTATION; CIRCUITS; DRIVES	In this article, influence of magnetic saturation upon steady-state and transient performance of a voltage-fed induction motor is studied using time stepping finite element method (TSFEM). In the design and fault diagnosis, precise computation and analysis of signals and variables are necessary. On the other hand, many analytical and lumped parameters based model methods ignore the magnetic saturation. The results of TSFEM application are compared with those obtained by the winding function method, lumped parameters model based methods and experiments. These comparisons show a very good agreement between the TSFEM application and test results, while there are large differences between the results of applications of the other methods and the test results.

J	Dong, M; He, D				Dong, Ming; He, David			Hidden semi-Markov model-based methodology for multi-sensor equipment health diagnosis and prognosis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						hidden semi-Markov model; diagnosis; prognosis; equipment health; sensor fusion	SENSOR FUSION; OPERATIONS; TUTORIAL; SYSTEM	This paper presents an integrated platform for multi-sensor equipment diagnosis and prognosis. This integrated framework is based on hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). Unlike a state in a standard hidden Markov model (HMM), a state in an HSMM generates a segment of observations, as opposed to a single observation in the HMM. Therefore, HSMM structure has a temporal component compared to HMM. In this framework, states of HSMMs are used to represent the health status of a component. The duration of a health state is modeled by an explicit Gaussian probability function. The model parameters (i.e., initial state distribution, state transition probability matrix, observation probability matrix, and health-state duration probability distribution) are estimated through a modified forward-backward training algorithm. The re-estimation formulae for model parameters are derived. The trained HSMMs can be used to diagnose the health status of a component. Through parameter estimation of the health-state duration probability distribution and the proposed backward recursive equations, one can predict the useful remaining life of the component. To determine the "value" of each sensor information, discriminant function analysis is employed to adjust the weight or importance assigned to a sensor. Therefore, sensor fusion becomes possible in this HSMM based framework. The validation of the proposed framework and methodology are carried out in real world applications: monitoring hydraulic pumps from Caterpillar Inc. The results show that the increase of correct diagnostic rate is indeed very promising. Furthermore, the equipment prognosis can be implemented in the same integrated framework.

J	Choi, YC; Kim, YH				Choi, Young-Chul; Kim, Yang-Hann			Fault detection in a ball bearing system using minimum variance cepstrum	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fault detection; minimum variance cepstrum; bearing fault; impulse signal; noisy environment	MOVING WINDOW; SPECTRUM; FAMILY	The signals that can be obtained from rotating machines convey information on a machine operating condition. For example, if the machine has faults, it generates a signal that is usually composed of pulse signals. This paper addresses the way in which we can find the faults for periodic pulse signals. Specifically, we have an interest in the case that it is embedded in noise. How well we can detect the fault signal in noise directly determines the quality of fault diagnosis of rotating machines. We propose a signal processing method to detect fault signals in noisy environments. The proposed method is 'minimum variance cepstrum' because it minimizes the variance of the signal power in its cepstrum representation. To test the performance of this technique, various experiments have been performed for ball bearing elements that have man-made faults. Results show that the proposed technique is quite powerful in the detection of faults in noisy environments. In other words, it is possible to detect faults earlier than with conventional methods ( McFadden and Smith 1984 J. Sound Vib. 96 69-82, Ho and Randall 1999 6th Int.

J	Li, L; Qu, LS; Liao, XH				Li, Li; Qu, Liangsheng; Liao, Xianghui			Haar wavelet for machine fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						machine fault diagnosis; continuous wavelet transform (CWT); Haar wavelet; time-scale periodicity; frequency characteristic	TRANSFORM	Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is a kind of time-frequency analysis method commonly used in machine fault diaanosis. Unlike Fourier transform, the wavelet in CWT can be selected flexibly. In engineering application, there is a problem of how to select a suitable wavelet. At present, the selecting method mainly depends on the waveform similarity between the signal required to extract and the wavelet. This method is imperfect. For example, Haar wavelet possesses the rectaneular waveform in its supporting field and dissimilarity to any component in the machine signal. It is rarely used in machine diagnosis. However, the time-frequency periodicity of Haar wavelet continuous wavelet transform (HCWT) should be useful in revealing the features in signals. In addition, Haar wavelets under different scales have good low-pass filter characteristic in frequency domain, particularly under larger scales, and that can allow HCWT to detect the lower frequency signal. These merits are presented in this paper and applied to diagnose three types of machine faults. Furthermore, in order to verify the effect of Haar wavelet, the diagnosis information obtained by HCWT is compared with that by Morlet wavelet continuous wavelet transform (MCWT), which is popular in machine diagnosis. The results demonstrate that Haar wavelet is also a feasible wavelet in machine fault diagnosis and HCWT can provide abundant graphic features for diagnosis than MCWT. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yuan, SF; Chu, FL				Yuan, Sheng-Fa; Chu, Fu-Lei			Fault diagnostics based on particle swarm optimisation and support vector machines	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ALGORITHM	In the fault diagnosis based on support vector machines (SVM), irrelevant variables in the fault samples spoil the performance of the SVM classifier and reduce the recognition accuracy. On the other hand, some SVM parameters are usually selected artificially, which hampers the efficiency of the SVM algorithm in practical applications. A new method that jointly optimises the feature selection and the SVM parameters with a modified discrete particle swarm optimisation is presented in this paper. A correct ratio based on a new evaluation method is used to estimate the performance of the SVM, and serves as the target function in the optimisation problem. A hybrid vector that describes both the fault features and the SVM parameters is taken as the constraint condition. This new method can select the best fault features in a shorter time, and improves the performance of the SVM classifier, and has fewer errors and a better real-time capacity than the method based on principal component analysis (PCA) and SVM, or the method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and SVM, as shown in the application of fault diagnosis of the turbo pump rotor.

The multimedia tools have been developed to support the design implementation and maintenance of a component-based control system for manufacturing machines. Scenario testing has been adopted to assess the possible benefits associated with the use of multimedia tools. It has been found that the multimedia tools are effective in improving the diagnostic capability of the maintenance provider in terms of acquiring better information and reducing the time taken to diagnose the problems. However, there are security, human resource restructuring, maintenance agreement, and training issues associated with the service that must be appreciated prior to large-scale adoption of the technology.

In here, we proposed a novel treatment strategy of pancreatic cancer by injuring limited angiogenic vessels with liposome containing adriamycin. At first, we established an orthotopic tumor model, which has a hypovascular characteristic of pancreatic tumor. In this model, we obtained the enhanced therapeutic efficacy with liposome that modified by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a peptide, Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly (APRPG), having an affinity to neovessels. Histochemical analysis suggested the degradation of angiogenic vessels after treatment with APRPG-PEG-liposomal adriamycin. In addition, we observed colocalization of fluorescence-labeled APRPG-PEG-liposome with angiogenic endothelial cells, although the biodistribution of H-3-labeled liposome did not show the difference in the amount of accumulation between PEG-modified liposome and APRPG-PEG-i-nodified liposome.

The method incorporates an efficient parameter tuning procedure (based on minimization of radius/margin bound for SVM's leave-one-out errors) into a multi-class classification strategy using a fuzzy decision factor, which is named fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM). The datasets generated from the Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) simulator were used to evaluate the classification performance. To decrease the negative influence of the auto-correlated and irrelevant variables, a key variable identification procedure using recursive feature elimination, based on the SVM is implemented, with time lags incorporated, before every classifier is trained, and the number of relatively important variables to every classifier is basically determined by 10-fold cross-validation. Performance comparisons are implemented among several kinds of multi-class decision machines, by which the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved.

Failure to satisfy customer requirements implies operational weaknesses in a company. These weaknesses will damage both the rights of customers and the reputation of the company. The traditional method of handling customer requirement for a machine tool manufacturer was dominated by manual process and subjective decision. In this study, we improved the operation process of handling customer requirement. The framework of a customer requirement information system (CRIS) for machine tool manufacturers was then analyzed, integrating rule-based. fuzzy inference and expert systems, and a prototype system developed. The CRIS supports both customers and service personnel in providing a systematic way of fulfilling and analyzing customer requirements. The system was installed and operated in a machine tool manufacturer and the performance was found promising. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a linear model is developed to describe the dimensional variation propagation of machining processes through kinematic analysis of the relationships among fixture error, datum error, machine geometric error, and the dimensional quality of the product. The developed modeling technique can handle general fixture layouts rather than being limited to a 3-2-1 layout case. The dimensional error accumulation and transformation within the multistage process are quantitatively described in this model. A systematic procedure to build the model is presented and validated. This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complex machining processes.

J	Venugopal, S; Wagstaff, RA; Shartna, JP				Venugopal, Suresh; Wagstaff, Ronald A.; Sharma, J. P.			Exploiting phase fluctuations to improve machine performance monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						aligned phase angle; bearing diagnostics; machine monitoring; phase fluctuations	TIME-FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROTATING MACHINERY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ALGORITHM	Machines are an integral and important part of modern life. Machine condition monitoring is of vital importance to modern industry in its quest for higher reliability, quality, and efficiency. A new signal-processing technique for machine performance monitoring is presented. This new technique exploits fluctuations in phase angles of machine rotational frequency signals to determine their dynamic temporal coherence. Temporal coherence is the key to automatically identify a fault condition and assess its severity. The exploitation of temporal coherence also provides increased spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Tests were conducted on an edger trimmer ball bearing assembly that was subjected to different levels of fault conditions, such as a hairline crack on the outer race and sand contamination in the bearing. An electric fan motor with bearing faults was also tested. The fault identification capabilities of incoherent power averaging are compared with those of the new coherence processors. Some rotational signals could not be identified in the average power spectra and, therefore, the average power could not be used for monitoring these signals. However, they were easily identified in the spectra of the new processors, with their increased SNR gain, and were used successfully for machine performance monitoring and diagnostics. This new processing capability for quantifying and exploiting the dynamic temporal coherences of a machine's signals provides a valuable capability for detecting existing and developing faults, and for monitoring their progress. This is also true during the startup and shutdown phases of machines, when their speeds and corresponding rotational frequencies are changing.

These studies are performed by using the model to compute healthy case, one-broken-bar fault, and two adjacent broken bars fault performance data, which contains stator starting current waveforms, the current density on the bars, the magnetic force distribution on the rotor bars, and the distribution of magnetic field. Meanwhile, the iron core loss distributions on the rotor tooth adjacent to broken bars are computed, and the harmonic component of air-gap flux density is analyzed. From this data, the faulty signatures are extracted. Theoretical approach together with experimental results derived from a two-pole 1.1 kW induction motor confirms the validity of the proposed method. Furthermore, this method, which could help to develop diagnostics of broken bars and performance evaluation of induction motors, has great potential in future applications.

Internal short circuit fault diagnosis for PM machines using FE-based phase variable model and wavelets analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Biennial IEEE Conference on Electromagnetic Field computation	APR 30-MAY 03, 2006	Miami, FL	IEEE		fault diagnosis; (FE) finite-element computation; internal short circuit fault; phase variable model; permanent magnet (PM) machine; wavelet analysis		This paper presents a procedure using the finite-element (FE)-based phase variable model combined with wavelet analysis to facilitate the fault diagnostic study for permanent magnet machines with internal short circuit faults. Our efforts are dedicated to the aspects of fault modeling and fault extraction. The FE-based phase variable model is developed to describe the PM machine with internal short circuit faults. This model is built with the parameters [inductances and back Electromotive Force (EMF)] obtained from FE computations of the machine with the same type of fault. The developed model has two features. It includes the detailed information of the fault including the location of the shorted turns and the number of turns involved. It keeps the accuracy of the FE model by taking only a fraction of time needed by FE operation. This is particularly desired for diagnosing faults in machines connected to a control circuit. The wavelet transform is used to perform machine current/voltage signature analysis. Excellent results were obtained providing information that would not be otherwise available except by measurement.

Hence the condition monitoring of a such systems ought to have some possibility of resealing of observed symptoms to a standard load condition. This paper shows such a possibility of a symptoms rescaling in application to multidimensional vibration condition monitoring. It is shown on some real example of vibration condition monitoring, that resealing of symptoms can make more reliable the assessment of current system condition, as well as its prognosis.

J	Zhang, L; Nandi, AK				Zhang, Liang; Nandi, Asoke K.			Fault classification using genetic programming	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						genetic programming; condition monitoring; multi-class classification; fault classification; roller bearing	ALGORITHMS; MACHINERY; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	Genetic programming (GP) is a stochastic process for automatically generating computer programs. In this paper, three GP-based approaches for solving multi-class classification problems in roller bearing fault detection are proposed. Single-GP maps all the classes onto the one-dimensional GP output. Indtpendent-GPs singles out each class separately by evolving a binary GP for each class independently. Bundled-GPs also has one binary GP for each class, but these GPs are evolved together with the aim of selecting as few features as possible. The classification results and the features each algorithm has selected are compared with genetic algorithm (GA) based approaches GA/ANN and GA/SVM. Experiments show that bundled-GPs is strong in feature selection while retaining high performance, which equals or outperforms the two previous GA-based approaches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sun, WX; Chen, J; Li, JQ				Sun, Weixiang; Chen, Jin; Li, Jiaqing			Decision tree and PCA-based fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; decision tree; C4.5; data mining; principal component analysis	SYSTEM	After analysing the flaws of conventional fault diagnosis methods, data mining technology is introduced to fault diagnosis field, and a new method based on C4.5 decision tree and principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed. In this method, PCA is used to reduce features after data collection, preprocessing and feature extraction. Then, C4.5 is trained by using the samples to generate a decision tree model with diagnosis knowledge. At last the tree model is used to make diagnosis analysis. To validate the method proposed, six kinds of running states (normal or without any defect, unbalance, rotor radial rub, oil whirl, shaft crack and a simultaneous state of unbalance and radial rub), are simulated on Bently Rotor Kit RK4 to test C4.5 and PCA-based method and back-propagation neural network (BPNN). The result shows that C4.5 and PCA-based diagnosis method has higher accuracy and needs less training time than BPNN. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yuan, SF; Chu, FL				Yuan, Shengfa; Chu, Fulei			Fault diagnosis based on support vector machines with parameter optimisation by artificial immunisation algorithm	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMMUNE-SYSTEM	Support vector machines (SVM) is a new general machine-learning tool based on the structural risk minimisation principle that exhibits good generalisation when fault samples are few, it is especially fit for classification, forecasting and estimation in small-sample cases such as fault diagnosis, but some parameters in SVM are selected by man's experience, this has hampered its efficiency in practical application. Artificial immunisation algorithm (AIA) is used to optimise the parameters in SVM in this paper. The AIA is a new optimisation method based on the biologic immune principle of human being and other living beings. It can effectively avoid the premature convergence and guarantees the variety of solution. With the parameters optimised by AIA, the total capability of the SVM classifier is improved. The fault diagnosis of turbo pump rotor shows that the SVM optimised by AIA can give higher recognition accuracy than the normal SVM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cyclin E expression negatively affects lung cancer prognosis. Its role in lung carcinogenesis was explored. Retroviral cyclin E transduction promoted pulmonary epithelial cell growth, and small interfering RNA targeting of cyclin E repressed this growth. Murine transgenic lines were engineered to mimic aberrant cyclin E expression in the lung. Wild-type and proteasome degradation-resistant human cyclin E transgenic lines were independently driven by the human surfactant C (SP-C) promoter. Chromosome instability (CIN), pulmonary dysplasia, sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activation, adenocarcinomas, and metastases occurred. Notably, high expression of degradation-resistant cyclin E frequently caused dysplasia and multiple lung adenocarcinomas. Thus, recapitulation of aberrant cyclin E expression as seen in human premalignant and malignant lung lesions reproduces in the mouse frequent features of lung carcinogenesis, including CIN, Shh pathway activation, dysplasia, single or multiple lung cancers, or presence of metastases. This article reports unique mouse lung cancer models that replicate many carcinogenic changes found in patients. These models provide insights into the carcinogenesis process and implicate cyclin E as a therapeutic target in the lung.

A hybrid neural network model for rule generation and its application to process fault detection and diagnosis	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						fault detection and diagnosis; neural networks; rule extraction; fuzzy ARTMAP; rectangular basis function network	FUZZY ARTMAP; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; CIRCUIT-BREAKERS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; RECOGNITION; PATTERNS; TRANSFORMERS; ARCHITECTURE; METHODOLOGY; MACHINE	In this paper, a hybrid neural network model, based on the integration of fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and the rectangular basis function network (RecBFN), which is capable of learning and revealing fuzzy rules is proposed. The hybrid network is able to classify data samples incrementally and, at the same time, to extract rules directly from the network weights for justifying its predictions. With regards to process systems engineering, the proposed network is applied to a fault detection and diagnosis task in a power generation station. Specifically, the efficiency of the network in monitoring the operating conditions of a circulating water (CW) system is evaluated by using a set of real sensor measurements collected from the power station. The rules extracted are analyzed, discussed, and compared with those from a rule extraction method of FAM. From the comparison results, it is observed that the proposed network is able to extract more meaningful rules with a lower degree of rule redundancy and higher interpretability within the neural network framework. The extracted rules are also in agreement with experts' opinions for maintaining the CW system in the power generation plant. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, XD; Wu, Q; Nandi, S				Li, Xiaodong; Wu, Qing; Nandi, Subhasis			Performance analysis of a three-phase induction machine with inclined static eccentricity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference	MAY 15-18, 2005	San Antonio, TX	IEEE		inclined static eccentricity (SE); induction motor	AIR-GAP ECCENTRICITY; DYNAMIC SIMULATION; ROTOR SLOT; MOTORS; COMBINATION; FAULTS	Fault diagnosis is gaining more attention for electric machines running critical loads, whose sudden breakdown can result in unpredictable revenue losses. Consequently, the motor drive systems with fault diagnostic and prediction features are of great concern and are becoming almost indispensable. Among all kinds of common faults, quite a few have relationship with unequal air gap. So far, work on detection of eccentricity-related faults in induction and synchronous machines has been well documented. However, a few are reported on faults resulting from axial nonuniform air gap. This paper investigates the performance of a three-phase induction machine with nonuniform static eccentricity (SE) along axial direction or inclined SE. A variant of modified winding function approach is applied to study this fault. The relationship between the number of rotor bars and poles, and the existence of fault-related current harmonics is discussed. It is shown that inclined eccentricity also demonstrates similar characteristics such as circumferential nonuniform air gap (SE). More importantly, it has been proved conclusively that inclined eccentricity symmetric to the midpoint of the machine shaft cannot be recognized from the current spectrum and would therefore require some other form of detection. Finite-element results to verify the inductance values used in simulation are also presented. The analysis is supplemented by the stator current spectra obtained from simulated results for different load and fault conditions. Finally, a four-pole 45-rotor-bar 2-kW induction motor is used to validate the theoretical and simulation results experimentally. Both current as well as vibration spectra are presented.

J	Li, ZG; Zhou, SY; Ding, Y				Li, Zhiguo; Zhou, Shiyu; Ding, Yu			Pattern matching for variation-source identification in manufacturing processes in the presence of unstructured noise	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						statistical pattern matching; statistical testing; unstructured noise; variation source identification	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DIAGNOSABILITY	Variation-source identification has received considerable attention from the manufacturing quality improvement community. One widely used method is based on a pattern matching procedure, which identifies process faults by comparing the fault symptom, which is the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the quality measurement, with fault signatures. The presence of unstructured noise as well as the uncertainty due to sampling will cause the direction of the fault symptom to deviate from the corresponding fault signature. The influences of these two effects on pattern matching procedures have previously been studied separately, by assuming either the absence of unstructured noise or the availability of large samples. This paper developes a robust pattern matching procedure that considers both effects simultaneously. Using a machining process as an illustrative example, the paper demonstrates that previous pattern matching procedures can have a remarkably low identification capability when the assumptions are not strictly satisfied. By contrast, our proposed method is more robust, maintaining a good identification probability, and would be a preferable tool for root-cause identification in manufacturing quality improvement.

Tool wear detection and fault diagnosis based on cutting force monitoring	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						fault detection; linear model; milling center; observer; tool wear	ADAPTIVE-OBSERVER; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION	In metal cutting processes, an effective monitoring system, which depends on a suitably developed scheme or set of algorithms can maintain machine tools in good condition and delay the occurrence of tool wear. In this paper, an approach is developed for fault detection and diagnosis based on an observer model of an uncertain linear system. A robust observer is designed, using the derived uncertain linear model, to yield the necessary and key information from the system. Subsequently, it is used as a state (tool wear) estimator, and fault detection is carried out by using the observed variables and cutting force. The developed approach is applied to milling machine center. Several linear models are identified based on different working conditions. A dominant model plus uncertain terms is derived from these model set and used as an observer. Threshold values are proposed for detecting the fault of the milling machine. Examples taken from experimental tests shown that the developed approach is effective for the fault detection. The approach can be used for fault detection of failures arising from sensor or actuator malfunction. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, M; Djurdjanovic, D; Ni, J				Zhang, Min; Djurdjanovic, Dragan; Ni, Jun			Diagnosibility and sensitivity analysis for multi-station machining processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						stream of variation; multi-station machining process; diagnosibility; sensitivity	VARIATION PROPAGATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Dimensional variation is a major problem affecting product quality in discrete-part manufacturing. The stream of variation (SoV) methodology has been proposed as one of the systematic approaches to identify the root causes of process variation based on part measurements. This paper presents the results of the diagnosibility and sensitivity analysis study of the SoV methodology in a multistation V8 cylinder head machining process used by a major domestic automotive manufacturer. The SoV model of dimensional machining errors has been derived based on the CAD description of the part and CAPP description of the process. Variation patterns of the final product were assessed based on the measurements of 20 automotive cylinder heads machined under normal process conditions, and the relative contributions of each machining station were assessed. In addition, one faulty product was observed and SoV model was used to identify the machining station that caused this quality problem. A station-level error decomposition method has been introduced and the SoV model correctly identified the culprit station. Furthermore, the sensitivities of dimensional features of the cylinder head to departures in fixture parameters away from their nominal values are evaluated based on the SoV model. Finally, four major issues arising from this implementation study of SoV in industry have been identified. Those are: non-diagnosibility of available measurements, vectorial representation of features, random sampling of parts at inspection and inadequate level of details in modeling of the process faults.

J	Abu-Mahfouz, IA				Abu-Mahfouz, Issam A.			Gearbox Health Monitoring Experiment Using Vibration Signals	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							TIME-FREQUENCY	Machine deterioration prognosis is one of the most important considerations to reduce the cost of maintenance. This experiment demonstrates the processing of vibration signals for gear fault detection. An artificial defect was introduced to the gearbox as a full tooth breakage (missing tooth). Vibration signals were collected for run-up operation and at some fixed speeds. The kurtosis statistical parameter was used as a measure of impact severity in the time domain of the vibration signal. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) and the wavelet analysis (two widely applied techniques for machine health monitoring) were also used for spur gear fault detection. The kurtosis was found to be higher for the case of faulty gears. Also, the experiment demonstrated that both FFT and wavelet techniques were very sensitive to gear faults and imperfections.

J	Haggag, S; Rosa, A; Huang, K; Cetinkunt, S				Haggag, Salem; Rosa, Aristoteles; Huang, Kevin; Cetinkunt, Sabri			Fault tolerant real time control system for steer-by-wire electro-hydraulic systems	MECHATRONICS			English	Article								A steer-by-wire (SBW) control system is presented with emphasis on safety issues. The applications are in articulated vehicles such as the wheel type loaders, articulated trucks, and others. The electro-hydraulic (EH) power circuit is controlled by two embedded electronic control modules (ECM), the primary ECM and backup ECM. The two ECMs monitor each others condition. If one detects fault in the other, it takes over the control functions. There are two main control algorithms that run in the ECMs in real-time: the steering valve control algorithm and the failure detection algorithm. The valve control algorithm basically generates command signal to the steering valve based on operator steering column signal as well as other machine condition sensors. The failure detection algorithm implements a fault detection logic for both input sensors and output drivers, and flags the corresponding warning for to the operator, and take a predefined action depending on the type of the failure detected. A unique fault strategy organization is implemented by inspecting the failure behavior on both the component and the system levels. The failure detection algorithm also deter-mines the most likely "good" sensor signal from a set of redundant sensors for each critical measurement. Based on these good sensors data, the steering control algorithm sends two output signals: the control signal to the steering EH circuit valve and the control signal to the steering wheel force feedback device (i.e. a brake or a motor) to give operator feedback about the steering conditions. Finite state machine (FSM) concept is used to design the fault handling algorithms for both the component level and the system level failure. The probability of the system being at normal steering state or at any other steering failure state is determined. Failure mode probabilities of steering system components are also determined.

J	Guo, Q; Hierons, RA; Harman, M; Derderian, K				Guo, Qiang; Hierons, Robert A.; Harman, Mark; Derderian, Karnig			Heuristics for fault diagnosis when testing from finite state machines	SOFTWARE TESTING VERIFICATION & RELIABILITY			English	Article						finite state machines; conformance testing; fault diagnosis; symptom; candidates; conflict sets; minimization	GENERATION; SEQUENCES	When testing from finite state machines, a failure observed in the implementation under test (IUT) is called a symptom. A symptom could have been caused by an earlier state transfer failure. Transitions that may be used to explain the observed symptoms are called diagnosing candidates. Finding strategies to generate an optimal set of diagnosing candidates that could effectively identify faults in the IUT is of great value in reducing the cost of system development and testing. This paper investigates fault diagnosis when testing from finite state machines and proposes heuristics for fault isolation and identification. The proposed heuristics attempt to lead to a symptom being observed in some shorter test sequences, which helps to reduce the cost of fault isolation and identification. The complexity of the proposed method is analysed. A case study is presented, which shows how the proposed approach assists in fault diagnosis. Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Pusey, HC				Pusey, Henry C.			Turbomachinery condition monitoring and failure prognosis	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								This article provides a broad overview of developments and progress in condition monitoring, diagnostics and failure prognosis technology applicable to high performance turbomachines. An assessment is made of current technological capabilities in this critical area. Selected maintenance philosophies, including Condition Based Maintenance, Reliability Centered Maintenance and Profit Centered Maintenance are discussed. Available diagnostic technologies applicable to condition monitoring of turbomachinery are described. Some observations on technological gaps and problems yet to be solved are presented; available information resources and organizations with active related programs are identified. In a 1969 monograph, Loewy(1) stated that the first published work on the dynamics of rotating shafts was by Rankine(2) in 1869. Loewy also said that Gunter(3) pointed out that Rankine's neglect of Coriolis acceleration led to erroneous conclusions which confused engineers for half a century. Loewy suggested in 1969 that confusion still existed, in otherwise knowledgeable circles, about many aspects of rotor dynamics. In his book, he identified more than 550 references on this topic in the open literature; today there are undoubtedly thousands of technical publications relating to the dynamics of rotating machinery. In my view, this is evidence that many difficult problems have been solved over the last three decades. At the same time new breakthroughs continue to advance the technology.				hcp1@comcast.net	Lin, Zhao/C-8319-2011	Lin, Zhao/0000-0002-6131-9723			ADAMS ML, 1994, 4 INT C ROT DYN IFTO; AYANDOKUN K, 1994, P COND MON 94 SWANS; BOND TH, 1995, P VIBR I 19 ANN M VI; CATANIA G, 1994, P COND MON 94 SWANS; DUBOIS TJ, 1994, P MFPG 48 VIBR I; ESHLEMAN RL, 1990, P MFPG 44 VIBR I; GUNTER EJ, 1966, NAS36473 NASA; GUY KR, 1995, TURBINE GENERATOR MO; ISAKSSON JL, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; ISHIDA Y, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; JAKCSON C, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; LEE CW, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; LOUKIS E, 1993, 93GT47 ASME; LOWEY RG, 1969, DYNAMICS ROTATING SH; MECHEFSKE CK, 1994, P COND MON 94 SWANS; MEHERHOMJI CB, 1994, INT J TURBO JET ENG, V11, P99; MITCHELL JS, 1993, INTRO MACHINER ANAL; MITCHELL JS, 1994, P PM TECHNOLOGY, V7; PICCOLI HC, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; PORADA S, 1994, P COND MON 94 SWANS; PUSEY HC, 1995, P 11 BIENN C REL STR; RANDALL RB, 1994, P 4 INT C ROT DYN IF; RANKINE WJ, 1869, ENGINEER, V26; RIEGER NF, 1990, P MFPG 44 VIBR I; ROEMER MJ, 1995, INFORM COMMUNICATION; ROUSH ML, 1995, P MFPT 49 VIBR I; SMITH SF, 1990, P MFPG 44 VIBR I	27	3	3	0	0	ACOUSTICAL PUBL INC	BAY VILLAGE	27101 E OVIATT RD, PO BOX 40416, BAY VILLAGE, OH 44140 USA	1541-0161			SOUND VIB	Sound Vib.

Tool condition monitoring in milling using vibration analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						tool breakage; tool wear; tool vibration; fault detection; scalogram; mean frequency	MOMENTS ANALYSIS; FAULT-DETECTION; WEAR; SIGNALS; FREQUENCY	Monitoring the condition of cutting tools in any machining operation is very important to avoid unexpected machining trouble and improve machining accuracy. This paper presents the use of vibration analysis of the cutting process in milling to indicate the presence and progression of damage incurred by an end mill. The metal cutting experiments were performed on a mild steel workpiece without using any coolant to accelerate damage to cutter, and classical processing schemes in time and frequency domains were applied to the resulting vibrations of cutting process to obtain diagnostic information. Moreover, developing fault features were also illustrated using both scalogram and its mean frequency variation. It has been found that scalogram and its mean frequency are both capable of revealing the features of not only localized, but progressive fault more clearly in the presence of strong noise than conventional time and frequency domain analyses. Furthermore, the global average of the mean frequency variation provides a useful indicator signifying the progression of wear, whereas time domain statistics do not give any consistent trend.

J	Farrar, CR; Worden, K				Farrar, Charles R.; Worden, Keith			An introduction to structural health monitoring	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						structural health monitoring; condition monitoring; non-destructive testing; evalution	OF-THE-ART; DAMAGE IDENTIFICATION; ROTATING MACHINERY; FAULT-DETECTION; VIBRATION	The process of implementing a damage identification strategy for aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering infrastructure is referred to as structural health monitoring ( SHM). Here, damage is defined as changes to the material and/or geometric properties of these systems, including changes to the boundary conditions and system connectivity, which adversely affect the system's performance. A wide variety of highly effective local non-destructive evaluation tools are available for such monitoring. However, the majority of SHM research conducted over the last 30 years has attempted to identify damage in structures on a more global basis. The past 10 years have seen a rapid increase in the amount of research related to SHM as quantified by the significant escalation in papers published on this subject. The increased interest in SHM and its associated potential for significant life-safety and economic benefits has motivated the need for this theme issue. This introduction begins with a brief history of SHM technology development. Recent research has begun to recognize that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of the statistical pattern recognition ( SPR) and a paradigm to address such a problem is described in detail herein as it forms the basis for organization of this theme issue. In the process of providing the historical overview and summarizing the SPR paradigm, the subsequent articles in this theme issue are cited in an effort to show how they fit into this overview of SHM. In conclusion, technical challenges that must be addressed if SHM is to gain wider application are discussed in a general manner.

The first model considered in this paper is a static model trained to detect novel events associated with changes in the vibration spectra recorded from a jet engine. We describe how the distribution of energy across the harmonics of a rotating shaft can be learnt by a support vector machine model of normality. The second model is a dynamic model partially learnt from data using an expectation maximization-based method. This model uses a Kalman filter to fuse performance data in order to characterize normal engine behaviour. Deviations from normal operation are detected using the normalized innovations squared from the Kalman filter.

Damage prognosis: the future of structural health monitoring	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						damage detection; prognosis; life prediction		This paper concludes the theme issue on structural health monitoring ( SHM) by discussing the concept of damage prognosis ( DP). DP attempts to forecast system performance by assessing the current damage state of the system ( i.e. SHM), estimating the future loading environments for that system, and predicting through simulation and past experience the remaining useful life of the system. The successful development of a DP capability will require the further development and integration of many technology areas including both measurement/processing/telemetry hardware and a variety of deterministic and probabilistic predictive modelling capabilities, as well as the ability to quantify the uncertainty in these predictions. The multidisciplinary and challenging nature of the DP problem, its current embryonic state of development, and its tremendous potential for life-safety and economic benefits qualify DP as a 'grand challenge' problem for engineers in the twenty-first century.

The ICA is used for feature extraction and data reduction from original features. The principal components analysis is also applied in feature extraction process for comparison with ICA does. In this paper, the training of the SVMs is carried out using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm and the strategy of multi-class SVMs-based classification is applied to perform the faults identification. Also, the performance of classification process due to the choice of kernel function is presented to show the excellent of characteristic of kernel function. Various scenarios are examined using data sets of vibration and stator current signals from experiments, and the results are compared to get the best performance of classification process.

J	Su, H; Chong, KT				Su, Hua; Chong, Kil To			Induction machine condition monitoring using neural network modeling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						condition monitoring; induction motors; neural networks; vibration signal		Condition monitoring is desirable for increasing machinery availability, reducing consequential damage, and improving operational efficiency. Model-based methods are efficient monitoring systems for providing warning and predicting certain faults at early stages. However, the conventional methods must work with explicit motor models, and cannot be applied effectively for vibration signal diagnosis due to their nonadaptation and the random nature of vibration signal. In this paper, an analytical redundancy method using neural network modeling of the induction motor in vibration spectra is proposed for machine fault detection and diagnosis. The short-time Fourier transform is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals to continuous spectra for the neural network model training. The faults are detected from changes in the expectation of vibration spectra modeling error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results, and it is shown that a robust and automatic induction machine condition monitoring system has been produced.

Adaptive neural fuzzy inference system for the detection of inter-turn insulation and bearing wear faults in induction motor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs); bearing wear; induction motor; winding insulation		The positive features of neural networks and fuzzy logic are combined together for the detection of stator inter-turn insulation and bearing wear faults in single-phase induction motor. The adaptive neural fuzzy inference systems (ANFISs) are developed for the detection of these two faults. These faults are created experimentally on a single-phase induction motor in the laboratory. The experimental data is generated for the five measurable parameters, viz, motor intakes current, speed, winding temperature, bearing temperature, and the noise of the machine. Earlier, the ANFIS fault detectors are trained for the two input parameters, i.e., speed and current, and the performance is tested. Later, the three remaining parameters are added and the five input ANFIS fault detector is trained and tested. It observed from the simulation results that the five input parameter system predicts more accurate results.

Computed order tracking is a fault detection method developed to deal with the varying speed conditions often found in industry and has been proven effective in laboratory conditions. its application to real situations, however, requires some adjustment to deal with issues such as inadequate speed data and the fact that the drag gear rotates in two directions. This provides a unique opportunity to observe the performance of the order tracking method in a bidirectional rotating environment, allowing an investigation of the relationships between the results obtained from each operating direction. A monitoring station was set up aboard the dragline and data was captured twice daily for a period spanning approximately one year. The data captured consisted of accelerometer and proximity sensor data. The key on the shaft triggers the proximity sensors, allowing speed and direction to be measured. The measured speed is interpolated by using various speed interpolation techniques. Then the interpolated speed is used to complete the order tracking procedure that resamples the vibration data with reference to the speed. The results indicate that computed order tracking can be successfully employed in real environments. Furthermore it is shown that the rotation direction that opens the gear-tooth crack gives a better indication of incipient failure. it is therefore important not to disregard either direction when monitoring rotating machinery of this kind.

Through the use of ICA, invariable features embedded in multi-channel vibration measurements made in different operating modes can be extracted. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical model of the time series, and has a strong capability in pattern classification, especially for signals with abundant information quantity, non-stationary natures and poor repeatability and reproducibility. A new approach to fault recognition is proposed in this article, in which ICA is used for feature extraction, and the HMM as a classifier. Fault recognition in the speed-Up and speed-down processes of rotating machinery has been successfully completed. The proposed approach is compared with another recognition approach, in which principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature extraction, and HMM as a classifier, and is shown to be very effective.

Furthermore the proposed approach is applied to machinery fault diagnosis. Firstly, EMD method is used to decompose a multi-component AM-FM signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IFMs). Secondly, the energy operator demodulation method is applied to each IMF and the instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies of a multicomponent AM-FM signal are extracted. Finally, the spectrum analysis is applied to each instantaneous amplitude in order to obtain envelope spectra from which the mechanical fault can be diagnosed. The analysis results show that the energy operator demodulation approach based on EMD can extract the characteristic of machinery fault vibration signals efficiently. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hu, Q; He, ZJ; Zhang, ZS; Zi, YY				Hu, Qiao; He, Zhengjia; Zhang, Zhousuo; Zi, Yanyang			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on improved wavelet package transform and SVMs ensemble	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						improved wavelet package; feature extraction; feature selection; distance evaluation technique; support vector machines ensemble; fault diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SIGNALS	This paper presents a novel method for fault diagnosis based on an improved wavelet package transform (IWPT), a distance evaluation technique and the support vector machines (SVMs) ensemble. The method consists of three stages. Firstly, with investigating the feature of impact fault in vibration signals, a biorthogonal wavelet with impact property is constructed via lifting scheme, and the IWPT is carried out to extract salient frequency-band features from raw vibration signals. Then, the faulty features can be detected by envelope spectrum analysis of wavelet package coefficients of the most salient frequency band. Secondly, with the distance evaluation technique, the optimal features are selected from the statistical characteristics of raw signals and wavelet package coefficients, and the energy characteristics of decomposition frequency band. Finally, the optimal features are input into the SVMs ensemble with AdaBoost algorithm to identify the different abnormal cases. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, and testing results show that the SVMs ensemble can reliably separate different fault conditions and identify the severity of incipient faults, which has a better classification performance compared to the single SVMs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, ZK; Chu, FL; Tse, PW				Peng, Z. K.; Chu, F. L.; Tse, Peter W.			Singularity analysis of the vibration signals by means of wavelet modulus maximal method	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							CORRELATION DIMENSION; SYSTEMS	Machine fault diagnosis is vital for safe services and non-interrupted production. The key issue in fault diagnosis is the pattern recognition. A set of valid features will simplify the classifying operations and enhance the accuracy in diagnosis. In this paper, a novel singularity based fault features is presented. Vibration signals collected under different machine health conditions will show different patterns of singularities that can be measured quantitatively by the Lipschitz exponents. The wavelet transforms modulus maximal (WTMM) method provides a simple but accurate method in calculating the Lipschitz exponents. Therefore, the WTMM based Lipschitz exponent calculation as well as the method to select the appropriate wavelet function for WTMM and its range of scale are introduced. Three parameters about the singularity analysis are recommended. They are the number of Lipschitz exponents per rotation (N) over bar, the mean value mu(alpha) and the relative standard deviation (s) over bar (alpha) of the Lipschitz exponents that are obtained from the extracted features. To verify the usefulness of the proposed methods, simulated signals and vibration signals generated by four types of faults commonly occurred in a rotating machine, including the imbalance, the oil whirl, the coupling misalignment and the rub-impact, had been used for testing purpose. The results show that the signal from the rub-impact possesses the highest singular value and the widest range of singularity. The signal of the coupling misalignment ranked the second. Whilst, the signal of imbalance is more regular or having the smallest singular value and the narrowest range of singularity. The results also prove that the three parameters are excellent fault features for pattern recognition as they can well separate the four fault patterns. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yan, RQ; Gao, RX				Yan, Ruqiang; Gao, Robert X.			Approximate Entropy as a diagnostic tool for machine health monitoring	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Approximate Entropy; machine health monitoring; computational efficiency	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; VIBRATION FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CORRELATION DIMENSION; STATISTICAL MOMENTS; COMPLEXITY MEASURE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; COMPRESSION; PARAMETERS	This paper presents a new approach to machine health monitoring based on the Approximate Entropy (ApEn), which is a statistical measure that quantifies the regularity of a time series, such as vibration signals measured from an electrical motor or a rolling bearing. As the working condition of a machine system deteriorates due to the initiation and/or progression of structural defects, the number of frequency components contained in the vibration signal will increase, resulting in a decrease in its regularity and an increase in its corresponding ApEn value. After introducing the theoretical framework, numerical simulation of an analytic signal is presented that establishes a quantitative relationship between the severity of signal degradation and the ApEn values. The results of the simulation are then verified experimentally, through vibration measurement on a realistic bearing test bed. The study has shown that ApEn can effectively characterise the severity of structural defect, with good computational efficiency and high robustness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Miao, Q; Makis, V				Miao, Qiang; Makis, Viliam			Condition monitoring and classification of rotating machinery using wavelets and hidden Markov models	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						condition monitoring; rotating machinery; wavelet modulus maxima distribution; Lipschitz exponent; condition classification; hidden Markov model (HMM)	SINGULARITY DETECTION; TRANSFORM; TOOL	Condition monitoring and classification of machinery state is of great practical significance in manufacturing industry, because it provides updated information regarding machine status on-line, thus avoiding the production loss and minimising the chances of catastrophic machine failure. In this paper, the condition classification is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) processing information obtained from vibration signals. We present an on-line fault classification system with an adaptive model re-estimation algorithm. The machinery condition is identified by selecting the HMM which maximises the probability of a given observation sequence. The proper selection of the observation sequence is a key step in the development of an HMM-based classification system. In this paper, the classification system is validated using observation sequences based on the wavelet modulus maxima distribution obtained from real vibration signals, which has been proved to be effective in fault detection in previous research.

Feature selection using Decision Tree and classification through Proximal Support Vector Machine for fault diagnostics of roller bearing	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						feature selection; decision tree; roller bearing; statistical features; PSVM; fault detection	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS	Roller bearing is one of the most widely used rotary elements in a rotary machine. The roller bearing's nature of vibration reveals its condition and the features that show the nature, are to be extracted through some indirect means. Statistical parameters like kurtosis, standard deviation, maximum value, etc. form a set of features, which are widely used in fault diagnostics. Often the problem is, finding out good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the bearing. Selection of good features is an important phase in pattern recognition and requires detailed domain knowledge. This paper illustrates the use of a Decision Tree that identifies the best features from a given set of samples for the purpose of classification. It uses Proximal Support Vector Machine (PSVM), which has the capability to efficiently classify the faults using statistical features. The vibration signal from a piezoelectric transducer is captured for the following conditions: good bearing, bearing with inner race fault, bearing with outer race fault, and inner and outer race fault. The statistical features are extracted therefrom and classified successfully using PSVM and SVM. The results of PSVM and SVM are compared. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Machine tool condition monitoring using sweeping filter techniques	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cutting tool monitoring; tool breakage; sweeping filter; e-monitoring	MILLING OPERATIONS; DETECTION SYSTEM; BREAKAGE; WEAR; SIGNAL; BANK; PREDICTION; DESIGN; LIFE	This paper presents an approach to milling process monitoring utilizing sweeping filter frequency analysis techniques. The paper demonstrates how critical information retrieved via the new technique may be used to ascertain the tool condition. This information can be used to suggest remedial actions, to increase the quality of work, and to reduce overall machining costs. The deployed system does not require any additional sensors to be attached to the machine. It consists of three front-end nodes based upon embedded controllers which are linked on a controller area network bus. These nodes acquire and analyse data dynamically from the spindle load, spindle speed, and cutting axis current signals as are typically available on milling machines. These nodes are controlled by a bridge node, which is interfaced to the internet for remote information display. The front-end nodes contain the implementation of the sweeping filter technique. Potential faults from the signature of the acquired signal are identified at this level and can be further verified by the bridge node. The overall system allows dynamic decision making based on a health index measure of the process. The system has the flexibility for any number of required front-end nodes to be deployed depending upon the monitoring requirements.

Integrated decision-support system for diagnosis, maintenance planning, and scheduling of manufacturing systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						decision-support systems; diagnostics; influence diagram; maintenance; scheduling	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM; NETWORK	This paper describes an integrated decision support system to diagnose faults and generate efficient maintenance and production schedules. The proposed integrated system is composed of three modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module, the Maintenance Planning Module, and the Scheduling Module. In the Diagnosis Module, a vector of symptoms is fed into an influence diagram representing the causal relationships of the system. Given an instantiation of the symptom vector, a stochastic sampling algorithm is applied to update the joint-probability distribution associated with the influence diagram and rank the possible causes of the symptoms. The Maintenance Planning Module searches a Look-Up-Table to find maintenance activities to correct the fault.

Bandpass filtering has shown to be an effective de-noising approach. Though simple, this method requires prior knowledge of the dominant resonance frequencies excited by the fault impacts. In this paper an on-line resonance frequency estimation algorithm is presented. This approach exploits the effect of variable shaft rotational speed on the measured vibration and applies a reliable wavelet based instantaneous frequency calculation method to find the proper center frequency for the bandpass filter. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the vibrations measured from a faulty bearing and further validated with the results obtained based on the bearing impact analysis.	[Bozchalooi, I.

In the paper, a reflective fibre optic displacement sensor is firstly introduced for the dynamic measurement of the lubricant film, and then the influence of the reflector shape with regard to the principle property of the reflective fibre optic displacement sensor is deeply analyzed so that the influence of the reflector shape is zero when the curvature radius is much bigger than the diameter of the fibre. So, a fibre optical based dynamic measurement schedule is presented for the lubricant film of slide bearing. At last, by the experimental verification, the results show that the proposed approach for the influence analysis of the reflector shape is correct, and the presented schedule for the fibre optic dynamic measurement of lubricant film about slide bearing is also feasible(1).

In this work, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used because of its proved efficiency dealing with multiclass problems in other technical areas. A Fault Diagnosis System has been developed implementing a multilabel approach using SVM and has been tested addressing a difficult diagnosis problem widely studied in the literature, the Tennessee Eastman process. Successful results have been obtained when diagnosing up to four simultaneous faults. These very first results are very promising since they have been achieved without any data processing or parameter tuning. Furthermore, they have been obtained just using training sets consisting of single faults, thus proving the achievement of a very powerful learning capacity.

The proposed approach has been achieved through both fault masking and fault diagnosis algorithms. Concurrent tesing technique through using triple modular redundancy (TMR) is required to mask the operational faults and specially tolerate the transient faults. For permanenet faults and in parallel with TMR an on-line and non-concurrent fault detection and diagnostic technique is used to locate the faulty elements. The fault detection and diagnostic technique uses a set of assembly programs that test the entire microcontroller instruction-sets called macros. The macros are able to excite all of the microcontroller functions. A macro is associated to each machine-level instruction; and composed of a few instructions, aimed at activating the target instruction with some operand values representing the macro parameters and propagates the results of its execution to an observable memory positions. A Simulation study has been done using Xilinx Foundation tool, VHDL, and an FPGA Vertix chip.

We have designed a system that can be used to monitor the bearing conditions of induction motors. The system called as WiBeaM (Wireless Bearing Monitoring system) forms a network of sensor nodes that sense the vibration on motors and transmit the same to a central base station, this data is further analyzed through signal processing for defect diagnosis. We have used cheap off the shelf components to realise a real world application at a very low cost. Considering the low cost and the ease of deployment, our application is one of its kind in the domain. The solution has been implemented on Moteiv's Tmote-Sky nodes using ADXL 105 accelerometer from Analog devices. The solution includes an application layer, transport layer for reliable data transfer and a MAC protocol for low power consumption. The challenges in the implementation span from the hardware to software. The aim was to select a cheap yet efficient sensor that could be compatible with the sensor node and build a software that can automat the otherwise cumbersome process of bearing monitoring. Whilst developing the application we have found that by proper selection of transmit power of the radio, single hop wireless transmission is more power efficient than the multihop. In sum, we have proved the viability of machinery vibration monitoring with wireless network technology by conducting testbed trials.

Whether in large synchronous generators that are installed in power plants or for distributed generators in wind farms, survivable performance of these electric machines plays a vital role in accomplishing this goal. The worldwide economical impact of achieving a reliable generation is immeasurable. As a result real time monitoring and just-in-time maintenance of synchronous generators deserves due attention. The present paper deals with this outstanding issue. Synchronous generators are subject to a variety of failures which may occur in various parts of their structure. The present paper deals with a class of failures which may happen in the rotor of a turbo-generator. Since the electromechanical conversion of energy is closely related to magnetic response of the machine any alteration of the excitation and geometry will result in detectable changes in stator quantities such as voltage and current. The present paper is based on a detailed Finite element Analysis (FEA) of the electromagnetic response of a two pole synchronous generator under various types of rotor faults. In the first step existence of detectable time-domain signatures have been investigated. Next, uniqueness of these signatures is studied. Accordingly, a systematic method for just-in-time detection and classification of various rotor faults has been developed.	[Kiani, M.; Lee, W.

Robust preprocessing: Denoising and whitening in the context of blind source separation of instantaneous mixtures	2007 5TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics INDIN		English	Proceedings Paper	5th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics	JUN 23-27, 2007	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE		BSS; ICA; fast-ICA; eigenfilters; wavelets; denoising		In this paper the feasibility and performance of two different preprocessing schemes for Blind Source Separation (BSS) problems have been investigated. BSS is a promising technique for non-destructive machine condition monitoring by vibration and acoustic analysis. BSS methods offer non-invasive and inexpensive solution by restoring the specific signature of each machine from a mixture of signals which can be used for monitoring and fault diagnosis. Signals recorded by sensors in an industrial application are often disrupted by ambient noise and other mechanical systems. The presence of noise in the observation poses difficulties in the BSS process. Robust preprocessing involves denoising followed by whitening. Eigenfilters as well as wavelets have been used prior to the traditional Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm to test the separation ability for the instantaneous mixtures of synthetic signals, speech and acoustic noise from electromechanical systems. A comparative assessment with and without the denoising schemes have been presented.

Specifically our approach uses the wavelet packet transform (WPT) to decompose the vibration signals in the wavelet packet space, in order to reveal the transient information in these signals. Faults are efficiently detected by exploiting the mean values of the energy in the detail signals. The wavelet-based approach is also compared with the traditional Fourier-based one. Both analysis and an extensive simulation of the two approaches clearly show the superiority of the WPT-based approach over the Fourier-based one, in efficiently diagnosing faults from vibration signals.

In order to detect and monitor failure precursors and anomalies early in electrical systems, we have developed signal processing capabilities that can detect and map patterns in already existing and available signals to an anomaly measure. Toward this end, the language measure theory based on real analysis, finite state automaton, symbolic dynamics and information theory has been deployed. Application of this theory for electronic circuit failure precursor detection resulted in a robust statistical pattern recognition technique. This technique was observed to be superior to conventional pattern recognition techniques such as neural networks and principal component analysis for anomaly detection because it exploits a common physical fact underling most anomalies which conventional techniques do not. Symbolic dynamic technique resulted in a monotonically increasing smooth anomaly plot which was experimentally repeatable to a remarkable accuracy. For the Van der Pol oscillator circuit board experiment, this lead to consistently accurate predictions for the anomaly parameter and its range.

Specifically, the paper presents a statistical analysis procedure for online estimation of remaining fatigue life in polycrystalline alloys using STSA-based information from an ensemble of fatigue experiments. This real-time information is useful for monitoring the evolving fatigue damage and lire extending control of mechanical structures for prevention of widespread failures. The concept is experimentally validated on 7075-T6 aluminum alloy specimens on a special-purpose fatigue test apparatus that is equipped with ultrasonic flaw detectors and an optical travelling microscope.

New and innovative technologies must be developed and implemented to address these concerns. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) requires that the health of critical components/systems be monitored and diagnositics/prognostic strategies be developed to detect and identify incipient failures and predict the failing component's remaining useful life (RUL). Typically, vibration and other key indicators on-board on aircraft are severely corrupted by noise thus curtailing our ability to accurately diagnose and predict failures. This paper introduces a novel blind deconvolution de-noising scheme that employs vibration model in the frequency domain and attempts to arrive at the true vibration signal through an iterative optimization process. Performance indexes are defined and data from a helicopter are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The transient response during such interaction can be considered as step response of a higher order system with lightly damped modes. The response profile changes throughout the life span of a boring tool. Obtaining a parametric model will be the base for the model-based diagnosis and prognosis for the boring tool. Two basic orthonormal function kernels, Kautz and Laguerre, have been studied. The steepest descent method was applied to search for the pole determination. The least mean square method was used to find the optimal model coefficients. The modeling results showed that Kautz and Laguerre function kernels are viable for modeling the transient response for boring tool vibration.

Early detection and treatment of colon cancer can significantly improve patient prognosis. Manual identification of polyps by radiologists using CT Colonography can be labour intensive due to the increasing size of datasets and is error prone due to the complexity of the anatomical structures. There has been increasing interest in computer aided detection (CAD) systems for detecting polyps using CT Colonography. For a typical CAD system two major steps can be identified. In the first step image processing techniques are used to detect potential polyp candidates. Many non-polyps are inevitably found in this process. The second step attempts to discount the non-polyp candidates while maintaining true polyps. In practice this is a challenging task as training data is heavily imbalanced, that is, non-polyps dominate the data. This paper describes how the weighted support vector machine (weighted-SVM) can be used to tackle the problem effectively. The weighted-SVM generalises the traditional SVM by applying different penalties to different classes. This trains the classifier to give favour to the most weighted class (in this case true polyps). In this paper the method was applied to data obtained from the intermediate results from a CAD system, originally applied to 209 cases. The results show that the weighted-SVM can play an important role in CAD algorithms for colorectal polyps.

The study is based on EEG signals from six full term infants who have suffered from perinatal asphyxia, and the methods have been trained with reference data classified by an experienced electroencephalographer. The results are summarized as area under the curve (AUC) values derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the three methods, and show that the SVM is slightly better than the others, at the cost of a higher computational complexity.

Recently microarray technology emerged and it has the potential to revolutionize the clinical management of cancer and other diseases. A microarray allows to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously which may reflect diagnostic or prognostic categories and sensitivity to treatment. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether clinical data, which is the basis of day-to-day clinical decision support, can be efficiently combined with microarray data, which has yet to prove its potential to deliver patient tailored therapy, using Least Squares Support Vector Machines.

However, due to the inherent drawbacks of the conventional tools, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the changing of motor stator current in the frequency domain along with load variations, optimal trade-off between leakage suppression, resolution and tracking is difficult to fulfil. This paper proposes a novel high-resolution technique for detection of rotor broken bars in induction motors. It is able to outperform FFT in the sense of achieving high frequency resolution while using data samples from a very short window. In order to investigate the impact of broken bars and generate representative signals to test the spectral estimation method, a mathematical model that is able to simulate induction machines with broken bars was developed. In the final sections of this paper we present selection of spectral estimation results obtained by analysing simulated signals.

The current practice in condition monitoring primarily involves using various forms of mobile devices usually with a single sensor input to perform tests at regular intervals. However, such devices and monitoring services are expensive and require an experienced operator for reliable decisions. This paper investigates an alternative low cost solution for continuous condition monitoring of induction machines using multiple sensors, which can be located next to a machine under test and can provide condition information using indicator lights for quick diagnosis. In addition, the paper provides the hardware and software details of the system implemented which are based on an FPGA based (CompactRIO) LabVIEW platform. A number of test results are also provided in the paper to demonstrate its performance under real faults.	[Bakhri, S.; Ertugrul, N.; Soong, W.

Depending on the motor protection, the motor may continue to run but, soon or later, the heating in the shortcircuited turns will cause severe failures. In this paper, the stator inter-turn faults are detected by observing the Concordia patterns and the behavior of the effective current values (RMS). These fault indicators have a specific behavior corresponding to each fault and can be used detect, locate and evaluate faults. Also two strategies are proposed to use multilayer feedforward neural networks (FFNN) in the fault detection, and both strategies are sketched and the best configuration is used. The network output can be interpreted, using a table, as a diagnosis report of the machine health.

The broken rotor bar position has a big impact on the cage induction machine, which was overlooked in the past. Based on the multi-loop method, research has been carried out on the broken rotor bar position and its impact. First the relation between the broken rotor bar position and the fault characteristic in stator current caused by rotor winding fault are quantitatively analyzed in this paper, and the regularity is generalized. Then it is pointed out that for a machine with broken rotor bar fault, when further broken bars occur in some positions, the machine's asymmetry will rise, the impact on operation will be greater, and the fault characteristic of stator current will increase; however, when the further broken bars are in some other positions, the machine's asymmetry will decline, the impact on operation will be less, and the fault characteristic of stator current will decrease. The criterion to judge the fault extent is proposed, which is through the asymmetry of the machine caused by broken rotor bars.

At first, this paper establishes the fundamental machine winding equation for fault analysis and gives the analysis method of rotor broken end-ring fault; then the paper analyzes respectively the change rule of machine inner current under one broken end-ring fault, two broken end-rings fault on the same side of rotor, two broken end-rings fault on the different sides of rotor and under the concurrent fault of broken bar and broken end-ring. The paper points out the severe unsymmetry of the end-ring current on the side of broken end-ring after end-ring breaks and gives current change rule definitely; since the rotor bar current is smaller than it in normal condition, the output power of machine will decrease, and the increases of individual bar current can cause machine torque to fluctuate and to move unsteadily. In addition, this paper gives the value of fault character current component in stator winding after broken end-ring fault.

Different diagnostic techniques are proposed and analyzed with this aim, putting in evidence the advantages and limitations of each one. It is demonstrated that depending on the structure of the control system, some diagnostic techniques may be applicable or not for the diagnosis of this type of fault. The estimated rotor flux and the reference value of the magnetizing current component are the variables which demonstrate higher potential to be used for diagnostic purposes. At the end, the possibility of diagnosing the fault not only when the drive is operating in steady-state but also in transient conditions is investigated.	[Cruz, S. M. A.; Cardoso, A. J.

It is shown that by proper modelling of the induction machine it is possible to detect the effect of the different faults on the machine current and vibrations. This paper proposes a model based on Permeance Network Method (PNM) for the simulation of faulty induction machines. The PNM allows the authors to take into account the local magnetic saturation and remains moderately time consuming compared to the finite element method. The developed permeance network of the machine is coupled to the stator phase electrical equations on one side and, on the other side, to the mechanical motion equation in order to simulate variable speed operations. The air-gap eccentricity is then taken into account in the modelling of the air-gap permeance. The effect of the eccentricity on the current and vibration signatures is discussed. Theoretical analysis for the effect of the machine eccentricity is presented.	[Mahyob, A.; Elmoctar, M. Y.

Detection of rotor faults in torque controlled induction motor drives	2007 EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-10			English	Proceedings Paper	12th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications	SEP 02-05, 2007	Aalborg, DENMARK	IEEE		diagnostics; induction motor; electrical drive; modelling; simulation	MACHINES; DIAGNOSIS; BARS	In the supervision of electrical equipment, the task of diagnostic system is to detect an upcoming machine fault as soon as possible, in order to save expensive manufacturing processes or to replace fault parts. An important issue in such effort is the modelling of the induction machine (IM) including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, a simpler method is employed in the simulation of an induction motor with rotor asymmetries. Simulation of classical and dynamic space vector models, Finite Element Analysis and experimental results are presented to support the proposed model. The need for detection of rotor faults at an earlier stage has pushed the development of monitoring methods with increasing sensitivity and noise immunity. Addressing diagnostic techniques based on current signatures analysis (MCSA), the characteristic components introduced by specific faults in the current spectrum are investigated and a diagnosis procedure correlates the amplitudes of such components to the fault extent. The impact of feedback control on asymmetric rotor cage induction machine behavior is also analyzed. It is shown that the variables usually employed in diagnosis procedures assuming open-loop operation are no longer effective under closed-loop operation. Simulation results show that signals already present at the drive are suitable to effective diagnostic procedure. The utilization of the current regulator error signals in rotor failure detection are the aim of the present work. The use of a band-pass filter bank to detect the presence of sidebands is also proposed.	[Cunha, Carla C.

Newer network cards implemented more security measures according to the IEEE recommendations [14], but the wireless network is still vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks or to other traditional attacks due to existing wide deployment of network cards with well-known security vulnerabilities. The effectiveness of a Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS) relies on updating its security rules; many current WIDSs use static security rule settings based on expert knowledge. However, updating those security rules can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on multi-channel monitoring and anomaly analysis of station localization, packet analysis, and state tracking to detect wireless attacks, we use adaptive machine learning and genetic search to dynamically set optimal anomaly thresholds and select the proper set of features necessary to efficiently detect network attacks. We present a self-protection system that has the following salient features. monitor the wireless network, generate network features, track wireless network state machine violations, generate wireless flow keys (WFK), and use the dynamically updated anomaly and misuse rules to detect complex known and unknown wireless attacks. To quantify the attack impact, we use the abnormality distance from the trained norm and multivariate analysis to correlate multiple selected features contributing to the final decision. We validate our Wireless Self Protection System (WSPS) approach by experimenting with more than 20 different types of wireless attacks. Our experimental results show that the WSPS approach can protect from wireless network attacks with a false positive rate of 0.1209% and more than 99% detection rate.

The overall goal is to develop a prognosis system to track and predict bearing degradation and to integrate those technologies with the open architecture IMD-HUMS. This paper summarizes the challenges and advancements that have been experienced while improving the diagnostic capabilities for the bearings. The causes and effects of bearing contamination and lubricant exhaustion are addressed, while the focus is placed on detection methods of these failure modes. Interesting and encouraging results were found for both the oil cooler bearings and the hanger bearings, but at the present time, the potential is greatest for the development of detection methods and PHM algorithms for oil cooler bearings. The anticipated system will enable fault diagnosis, damage tracking, and the prognosis of useful life remaining.(1,2).

One of the key components necessary for developing a prognostic algorithm is a diagnostic severity metric. This paper presents an evaluation of a number of standard vibration-based diagnostic metrics, utilizing a large set of experimental fault-to-failure progression data for bearings. These experiments included over 40 complete bearing failure progressions with 10 to 30 ground truth data points per bearing. Additional data supporting the potential of using oil debris monitoring in conjunction with vibration monitoring is also presented.(1,2). Once a prognostic algorithm has been developed, the next critical step is to validate how well the algorithm performs. Conceptually, this seems like a simple task. However, there are many criteria to be considered, including convergence rate, accuracy, and stability of the RLTL prediction. The paper includes an evaluation of prognostic algorithms based on vibration-based diagnostics that feed into a model-based prediction of future spall propagation and thus remaining life. Methods for objectively measuring the quality of the predictions are proposed. The results presented herein help demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of predictive prognostics at the current state-of-the-art.

Detection of change is an important first step in building a prognostic system: when a detectable fault occurs, it will cause changes in one or more sensed parameters of the system. Once a change has been detected, localizing the time of change (presumably the time of fault onset), can contribute to the estimate of RUL in two ways. First, it may make the RUL estimate more accurate. Second, and independent of estimate accuracy, it may make the prognostic estimate more precise by reducing the variance of the estimate. This paper describes an approach for localizing the time of change in time series data. The performance of the system is assessed using synthetic data that closely matches the characteristics of real-world data. However, the synthetic data is deterministically labeled, so algorithm performance can accurately be assessed. The approach presented requires low computational power at runtime, an important feature for on-wing application that combines the rank transformation of data, randomization tests inspired by the work of Fisher and Pitman, and fusion of multi-scale estimates to result in a fast and accurate localization of change.(1 2).

The current on-board diagnosis systems embedded in the automobiles follow conventional rule-based diagnosis procedures, and may benefit from the introduction of sophisticated artificial intelligence and pattern recognition-based procedures in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Here, we present a mode-invariant fault diagnosis procedure that is based on data-driven approach, and show its applicability to automotive engines. The proposed approach achieves high-diagnostic accuracy by detecting the faults as soon as they occur. It uses statistical hypothesis tests to detect faults, a wavelet-based preprocessing of the data, and pattern recognition techniques for classifying various faults in engines. We simulate the Toyota Camry 544N Engine SIMULINK model in a real-time simulator and controlled by a prototype ECU (Electronic Control Unit). The engine model is simulated under several operating conditions (pedal angle, engine speed, etc), and pre- and post-fault data is collected for eight engine faults with different severity levels, and a database of cases is created for applying the presented approach. The results demonstrate that appealing diagnostic accuracy and fault severity estimation are possible with pattern recognition-based techniques, and, in particular, with the support vector machines(1 2).

A usefulness criterion is introduced that enables the specification of admissible uncertainty bounds on measurements of systems' health/degradation parameters. Keeping the uncertainty of health estimation below the admissible levels assures more accurate individual remaining useful life (RUL) estimations than those based on traditional population average time-to-failure. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using the well-known cumulative damage model that was extended to incorporate individual degradation data.(12).	[Usynin, Alexander; Hines, J.

The model utilizes environmental loads and in-situ performance measurements in conjunction with two baseline prediction algorithms: life consumption monitoring (LCM) and uncertainty adjusted prognostics (UAP). Fusion techniques are then utilized to integrate the two prognostic algorithms. A key and unique value of this combined prognostic model is its ability to assess intermittent as well as "hard" failures. In the paper we show how it has been validated for intermittent and "hard" solder joint interconnect failures under temperature cycling loads.(12).

The method relies on the transfer characteristics of the closed loop operation of the power supply circuit to evaluate gain, rather than direct measurement of current at the isolator terminals. With voltage regulation, a power supply will continue to operate within specifications well beyond the onset of opto-isolator wear, but then fail suddenly when the damage accumulation reaches a threshold. We show that it is possible to detect the onset of degradation of the isolator before performance is adversely affected, and track the progression of a fault to provide greater lead time for field replacement. The method presented is simple to implement on many commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supplies, and offers the advantage of longer maintenance cycles at lower cost. We show how this method can improve the accuracy of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, reduce the occurrence of No Trouble Found (NTF), and improve manufacturing of highly reliable SMpS.(12).

When implemented, this capability will greatly enhance the maintenance management of platforms. Electronic prognostics require extensive use of physics of failure models to predict the remaining useful life of complex electronic failure modes.(12) VEXTEC has developed a material-based physics of failure analysis tool for use in a variety of programs with aerospace OEMs. These techniques are far more accurate and versatile than traditional fatigue life analysis by using the alloys' grain and material properties for damage prediction. By modeling the stresses induced on interconnects by thermal and vibration forces, current damage estimates and remaining useful life can be calculated. The data required to drive these models uses measurands commonly available from electronic systems such as board temperature and loads induced by flight or operational conditions. The electronic circuit accelerated life test programs have shown excellent correlation between the predictions from material based physics of failure models and induced circuit board failures. VEXTEC's probabilistic roll-up models of electronic component circuits and interconnects predict overall system reliability to provide the operator with useful information for managing vehicle maintenance.

The research and development of such techniques has relied on the theories of material science, structural mechanics, domain expertise, as well as empirical studies such as accelerated run-to-failure testing. Even after prognostic models have been developed and operationally validated for various components of a system, the challenge remains how prognostic assessments from individual components of a system (such as an aircraft engine) should be used to make maintenance and logistics decisions. In this paper, we describe an integration process where the primary focus is on bridging the gap between the individual component prognosis and the system-level reasoning required to support maintenance and inventory management decisions. The research involves integration of component health assessment with an information fusion mechanism that operates in conjunction with a higher-level reasoning engine which utilizes system-level structural and functional dependencies. The higher-level reasoning engine generates a system availability analysis that leads directly to actionable tasks for the inventory and maintenance management decision support systems. The inventory management decision support system involves predicting the spares requirements, and when this is integrated with remote health monitoring and intelligent diagnostics and prognostics, it can assess different sparing allocation schemes, and maximize system availability within budget constraints.

For safety-critical systems, ISHM must maintain safe operations while increasing availability by preserving functionality and minimizing downtime. This paper discusses a model-based approach to ISHM that combines fault detection, isolation and identification, fault-adaptive control, and prognosis into a common framework. At the core of this framework are a set of component oriented physical system models. By incorporating physics of failure models into component models the dynamic behavior of a failing or degrading system can be derived by simulation. Current state information predicts future behavior and performance of the system to guide decision making on system operation and maintenance.(1,2) We demonstrate our approach on the fluid loop of a secondary sodium cooling loop of a nuclear reactor system. We model the fluid loop at the system level and a generic pump system at the component level. Monitoring and diagnosis at the system level may point to faults and degradation in components, e.g., the pump. A more detailed analysis of the pump using structural and material models may point to physics of failure models that explain degradation in the pump components. This information can form the basis for prognostic analysis that forms the core methodology for monitoring system performance and decision making for maintenance.

Unlike lot of dials and gauges, the pilot will interact with Multi Function Displays (MFD). This means that the systems are coupled with multifunction displays, communication and navigation radios with control units, multi-mode interactive instruments for control and navigation, recording and fault management systems, airframe and health monitoring diagnostic capability. Pilot Vehicle Interface (PVI) is important measure of good avionics and cockpit layout, which implies the optimization of man machine interface, enhancement of economy and safety of flight operations. The paper presents the avionics architecture of a 14 seated Light Transport Aircraft (LTA) for general aviation, which has the multi role commuter capabilities. LTA is a twin turbo-prop, multi role aircraft, with air taxi and commuter services as its primary roles. The avionics is built on the digital communication mode for both command and control with current requirements of TCAS, digital Autopilot and AMLCD multipurpose glass displays. The LTA Avionics suite is grouped into six major groups based on the functionality: Display system, Communication System, Navigation system, Recording System, Radar System and Engine instruments and other cockpit displays. The paper also covers a details about the extensive tests carried out to prove the avionics design in terms of functionality, inter-operability, interference and compatibility. Various practical integration and flight-test issues, methodology and details of the scenarios is presented in the paper.

C	Dussault, PL			IEEE	Dussault, Philip L.			Creating a closed loop environment for condition based maintenance plus (CBM+) and prognostics health management	2007 IEEE AUTOTESTCON, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual AUTOTESTCON Conference	SEP 17-20, 2007	Baltimore, MD	IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc				One important facet of CBM+ is to formulate the assessment of the system based upon objective evaluation of degraded performance or impending failure. Only when the objective evidence substantiates the need to perform a maintenance action would the system be pulled in for maintenance. Viability and acceptance of predictive measures and appropriate metrics to ensure success have crippled efforts to add prognostic systems in the past. Only a portion of the diagnostic information is available directly from the defense system. To get the full picture requires being aware of repair activity at all levels of maintenance to correlate initial conditions to the actual root cause of the failure. This is usually the downfall of most attempts at intelligent maintenance concepts. We have typically done a horrible job of keeping track of parts in maintenance throughout the enterprise. The US Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), Diagnostic/Prognostic Laboratory has developed a closed loop environment to address critical aspects of system operation, fault classification, and prognostics health management (PHM). The environment was derived from our automatic test system (ATS) improvement program to develop a closed loop system to monitor ATS performance in the field remotely and be able to provide seamless updates to the operators around the world. Recognizing that today's complex defense system data sources are diverse in their form and their context requires special attention to feature extraction and fusion to reduce potential transmission overload. Periodicity related to the sampling of data and the correlation of the data set to particular incipient fault evidence is of interest to develop a rational architecture for a systems approach to health management. In many cases we monitor individual subsystems or components and singularly diagnose failures into ambiguity groups due to insufficient discrimination of diagnostic information. Therefore we blindly wait for a failure to occur, diagnose the problem, order the appropriate part, wait for its arrival, replace the component upon arrival, test the repaired system, and put it back into operational status. This is not satisfactory anylonger.

Practical condition assessment and prediction of remaining useful life for such systems offer significant potential for improved readiness and field reliability. This paper introduces the 'circuit as a sensor' concept as an innovative and practical PHM solution for Electronic Systems through proof of concept using Radio Frequency Digital (RF/D) systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, an economical test platform operating in the frequency range representative of modern avionic systems, with available system and component features was selected. An experiment to study the effects of degradation from the highly accelerated tests on diagnostic features as well as derive failure progression trends was conducted. Results from this research are presented. The embedded diagnostic and prognostic capability developed is scalable and can tie applied to broad class of electronic systems.

Accurate estimates of the state-of-charge (OC), the state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-life(SOL) for batteries provide a significant value addition to the management of any operation involving electrical systems. This is especially true for aerospace systems, where unanticipated battery performance may lead to catastrophic failures. Batteries, composed of multiple electrochemical cells, are complex systems whose internal state variables are either inaccessible to sensors or hard to measure under operational conditions. In addition, battery performance is strongly influenced by ambient environmental and load conditions. Consequently, inference and estimation techniques need to be applied on indirect measurements, anticipated operational conditions and historical data, for which a Bayeslan statistical approach is suitable. Accurate models of electro-chemical processes in the form of equivalent electric circuit parameters need to be combined with statistical models of state transitions, aging processes and measurement fidelity, need to be combined in a formal framework to make the approach viable. The RVM, which is a Bayesian treatment of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used for diagnosis as well as for model development. The PF framework uses this model and statistical estimates of the noise in the system and anticipated operational conditions to provide estimates of SOC, SOH and SOL. Validation of this approach on experimental data from Li-ion batteries is presented.

Two types of induction machine internal faults are investigated, rotor broken bar, and stator shorted turns faults. Early detection and diagnosis of these faults are desirable for condition assessment, maintenance schedule and improved operational efficiency of induction motors. The terminal behavior of the induction motor was obtained by coupling the induction motor transient FE model and external electric circuit. Such a model would allow efficient representation of the induction machine with internal faults. A Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was then used to extract the different harmonic components of the stator currents. The key advantages of the DWT are its ability to provide a local representation of the nonstationary current signals for normal and faulty operating conditions.	[Mohammed, O. A.; Abed, N.

It has become extremely critical to detect faults in the electrical system and predict the remaining useful fife of failing components. This paper introduces an integrated methodology for monitoring, modeling, data processing, fault diagnosis, and failure prognosis of critical electrical components such as the battery. The enabling technologies include signal processing, sensor selection and placement, selection and extraction of optimum condition indicators, and accurate fault diagnosis and failure prognosis algorithms that are based on both the physics of failure models and Bayesian estimation methods. The proposed architecture is implementable on-board an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) requiring minimum computational resources. Potential benefits include reduction in maintenance costs, improved asset reliability and availability and longer life of critical components.

A Gaussian mixture model is employed to model the normal operating range of the machine. A Gaussian random vector is introduced to model the possible deviations of the observed sensor values from their corresponding normal values. Different levels of deviations are elegantly handled by the covariance matrix of this random vector, which is estimated adaptively for each input observation.

As most running statuses of machines are nonlinear and non-stationary, it is difficult to extract the effective features for fault diagnosis by linear feature extractor such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLD). Therefore, kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (kernel FDA) is used to extract the nonlinear discriminant feature. In addition, the idea of feature fusion is introduced to improve the robustness of feature extractor, because feature fusion can synthesize complementary information of different feature variables from multi-signal sources. The heavy computational burden induced by the tremendous size of the feature space is also effectively settled by using a kernel function in the input space without explicit computation of the mapping in feature space, and the influence of the parameter in kernel function on recognition performance is also discussed. The results show that the proposed feature fusion scheme can effectively improve the robustness of feature extractor, and nonlinearly discriminant features perform better than kernel PCA features.

According to the fault diagnosis method based on a mathematical model of the control system, a fault diagnosis method is proposed for hydraulic actuator based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). This new fault diagnosis approach leads to solving a linear set of equations instead of solving a quadratic programming problem. The LS-SVM formulation also involves less tuning parameters. By using the measurable parameters, the fault diagnosis model of LS-SVM for hydraulic actuator are established. The simulation results show that this method can effectively detect every fault of servo valve, displacement sensor and servo amplifier.

A hybrid method combining feature selection and generation in a wrapper based approach via evolutionary algorithm was proposed to automatically generate feature set, and SVM was proposed to serve as an inductive learner for the evaluation of the feature set both as a classifier for the whole diagnosis system. The whole diagnosis process is in a full-automatic way. First, training stage is carried out. Original data with known features was directly sent to the IFD system and then selected features together with generated features are determined by the evolution of SVM learner. Finally, test stage is on the way. Test feature sets are put into SVM classifier, and IFD outputs current fault patterns, which terminates the whole diagnosis process. Applications in TEP data sets prove this method effective and robust.

Plunge milling is one of the most efficient machining with high metal removal rate. The online monitoring of tool wear has been the key of plunge milling process. In this paper, the technique of tool wear monitoring in plunge milling process was studied. An online monitoring and faults diagnosis system based on PC104 bus and LabVIEW was established. The system can acquire and analyze the vibration signals by acceleration sensors that were put in the milling tool holder. The model between the tool wear and vibration signals in plunge milling 45# steel was built by fitting of multivariable linear regression on the base of experiment. The model was realized on the open NC system, monitoring the tool wear degree quantificational. Through the verification to experiment data, the model was effective and reliable, and the error of forecast tool wear value was within 10% by the tool wear model. The model provided an important reference for the research of tool wear on the plunge milling.

Considering that it is difficult to install speed sensor for submersible induction motor in some specific situations such as special high temperature working environment, the proposed technique of recurrent multilayer neural network is used to estimate the speed of sensorless submersible induction motor. The stator current measured by data collector is analyzed by wavelet, thus the influence of high frequency noisy caused by high temperature is filtered off. Since the useful signal is extracted as sample input, and the speed signal collected by speed sensor as sample output, a neural network is trained on the principle of "training off-line, estimating on-line", so that the network can estimate the speed only using stator current. Experimental results prove that the proposed method has very high precision and good dynamic quality. Furthermore, the estimation results can provide powerful security for closed-loop control and fault diagnosis.

Recent manufacturing outsourcing business environment necessitates more focus on machine performance degradation to optimize the tool management for improved six-sigma productivity and manufacturing performance. The unmet needs for drilling monitoring is how to effectively predict its remaining life and manage the tool change to minimize downtime and costs. This paper presents a hybrid method for on-line assessment and performance prediction of remaining tool life in drilling operations based on the vibration signals. Logistic regression (LR) analysis combined with maximum likelihood technique is employed to evaluate tool wear condition based on features extracted from vibration signals using Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) technique. Auto-regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is then applied to predict remaining useful life based on tool wear assessment result. In addition, failure risk distribution is discussed. The developed prognostic method is validated in drilling operations, which can be also implemented to other manufacturing processes.

For high-dimensional data processing, engineers often resort to feature extraction methods and statistical theories to convert the original features into new features. However, the converted data always lose the engineering meaning of the original features and the choice and use of conversion methods are challenging. In this paper, a hybrid feature selection model is presented to select the most significant input features from all potentially relevant features. The algorithm combines a filter model with a wrapper model. In the filter model, four variable ranking methods are used to pre-rank the candidate features. These four methods including Pearson correlation coefficient, Relief algorithm, Fisher score and Class separability, measure features from various angles, which leads to different ranking results. Therefore, a weighted voting scheme is introduced to re-rank features based on the degree of significance of the four methods on the classification error rate of Radial Basis Function (RBF) classifier. In wrapper model, a Binary Search (BS) method and a Sequential Backward Search (SBS) method are utilized to minimize the number of relevant features when promising to keep the classification error rate of RBF classifier below a given threshold. To demonstrate the potential of applying the method to large-scale engineering data processing, a case study is conducted.

The system engages a peer-to-peer network of untrusted machines on the Internet to detect new worms and facilitate rapid preventative response. We evaluate the efficacy and scalability of the proposed system through large-scale simulations and assessments of a functional real-world prototype. We find that the system enjoys scalability in terms of network coverage, fault-tolerance, security, and maintainability. It proves effective against new worms, and supports collaboration among among mutually mistrusting parties.

Quarter sphere based distributed anomaly detection in wireless sensor networks	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-14	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2007)	JUN 24-28, 2007	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	IEEE				Anomaly detection is an important challenge for tasks such as fault diagnosis and intrusion detection in energy constrained wireless sensor networks. A key problem is how to minimise the communication overhead in the network while performing in-network computation when detecting anomalies. Our approach to this problem is based on a formulation that uses distributed, one-class quarter-sphere support vector machines to identify anomalous measurements in the data. We demonstrate using sensor data from the Great Duck Island Project that our distributed approach is energy efficient in terms of communication overhead while achieving comparable accuracy to a centralised scheme.				r.sutharshan@ee.unimelb.edu.au; caleckie@csse.unimelb.edu.au; swami@ee.unimelb.edu.au; jbezdek@uwf.edu	Rajasegarar, Sutharshan/AAW-4727-2021; Palaniswami, Marimuthu/AAE-2179-2022	Rajasegarar, Sutharshan/0000-0002-6559-6736; LECKIE, CHRISTOPHER/0000-0002-4388-0517			Akyildiz IF, 2002, COMPUT NETW, V38, P393, DOI 10.1016/S1389-1286(01)00302-4; Barnett V., 1994, OUTLIERS STAT DATA, V3rd ed.; Duin R., 2004, PRTOOLS4 MATLAB TOOL; Epelman M, 2002, SIAM J OPTIMIZ, V12, P627, DOI 10.1137/S1052623400373829; FLOURI BBL, 2006, EUSIPCO FLOR; LASKOV P, 2004, DETECTION INTRUSIONS; Loo CE, 2006, INT J DISTRIB SENS N, V2, P313, DOI 10.1080/15501320600692044; Nash S, 1996, LINEAR NONLINEAR PRO; Navia-Vazquez A, 2006, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V17, P1091, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2006.875968; Onat I, 2005, WIMOB 2005: IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS AND MOBILE COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS, VOL 3, PROCEEDINGS, P253; Palpanas T, 2003, SIGMOD REC, V32, P77; Perrig A, 2004, COMMUN ACM, V47, P53, DOI 10.1145/990680.990707; Pottie GJ, 2000, COMMUN ACM, V43, P51, DOI 10.1145/332833.332838; PRASAD NR, 2006, WIRELESS PERSONAL CO, V37; RAGHUNATHAN V, 2002, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAR; Rajasegarar S., 2006, IEEE INT C COMM SYST; Scholkopf B, 1998, NEURAL COMPUT, V10, P1299, DOI 10.1162/089976698300017467; Scholkopf B, 2002, LEARNING KERNELS; Shawe-Taylor J., 2004, KERNEL METHODS PATTE; SUBRAMANIAM S, 2006, VLDB, P187; Szewczyk R, 2004, COMMUN ACM, V47, P34, DOI 10.1145/990680.990704; SZEWCZYK R, 2004, INT C EMBEDDED NETWO, P214; Tax DMJ, 2004, MACH LEARN, V54, P45, DOI 10.1023/B:MACH.0000008084.60811.49; TAX DMJ, 2006, DDTOOLS DATA DESCRIP; Vapnik VN., 1998, STAT LEARNING THEORY; Zhao F, 2003, P IEEE, V91, P1199, DOI 10.1109/JPROC.2003.814921	26	99	101	0	6	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1550-3607		978-1-4244-0352-3	IEEE ICC			2007							3864	3869		10.1109/ICC.2007.637			6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Telecommunications	BIA16	WOS:000257882502160					2022-02-14

In order to obtain the process state, composite model is presented by combining mass equations of bioreactors with RBF neural network that serve as estimators of unmeasured process kinetic parameters. Then Support vector machines are used to analyze and recognize fault patterns, making use of estimated state variables on line. The proposed method is applied to glutamic acid fermentation process, and the simulation results show its feasibility and effectiveness.

Due to the P and Q are both constant for healthy motor, they correspond to a dot on the PQ curve. And the PQ curve of machine with rotor broken bar or eccentricity will correspond to an ellipse due to they comprise an additional frequency component. This paper start with the model of the unhealthy squirrel cage induction motors. Then detail analysis indicates that the longest radius and the shortest radius of the ellipse was determined by the effective value of the fault characteristic components in the stator currents of the squirrel cage induction motor, at the same time, and the deflexed angle of the ellipse was determined by the phases of the fault characteristic components in the stator currents of the motor. The change of the amplitude of the longer axis, the short axis and the deflexed angle of the ellipse can be fault diagnostic indexes of the induction motors. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method.

The theory of least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is a least squares version of standard SVM which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with a least squares object function. A systematic approach based on LS-SVM and wavelet decomposition for fault diagnosis of hydroturbine generating units (HGU) is proposed in this paper. The vibration signals under abnormal conditions are collected and preprocessed with the wavelet decomposition and feature information of signals is extracted as the feature vectors for training and testing the LS-SVM. To classify multiple fault modes of HGU, a multiclass classifier based on LS-SVM with minimum output codes (MOC) is constructed and used in the fault diagnosis for HGU. It's showed in the simulation result that the fault types can be identified and diagnosed by the above method. Compared with the result of a RBF neural network, more excellent identification accuracy indicates the feasibility and effectiveness of LS-SVM in the fault diagnosis of HGU.

Under this context, feature extraction is the process of identifying damage-sensitive information from measured data. Feature extraction is an essential component of a SHM system needed to convert raw sensor data into useful information about the structural health condition. The need for robust health monitoring and prognosis of components in remote or difficult-to-access locations is driving the advancement of sensing hardware and processing algorithms. In this paper a feature extraction algorithm, referred to as soft computing feature extraction algorithm, is developed to extract damage-sensitive information from measured response data of helicopter rotor-head components. The proposed feature extraction algorithm is based on a combination of discrete wavelet transform theory and fuzzy logic theory. The results of applying the proposed feature extraction approach to tie bar data are presented. Results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of extracting features sensitive to the degradation of tie bar systems.	[Escamilla-Ambrosio, P.

For a discrete-part machining system, it is very challenging to identify the faults, since the final product variation caused by faults is an accumulation from all stations. This paper explores a faults diagnosis methodology for the root causes identification of a serial machining system. Firstly, a system model is described to capture the relationship between process faults and product quality. Then based on the model, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation algorithms are built to estimate the key parameters of measurement data, such as the mean value and variance, which followed by a hypothesis testing method to determine the root causes at certain confidence level. A real machining case illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed faults diagnosis methodology.	[Du, S. C.; Xi, L.

However, the heavy computational burden induced by the tremendous size of the feature space is a tiresome problem. As most running statuses of machines are nonlinear and non-stationary, a nonlinear feature fusion scheme based on kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) is proposed to recognize the different fault patterns in running machines. Kernel PCA is applied to extract and fuse nonlinear features from acoustic signals and vibration signals. The computational problem is also effectively settled by using a kernel function in the input space without explicit computation of the mapping in feature space. The results show that the proposed scheme can greatly improve the robustness of feature extractor for mechanical faults.

Support vector machine (SVM) based classification gives a promising approach for fault diagnostics. of electric transformers. But the standard method for N-class SVMs (there are many types of electrical transformer fault) doesn't present an easy solution. The constructing N-class SVMs are still an unsolved research problem. In this paper, we apply a new learning architecture (the Decision Directed Acyclic Graph Support Vector Machine, DDAGSVM) in electric transformer fault diagnosis and try to obtain good results. The DDAGSVM operates in a kernel-induced feature space and uses two-class maximal margin hyperplanes at each decision node of the DDAG. At the last example shows that DDAGSVM is substantially faster to train and evaluate than either the standard algorithm (1-v-r) or Max Wins in electric transformer fault diagnosis, while maintaining comparable accuracy to both of these algorithms.

The key to the fault bearings diagnosis is feature extracting and feature classifying. Multidimensional correlated variable is converted into low dimensional independent eigenvector by means of principal components analysis. The pattern recognition and the nonlinear regression are achieved by the method of support vector machine (SVM). In the light of the feature of vibrating signals, eigenvector is obtained using principal components analysis, fault diagnosis of rolling bearing is recognized correspondingly using support vector machine multiple fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that the recognition of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on principal components analysis and support vector machine theory is available in the fault pattern recognizing and provides a new approach to intelligent fault diagnosis.

Here, we discuss dynamic fusion of classifiers which is a special case of the dynamic multiple fault diagnosis (DMFD) problem [1]-[3]]. The DMFD problem is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) configuration problem in tri-partite graphical models, which is NP-hard. A primal-dual optimization framework is applied to solve the MAP problem. Our process for dynamic fusion consists of four key steps: (1) data preprocessing such as noise suppression, data reduction and feature selection using data-driven techniques, (2) error correcting codes to transform the multiclass data into binary classification, (3) fault detection using pattern recognition techniques (support vector machines in this paper), and (4) dynamic fusion of classifiers output labels over time using the DMFD algorithm. An automobile engine data set, simulated under various fault conditions [41, was used to illustrate the fusion process. The results demonstrate that an ensemble of classifiers, when fused over time, reduces the classification error as compared to a single classifier and static fusion of classifiers trained over the entire batch of data. The results for sliding window dynamic fusion are also provided.

The analysis carries on the work already developed by the NeMeFo (Neural Meteo Forecasting) research project for meteorological data short-term forecasting [1]. The study analyzed the air pollution principal causes and identified the best subset of features (meteorological data and air pollutants concentrations) for each air pollutant in order to predict its medium-term concentration (in particular for the particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of up to 10 pm called PM10). The selection of the best subset of features was implemented by means of a backward selection algorithm which is based on the information theory notion of relative entropy. The final aim of the research is the implementation of a prognostic tool able to reduce the risk for the air pollutants concentrations to be above the alarm thresholds fixed by the law. The implementation of this tool will be carried out using data-driven models based on some of the most wide-spread statistical data-learning techniques (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines).

Unavoidable design defects, quality variations in the production process as well as different usage patterns make it is infeasible to foresee all possible faults that may occur to the vehicle. As a result, many systems rely on limited diagnostic coverage provided by a diagnostic strategy which tests only for a priori known or anticipated failures, and presumes the system is operating normally if the full set of tests is passed. To circumvent these difficulties and provide a more complete coverage for detection of any fault, a new paradigm for design of automotive diagnostic systems is needed. An approach inspired by the functionalities and characteristics of natural immune system is presented and discussed in the paper. The feasibility of the newly proposed paradigm is also partially demonstrated through application examples.

Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural network and support vector machine that are unable to accommodate new information as it becomes available into their existing models. This paper introduces the incremental learning approach to the problem of condition monitoring. The paper starts by giving a brief definition of incremental learning. Two incremental learning techniques are applied to the problem of condition monitoring. The first method uses the incremental learning ability of Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and explores whether ensemble approach can improve the performance of the FAM. The second technique uses Learn++ that uses an ensemble of MLP classifiers.

Continuously monitoring the health state of locomotives is critical in modern cost-effective maintenance strategy. A typical locomotive is equipped with the capability to generate fault messages or incidents based on logical rules in the control system. In the mean time, sensor readings and operational state variables are also collected. The goal is to detect faults early to provide lead-time for maintenance actions and trip planning based on the collected fault log and parametric data. In this paper, we present a model-based anomaly detection strategy. In this method, the inputs-outputs relationship of a locomotive subsystem is modeled using a neural network model based on normal operational data. The residuals between measurements and model outputs are calculated. A reasoning module based on these multiple residuals is used to generate an overall health indicator of the subsystem at each instance of times, which is further used to determine whether the subsystem is abnormal. Statistical testing, Gaussian mixture model and support vector machine are used to generate this healthy index and their performances are compared. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection strategy using real-world operational data from locomotives.

A key issue in current-based hearing fault detection is to extract bearing fault signature from motor stator current. In this paper bearing fault signature in motor stator current is detected by estimating and removing non-bearing fault components via a noise cancellation method. In this method, the components of the stator current that are not related to hearing faults are regarded as noise and are estimated by a Wiener filter. These noise components are then cancelled by their estimates in a real time fashion and a fault indicator is established based on the remaining components that are related to bearing faults. Machine parameters, bearing dimensions, nameplate values, or stator current spectrum distributions are not required in the method. The results of on-line experiments with a 20-horsepower induction motor have verified the effectiveness of this method.

The (1-2s)f(0) component arises as the main effect of the cage asymmetry whereas the (1+2s)f(0) component is a secondary effect. It is commonly known, that it arises due to speed ripples, which are generated by alternating component of electromagnetic torque in a motor with faulty cage. This paper shows that magnetic saturation of a main magnetic circuit also generates the (1+2s)f(0) component in stator currents. A special mathematical model accounting for saturation is used to prove this thesis. Results of quantitative analysis of an influence of inertia and saturation on the (1+2s)f(0) component is shown.

Rotor faults give rise to harmonic side band currents and double slip frequency shaft torque oscillations, however. The total drive inertia thus influences the speed ripple which, again, influences the balance of the magnitudes of the lower and upper side band current. Considering certain assumptions, the impact of the speed ripple on the current harmonics with respect to the stator and rotor fixed reference frame is investigated analytically. Additionally, the derived equations are applied to the Vienna Monitoring Method, a model based rotor fault detection method.

These are motors under real operation in power generating installations. Two different approaches are used for the diagnosis of the machine condition. Both of them are based on the study of the startup transient of the machine and the extraction of characteristic patterns caused by the evolution during the transient of certain components dependant on the slip. The results show the validity of both diagnosis methods. Special interest has the use of the Discrete Wavelet Transform for the detection and discrimination of different faults. Its validity was already proved by the authors in previous works but in small motors. The results show the potentiality of the approaches for the diagnosis of the condition of a wide range of motors.

The features extraction processus are realised by TFR and utilized by HMM to provide detection and diagnostic. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown by simulation studies using experimental fault data obtained from machine: bearing fault, stator fault and rotor fault. These one can be detected online by monitoring the probabilities of the pretrained HMM.

Most often, spectral analysis is applied, so it really important to predict spectra of faulty machines directly from the mathematical model. This paper discusses a methodology, which enables qualitative and quantitative analysis of faulty machines directly in a frequency domain, focusing on both the advantages and the disadvantages of such approach.

Beyond the diagnosis: the forecast of state system Application in an induction machine	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS & DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	SEP 06-08, 2007	Cracow, POLAND	IEEE		diagnosis; evolution tracking; data standardization; Kalman filter	MOTORS	This paper deals with the tracking and the prediction of the evolution of the system operation. The aim is to define a forecast of future operating state of the process by using the previous state. First of all, a signature is determined in order to monitor the evolution of different operating modes. For this purpose, on the example of an induction machine, diagnostic features are extracted from current and voltage measurements without any other sensors. Then, a feature selection method is applied in order to select the most relevant features which define the representation space. A polynomial approach of tracking evolution is presented. Next, a Kalman algorithm is developed to predict evolution and to allow pre-empting on the appearance of a fault and the accelerated ageing of system. Finally theses two approaches are applied and compared with an induction machine of 5.5 kW with squirrel-cage.

The study includes speed transients in realistic experimental conditions. The stator current is analyzed by means of time-frequency spectral distribution (SP), Wigner Ville distribution (WVD) and Analytical Wavelet Transform (AWT); also, the rms value of the local maximum for this distribution is calculated as indicated by Ridge-AWT algorithm. Experimental laboratory results validate the analysis and demonstrate that the time-frequency analysis can be applied to detect and identify short circuit failures in synchronous machines*.

The detection of mechanical faults using the vibration signal analysis has been well studied before. Recently, some works have been performed in order to observe the vibration components of the mechanical part in the stator current spectrum for an induction machine but without any theoretical detail. This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on torque oscillations due to the characteristic torsional vibrations in a gearbox and the source of mesh and rotating frequency components in the stator current is presented. In order to verify the theoretical development, a test-bed based on a 5.5kW three-phase squirrel-cage machine connected to a gearbox has been used.

While most research works focus on mechanical vibration analysis, the originality of our work relies on the use of high-resolution methods to detect modulations in the stator current. We present the results obtained for real data to detect inner and outer raceway bearing defects made articially as well as bearing defects obtained through on-site ageing. The obtained results show that the proposed method yields better detection than classical spectum analysis.

In case of standstills, fast and accurate fault diagnosis is necessary in order to reduce the downtime and consequently the production and revenue losses. For the above mentioned reasons, the investigation of the ASDs behaviour during the presence of faults in the power electronic converter and the development of diagnostic methods is extremely important In the present paper, faults in the rotor side of the power electronic converter of the subsynchronous cascade drive are examined. Furthermore, a novel approach for fault diagnosis is investigated via simulation and experiment. The proposed approach is based on monitoring the rotor current space vector angle, in order to extract features which indicate the specific fault modes of operation.

The common used method for PD measurement on electrical machines is the phase resolved partial discharge pattern (PRPDP) Method. Usually these patterns can only be interpreted by experienced test engineers. A computer program has been developed which is capable of interpreting these PD pattern in a qualitative manner. The presented diagnostic routine is focused on insulation faults of turbo generators which are classified according to an international standard. For system verification several generators with different age, from different manufacturers where investigated. Both measurement results under regular operation condition (online diagnosis) and diagnoses with external power supply (offline diagnosis) were evaluated. Additionally simulations models for the discharge processes have been developed. A network-type model simulates discharges in voids of different geometry. The parameters are calculated with a finite element model of a discharge process in an insulator void.

The proposed method can, beside the detection of the fault itself, recognize and categorize the fault types. In a first step, the magnetic and capacitive couplings of the armature single components are analyzed. Thereafter, the position-dependent impedance curves of healthy and faulty armatures are obtained by measurements and used for the detection of winding faults. Taking as criteria the main resonant points of the frequency and position dependent armature impedance curve, a diagnostic method that considers three different fault types is developed.

Modulation of transient reactances of induction machines caused by different types of eccentricity	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS & DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	SEP 06-08, 2007	Cracow, POLAND	IEEE		induction motor drives; monitoring; bearings; air gap	DIAGNOSIS; FAULTS; MOTOR	System reliability is getting more and more important in modern industrial drives. Currently the most frequent source of a drive breakdown is a defect of the bearings, which at the same time is most difficult to detect especially under inverter operation. The exploitation of the transient current slope was shown to give an accurate means to identify the machines transient reactances and thus also to detect possible asymmetries in the airgap. In this paper the influence of different types of eccentricity on the transient current slope of the machine excited by voltage pulses is investigated. Special attention is paid to the influence of combined static and dynamic eccentricity as this combination, due to the non linear behavior of the lamination gives rise to specific modulation that is clearly detectable. The investigation is done at machines with two and four pole pairs. The signal obtained corresponds to the inverse transient reactance. It contains different components of inherent asymmetries in the machine as well as in the case of eccentricity additional modulations that can be extracted. For a machine with two poles static eccentricity leads to a change in the signal offset, whereas dynamic eccentricity rotating with the rotor leads to a modulation with twice the mechanical frequency of the rotor. Mixed eccentricity finally leads to change in signal offset as well as a modulation corresponding to a fundamental wave with respect to the mechanical frequency. For a machine with four poles it is advantageous to use the signals obtained from single phase excitation separately.

It is well known that vibration tests enable discrimination between good and faulty products and hence the analysis of the vibration signals can be used for quality control of household appliances on the production tines. Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) is now an established technique for vibration measurements in industrial applications where non-contact operations are essential. Despite the advantages of the LDV, speckle noise occurs when rough surfaces are measured and the object is moving. Therefore, spike removal is a crucial point for a reliable system of mechanical defects detection. This paper deals with the integration or pattern recognition techniques into an automatic test system for data acquisition and classification, in order to detect mechanical faults of Washing Machines (WM) in the production line. In particular, as the electrical motor is one of the most critical part of the assembled system, the goal is to detect the faults related to the motor by the use of a Laser Doppler Vibrometer pointing the tub of the Washing Machine. First, data acquisition and its problems are introduced. Then, the adopted pre-processing techniques for speckle noise reduction is illustrated. Finally, feature extraction and real examples are shown to test the system.

The possible diagnostic indexes are investigated through spectral analysis of manipulated and controlled variables. Common control schemes have been considered to evaluate the diagnostic robustness towards operating condition and regulator parameters. Voltage injection was considered as well as a possible tool for diagnostics by analyzing the amplitude of spectral lines arising in motor input current spectrum. Experimental results guide the selection of suitable analytical models for the faulty machine. The experiments are obtained with a DSP based Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CCVSI) supplying a 1.5 kW induction machine in which three different rotors differing in asymmetry degree were used.

Such a comparison is rare as many papers focus on the presentation of new models. The three models studied in this paper are based on electrical circuit equations obtained using a common set of hypotheses which is important to reach the objectives. The different models are totally equivalent in healthy operations. A d-q stator transformation is used for the implementation of Model 1, a asymmetrical d-q rotor transformation is then added in the case of Model 2 and the application of the theorem of superposition leads to Model 3. Model 1 gives quite accurate results but requires extensive computing time and a precise knowledge of the rotor parameters. Equivalent performances are obtained with Model 2 but with a much lower computing time. The drawback is that the value of the d and q rotor resistances and inductances need to be numerically computed as they are functions of the slip. Finally Model 3 reaches less accurate results for high fault magnitude but in a low computing time and with few parameter knowledge as well as a good interpretation of the faulty machine behaviour. The three presented models cover then the complete range of applications, i.e. from the faulty machine test platform to the on-line diagnosis of machines.

Especially in variable frequency railway traction drives, bar breakage problems have been reported as a consequence of large sixth harmonic torques produced by the non-sinusoidal feeding. MCSA can be applied for motor diagnostics in these cases, but suitable indicators must be used for reliable fault severity assessment Harmonic Current Side-Band (HCSB) based Indicators (HCSBIs) for broken bars detection present a good rejection to frequency variations, as well as to motor load level, drive inertia, and motor parameters. In this paper, three industrial motors with broken bars have been tested for HCSBIs performance evaluation with different feeding frequencies, and the results have been reported and discussed.

The design and verification of these methods imply the use of complex mathematical models that allow the study of the influence produced by the machine operating conditions over the diagnosis procedure. The present paper describes a model for asynchronous motors based on a network of magnetically coupled reluctances. The aim of this model is its application to the study of the typical failures of this type of machine i. e. rotor asymmetries, air gap eccentricity, operation with an open phase etc. The dynamic properties of the model allow the simulation of the spatial evolution of all the motor variables, without neglecting complex phenomena such as magnetic saturation. Time domain analysis of air gap torque, as well as the calculation of current harmonic components is also possible. This initial study is aimed to check the accuracy and computation economy of the model. To do this, the model win be used to analyse a new diagnosis method for rotor fault detection. Simulations of healthy and faulty motors will be presented and the evolution of the machines main electrical and mechanical variables will be obtained.	[Pedrayes, F.; Rojas, C. H.; Cabanas, M.

The aim of this paper is to introduce a new diagnostic technique based on the analysis of the rotor inverter output voltages. In particular it will be shown that the frequency analysis of these signals leads to an effective diagnostic procedure.

Furthermore, these faults may be categorized as partial failure or catastrophic faults. One may note that most partial faults can eventually result in a permanent lack of service. The present digest deals with a class of failures which may happen in the rotor of a turbo-generator. These faults include electrical failures in the field winding and mechanical faults in the form of dynamic eccentricity. Since the electromechanical conversion of energy is closely related to magnetic response of the machine any alteration of the excitation and geometry will result in detectable changes in stator quantities such as no-load voltage. The present digest is based on a detailed analysis of the electromagnetic response of a two pole turbo generator under various types of rotor faults. In the first step existence of detectable time-domain signatures have been investigated. Next, uniqueness of these signatures is studied. In the last part, a systematic method for just-in-time detection and classification of various rotor faults has been developed. Finite element analysis has been used for this study.

However, the advancement in this area has led to the development of a new class of algorithms which are time-frequency based signal processing techniques. In this paper we explore the concept of identifying faults by analyzing the transient machine currents. We apply a new transient technique which extracts the nonstationary fundamental current component and analyzes the residual currents using wavelets. It will be shown that the technique shows a considerable improvement in detecting unbalanced faults in drive-connected induction machines compared to steady-state techniques.	[Barendse, P.

The main advantages of this model are its simplicity and the possibility of simulating different types of short circuits, involving different number of shorted turns located in different positions. This is achieved by means of the combination of a peculiar coil definition in the bi-dimensional finite element model with an external circuit coupled with it. The proposed model has been applied to a low-voltage random-wound induction motor, especially rewound for this study in order to allow the authors to introduce inter-turn short-circuits in any specific place of the windings. Experimental tests were performed on this machine in healthy and short-circuit conditions and, in both cases, measurements of supply currents and electromagnetic torque were taken. The spectral analysis of these magnitudes showed a good agreement between simulation and experimental results, validating the model for this kind of study.	[Rojas, C.; Melero, M. G.; Cabanas, M.

Motor Phase Current Signature Analysis (MPCSA) can be performed by evaluating the typical ratios I(7-2s)r/I-5f and I(5+2s)/I-7r, 1((13-2s)p/)I(11f) and I(11+2s)f/I-13f, etc., which appear in the phase current spectrum of faulted motors fed by non-sinusoidal low-switching-frequency voltage sources. Main advantages of the new indicators are: a) accentuate insensitivity to disturbs like load torque, drive inertia, and frequency variations, b) independence with respect to machine parameters and c) linear dependence on fault gravity. They can be directly applied on motors fed by GTO/Thyristor converters. Railway traction motor diagnostics is a possible target. The mathematical formulation has been based on the MultiPhase Symmetrical Components Theory; parameter identification was obtained by 2D-3D FEM analyses; experimental work was performed by using a motor with an appositely prepared cage.

With non-sinusoidal feeding a lot of frequencies other than (1-2s)f (lower-sideband, LSB) and (1+2s)f (upper-sideband, USB) arise, in proximity of low-order current harmonics, that can be good fault indicators. Current signature analysis-based techniques (CSABT) can take advantage by these harmonic current sidebands (HCSBs) since they are less dependent on load, frequency, drive inertia and motor parameters, so producing a better fault estimation. The measures were matched with simulations carried out by using a topologically complete mathematical complex model. Machine parameters were obtained by 2D and 3D FEA. A comparison between LSB/USB-based indicators (LUSBBIs) and HCSB-based indicators (HCSBBIs) suggests to use the latter whenever a broken bar diagnosis must be attempted for inverter-fed motors.

This paper investigates the diagnosis of rotor asymmetries in field oriented controlled induction machines based on the measured currents and speed. First, an analysis to elucidate how some characteristic features of the control affect the fault propagation is made. In particular, the influence of the outer and the inner control loops, the EMIT and cross coupling terms, the estimated angle of orientation and the resolution of the measured rotor angular position are investigated. Then, different scenarios are designed by means of simulations and experiments, and the limitations of using merely currents for the diagnosis are established. Second, an indicator calculated online from the torque producing current and the orientation angle is used to corroborate the conclusions derived from the previous analysis.

The method uses multiple observers that run in parallel, processing the same measured data from the process under consideration. The outputs from these observers are then used in a secondary least-squares estimation (LSE) process in order to identify the unknown parameters. We will demonstrate this Parameter Estimation using Multiple Observers (PEMO) on a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMEB) example (where the generator inertia, prime mover torque and damping of the generator are unknown). This method can also be used as a Fault Detection, Isolation and Identification (FDI) filter that tracks parameter changes that can be indicative of such events as line outages, load and generation changes in a power system. We illustrate this concept on a nine-bus example.

The traditional diagnostic techniques are based on the stator current or torque spectral analysis by FFT-based methods. However, the well known spectral leakage phenomena of FFT can cause not accurate estimation of the spectral components; moreover, its frequency resolution problems limits a fast detection of the fault condition. In order to solve these problems, this paper presents an high resolution method, the ESPRIT method, to make the fault identification faster and accurate. A proper dynamic model of the induction machine is used to simulate the occurring of a fault condition. Simulation results allow to compare the ESPRIT and FFT-based methods, considering the case of some rotor bars broken.

Modified Geffe test pattern generator for built-in self-test	2007 IEEE PACIFIC RIM CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE PACIFIC RIM CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing	AUG 22-24, 2007	Univ Victoria, Victoria, CANADA	IEEE	Univ Victoria			Various linear finite state machines have been widely used as pseudo-random test pattern generators for Built-in Self-test. These generators are inexpensive to use as they have the advantage of low hardware overhead. However, the Geffe generator, a classic type of nonlinear finite state machines, hasn't been frequently studied or used in similar applications. It is known that a Geffe generator when used as a pattern generator for digital system testing gives improved fault detection. Unfortunately, the area overhead involved is sufficiently high, thus such a generator becomes impractical for Built-in Self-test design. We propose a possible redesign of the Geffe generator. This redesign has very sharply reduced area overhead. More importantly, the fault simulation results show it can lead to fault coverage, which is comparable to the original Geffe generator.

The bicoherence has been proposed for such nonlinear analysis since it is a measure of the phase coupling between interacting frequency components. However, the bicoherence has some difficulties in machine condition monitoring due to the challenge of distinguishing between the intrinsic nonlinear signature of a healthy machine and the nonlinear signature of a faulted machine. To address this issue, we propose a novel method exploiting the bispectral change detection (BCD) to detect and analyze the machine faults. The principal advantages of the proposed BCD method are that it can suppress the intrinsic nonlinear signature of healthy machines and emphasize the fault-induced nonlinearities. Therefore, the proposed BCD method can discriminate between fault-induced nonlinearities and intrinsic nonlinearities, and thus can be a strong and sensitive diagnostic for machine faults. The usefulness and statistical robustness of this method are demonstrated via some experimental results.

Because of this complexity, as well as of wear and aging of components, faults occurs in such systems quite frequently at runtime. In order to use such drives in truly autonomous robots it is desirable that the robot is able to automatically react to such faults. Therefore, the robot needs reasoning and reconfiguration capabilities in order to be able to detect, localize and repair such faults on-line. In this paper we propose a model-based diagnosis and reconfiguration framework which allows an autonomous robot to detect and compensate faults in its drive. Moreover, we present an implementation for a real robot platform. Finally, we report experimental results which shows that the proposed framework is able to correctly cope with injected faults in the drive hardware, like broken motors.

By making the right qualifications, the overall machine and operations efficiency can be improved. Hence, efficient Qualification Management (QM) is a key factor for wafer fabs. In spite of this, not much has been investigated about what QM is, and what it can do for fab productivity. Only few articles treat the subject, and among these articles no author looks into the various aspects of QM and points out what the common challenges are. We will show that there is a need of a proper definition of QM for wafer fabs, and furthermore that it is an important area for further research. In this article we define what is meant with QM for wafer fabs and take a closer look into which areas of the wafer production are affected by QM. Furthermore we explain why proper QM in these areas is so important. We also review the lean literature area of QM for wafer fabs, and see how the content of earlier articles can be used to conclude what yet has to be conducted and what the new challenges are - where future research needs to be carried out. A conclusion on the work and future challenges is carried out; programs are needed that better display and visualize qualification settings; strategies to better handle process restrictions (such as costs, fault detection, capability, know-how, time); and performance measures that could be used in order to propose new qualifications should be further researched. Such measures could measure flexibility of process handling, cycle time reduction, fault detection frequency, yield rate or degree of reentrancy. Qualifications that optimize these measures will lead to a better performing fab.

This classifier can start 'from scratch', learning and adapting to the new data samples or from an initial rule-based classifier that can be updated based on the new information contained in the new samples. It is suitable for real-time applications such as classification streaming data, robotic applications, e.g. target and landmark recognition, real-time machine health monitoring and prognostics, fault detection and diagnostics etc. Each prototype is a data sample that represents the focal point of a fuzzy rule per class and is selected based on the data density by an incremental and evolving procedure. This approach is transparent, linguistically interpretable, and applicable to both fully unsupervised and partially supervised learning. It has been validated by two well known benchmark problems and by real-life data in a parallel paper. The contributions of this paper are: i) introduction of the concept of evolving (open structure) classification (eClass) of streaming data; ii) experiments with well known benchmark classification problems (Iris and wine reproduction data sets).

It consists of extracting the mechanical power second harmonic component which appears when the machine is faulty. This harmonic is processed in order to obtain a fault indicator. It will be shown that the amplitude of this indicator depends on the inter-turn fault severity. The proposed technique allows detecting the fault in real time and its implementation is easy. The experimental results show the validity of the proposed method.

On-board fault diagnosis of HEV induction motor drive at start-up and during idle mode	2007 IEEE VEHICLE POWER AND PROPULSION CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)	SEP 09-12, 2007	Arlington, TX	IEEE		on-board diagnostics; real-time fault diagnosis; induction motor; hybrid electric vehicle (HEV); standstill; start-up; idle	ECCENTRICITY; MACHINES	The integrity of the electric motors in work and passenger vehicles can best be maintained by monitoring its condition frequently on-board the vehicle. In this paper, a signal processing based fault diagnosis scheme for on-board diagnosis of rotor asymmetry at start-up and idle mode is presented. Regular rotor asymmetry tests are done when the motor is running at certain speed under load with stationary current signal assumption. It is quite challenging to obtain these regular test conditions for long enough time during daily vehicle operations. In addition, automobile vibrations cause a non-uniform air-gap motor operation which directly affects the inductances of electric motor and results quite noisy current spectrum. Therefore, examining the condition of electric motor as part of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain, conventional rotor fault detection methods become impracticable. The proposed method overcomes the aforementioned problems simply by testing the rotor asymmetry at zero speed. This test can be achieved and repeated during start-up and idle modes. The proposed method can be implemented at no cost basically using the readily available electric motor inverter sensors and microprocessing unit. Induction motor rotor asymmetry fault signatures are experimentally tested online employing the drive embedded master processor (TMS320F2812 DSP) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. It is experimentally shown that the proposed method detects the fault harmonics at start-up and standstill to determine the existence and the severity of faults in HEV powertrain.

However increased demand for reliability requires these systems to also predict the Remaining Useful life (RUL) of the machine in order to schedule timely maintenance and reduce machine downtime by preventing catastrophic faults. In this paper, an automated approach to degradation analysis is proposed that uses the acoustic noise signal from a rotating machine to determine the RUL. We incorporate a novel approach to Feature Subset Selection to extract relevant features for classification. This method is applied to the high dimensionality multivariate time series data extracted from the acoustic data acquired over the lifetime of the fan to reduce confounds from redundant features as well as improve computational efficiency. Our approach requires no a-priori information regarding the spectral location of defects or class label boundaries of the training data. Using such an approach, the RUL of the machine was determined with an accuracy of 98.7%.

A combined bond graph model will describe behavior of a squirrel cage induction motor and centrifugal pump system. The system's parameter values will be estimated by comparing simulations to sensor measured data, and altering parameters until simulations agree with data.

That is true especially for modem power plants which have multiple thousands of electronic cards because they sometimes have sudden trips (shutdowns) caused by malfunction of the electronic control cards in control systems. So, it is very desirable to avoid such trips by predictive maintenance on the control cards before they issue malfunction in operation. Even though the 'Analog Signature Analysis' (ASA) method has been using for more than a decade for predictive maintenance and diagnostics of power plants in Korea, it did not seem to decrease the number of unpredictable trips by faulty control cards for that period. In this paper, the ways how to use ASA test machines and their practical analysis methods for judgment of defect in the parts on the cards were investigated and some sample ICs manufactured from different vendors and manufacturing lots were tested to analyze the difference in Analog Signatures. Through the test results, this paper provides the guidelines for ASA to improve the effectiveness of diagnostics on the electronic control cards.

In PCA, we set linear fault boundaries. By means of the system decomposition based on SDG, the local models of each measured variable are constructed and more accurate and fast models are using an SVM, which has no loss of information and shows good performance, in order to obtain the estimated value of the variable, which is then compared with the measured value in order to diagnose the fault And then, in order to make fault boundaries linearized, we select particular variables in the local model and express the data through the PC space. In the last analysis for various fault intensities, we diagnose a number of faulty data effectively. To verify the performance of the proposed model, the Tennessee Eastman(TE) Process was studied and the proposed method was found to demonstrate a good diagnosis capability compared with previous statistical methods.

First, the reference frame theory and its applications to fault diagnosis of electric machinery are introduced. Second, phase sensitive detection (PSD) of motor fault signatures is presented. Both techniques provide very simple and robust way to find the magnitude and phase of the specified fault signatures in the line current. Particularly, PSD has a powerful line current noise suppression capability while detecting the fault signatures. Various faults are experimentally tested both offline using the data acquisition system, and online employing the TMS320F2812 DSP to prove the efficacy of the proposed tools. The advantages of these methods include the following: (1) no need to employ external hardware or a PC running a high level program; (2) provides instantaneous fault monitoring using a DSP controller in real time; (3) embedded into the motor drive; thus, readily available drive sensors and the core processor are used without employing additional hardware; (4) no need to store machine currents data, and thus no need for large memory size; (5) very short convergence time capability; (6) immune to non-idealities like sensor dc offsets, imbalance, etc.; (7) no need for a notch filter to filter out the fundamental harmonic; (8) steady state or stationary current signal assumptions are not necessary; (9) a familiar concept for motor control engineers; and (10) applicable to all multi-phase and single phase motors.

Do not need using signal of rotor magnetic linkage, through measuring the stator voltage, current and signal of rotational speed, the method of recursive least squares is made use of to carry on recognizing motor parameters. Through the identification of healthy motor and faulty motor, the relevant parameters of healthy motor and faulty motor are received. The change regulation of portion parameters before and after the motor broken is received. Some parameters will generate great change after motor broken. Based on this, it could pass parameter identification and faulty diagnosis toward the state of parameter deviate normal value.

SRM has been proposed for use in applications requiring certain fault tolerance. It is important to distinguish and characterize the inter-turn winding faults in SRM for maintenance and diagnostic purposes. In order to build an accurate model of SRM with and without faults, the effective magnetic equivalent circuit method is used to calculate the nonlinear flux-linkage characteristics under various winding fault conditions. ANN is applied for its well-known interpolation capabilities for the highly nonlinear SRM, with phase current, rotor position and a fault condition parameter as inputs and flux-linkage as output. Then, the dynamic models for the SRM with inter-turn winding faults are constructed. The analysis of the results from the faulty machine under different control strategies is presented and verifies the good performance of the developed method.

Application of rules extracted from a multilayer percentron network to moulding machine efficiency improvement	2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION ACQUISITION, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Information Acquisition	JUL 08-11, 2007	Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE			ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS	It has been found that artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely applied to manufacturing industry. Most of ANN-based applications focus on yield prediction and fault diagnosis. This paper describes a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network based method for tuning a moulding machine parameter. Once the MLP has been trained, we will draw 'IF-THEN' rules from it and find out which input parameters may significantly affect the moulding machine process efficiency. In additon, we can learn from rules that how to tune those input parameters. Moulding process engineers can accordingly tune a moulding machine input parameters and increase its efficiency. Practical numerical data obtained from a moulding machine at an IC packaging company in Taiwan justifies the feasibility of this method. It appears that the proposed method can be applied to other manufacturing process.

Several methods have previously been proposed to detect open switch faults in either the machine-side or line-side converter. The operating conditions that can cause possible false alarms with these methods are investigated. The proposed method detects open switch faults more reliably than any of the existing methods and hence improves overall system reliability. The performance of the existing methods and proposed methods has been verified by both simulation and experiment.	[Sae-Kok, W.; Grant, D.

This diagnosis is based on the analysis of the machine input line currents. However inverter-fed machines are becoming a common solution for industrial purposes. Power electronics technological advances allow good performance with competitive costs. Closed-loop drives represent a problem when current based fault detection techniques are used because in this kind of drives the controller regulates the machine input current. In order to keep the detection procedure non-invasive one should monitor the machine input voltage. In this paper the alpha beta-vector approach fault detection method is extended to inverter-fed induction machines.

To ensure the accuracy, and reliability of diagnosis, it is very important to extract the characteristic features of fault signals. Two feature extraction methods based on wavelet packet transform is proposed to treat transient signals: optimal wavelet packet transform (OWPT) and incomplete wavelet packet transform (IWPT). For the fault signals decomposed, the energy in each frequency band may be heightened or be reduced, so a novel 'energy-fault' method is put forward to extract fault features. The problem of fault diagnosis of analog circuit is actually a pattern recognition problem. Nowadays, the binary free support v;ector machines (BTSVMs) is usually used for multi-class classification, but the structure of the binary tree is closely related to the classification performance of binary tree support vector machines (BTSVMs). A new separability measure method based on the space distribution of pattern classes is applied to construct different binary trees. Three BTSVMs classifiers based on the separability measure are defined in this paper: inclined binary tree Support vector machines (IBTSVMs), balanced binary tree support vector machines (BBTSVMs) and adaptive binary tree support vector machines (ABTSVMs). Simulation results show us that the OWPT method is prefect for soft fault diagnosis, the IWPT for hard fault diagnosis, and the BBTSVMs multi-classifier possesses better classification speed, the ABTSVMs multi-classifer better classification accuracy.

According to the nonstationarity of ICE signals, the scale-wavelet power spectrum (SWPS) of si signals was obtained by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The wavelet power (WP) distribution on different scales of each pattern is observed to be similar and mainly concentrated in particular scope of 1 similar to 32. By analyzing the diversity of SWPS distribution, the WP which is most sensitive to the characteristic of each pattern were extracted by the reduction algorithm of rough set (RS theory) as feature and taken as input to train the back-propagation neural network (BPNN). By the trained BPNN to dia,gnose the fault signals under detection, the correctness rate is 100%. The fault diagnosis method integrated on SPWS, RS and BPNN demonstrates to be efficient and feasible. It has preferable engineering applicability and referenced value to diagnosis for complex machines.

Based on the fractal property, an approach for vibration signal data compression and reconstruction is proposed. In this method, a signal is represented by parameters of affine maps and is reconstructed according to self-similarity represented by the IFS parameters. The total data size of such a representation is far less than the original time domain data size. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to resolving the bottleneck in remote transmission of large amount signals and improving the capability of remote equipment fault diagnosis system, the presented method has been applied to some actual vibration signals as well as simulation signals.

The fault information within Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is used to build fault diagnosis model and the fault diagnosis is accomplished according to the concentration distribution of typical fault gases in higher dimensional space. The proposed approach is constructing the most accuracy model from few training samples supporting, and it is very suitable to solve the problems of less typical fault data for diagnosis. The results of using the proposed model to analyse some known samples of testing data of faulty transformers show, that the model possesses strong solving ability to deal with the problem. Moreover,by comparing with the traditional dissolved gas analysis methods like the neutral network there is less fault data discriminated by the proposed model and the accuracy for power transformer fault diagnosis improved using our proposed model.

In accordance with the defects of traditional envelope analysis to specify the resonant frequency band manually, a new fault diagnosis method based on wavelet packet transform and zooming envelope analysis is proposed. Firstly, the modulated frequency of resonant frequency band is extracted for rolling bearing, and the original signal is reconstructed and the other interfering signals are filtered based on wavelet packet transform. Secondly, the recomposed signal is demodulated by Hilbert transform, the high-frequency natural vibration is removed and the envelope signal can be obtained. Thirdly, in order to improve frequency precision of the envelope signal, the FFT-FS spectrum zooming method is proposed also. Finally, the fault vibration of a type 6350 rolling bearing installed on DBE-56-N4 electric machine is measured in the laboratory to verify the theoretical analysis presented above.

The anticipation action, which characterizes this proactive maintenance strategy, is mainly based on monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and decision-making modules. Oil monitoring is a key component of successful condition monitoring program. It can be used as a proactive tool to identify the wear modes of rubbing pars and diagnoses the faults in machinery. But Diagnosis application relying on oil analysis technology must deal with uncertain knowledge and fuzzy input data. Besides other methods, Bayesian networks have been extensively applied to fault diagnosis with the advantages of uncertainty inference, however, in the area of oil monitoring, it is a new field.

Drawing inspiration from the biological systems, where the mechanisms of self-diagnosis and self-healing continuously operate for maintaining the functionality of the system, and exploiting the potentialities offered by the FPGAs, three important characteristics have been implemented in digital systems: self-replication, self-test and self-repair. Particularly, the paper describes the realization of the bio-inspired architecture on FPGA, focusing in detail the timing of the state machine of each cell, that manages the operation of the device and the properties of self-replication, self-test and self-repair.

The methodology considers two autonomous modules, and assumes the existence of fault indicators (for monitoring purposes) and the availability of real-time measurements. A fault detection an identification (FDI) module uses a hybrid state-space model of the plant, and a particle filtering algorithm to calculate the probability of a crack in one of the blades of the turbine; simultaneously computing the state probability density function (pdf) estimates that will be used as initial conditions in the prognosis module. The failure prognosis module, on the other hand, computes the remaining useful life (RUL) pdf of the faulty subsystem in real-time, using a particle-filtering-based algorithm that consecutively updates the current state estimate for a nonlinear state-space model (with unknown time-varying parameters), and predicts the evolution in time of the probability distribution for the crack length. The outcome of the prognosis module provides information about precision and accuracy of long-term predictions, RUL expectations and 95% confidence intervals for the failure condition under study. Data from a seeded fault test is used to validate the proposed approaches.

It is possible to recognize a fault location from measured voltage and current information by using a Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) which only needs a learning process of relation between the locations and their voltage and current characteristics. Diagnosis methods for some types of apparatus are proposed by using the SOM. First a diagnosis method for a three-phase PWM inverter which may have a switch fault is proposed. Twelve types of switch fault patterns are analyzed for its DC and harmonic components which are used as input data for their diagnosis map. The method is also applied to a multi-level, for example, three-level inverter. Secondly a diagnosis method of a linear induction motor which may have a turn or a turn-to-turn fault is proposed. Diagonal impedance for all fault cases under considerations are used for the SOM learning process and they are checked for their fault detections. Finally a diagnosis method for an induction machine which may have a turn fault is proposed. An impedance, which is a small slip-dependent term and expresses the degree of motor asymmetry, is computed from two sets of applied input voltages and currents and used as SOM input data. A simple mathematical model of an induction motor with the reference frame transformation is investigated. The above application examples are all validated for its simulated results by developed Matlab programs.

The Daubechies wavelet function is used to extract fault features from measured vibration signals and to capture hidden fault information across an optimum frequency region. We also propose a new diagnosis method based on a fuzzy neural network realized by the partially-linearized neural network (PNN), one which can automatically distinguish fault types on the basis of the probability distributions of symptom parameters. The diagnosis knowledge for the training of the PNN can be acquired by using the RS. The PNN can deal with the ambiguity problem of diagnosis, and is always convergent. Practical examples of diagnosis for a centrifugal pump system are shown in order to verify the efficiency of the method.

The standard procedure with Support Vectors Machines uses Platt's method to fit a sigmoid that transforms continuous outputs into probabilities. The method proposed here exploits the difference between maximizing the AUC and minimizing the error rate in binary classification tasks. The conclusion is that it is preferable to optimize the AUC first (using a multivariate SVM) to then fit a sigmoid. We provide experimental evidence in favor of our proposal. For this purpose, we used data collected in general ICUs at 10 hospitals in Spain; 6 of these include coronary patients, while the other 4 do not treat coronary diseases. The total number of patients considered in our study was 2501.

Using process-level redundancy to exploit multiple cores for transient fault tolerance	37TH ANNUAL IEEE/IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks	JUN 25-28, 2007	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	IEEE Comp Soc, TCDCFT, IFIP WG10 4			COMPUTER; SOFTWARE	Transient faults are emerging as a critical concern in the reliability of general-purpose microprocessors. As architectural trends point towards multi-threaded multi-core designs, there is substantial interest in adapting such parallel hardware resources for transient fault tolerance. This paper proposes a software-based multi-core alternative for transient fault tolerance using process-level redundancy (PLR). PLR creates a set of redundant processes per application process and systematically compares the processes to guarantee correct execution. Redundancy at the process level allows the operating system to freely schedule the processes across all available hardware resources. PLR's software-centric approach to transient fault tolerance shifts the focus from ensuring correct hardware execution to ensuring correct software execution. As a result, PLR ignores many benign faults that do not propagate to affect program correctness. A real PLR prototype for running single-threaded applications is presented and evaluated for fault coverage and performance. On a 4-way SMP machine, PLR provides improved performance over existing software transient fault tolerance techniques with 16.9% overhead for fault detection on a set of optimized SPEC2000 binaries.

C	Zhu, Q; Yuan, C				Zhu, Qijun; Yuan, Chun			A reinforcement learning approach to automatic error recovery	37TH ANNUAL IEEE/IFIP INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEPENDABLE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	37th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks	JUN 25-28, 2007	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	IEEE Comp Soc, TCDCFT, IFIP WG10 4				The increasing complexity of modern computer systems makes fault detection and localization prohibitively expensive, and therefore fast recovery from failures is becoming more and more important. A significant fraction of failures can be cured by executing specific repair actions, e.g. rebooting, even when the exact root causes are unknown. However, designing reasonable recovery policies to effectively schedule potential repair actions could be difficult and error prone. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automate recovery policy generation with Reinforcement Learning techniques. Based on the recovery history of the original user-defined policy, our method can learn a new, locally optimal policy that outperforms the original one. In our experimental work on data from a real cluster environment, we found that the automatically generated policy can save 10% of machine downtime.

However, existing solutions are isolated from enterprise systems and limited to specific applications. A predictive maintenance framework that integrates the diversity of existing techniques for equipment failure predictions and that incorporates data both from machine level and the upper enterprise level is still missing. We envision the development of a predictive maintenance framework that is characterized by a high degree of automation and the possibility to use state-of-the-art prediction methods. We attempt to create an open architecture that enables third-party suppliers to integrate their specialized prediction components into our framework. In this paper we analyze the requirements and introduce the initial architecture associated with such a predictive maintenance framework, which is being realized in a joint project with SAP Research.

Firstly, stress wave theories of low-speed rotating machines are discussed. And then this paper described the basic principles of BSS, and a kind of non-linear neural network is used in consideration of the complex behavior of vibration, either nonlinear or random. After that BSS was applied to the experimental simulations for diagnosing the rubbing and looseness defects. Finally the processing results of a real process show that the new method based on non-linear blind source separation studied in this paper can simply and effectively remove the noise contained in the vibration signals and extract the multi-fault features to avoid the grand accidence.

Feature ranking method was introduced to explore the salient elements for cancer identification and simultaneous improve the classification accuracy. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) combined with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for feature ranking and filtering were applied to distinguish between the benign and malignant tumours of breast and evaluate the prognostic risk of recrudescence and metastasis. The results reveal that feature ranking method SNR can effectively pick out the informative and important features, which had significance for clinical assistant diagnosis and is useful for improving the performance of evaluation. The best overall accuracy for breast cancer diagnosis and evaluating the prognostic risk of recrudescence and metastasis achieved 96.24% and 88.81% respectively, by using SVM-Sigmoid and SVM-RBF combined with SNR under 5-fold cross validation. This study suggests that SVM may be further developed to be a practical methodology for clinical assistant differentiating between benign and malignant tumours and possible to help the inexperienced physicians avoid misdiagnosis. It also has benefit to the cured patients who are predicted as recrudescence and metastasis pay more attention to their diseases, and then reduce the mortality rate of breast cancer.

The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a popular unsupervised neural network, has been used for failure detection but with two limitations: needing predefined static architecture and lacking ability for the representation of hierarchical relations in the data. This paper presents a novel study on failure detection of gearbox using the Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map (GHSOM), an artificial neural network model with hierarchical architecture composed of independent growing SOMs. The GHSOM can adapt its architecture during unsupervised training process and provide a global orientation in the individual layers of the hierarchy; hence the original data structure can be described correctly for machine faults diagnosis. Gearbox vibration signals measured under different operating conditions are analyzed using the proposed technique. The results prove that the hierarchical relations in the gearbox failure data can be intuitively represented, and inherent structure can be unfolded. Then gearbox operating conditions including normal, tooth cracked and tooth broken are classified and recognized clearly. The study confirms that GHSOM is very useful and effective for pattern recognition in mechanical fault diagnosis, and provides a good potential for application in practice.

The dependence of production facilities on a high and constant availability increases with the degree of utilization. Hence, the availability of machine tools is substantial for the economic success of a manufacturer. The configuration of equipment elements in line with adapted product-accompanying services decisively contributes to the availability assurance. Thus, the aim of the article is to present a comprehensive calculation model to optimize the Life-Cycle-Performance of machine tools by a suitable reliability and availability prognosis considering the availability contribution of alternative machine equipment options and product accompanying services.

Many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural network, support vector machine that are unable to accommodate new information as it becomes available into their existing models. This paper presents a new method to bushing fault condition monitoring using fuzzy ARTMAP(FAM). FAM is introduced for bushing condition monitoring because it has the ability to incrementally learn information as it becomes available. An ensemble of classifiers is used to improve the classification accuracy of the systems. The testing results show that FAM ensemble gave an accuracy of 98.5%. Furthermore, the results show that fuzzy ARTMAP can update its knowledge in an incremental fashion without forgetting previously learned information.

In the model, the wavelet packet analysis and LSSVM are combined effectively. The power spectrum of fault signals are decomposed by wavelet packet analysis, which predigests choosing method of fault eigenvectors. And then the LSSVM is adopted to realize fault diagnosis. The non-sensitive loss function is replaced by quadratic loss function and the inequality constraints are replaced by equality constraints. Consequently, quadratic programming problem is simplified as the problem of solving linear equation groups, and the SVM algorithm is realized by least squares method. It is presented to choose parameter of kernel function in definite range by dynamic way, which enhances preciseness rate of recognition. The simulation results show the model has strong non-linear solution and anti-jamming ability, and it can effectively distinguish fault type.

The artificial intelligent such as neural network is widely used in fault diagnosis and substituted for traditional methods. In rotary machinery, the symptoms of vibration signals in frequency domain have been used as inputs to the neural network and diagnosis results are obtained by network computation. However, in gear or rolling bearing system, it is difficult to extract the symptoms from vibration signals in frequency domain which have shock vibration signals. The diagnosis results are not satisfied by using artificial neural network, if the training samples are not enough. The Bayesian networks (BN) is an effective method for uncertain knowledge and less information in faults diagnosis. In order to classify the instantaneous shock of vibration signals in gear train system, the statistical parameters of vibration signals in time-domain are used in this study. These statistical parameters include kurtosis, crest, skewness factors etc. There, based on the statistical parameters of vibration signals in time-domain, the fault diagnosis is implemented by using BN and compared with two methods back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) in gear train system.

The core idea is to convert the associated fault signature to a dc quantity, followed by calculating the signal average value in the new reference frame to filter out the rest of the signal harmonics, i.e. its ac components. Broken rotor bar and rotor eccentricity faults are experimentally tested both offline using the data acquisition systems and online employing the TMS320F2812 DSP to prove the efficacy of the proposed tool. The proposed method has been theoretically and experimentally to detect the fault harmonics and determine the existence proven to and the severity of machine faults. The advantages of this method include the following: (1) no need to employ external hardware or a PC running a high level program; (2) provides instantaneous fault monitoring using a DSP controller in real time; (3) embedded Into the motor drive; thus, readily available drive sensors and the core processor are used. without employing, additional hardware; (4) no need to store machine currents data, and thus no need for large memory size; (5) very short convergence time capability; (6) immune to non-idealities like sensor dc offsets, imbalance; etc.; (7) no need for a notch filter to filter out the fundamental harmonic; (8) steady state or stationary current signal assumptions are not necessary; (9) a familiar concept for motor-control engineers; and (10) applicable to all multi-phase and signal phase motors.

An on-line stator turn fault detection method for interior PM synchronous motor drives	APEC 2007: TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL IEEE APPLIED POWER ELECTRONICS CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1 AND 2	Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC 2007)	FEB 25-MAR 01, 2007	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc			INDUCTION MACHINES; INSULATION; DIAGNOSIS; FAILURE	An on-line stator turn fault detection scheme, which is suitable for detecting turn faults in interior PM synchronous motor (IPMSM) drives, is proposed in this paper. It is investigatted that the asymmetries in the machine parameters caused by turn faults in current-controlled voltage source inverter (CCVSI)-driven applications result in a reduced positive sequence component of the machine terminal voltages; furthermore, the reduction should be reflected in the voltage references because of the control action on the currents. It is also figured out that the variations in the voltage references can be easily observed in the synchronous rotating reference frame. Based on these facts, a stator turn fault detection method that does not require calculation of sequence components and importantly does not require measurements of the machine terminal voltages is proposed and verified through experiments.

According to theory and experimentation, the fault signatures caused by the inverter harmonics are similar and comparable to those generated by the fundamental harmonic of the line current. Unlike the utility-driven motor, monitoring the current of the inverter-fed motor is considerably noisy, which can mask the fault signatures and render a wrong fault warning. Therefore, the proposed additional fault data processing technique is expected to support the inverter-fed motor fault decision making algorithms effectively. The theoretically derived bearing fault relations are found to match the experimental results. In order to confirm these claims, outer race bearing faults are tested and the line current spectrum of the faulty motor is compared to the healthy one.

An early diagnosis and the use of drugs interfering with the main pathogenic pathways of PAH is pivotal for the improvement of prognosis in primary PAH and PAH secondary to autoimmune rheumatic diseases, mainly SSc. Lately, new specific therapies have been developed targeting prostacyclin, endothelin, and nitric oxide pathways, the major pathogenic pathways leading to endothelial dysfunction in PAH. Epoprostenol improved life expectancy of patients with primary and secondary PAH, but its continuous intravenous administration requires experienced centers. More stable analogues of prostacyclin, administrated by intravenous (iloprost, treprostinil), subcutaneous, inhalatory (treprostinil, iloprost), and oral route (Beraprost) have shown efficacy in PAH. Bosentan, the first oral endothelin receptor antagonist (with affinity for endothelin A and B receptors) improves exercise function and survival in PAH, both primary and secondary to autoimmune rheumatic diseases. This is confirmed also for Sitaxsentan and Ambrisentan, selective A receptor antagonists. Because of its short half-life and systemic side effects, short-term NO inhalation is used only in short-term management of PAH in critically ill adults. Inhibitors of NO degradation, such as sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitor, improved functional and hemodynamic parameters without significant side effects. Vardenafil and taladafil, longer-acting PDE inhibitors, also have vascular pulmonary selectivity. All these drugs may be used in combination, to maximize their clinical benefit not only in patients unresponsive to single drugs, but also potentially as initial therapy of PAH.

Firstly, analyzing characters of the optimal wavelet packet transform and the incomplete wavelet packet transform, the conclusion that the latter is perfect for fault diagnosis of analog circuit is obtained. Secondly, in order to perform multi-class classification, binary-tree-based SVMs has been studied. By introducing the separability measure that based on the space distribution of pattern classes, an improved balanced binary-tree structure is constructed. The proposed algorithm for analog circuits with tolerances and noise is implemented, and simulation results show us that compared with several existent fault diagnosis methods, the current algorithm has highest classification speed and higher classification accuracy, which make fault diagnosis of analogy circuit on-line promising.

Existing Hardware-based Redundant Multi-Threading (HRMT) approaches rely mostly on special-purpose hardware to replicate the program into redundant execution threads and compare their computation results. In this paper, we present a Software-based Redundant Multi-Threading (SRMT) approach for transient fault detection. Our SRMT technique uses compiler to automatically generate redundant threads so they can run on general-purpose chip multi-processors (CMPs). We exploit high-level program information available at compile time to optimize data communication between redundant threads. Furthermore, our software-based technique provides flexible program execution environment where the legacy binary codes and the reliability-enhanced codes can co-exist in a mix-and-match fashion, depending on the desired level of reliability and software compatibility. Our experimental results show that compiler analysis and optimization techniques can reduce data communication requirement by up to 88% of HRMT. With general-purpose intra-chip communication mechanisms in CAP machine, SRMT overhead can be as low as 19%. Moreover, SRMT technique achieves error coverage rates of 99.98% and 99.6% for SPEC CPU2000 integer and floating-point benchmarks, respectively. These results demonstrate the competitiveness of SRMT to BRMT approaches.

This paper proposes the application of time-frequency methods, which can provide more information about a signal in time and in frequency and gives a better representation of the signal than the conventional methods in machinery diagnosis. In this paper, we review the machine diagnosis techniques based on the verification of classical vibration parameters. Then the necessity of using time-frequency analysis in machinery diagnostics is discussed. Finally, the theory of the Short-Time Fourier Transform, the Wigner-Ville distribution and the Wavelet transforms are briefly studied and their advantages are shown by some practical examples.

Current methods rely on the response of the machine to unbalance excitation during run-up, run-down or normal operation, and are mainly based on pattern recognition approaches. Of all machine faults, probably cracks in the rotor pose the greatest danger and research in crack detection has been ongoing for the past 30 years. For large unbalance forces the crack will remain permanently open and the rotor is then asymmetric, which can lead to stability problems. If the static deflection of the rotor due to gravity is large then the crack opens and closes due to the rotation of the shaft (a breathing crack), producing a parametrically excited dynamical system. Although monitoring the unbalance response of rotors is able to detect the presence of a crack, often the method is relatively insensitive, and the crack must be large before it can be robustly detected. Active magnetic bearings (AMB) have been used in high speed applications or where oil contamination must be prevented, although their low load capacity restricts the scope of applications. Recently a number of authors considered the use of AMBs as an actuator that is able to apply force to the shaft of a machine. If the applied force is sinusoidal, then the presence of the crack generates responses containing frequencies at combinations of the rotor spin speed and applied force. This paper discusses some of the issues to be addressed to enable this approach to become a robust condition monitoring technique for cracked shafts. In particular the following are considered and demonstrated using simulated results: the character and frequency of the force, the dynamics of the AMB, the choice of signal features for the detection, the effect of higher frequency resonances, the sensitivity to small crack depths, and the risk of reducing machine life by increased forcing, the response of other different system parameters. In addition the prospects of using AMBs to extend the life of the machine are discussed briefly.

At present, many methods such as vibration diagnosis, spectrometric oil analysis (SOA), etc. have been tried to detect and diagnose the failure of sliding bearing. But all of these methods have met some questions in the practice of industry, and can not monitor its failure in the initial period, so the acoustic emission method (AE) to diagnose its failure was introduced in this paper, including the introduction of the AE mechanism of sliding bearings in rotating machinery and the influence factors of AE signal intensity, and the synchronous detection of acoustic emission signals and bearing vibration signals in the abnormal situation. In addition, the AE signal characteristics and vibration signal characteristics are extracted. Furthermore, the relationship between AE parameters with the influence factors of sliding bearing is established. At the same time, a comparison between AE signal characteristics and vibration signal characteristics in the same conditions is presented. After experiment, it is concluded that AE sliding bearing fault diagnosis method is with high rates of diagnosis and accuracy, and the fault can be diagnosed early, compared with the sliding bearing vibration diagnosis method.

To better understand PHM requirements, we introduce a decision-making framework in which we analyze PHM decisional tasks. This framework is the cross product of the decision's time horizon and the domain knowledge used by SC models. Within such a framework, we analyze the progression from simple to annotated lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We use this metaphor to monitor the leverage of domain knowledge in SC to perform anomaly detection, anomaly identification, failure mode analysis (diagnostics), estimation of remaining useful life (prognostics), on-board control, and off board logistics actions. We illustrate a case study in anomaly detection, which is solved by the construction and fusion of an ensemble of diverse detectors, each of which is based on different SC technologies.

Early breast cancer prognosis prediction and rule extraction using a new constructive neural network algorithm	COMPUTATIONAL AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks	JUN 20-22, 2007	San Sebastian, SPAIN				INTERVALS	Breast cancer relapse prediction is an important step in the complex decision-making process of deciding the type of treatment to be applied to patients after surgery. Some non-linear models, like neural networks, have been successfully applied to this task but they suffer from the problem of extracting the underlying rules, and knowing how the methods operate can help to a better understanding of the cancer relapse problem. A recently introduced constructive algorithm (DASG) that creates compact neural network architectures is applied to a dataset of early breast cancer patients with the aim of testing the predictive ability of the new method. The DASC method works with Boolean input data and for that reason a transformation procedure was applied to the original data. The degradation in the predictive performance due to the transformation of the data is also analyzed using the new method and other standard algorithms.

Three-dimensional interactive Molecular Dynamics program for the study of defect dynamics in crystals	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						graphical user interface; molecular dynamics; crystal defects; molecular dynamics; Lennard-Jones; Sutton-Chen; EAM; dislocations; cracks; interfaces; visualization	EMBEDDED-ATOM-METHOD	The study of crystal defects and the complex processes underlying their formation and time evolution has motivated the development of the program ALINE for interactive molecular dynamics experiments. This program couples a molecular dynamics code to a Graphical User Interface and runs on a UNIX-X11 Window System platform with the MOTIF library, which is contained in many standard Linux releases. ALINE is written in C, thus giving the user the possibility to modify the source code, and, at the same time, provides an effective and user-friendly framework for numerical experiments, in which the main parameters can be interactively varied and the system visualized in various ways. We illustrate the main features of the program through some examples of detection and dynamical tracking of point-defects, linear defects, and planar defects, such as stacking faults in lattice-mismatched heterostructures. Method of solution: Simplifications of the simulation work described above strongly depend also oil the computer performance. It has now become possible to realize some of such simplifications thanks to the real possibility of using interactive programs. The solution proposed here is based on the development of an interactive graphical simulation program both for avoiding large storage of data and the subsequent elaboration and analysis as well as for visualizing and tracking many phenomena inside three-dimensional samples. However, the full Computational power of traditional simulation programs may not be available in general in programs with graphical user interfaces, due to their interactive nature. Nevertheless interactive programs can still be very useful for detecting processes difficult to visualize, restricting the range or making a fine tuning of the parameters. and tailoring the faster programs toward precise targets. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: The restrictions on the applicability of the program are related to the computer resources available. The graphical interface and interactivity demand computational resources that depend on the particular numerical simulation to be performed. To preserve a balance between speed and resources, the choice of the number of atoms to be simulated is critical. With an average current computer, simulations of systems with more than 105 atoms may not be easily feasible on an interactive scheme. Another restriction is related to the fact that the program was originally designed to simulate systems in the solid phase, so that problems in the simulation may occur if some particular physical quantities are computed beyond the melting point. Typical running time: It depends on the machine architecture, system size, and user needs. Unusual features of the program: In the program, besides the window in which the system is represented in real space, an additional graphical window presenting the real time distribution histogram for different physical variables (such as kinetic or potential energy) is included. Such tool is very interesting for making demonstrative numerical experiments for teaching purposes as well as for research, e.g., for detecting and tracking crystal defects.

However, most present systems do not contain prognostics capability which would allow operators to observe an unhealthy system component in its prefault condition. In industry applications, scheduled downtime can result in considerable cost avoidance. The next technology step is self-healing system components which observe not only potential problems, but can also take steps to continue operation under abnormal conditions - whether due to long-term normal wear-and-tear or sudden combat damage. in this paper, current and voltage information using the double-layer gate drive concept is fed to intelligent networks to identify the type of fault and its location. These intelligent networks are based on unsupervised and supervised learning networks (self-organizing maps and learning vector quantization networks respectively). The proposed concept allows the reconfiguration of the electric machinery system for continued normal operation of the machine. This paper presents an intelligent health monitoring and self-healing control strategy for a multi-phase multilevel motor drive under various types of faults.

The frequency-domain methods which are commonly used need speed information or accurate slip estimation for frequency components localization in any spectrum. Nevertheless, the fault frequency bandwidth can be well defined for any induction machine due to numerous previous investigations. The proposed approach consists in the energy evaluation of this known bandwidth with time-domain analysis using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then, it has been applied to the stator current space vector magnitude and the instantaneous magnitude of the stator current signal for different broken bar fault severities and load levels.

A number of turn fault detection techniques have been proposed; however, there is currently no method available for distinguishing turn faults from high-resistance(R) connections, which also result in 3 phase system asymmetry. It is important to distinguish the two faults since a high-R connection does not necessarily require immediate motor shutdown. In this paper, new sensorless on-line monitoring techniques for detecting and classifying stator turn faults and high-R electrical connections in induction machines based on the zero sequence voltage or negative sequence current measurements are proposed. An experimental study on a 10 hp induction motor performed under simulated turn faults and high-resistance circuit conditions verifies that the two faults can be reliably detected and classified. The proposed technique helps improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of the motor system and industrial plant, and also allows maintenance to be performed in a more efficient manner since the course of action can be determined based on the type and severity of the fault.

Both tools are applied to the stator startup current. The objective is to extract the evolution during the startup transient of the left sideband harmonic associated with the asymmetry, which constitutes a reliable evidence of the presence of the fault. The first tool is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and its validity for the diagnosis was proven by the authors in previous works, even in cases where the classical Fourier approach does not lead to correct results. Despite its good results, some constraints remained, such as the selection of an optimal mother wavelet or the possible overlap between frequency bands associated with the wavelet signals. In the paper, an alternative time-frequency decomposition tool, the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), is applied to the startup current for detecting the harmonic. This tool might allow avoiding some of the limitations of the DWT, maintaining its reliability. Both approaches are applied to experimental signals obtained under various operation conditions. Finally, the results are analyzed and compared, showing the robustness of both approaches for the diagnosis of rotor asymmetries in induction machines.	[Antonino-Daviu, J.

Nowadays, inductions motors are more frequently used with inverters which make the diagnosis process more complicated. The approach used in this paper, for the detection of a broken rotor bar in induction motor powered by a voltage fed inverter, is based on the analysis of the voltage taking place between the stator neutral and an artificial supply neutral. A comparison study with the well known Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is underlined. A theoretical analysis is investigated in order to depict all harmonic components related to the rotor defects in both line current and neutral voltage. These signatures are drawn by the phase analysis of Hilbert transform applied on the spectrum modulus of the line current and the neutral voltage.

So far, fault diagnostic techniques proposed for stator inter-turn fault detection in DFIG are based on analysis of stator current or vibration of generator. Results from these methods are ambiguous because either they fail to account for condition when DFIG is operating under unbalanced load or these methods are based on experimental results alone. Our recent observations suggested that harmonies induced in the rotor circuit are very promising in detecting stator inter-turn faults in DFIGs. Hence, in this study, an in-depth investigation was conducted to determine the origin of various harmonic components in the rotor currents and their feasibility to detect inter-turn stator faults unambiguously. Detailed analysis is presented that explains the induction of stator inter-turn fault related harmonics in the rotor circuit. The theory is verified with simulation and extensive experimental results.

When a machine is connected to the line, the startup transient is characterized by large stator (and rotor) currents, as well as by large slips (i.e., rotor speed significantly smaller than the excitation frequency). The stator current of machines with damaged rotors include large rotor speed dependent components during the startup transient. Such components, however, fade away or coincide with components not containing fault related information (e.g., saturation-induced components) once the machine reaches steady-state. Because of this, the startup transient provides an opportunity for performing diagnostics on the machine. The paper shows that the information contained in the startup transient signal can be effectively separated and detected using a complex vector wavelet transform.

There has been a long history of trying to develop and implement various degrees of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) capability on new applications like the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). A discussion of JSF's PHM system and its relationship to the Autonomic Logistics (AL) support concept will be presented in this paper. Overall PHM Architecture will be described with emphasis on its capabilities and its aims to enhance aircraft safety, improve Sortie Generation Rate, decrease Logistics Footprint and reduce Operation and Support costs. In order to enable the benefits of AL support concepts, PHM will be used also for prevention, control, and monitoring of airframe and component corrosion. Corrosion control has, in the past, consisted of visual inspection, corrosion removal, and coating system repair on a regular, recurring basis. This cycle continues throughout the life of an aircraft, and it consumes a significant amount of man-hours, support costs, and material needs. Use of newer maintenance philosophies such as Reliability-Centered Maintenance, as well as introduction of corrosion prevention compounds, upgraded coating systems, and PHM, leads to a reduction in Operation and Support costs, and provides a benefit to the user in terms of reduced down time and repair requirements. Data collection, from location monitoring to tracking of inspection and repair trends, provides a key element for the continual update and refinement of a maintenance program. This paper will describe some of the innovations in aircraft maintenance practices, task interval determination, and design strategies that can be applied to JSF, and can have a positive impact to the aircraft and to the end user.

Consistency-based diagnosis is capable of performing automatic fault detection and localization using just correct behaviour models. Nevertheless, it may exhibit low discriminative power among fault candidates. Hence, we combined the consistency based approach with machine learning techniques specially developed for fault identification of dynamic systems. In this work, we apply Stacking to generate time series classifiers from classifiers of its univariate time series components. The Stacking scheme proposed uses K-NN with Dynamic Time Warping as a dissimilarity measure for the level 0 learners, and Naive Bayes at level 1. The method has been tested in a fault identification problem for a laboratory scale continuous process plant. Experimental results show that, for the available data set, the former Stacking configuration is quite competitive, compare to other methods like tree induction, Support Vector Machines or even K-NN and Naive Bayes as stand alone methods.

This property is so symptomatic when an incipient fault develops that it can be efficiently exploited for diagnostics. This paper gives a synthetic but comprehensive discussion about this issue. First, the cyclostationarity of bearing signals is proved from a simple phenomenological model. Once this property is established, the question is then addressed of which spectral quantity can adequately characterise such vibration signals. In this respect, the cyclic coherence - and its multi-dimensional extension in the case of multi-sensors measurements -- is shown to be twice optimal: first to evidence the presence of a fault in high levels of background noise, and second to return a relative measure of its severity. These advantages make it an appealing candidate to be used in adverse industrial environments. The use and interpretation of the proposed toot are then illustrated on actual industrial measurements, and a special attention is paid to describe the typical "cyclic spectral signatures" of inner race, outer race, and rolling-element faults.

Deconvolution is one system identification technique for fault detection when signals captured from bearings with and without flaw are both available. However effects of measurement systems and noise are obstacles to the technique. In the present study, a model, namely autoregressive-moving average (ARMA), is used to estimate vibration pattern of rolling element bearings for fault detection. The frequently used ARMA estimator cannot characterize non-Gaussian noise completely. Aimed at circumventing the inefficiency of the second-order statistics-based ARMA estimator, higher-order statistics (HOS) was introduced to ARMA estimator, which eliminates the effect of noise greatly and, therefore, offers more accurate estimation of the system. Furthermore, bispectrums of the estimated HOS-based ARMA models were subsequently applied to get clearer information. Impulse responses of signals captured from the test bearings without and with flaws and their bispectra were compared for the purpose of fault detection. The results demonstrated the excellent capability of this method in vibration signal processing and fault detection.

Aero-engine, as one kind of rotating machine with complex structure and high rotating speed, has complicated vibration faults. As one kind of AI methods, RBF neural network has the advantages of fast learning, high accuracy and strong self-adapting ability. Support vector machine, another AI method, only needs a small quantity of fault data samples to train the classifier and does not need to extract signal features. In this paper, the applications of two AI methods on aero-engine vibration fault diagnosis are introduced. Firstly, the principles and algorithm of both two methods are presented. Secondly the fundamentals of two-shaft aero-engine vibration fault diagnosis are described and gotten the standard fault samples (training samples) and simulation samples (testing samples). Third, two AI methods are applied to the vibration fault diagnosis and obtained the diagnostic results. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are compared such as the computing speed, accuracy of diagnosis and complexity of algorithm, and given a suggestion of selecting the diagnostic methods.

The Authors propose decomposing the finite state machine (FSAP which describes the sequential circuit of interest, thus obtaining a number of component FSMs respectively describing the number of component circuits. Being decomposed to the number of component circuits, the initial circuit becomes able to detect faults much faster since, at each specific moment of time, one of the component circuits (FSMs) is working and all the others are being tested. The paper deals with the following aspects: a) the decomposition procedure; b) evaluation of the proposed approach based on.fbetween the reduction of latency and a fault injection simulation; c) estimation of trade-off the required hardware overhead. Results of the study are tested on a number of standard benchmarks.				i.levin@ieee.org; avrainov@post.tau.ac.il; vladio@post.fart.ac.il					Almukhaizim S, 2004, DESIGN, AUTOMATION AND TEST IN EUROPE CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION, VOLS 1 AND 2, PROCEEDINGS, P596, DOI 10.1109/DATE.2004.1268910; BARANOV S, 1994, LOGIC SYNTHESIS CONT; Baraza JC, 2002, J SYST ARCHITECT, V47, P847, DOI 10.1016/S1383-7621(01)00036-4; Boue J, 1998, DIG PAP INT SYMP FAU, P168, DOI 10.1109/FTCS.1998.689467; Busaba F.

Fault detection in induction motors using Hilbert and Wavelet transforms	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Hilbert transform; wavelet transform; fault detection; broken bar detection; motor fault detection; motor failure diagnosis; statistical analysis	STANDARD-DEVIATION; MODEL; BIAS	In this work, a new on-line method for detecting incipient failures in electrical motors is proposed. The method is based on monitoring certain statistical parameters estimated from the analysis of the steady state stator current (for broken bars, saturation, eccentricities, and bearing failures) or the axial flux signal (for coil short-circuits in the stator windings). The approach is based on the extraction of the envelop of the signal by Hilbert transformation, pre-multiplied by a Tukey window to avoid transient distortion. Then a wavelet analysis (multi-resolution analysis) is performed, which makes the fault diagnosis easier. Finally, based on a statistical analysis, the failure thresholds are determined. Thus, by monitoring the mean value estimate it is possible to detect an incipient failure condition on the machine.

Finite element transient analysis of an on-load three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor with static eccentricity	ELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						induction motor; eccentricity; fault; finite element	SPACE MODELING ENVIRONMENT; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; ABC FRAME; ROTOR; MACHINE; PERFORMANCE; DIAGNOSTICS; CONNECTORS; CIRCUITS; DRIVES	This paper presents the static eccentricity fault diagnosis using time stepping finite element (TSFE) method. In the previous publications on induction motor fault diagnosis by a finite-element method (FEM), steady-state analysis was proposed. White noise, large unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP), and even arc appear during the starting of a faulty induction motor. These phenomena particularly for large induction motor which have longer starting time are very important. In this paper, transient analysis of induction motor under fault is presented. In addition to the static eccentricity fault diagnosis, torque and speed due to the fault are also investigated. In order to show the significant effect of saturation on a faulty induction motor, simulations are carried out for a core with a constant permeability. The results of applying TSFE method and those obtained by application of winding function (WF) theory are compared.

Signature analysis of electrical and mechanical signals for diagnosis of broken rotor bars in an induction motor	ELECTROMAGNETICS			English	Article						induction motor; broken rotor bar; TSFE; fault	FINITE-ELEMENT-METHOD; STATE SPACE MODEL; AIR-GAP; ELECTROMAGNETIC FORCES; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CAGE ROTOR; ECCENTRICITY; HARMONICS; MACHINES	In this paper, diagnosis of broken rotor bar faults in induction motors is presented using a time-stepping, finite element (TSFE) technique. Stator current, magnetic flux distribution, magnetic potential vector, magnetic flux density, torque, and speed of the healthy motor and motor with broken rotor bars are calculated. By analyzing the current spectrum, torque, and speed and also by precise analysis of the air gap magnetic field, the occurrence and extent of the broken rotor bars, unbalanced stator current, noise, vibration, and pulsation torque in a faulty induction motor are investigated. In previous publications on the fault diagnosis of induction motors, only one of the above-mentioned signals was used for diagnosis. However, here precise computation and analysis of the field, current, torque, speed and their relationship and interaction in the analysis and diagnosis of the broken rotor bars are considered.

However, the fault rate of reciprocating compressors is very high in technologic processes because of the complexity of their structure and movement forms. An on-line condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system for reciprocating compressors has been developed according to their fault characteristics. Some important condition parameters such as working pressure and working temperature inside the cylinders, vibration of horizontal, vertical and transversal directions, working speed and the displacement of the piston rod, etc can be monitored on-line and transmitted to remote-distance computers by networks. The working principle, hardware design, software design are presented. The predictive condition maintenance of reciprocating compressors can be realized. The monitoring system can ensure that the reciprocating compressors work reliably and safely.

The fault signature is based on the analysis of the negative sequence symmetrical component of the current. Two approaches are described and compared: the spectral analysis of the signature using the Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT), the Short-time Discrete Fourier Transform (SDFT), the Gortzel algorithm and the synchronous demodulation of the current space vector. The theoretical principles of these methods are presented and their performances compared. The main purpose of this study lies in the investigation of the computational tools dedicated to the diagnosis and minimization of computing time. These methods are applied to an induction machine of 1.1 kW.

A mechanistic force model has been established for high speed milling on hardened stavax steel with 6mm micro-grain tungsten carbide 2 flute ball-nose end mill. The threshold curve can be obtained off-line based on the process model as the cutting engagement conditions along the tool path are determined at the simulation stage. The measured cutting forces are monitored on-line to detect the faults by comparing them with the threshold curve at machining stage. If a fault is detected at certain position along the tool path, an intelligent predictive method developed in [1] is utilized to predict whether this fault will result in catastrophic failure. experimental results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.

However, various faults can occur, such as stator short-circuits and rotor failures. We focus our study on the latter since the unknown evolution of rotor currents in the squirrel cage makes the detection of the rotor's failures very difficult. In this paper, we present the effects of the rotor failures by multi-windings model simulation and we use a technique based on the spectral analysis of stator current in order to detect a breakdown or a defect in the rotor. Thus, the number and the position effect of rotor bars have been studied and a comparison between simulation and experimental results has been realized. The effect is highlighted by considering the machine supplied through a balanced three phase voltage network for the simulation as well as for the experimental tests.

It is significant to improve squirrel-cage asynchronous motors diagnosis technique in application. It helps to decrease the occurrence of accident and reduce the cost of maintenance. Based on the wavelet packet-neural network the scheme on the real-time diagnosis of the stator, bearing, and eccentricity fault of squirrel-cage asynchronous motors is presented in this paper. The electric machines stator current signal is analyzed and processed, with wavelet packet decomposition algorithm. By this method the problem that conventional FFT algorithm can't provide any partial information in time domain is solved. The eigenvectors of bearing and eccentricity fault that processed by wavelet packet decomposition algorithm. The eigenvectors are tiny. The neural networks are not convergent easily when they are trained, with these eigenvectors as above. To this problem, this paper gives a novel scheme based on logarithm fault eigenvectors extraction. By the logarithm fault eigenvectors proposed, the fault of squirrel-cage asynchronous motors can be real time diagnosed and categorized precisely. This scheme is feasible, which is proved by the test experiment.

Machine learning could provide invaluable support for automatically inferring diagnostic rules from descriptions of past cases, making the diagnosis process more objective and reliable. Since the problem involves both test and misclassification costs, we have analyzed ICET, the most prominent approach in the literature for complex cost problems. The hybrid algorithm tries to avoid the pitfalls of traditional greedy induction by performing a heuristic search in the space of possible decision trees through evolutionary mechanisms. Our implementation solves some of the problems of the initial ICET algorithm, proving it to be a viable solution for the problem considered.

Deriving specifications for systems that are connected to the physical world	FORMAL METHODS AND HYBRID REAL-TIME SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Formal Methods and Hybrid Real-Time Systems held in Honour of Dines Bjorner/Zhou Chaochen	SEP 24-25, 2007	Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA					Well understood methods exist for developing programs from formal specifications. Not only do such methods offer a precise check that certain sorts of deviations from their specifications are absent from implementations but they can also increase the productivity of the development process by careful use of layers of abstraction and refinement in design. These methods, however, presuppose a specification from which to begin the development. For tasks that are fully described in terms of the symbolic values within a machine, inventing a specification is not difficult but there is an increasing demand for systems in which programs interact with an external physical world. Here, the task of fixing the specification for the "silicon package" can be more challenging than the development itself. Such applications include control programs that attempt to bring about changes in the physical world via actuators and measure things in that external (to the silicon package) world via sensors. Furthermore, most systems of this class must tolerate failures in the physical components outside the computer: it then becomes even harder to achieve confidence that the specification is appropriate. This paper offers a systematic way to derive the specification of a control program. Furthermore, our approach leads to recording assumptions about the physical world. We also discuss separating the detection and management of faults from system operation in the absence of faults. This discussion is linked to the distinction between "normal" and "radical" design.

When mission objectives cannot be reached for the control system since unanticipated operating conditions exists, namely a failure, the mission plan must be revised or altered according to the health monitoring system assessment. Representation of the system health knowledge must facilitate interaction with the control system to compensate for subsystem degradation. Several generic architectures have been described for the implementation of health monitoring systems and their integration with the control system. In particular, the OSA-CBM approach is considered in this work as initial point, and it is evolved in the sense of self-health awareness, by defining an appropriated multi-agent smart health management architecture based on smart device models, communication agents and a distributed control system, A case study about its application on fuel-cells as auxiliary power generator will demonstrate the integration.

Aero-engine, as one kind of rotating machine with complex structure and high rotating speed, has complicated vibration faults. ANN is a good tool for aero-engine fault diagnosis, since they have strong ability to learn complex nonlinear functions. Data mining has advantages of discovering knowledge from mountain of data, providing a simple way to interpret complex decision problem, and automatically extract diagnostic rules to replace the expert's advice. This paper presents application of the two methods on aero-engine vibration fault diagnosis and then makes a comparison between them. From the study of this paper, both the two methods are effective on aero-engine vibration fault diagnosis, while each of them has its individual quality.

In order to process the non-stationary vibration signals such as run-up or run-down vibration signals effectively, the order bi-spectrum technique is presented This new method combines computed order tracking technique with bi-spectrum analysis. Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments during run-up of gearbox and then uses numerical techniques to resample the data at constant angle increments. Therefore, the vibration signals are transformed from the time domain transient signal to angle domain stationary one. In the end, the resampled signals are processed by bi-spectrum analysis method The experimental results show that order tracking and bi-spectrum technique can effectively diagnosis the gear faults.

As the fault information of power transformers has uncertainty characteristic, in this paper a novel approach based on rough set theory and SVM is proposed. Moreover by comparing with the traditional methods like the neural network, there is less fault data discriminated by the rough set theory and SVM model and the accuracy for power transformer fault diagnosis is improved using our proposed model.

If done correctly, CBM has the benefits such as reducing catastrophic failures, minimizing maintenance and logistical cost, maximizing, system security and availability and improving platform reliability. A CBM system usually has four major functional modules, namely feature extraction, diagnostics, prognostics and decision support. Among them, fault prognostics is the most important enabling technology. It is the most challenging research area which is so called crystal ball of most challenging CBM. But it has the potential to be the most beneficial. This paper presents a fault prognostic algorithm. based on a generic wavelet neural networks (WNN) architecture. Its training process based on genetic algorithm is described in detail. Finally, the fault prognostic algorithm has been verified using a simulation experiment, and the results are very satisfactory.

A hybrid method combining feature selection and generation in a wrapper based approach via evolutionary algorithm was proposed to automatically generate feature set, and SVM was proposed to serve as an inductive learner for the evaluation of the feature set both as a classifier for the whole diagnosis system. The whole diagnosis process is in a full-automatic way. First, training stage is carried out. Original data with known features was directly sent to the IFD system and then selected features together with generated features are determined by the evolution of SVM learner. Finally, test stage is on the way. Test feature sets are put into SVM classifier, and IFD outputs current fault patterns, which terminates the whole diagnosis process. Applications in TEP data sets prove this method effective and robust.

Firstly, output voltage signals from the test nodes are obtained from analog circuits test points and the fault feature vectors are extracted from haar wavelet transform coefficients. Then, after training the HSVM by faulty feature vectors, the HSVM model of the circuit fault diagnosis system is built. Finally, combing D-S theory with probabilistic interpretation of SVM scores estimate confidences over the prediction, which improves diagnosis results.

We built this system by given a faulty circuit. Based on the transient response testing (TRT) on the mixed-signal circuits, both analog and digital signal characteristics are unified. The system includes knowledge base, reasoning machine, explanatory, and interface. The diagnostic portion of the system is based on neural-calculation approach, which is used to establish the knowledge base composed of the weigh values and threshold values. With this approach, conclusions are developed directly from the outputs of the net, rather than the domain knowledge in traditional expert system. Compared with the traditional expert system, this-system is good at processing data. The experimental results show that the system not only improves the shortcoming of the traditional expert system such as the deficiency on knowledge acquisition and self-learning capability, but also achieves a satisfied fault diagnosis efficiency.

It continuously provides the machine status which allows the detection of abnormalities and problems at incipient stages as well as the intervention of maintenance and production personnel at proper time to keep the plant running and to avoid serious accidents. Most of rotating machine failures is due to bearing faults. The ability to predict the bearing failure at early stage is of great importance. This paper discusses the concept of acoustic emission (AE) monitoring techniques, in which signal processing measurements are used to create a simple integrated structure for the integration of condition monitoring and real-time information management of systems. This allows AE signals with frequency range 100 KHz - 1MHz to be processed and analyzed using advanced signal processing and data analysis techniques. The effectiveness for AE monitoring system for early detection of healthy bearing is conducted. A system that is being developed to provide a test-bed for this concept is described.

Using a special motor design and an appropriate inverter topology, brushless permanent magnet AC motor drives can have a fault-tolerant capability. This paper considers a dual motor drive system on a common shaft to introduce redundancy. The paper provides a systematic classification for the potential electrical faults which may occur in a real motor drive. In the paper, the switch and winding short circuit fault detection and identification methods are studied and experimental results are presented. In addition, the effects of switch faults on the phase currents and output torque are discussed, and remedial strategies for these faults are proposed. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated using simulation results that the proposed remedial strategies can compensate for the loss of torque due to the switch faults and can keep the peak-to-peak torque ripple factor comparable to healthy operation of the drive.

In order to solve these practical application problems, a novel model of one-class bearing fault detection based on SVDD and Genetic Algorithm is presented in this paper. The time domain statistics features are processed as inputs to SVDD for one-class (normal) recognition. Then SVDD is used to describe the normal data distribution characteristics with high data description ability. The SVDD is trained only with a subset of normal samples. This paper also analyzes the behavior of the classifier based on parameter selection and proposes a novel way based on genetic algorithm to determine the optimal threshold parameters. The hybrid one-class classification model of SVDD and Genetic Algorithm is determined to address the problem of difficultly collecting abnormal samples in bearing fault detection. Comparison of the performance of detection of SVDD with different kernel parameters is experimented. This hybrid approach is compared against other MLP detection techniques. The results show the relative effectiveness of the proposed classifiers in detection of the bearing condition with some concluding remarks.

In many bearing fault detection application, only positive (normal) samples are available for training purposes, Then RNCS is used to generate probabilistically a set of fault detectors that can detect any abnormalities(including faults and damages) in the behavior pattern of bearings. Faults occurring in machine elements are often related to non-linear effects which may lead to non-linearity in the machine vibration signature. HOS make it possible to analyze the structure of the output signal and to provide information related to the non-linearity within the system. The extracted HOS features matrix from original signals are transformed to SVD features which are used as inputs to RNCS for one-class (normal) recognition to address the problem of difficultly collecting abnormal samples in bearing fault detection. Comparison of the performance of detection of RNCS with different detector's numbers is experimented. This proposed approach is compared against other MLP detection techniques. The results show the relative effectiveness of the proposed classifiers in detection of the bearing condition with some concluding remarks.

This paper proposes an ARIMA approach to predict the future machine status with accuracy improvement by an improved forecasting strategy and an automatic prediction algorithm. Improved forecasting strategy increases the times of model building and creates datasets for modeling dynamically to avoid using the previous values predicted to forecast and generate the predictions only based on the true observations. Automatic prediction algorithm can satisfy the requirement of real-time prognostics by automates the whole process of ARIMA modeling and forecasting based on the Box-Jenkins's methodology and the improved forecasting strategy. The feasibility and effectiveness of the approach proposed is demonstrated through the prediction of the vibration characteristic in rotating machinery. The experimental results show that the approach can be applied successfully and effectively for prognostics of machine health condition.

The faults that are concerned correspond to changes in frequency components of the signal. Thus, early fault detection, which reduces the possibility of catastrophic damage, is possible by detecting the changes of characteristic features of the signal. This approach combines the Filters Bank technique, for extracting frequency and energy characteristic features, and the Dynamic Cumulative Sum method (DCS), which is a recursive calculation of the logarithm of the likelihood ratio between two local hypotheses. The main contribution is to derive the filters coefficients from the wavelet in order to use the filters bank as a wavelet transform. The advantage of our approach is that the filters bank can be hardware implemented and can be used for online detection.

One of the objectives of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems is to help reduce the number of unexpected failures by continuously monitoring the components of interest and predicting their failures sufficiently in advance to allow for proper planning. In other words, PHM systems may help turn unexpected failures into expected ones. Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of data mining to help build prognostic models for PHM but also has identified the need for new model evaluation methods that take into account the specificities of prognostic applications. This paper investigates this problem. First, it reviews classical and recent methods to evaluate data mining models and it explains their deficiencies with respect to prognostic applications. The paper then proposes a novel approach that overcomes these deficiencies. This approach integrates the various costs and benefits involved in prognostics to quantify the cost saving expected from a given prognostic model. From the end user's perspective, the formula is practical as it is easy to understand and requires realistic inputs. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methods through a real-world case study involving data-mining prognostic models and realistic costs/benefits information. The results show the feasibility of the approach and its applicability to various prognostic applications.

The robustness characteristic of SOWN based on the separability between pattern classes and support vector machine (SVM) based on the theory of statistic learning for the small sample set were integrated in the algorithm. The SOWN was firstly applied to cluster layer by layer, by which structure of binary-tree SVMs multi-classifier for fault diagnosis was established, namely, the fault classes at each node of the tree were nailed down. Then according to the preprocess results of SOWN, SVM were utilized to segment each decision node accurately.

Multidimensional correlated variable is converted into low dimensional independent eigenvector by means of K-L transform. The pattern recognition and the nonlinear regression are achieved by the method of support vector machine. In the light of the feature of vibrating signals, eigenveclor is obtained using K-L transform, fault diagnosis of ball bearing is recognized correspondingly using support vector machine multiple fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that the recognition of fault diagnosis of ball bearing based on K-L transform and support vector machine theory is available in the fault pattern recognizing and provides a new approach to the development of intelligent fault diagnosis.

Several methods have been developed to extend it to multi-category problems. Combining strengths of them, an improved "labeled multi-category support vector machine" is proposed. The proposed method explicitly labels samples and performs multi-category classification with only a single support vector machine classifier. Labeling samples leads to the sample number disparity between positive and negative classes. The techniques of setting different cost parameters for different classes are employed to enhance the algorithm's performance. Generalization error bound estimates are theoretically derived by the new technique of maximal discrepancy. Experiments with a benchmark dataset show that the algorithm can accurately classify multi-category data. Rotor mechanical fault recognition applications confirm that the algorithm can efficiently perform multi-category fault detection and identification.

As most running statuses of machines are nonlinear and non-stationary, it is difficult to extract the effective features for fault diagnosis by linear feature extractor such as PCA. Therefore, a nonlinear feature fusion scheme based on kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) with genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to recognize the different conditions of rolling bearing. Kernel PCA is applied to extract higher order information from a union-vector set, in which statistical features from acoustic signals and vibration signals are incorporated. The computational problem induced by the tremendous size of the feature space is also effectively settled by using a kernel function. For better classification performance, GA is applied to search the optimal parameter in kernel function. The analytical results show that the proposed feature fusion scheme can effectively improve the recognition ability of feature extractor.

The proposed protection scheme is developed and implemented in real-time using the ds1102 digital signal processor (DSP) board. In this work, a two-layer feed-forward neural network (FFNN) with sixteen inputs and single output is designed and trained off-line with experimental data using the back-propagation algorithm. An experimental setup is developed to accommodate the on-line testing and to carry out the protection of IPM motors. Three types of faults such as single line to ground (L-G) fault, line-to-line (L-L) fault, and single phasing fault are investigated. The technique is evaluated and tested on-line on the laboratory 1-hp and 5-hp IPM motors using the DSP board. The laboratory results show that the proposed technique is able to detect the faulted conditions with high accuracy.	[Khan, M. A. S. K.; Rahman, M.

Considering vibration signal is highly related with various faults of cylinder cover, we propose to diagnose faults of marine main engine cylinder cover based on vibration signal from engine. First, a wavelet analysis method is used to characterize the power spectrum of the vibration signal. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most distinctive feature for faults diagnosis. The extracted features are then fed into a set of pre-trained support vector machines (SVM) for fault diagnosis. Importantly, we use a cascade framework to organize a set of SVMs, for classifying different types of faults. The SVM is a new and effective method in fault diagnosis of marine main engine cylinder cover. Experimental results are presented to show that our proposed method is able to not only detect faults but also classify different types of faults accurately.

The Electric Machines Diagnosis System (EMDS) covers field winding shorted-turns fault in alternators and stator windings shorted-turns fault in induction motors. The EMDS has a modular architecture. The modules include: acquisition and data treatment; well-known parameters estimation algorithms, such as Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF); dynamic models for faults simulation; faults detection and identification tools, such as M.L.P. and S.O.M. neural networks and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) technique. The modules working together detect possible faulty conditions of various machines working in parallel through routing. A fast, safe and efficient data manipulation requires a great DataBase Managing System (DBMS) performance. In our experiment, the EMDS real-time operation demonstrated that the proposed system could efficiently and effectively detect abnormal conditions resulting in lower-cost maintenance for the company.

Analytical nature of this method makes it possible to use system oriented simulation environments such as Simulink for analysis of application of different control algorithm. Influence of different control algorithm upon the stator current harmonies due to the eccentricity fault will he studied in this paper. It is also shown that after applying the Park's transformation to the three-phase currents of stator, detection of eccentricity harmonies around fundamental frequency is easier than the detection of these harmonics within the stator three-phase currents.

This paper proposes a method that can provide the information to diagnose rotor problems accurately and quantitatively using motor dynamic eccentricity sidebands as a universal rotor fault detection and classification index. Moreover, related research into the effects of rotor fault isolation from load torque will enable a determination of the relative severity of a broken rotor bar or any type of air-gap asymmetry. The objective of this paper is to also implement a proof-of-concept laboratory test of the suggested method. Three induction machines were tested on a dynamometer at twenty-eight loading points and different source and load conditions, verifying detection accuracy of the implemented technique.

Therefore, it is important to monitor and correct high-R connections for reliable, efficient, and safe operation of the industrial facility. This paper focuses on the development of a sensorless on-line technique for detecting poor connections based on monitoring the asymmetry in the electrical circuit. The development of the technique begins with the derivation of the dynamic model of an induction motor with high-R connections. Based on the analysis of the model, two approaches for detecting poor contacts using the negative sequence current and zero sequence voltage are proposed. In addition to detecting the existence of faults, the location and severity of the fault can also be determined using the proposed method. An experimental study on a 10 hp induction machine under simulated and realistic high-R conditions shows that the proposed techniques provide a simple low cost solution for reliably detecting poor contact problems at an early stage. It is also shown that the severity and location of the high-R contact fault can be assessed with high accuracy.

As a base are measurement results of frequency dependencies of the winding admittance. Therefore, relations between different kinds of winding faults and changes of frequency dependencies of winding admittances should be determined. Much research work is done in that field, which is aiming to determine the sensitivity of this method and to develop the recognition criteria with regards to the type and range of faults. This paper presents the comparison of measurement results of the admitance performed on the electric machine windings of different construction. The influence of turn-to-turn faults between adjacent winding wires on the admittance waveform has been also investigated.

Some block diagrams are presented which can be used to establish useful relationships between the effects of a rotor fault in different motor and controller variables. Based on these results, several fault indicators are defined, stressing the advantages and limitations of each one regarding their robustness against the operating conditions of the motor, easiness of implementation in a DSP board and filtering needs.

Detection of airgap asymmetry in induction machines with different pole pair number using the current step response	IEEE IEMDC 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES AND DRIVES CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC 2007)	MAY 03-05, 2007	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc (PELS), IEEE Power Engn Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc			ECCENTRICITY; MOTORS	In the past years the incident of fault conditions in modern drives has increased. One reason for that loss of reliability is the fast switching of the power electronics applied that puts additional stress to all components of the machine. Besides the stator isolation breakdown and the rotor bar defect the degradation of the bearings has been given increased attention recently from both industry and academia. Bearing defect is the most frequent source of a drive breakdown and at the same. time this type of defect is the most difficult to detect. Monitoring methods based on frequency analysis like fourier or wavelet transform are facing problems with the additional harmonics introduced by the inverter, the load, as well as the high dynamic control of the machine itself that have to be separated from the harmonics induced by the bearing defect. In this paper an online method based on the time step response of the machine current is investigated and the influence of the pole pair number on the resulting fault indication signal is discussed. In a machine with one pole pair, eccentricity leads to very distinct changes in the offset values of the resulting signal caused by a change in the phase values of the leakage inductances. This effect diminishes with increasing pole pair number making it necessary to identify other indicators. This other indicators are found in the signal components linked to the slotting of the machine. Their magnitude is increased by a factor 34 making it suitable to determine the airgap eccentricity of the machine.

It was perceived that this motor has the potential of quick and easy reconfiguration to produce the desired stator and rotor faults in a variety of different fault combinations. Accordingly, this would eliminate the need to permanently destroy machine components such as stator windings or rotor bars when acquiring data from a faulty machine for fault diagnostic purposes. Experimental results under healthy and various faulty conditions will be presented in this paper, including issues associated with rotor bar-end ring contact resistances, to demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks of this motor for acquiring large amounts of fault signature data.

Different procedures for the diagnosis of rotor fault in closed loop induction motors drives	IEEE IEMDC 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES AND DRIVES CONFERENCE, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC 2007)	MAY 03-05, 2007	Antalya, TURKEY	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc (PELS), IEEE Power Engn Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc				This paper deals with different procedures that can be applied to diagnose the severity degree of rotor faults in closed loop controlled induction machines. A solution based on Field Oriented Control (FOC) was investigated in order to validate the robustness of the diagnostic procedures towards the regulator parameters. Different diagnostic procedures were investigated, that rely on different diagnostic indexes. Specifically a few electric quantities are considered as possible fault alert signals: the spectral analysis of manipulated and controlled variables, the voltage homopolar components (voltage zero sequence), and the spectral analysis of motor input current due to a high frequency voltage injection. It turns out that the last quantity is a simple and effective index able to detect and quantify the fault severity degree. The procedures based on the above mentioned quantities are validated by experiments made with a DSP based Current Controlled Voltage Source Inverter (CCVSI) supplying an induction machine with three rotors in different health conditions.

This paper proposes two approaches to compute the magnetic stray field created by faulty electrical machine. The first one presents a homogenized FEM method. The second one is based on a combination of an analytical expression for the magnetic field in the air gap with an integral method. Both models lead to accurate results while saving significantly CPU time and memory, and highly simplify the machine description. Then, it is possible to use them to model electrical machines in faulty operation modes.

This paper presents a new approach for the protection of TCSC line using a support vector machine (SVM). The proposed method uses postfault current samples for half cycle (ten samples) from the inception of the fault and firing angle as inputs to the SVM. Three SVMs are trained to provide fault classification, ground detection, and section identification, respectively, for the line using TCSC. The SVMs are trained with polynomial kernel and Gaussian kernel with different parameter values to get the most optimized classifier. The proposed method converges very fast with fewer numbers of training samples compared to neural-network and neuro-fuzzy systems which indicates fastness and accuracy of the proposed method for,protection of the transmission line with TCSC.

FE-based physical phase variable model of PM synchronous machines under stator winding short circuit faults	IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Computation in Electromagnetics	APR 03-06, 2006	Aachen, GERMANY					An FE-based physical phase variable model is proposed for PM machines under stator short-circuit faults. The parameters of the proposed model, inductances and back EMFs are determined using the FE-circuit coupled computation of the machine under the same type of fault. The parameters obtained include information on the fault location and the number of turns involved, in addition to the space harmonics and the effects of stator saturation. The FE-based phase variable model that has been developed is verified through comparison with the FE model. The significance of the work is that it introduces a feasible procedure to build a physically accurate and computationally fast phase variable model for PM machines under stator short-circuit fault conditions. Such a model is useful for the study of fault diagnosis and prognosis.

The robustness characteristic of SOMNN based on the embedded separability between pattern classes and SVM based on the theory of statistic learning for the small sample set were integrated in the algorithm. The SOMNN was firstly applied to cluster as layers by which binary-tree multi-classifler structure for fault diagnosis was established, namely, the fault classes at each node of the tree were nailed down. Then according to the preprocess results of SOMNN, SVM were utilized to segment each decision node accurately. Multiple fault diagnosis of analog circuit with tolerances was experimented with the proposed method. The simulation results show us that compared with the several existent multi-class classification methods: the current algorithm has high accuracy and speed.

On the application of cumulant-based cyclostationary processing on bearings diagnosis	INNOVATIVE ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES IN AUTOMATION, INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Telecommunications and Networking (TeNe)/International Conference on Industrial Electronics, Technology and Automation (IETA)	2006	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, Univ Bridgeport			SIGNALS; FAULTS	A false indication of failure in rolling element bearings can be reached when cyclostationary processing technique is used for machine condition diagnosis. This problem is due to the fact that the estimated second-order cyclostationary parameters can be altered by first-order cyclostationary signals such as vibrations no related to those produced by defective bearings. The goal of this work is to solve this problem by applying a cumulant-based approach. Four algorithms were implemented. In order to quantify the effectiveness of the algorithm applications, a new function, named Interference Rate Function, is proposed. The appreciable interference immunity in the estimated cumulant-based cyclostationary parameters demonstrated the veracity of the hypothesis.	[Hernandez, F.

Usually the vibration signal is sampled with a very high frequency due to its nature, thus it is quite difficult. to do considerably long forecasting based on the methods, which are suitable for e.g. financial time series (where the sampling frequency is smaller). In this paper new forecasting and classification technique for particular vibration signal characteristics is proposed. Suggested approach allows creating a part of control system responsible for early fault detection, which Could be used to]preventive maintenance of industrial equipment. Presented approach can be extended to high frequency financial data for the prediction of "faults" on the market.

Artificial immune based support vector machine algorithm for fault diagnosis of induction motors	INTERNATIONAL AEGEAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND POWER ELECTRONICS & ELECTROMOTION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Conference on Electromotion/IEEE Aegean Conference on Electrical Machines and Power Electronics/	SEP 10-12, 2007	Bodrum, TURKEY	Middle East Tech Univ, IEEE, PELS, PES		support vector machines; artificial immune system; time series analysis; fault detection and diagnosis; induction motors; stator and broken rotor bar faults		The use of induction motors is widespread in industry. Many researchers have studied the condition monitoring and detecting the faults of induction motors at an early stage. Early detection of motor faults results in fast unscheduled maintenance. In this study, a new artificial immune based support vector machine algorithm is proposed for fault diagnosis of induction motors. Support vector machines (SVMs) have become one of the most popular classification methods in soft computing, recently. However, classification accuracy depends on kernel and penalty parameters. Artificial immune system has abilities of learning, memory and self adaptive control. The kernel and penalizes parameters of support vector machine are tuned using artificial immune system. The training data of support vector machine are extracted from three phase motor current. The new feature vector is constructed based on park's vector approach. The phase space of this feature vector is constructed using nonlinear time series analysis. Broken rotor bar and stator short circuit faults are classified in combined phase space using support vector machines. The experimental data are taken from a three phase induction motor. One, two and three broken rotor bar faults and 10% short circuit of stator faults are detected successfully.

A variety of vibration signals analysis techniques have long been used to diagnosis machine status. Based on the newest Internet and mobile communication technology we developed a remote fault diagnostic system with many merits. This remote monitoring system takes XML as a core and uses it to encode diagnostic data. The utilization of XML gives this system many advantages including minimum research work on the client side, and simplicity to expand the system. This system publishes the diagnosis data not only by WEB, but also by WAP. Then users can check the machine status including data, image and video, through the Internet and mobile terminals. The automatic alarm part, which is developed based on Microsoft's Smartphone 2003 operating system, can actively send alerting messages to the engineers' mobile phones and call these phones to make sure they get an alert when the machine's status is abnormal.

Real-time health prognosis and dynamic preventive maintenance policy for equipment under aging Markovian deterioration	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						real-time equipment monitoring; equipment health prognosis; Markov chain modeling; condition-based maintenance	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; OPTIMAL REPLACEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; FAILURE; SUBJECT; SYSTEMS	An often seen practice of preventive maintenance (PM) is to construct a machine's reliability model based on its historical failure records. The reliability model is then used to determine the PM schedule by minimizing the machine's long-run operation cost or average machine downtime. Machines in many hi-tech manufacturing sectors are using sophisticated sensor technologies to provide sufficient immediate online data for real-time observation of equipment condition. Not only is the historical data but also the real time condition now available for scheduling a more effective PM policy. This research is to determine an effective PM policy based on real-time observations of equipment condition. We first use the multivariate process capability index to integrate the equipment's multiple parameters into an overall equipment health index. This health index serves as the basis for real-time health prognosis under an aging Markovian deterioration model. A dynamic PM schedule is then determined based on the health prognosis.

During the image process of ferrography image, the calculation of threshold is so important that it will influence the following process of-image processing. Because the ferrography image has a changeable background, the threshold will be calculated difficulty. Therefore, this paper applies Ostu thresholding method to ascertain the threshold of ferrography image.

To ascertain the fault cause, the oil synthetic analytical techniques were used to analyze present unused oil compared with former unused oil, us well as present used oil with former used oil. Firstly, the Viscidity and total base number (TBN) of the hydraulic oil used for 2,500 h were analyzed by routine physical, and chemical analysis (RPCA) and proved eligible. Secondly, the test results of particle counter showed that present unused oil was set at the unallowable contamination level (ISO 20/17, equal to NAS 11), much higher than that of former unused oil. So particles contamination in present unused oil was the cause of hydraulic pump early fault. Thirdly, the test results of spectrographic oil analysis (SOA) also showed that the pollutants in present unused oil were more than that in former unused oil. Finally, the test results of ferrographic oil analysis (FOA) clearly showed that wear particle pollutants in present unused oil was much higher than that of former unused oil, and these pollutants was dust. By the oil synthetic analytical techniques above, it was ascertained the severe contamination of present unused hydraulic oils (ISO 20/17) was the main cause of the hydraulic pumps early fault. In detail, the solid pollutants entered hydraulic components and caused severe adhesive wear. In short, oil synthetic analytical techniques were essential for machines to avoid early fault by monitoring oil contamination and machinery wear state.

The wavelet packet analysis was adopted at first in acquisition of fault diagnosis system feature parameters. Each bandwidth of wavelet packet was identical after disassembled. In order to reduce the structure complexity, the application of rough sets in parameter attribute optimization was explored. In order to acquire some knowledge about the reduct set, a hybridization strategy based on genetic algorithm was studied. After reducing the train sample set with rough set method, the unnecessary condition attributes were eliminated, and the inner redundancy of fault diagnosis system condition attributes is revealed. The result of attribute reduction is given finally.

The induce motor has usually been broken down owing to its heavy working loads as well as the bad working conditions. The production of enterprise are under threat. That will bring about huge economic loss. The fault mechanism of induce motors is complex extremely. Its fault reasons are not corresponding to omens absolutely. The causes of formation of some faults and behaving in different. development stages of faults are not very clarity yet. It is impossible for us to analyze faults and extract early breakdown characteristics using a little information accurately especially because physical signal of early breakdown is weak and indefinite. As a result, it is difficult to diagnose earlier period faults and separate a fault from others. Therefore electromagnetism and dynamics characteristics of induce motor have been analyzed The change law of all kinds of motor faults in signals and parameter has been found out. The multi-information fusion is used to ensure the output of system reliable. So this realized earlier period faults intelligent diagnosis and prediction for induce motor.

Fourier analysis is unable to describe the time-frequency(T-F) localized characteristic because it is global transform. Here, we adopt a new time-frequency methods--Local wave method, to analysis the fault vibration signals. Because the Local wave T-F spectrum can be showed in the gray image, so the fault features were extracted using the fractal dimension and moment invariants for the two-dimension local wave T-F images. The experiments show that this method is feasible.

Therefore, the information of the vibration signals in this stage is very helpful to detect the faults of a gearbox. The order tracking technique is combined with bi-coherence spectrum and then the order bi-coherence spectrum analysis technique is presented Firstly, the vibration signal is sampled at constant time increments and then uses software to resample the data at constant angle increments. Therefore, the time domain transient signal is transformed into angle domain stationary one. In the end, the re-sampled signals are processed by bi-coherence spectrum analysis. The experimental results show that order bi-coherence spectrum can effectively diagnosis the gear faults.

As the working condition of a machine system deteriorates, the number of frequency components contained in the fault vibration signal will be more than that in healthy signal, resulting in a decrease. in its regularity and an increase in its corresponding ApEn valuel([1][2]). So ApEn with Local Wave Method are used in mechanical fault diagnosis. The result has shown that values of ApEn can effectively characterise the severity of structural defect with good computational efficiency. And the values of ApEn will be used as the input of ANFIS to classify and recognize the fault severity(1[3]).

However, for machinery operating in non-stationary conditions, under varying operating condition, the FFT approach is not directly effective for analysis. Presently, two techniques are used: Order Tracking Technique (OTT) and Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA). OTT is used to avoid a spread of the spectral components of a spectrum obtained from variable speed machinery, however, it presents the disadvantage of averaging the amplitude of the spectral components during acquisition time. The TFA are three-dimensional functions that allow to visualize the frequency and amplitude variations of the spectral components. However, when the analyzed vibration has larger changes of the machine speed during measurement, they become very difficult to analyze. The present paper presents a new approach called Angle Order Analysis Technique (AOAT), which uses the advantages of both OTST and TFA techniques. Basically, the technique involves changing the signal sampled at constant time increments to a signal sampled at constant angular increments and then processes it using Wigner-Ville Distribution. The proposed method is evaluated using experimental data of a gearbox under running-up.

A focused THz beam is scanned along the sealed area of a package, and the transmitted signal is collected. Defect detection is effected through the large difference between the absorption coefficients of plastic and water for water-filled channel defects, and on the refraction index difference between plastic and air for air-filled channel defects owing to reduction of the incident signals into the detector. Compared to previous methods, such as visual and ultrasound inspection, our technique can be applied to optically opaque packages and does not require immersion in a matching liquid. The method was tested on fabricated 10 similar to 100-mu m diameter water-filled and air-filled channel defects imbedded in polyethylene films. The detection limit (the minimum size of a detectable defect), which depends on the conveying speed, was determined and analyzed. The results show that our system has potential for application in actual-production, real-time, inspection.

AI and OR in management of operations: history and trends	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Review						operations management; artificial intelligence; operational research	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE-BASED-SYSTEM; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; MACHINE SCHEDULING PROBLEM; FUZZY PROCESSING TIMES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; GENETIC-ALGORITHM; EXPERT-SYSTEM; PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE; INVENTORY CONTROL	The last decade has seen a considerable growth in the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for operations management with the aim of finding solutions to problems that are increasing in complexity and scale. This paper begins by setting the context for the survey through a historical perspective of OR and AI. An extensive survey of applications of AI techniques for operations management, covering a total of over 1200 papers published from 1995 to 2004 is then presented. The survey utilizes Elsevier's ScienceDirect database as a source. Hence, the survey may not cover all the relevant journals but includes a sufficiently wide range of publications to make it representative of the research in the field. The papers are categorized into four areas of operations management: (a) design, (b) scheduling, (c) process planning and control and (d) quality, maintenance and fault diagnosis. Each of the four areas is categorized in terms of the AI techniques used: genetic algorithms, case-based reasoning, knowledge-based systems, fuzzy logic and hybrid techniques. The trends over the last decade are identified, discussed with respect to expected trends and directions for future work suggested.

We briefly describe some of the machine learning techniques developed to overcome the real world challenges in this medical domain. The most significant hurdle in transitioning from a machine learning research prototype that performs well on an in-house dataset into a clinically deployable system, is the requirement that the CAD system be tested in a clinical trial. We describe the clinical trial in which LungCAD was tested: a large scale multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) retrospective observational study to evaluate the effect of CAD in clinical practice for detecting solid pulmonary nodules from CT thorax studies. The clinical trial demonstrates that every radiologist that participated in the trial had a significantly greater accuracy with LungCAD, both for detecting nodules and identifying potentially actionable nodules; this, along with other findings from the trial, has resulted in FDA approval for LungCAD in late 2006.

An information theoretic approach to feature selection has been applied in order to determine the best subset of features by means of a proper backward selection algorithm. The final aim of the research is the implementation of a prognostic tool able to reduce the risk for the air pollutants concentrations to be above the alarm thresholds fixed by the law. The implementation of this tool will be carried out using machine learning methods based on some of the most widespread statistical data driven techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, ANN, and Support Vector Machines, SVM).

This approach is already known, but until now, classical methods only detect if a fault is present or not. Thus, we propose a new approach based on the theory of inverse problems. It not only enables us to identify a faulty mode, but also to discriminate several types of defects, to localize them and also to quantify their importance.

Main components of the system are a reliability-based system assessment tool, prognostic models of degradation and new sensoring techniques. The system assessment tool is based on the reliability method; its task is to find out weak points of a structure being first responsible for a possible failure. If prognostic models of degradation are combined with monitoring an improved accuracy of prognosis can be achieved. To get relevant monitoring data from a structure a new generation of sensors is being developed. These three parts of a structural monitoring system are presented in the contribution. The methods mentioned before are tested and demonstrated at a real scale pc-bridge, serving as an experimental structure. This structure provides typical structural situations and degradation processes in a realistic manner. The object is to examine under conditions close to real structures the combined use of reliability analysis in order to find weakpoints and to decide on the places where sensors should be applied on one side, and on the other side the practical operability and usefulness of new sensors and adaptive prognostic models for concrete degradation as presented above. The experimental bridge structure is presented and the first results of the probabilistic system analysis are sketched finally.

This new method is different from the others that have been used in the past, in that it uses the minimum quantisation error (MQE) indicator derived from SOM, which is trained by six vibration features, including a new designed degradation index for performance degradation assessment. Then, using this indicator, back propagation neural networks focusing on the degradation periods can be trained. Thanks to weight application to failure times (WAFT) technology, a useful life prediction model for ball bearings has been developed successfully. Finally, a set of accelerated bearing run-to-failure experiments is carried out, with the experimental results showing that the new proposed methods are greatly superior to those, based on L10 bearing life prediction, currently being used.

This paper describes an experimental investigation on spur gears in which natural pitting was allowed to occur. Throughout the test period, AE, vibration and spectrometric oil samples were monitored continuously in order to correlate and compare these techniques to natural life degradation of the gears. It was observed that based on the analysis of root mean square (rms) levels only the AE technique was more sensitive in detecting and monitoring pitting than either the vibration or spectrometric oil analysis (SOA) techniques. It is concluded that as AE exhibited a direct relationship with pitting progression, it offers the opportunity for prognosis. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impact velocity modelling and signal processing of spur gear vibration for the estimation of defect size	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						impact velocity model; defect size estimation; empirical mode decomposition; kurtosis; intrinsic mode function	MESHING VIBRATION; FAULT-DETECTION; FAILURE; AVERAGE	Gears are one of the most common elements in any rotating machinery. If gear defect can be assessed, gearbox maintenance schedule can be optimally planned. This paper presents an impact velocity model relating measurable vibration signal to the defect size on the gear tooth flank. The analytical model was verified experimentally. The experimental results support the effectiveness of the analytical model in estimating defect size. In addition, experimental vibration signals were decomposed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique. These decomposed oscillatory functions are called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Kurtosis value of selected IMF was calculated for early detection of fault. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, CS; Qu, LS				Li, Chongsheng; Qu, Liangsheng			Applications of chaotic oscillator in machinery fault diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						chaotic oscillator; Duffing equation; weak signal detection; symbol sequence statistics; fault diagnosis; rolling bearings; gearboxes		The forward detecting method is used to detect weak periodic signals by identifying the transformation of the chaotic oscillator from the chaotic state to the large-scale periodic state when a weak external periodic signal is applied. Based on the method above, in this paper, a similar method, which is devised in a reverse way, is presented. The method detects the change of a weak signal by identifying the transformation of the chaotic oscillator from the large-scale periodic state to the chaotic state when a weak external signal is applied. This paper discusses and summarizes the features and scopes of both methods in their application in the field of machinery fault diagnosis. Satisfactory results have been achieved when using both of them in the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings and automobile gearboxes. The paper also presents how to use symbol sequence statistics to automatically identify the state transformation of the chaotic oscillator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Little is known on patterns of variation on a small scale of some parameters of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, despite their increasing use as indicators of the status of meadows. A cartographic method based on a stochastic interpolator (kriging) was applied to the P. oceanica meadow off Lacco Ameno (Island of Ischia - Gulf of Naples, Italy), extended between 1 and 33 m depth, to detect spatial and temporal patterns of meadow structure and functioning at a small scale. The meadow architecture, plant size, plant growth and algal epiphyte assemblages were investigated. Nestlike structures with a rounded shape and exhibiting an increase of values towards the centre were obtained for several parameters. The analysis detected various degrees of patchiness, in particular between shallow (down to 10 m depth) and deep stands. A good overlapping between structural and biological models was found, indicating that the shape of the sea bottom may affect the complexity and dynamics of the P. oceanica system. In contrast, the decrease of spatial anisotropy over a decadal time scale may be interpreted as a result of the anthropic impacts affecting the clonal growth patterns of this species.

These models are traditionally built with supervised machine learning techniques, and consider prognosis as a static, one-shot activity. This paper presents a new type of prognostic model that builds on the Bayesian network methodology that implements a dynamic, process-oriented view on prognosis. In contrast to traditional prognostic models, prognostic Bayesian networks explicate the scenarios that lead to disease outcomes, and can be used to update predictions whet? new information becomes available. A recursive data analysis strategy for inducing prognostic Bayesian networks from medical data is presented, and applied to data from the field of cardiac surgery. The resulting model outperformed a model that was constructed with off-the-shelf Bayesian network learning software, and had similar performance as class probability trees.

Prediction of minimum temperatures in an alpine region by linear and non-linear post-processing of meteorological models	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROTECTION; REGRESSION	Model Output Statistics (MOS) refers to a method of post-processing the direct outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in order to reduce the biases introduced by a coarse horizontal resolution. This technique is especially useful in orographically complex regions. where large differences can be found between the NWP elevation model and the true orography. This study carries out a comparison of linear and non-linear MOS methods, aimed at the prediction of minimum temperatures in a fruit-growing region of the Italian Alps. based on the output of two different NWPs (ECMWF T511-L60 and LAMI-3). Temperature. of course, is a particularly important NWP output;, among, other roles it drives the local frost forecast, which is of great interest to agriculture. The mechanisms of cold air drainage. a distinctive aspect of mountain environments, are often unsatisfactorily captured by global circulation models. The simplest post-processing technique applied in this work was a correction for the mean bias, assessed at individual model grid points. We also implemented a multivariate linear regression on the output at the grid points surrounding the target area, and two non-linear models based on machine learning techniques: Neural Networks and Random Forest. We compare the performance of all these techniques on four different NWP data sets. Downscaling the temperatures clearly improved the temperature forecasts with respect to the raw NWP output, and also with respect to the basic mean bias correction. Multivariate methods generally yielded better results. but the advantage of using non-linear algorithms was small if not negligible. RF, the best performing method. was implemented on ECMWF prognostic output at 06:00 UTC over the 9 grid points surrounding the target area. Mean absolute errors in the prediction of 2 m temperature at 06:00 UTC were approximately 1.2 degrees C, close to the natural variability inside the area itself.

Traditionally, corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance are performed, but both of them, the excessive and the lacking maintenance can be harmful. In the last years, CBM (Condition Based Maintenance) technology or predictive maintenance has appeared in order to establish whether the system will fail during some future period and then take actions to avoid consequences. This paper shows the e-maintenance platform nicknamed DYNAWeb which is part of DYNAMITE project. DYNAWeb develops a CBM system based on OSA-CBM standard over MIMOSA comprising broad of capabilities like sensing and data acquisition, signal processing, health assessment, prognosis... This platform ensures the integration of all the components (software and hardware) using different technologies (sensor technologies, wireless communication technology) and providing them with agents and (Semantic) Web Services to allow the integration and the reuse among different applications.

A scholarly semantic web system for advanced search functions	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						worldwide web; information retrieval; search engines; knowledge transfer	ONTOLOGY	Purpose - The semantic web gives meaning to information so that humans and computers can work Approved for publication together better. Ontology is used to represent knowledge on the semantic web. Web services have been 29 October 2006 introduced to make the knowledge conveyed by the ontology on the semantic web accessible across different applications. This paper seeks to present the use of these latest advances in the context of a scholarly semantic web (or SSWeb) system, which can support advanced search functions such as expert finding and trend detection in addition to basic functions such as document and author search as well as document and author clustering search. Design/methodology/approach - A distributed architecture of the proposed SSWeb is described, as well as semantic web services that support scholarly information retrieval on the SSWeb. Findings - Initial experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective. Research limitations/implications - The work reported is experimental in nature. More work is needed, but early results are encouraging and the authors wish to make their work known to the research community by publishing this paper so that further progress can be made in this area of research. Originality/value - The work is presented in the context of scholarly document retrieval, but it could also be adapted to other types of documents, such as medical records, machine-fault records and legal documents. This is because the basic principles are the same.

When left untreated, the ultimate outcome is alveolar bone loss and exfoliation of the involved teeth. Traditional periodontal diagnostic methods include assessment of clinical parameters and radiographs. Though efficient, these conventional techniques are inherently limited in that only a historical perspective, not current appraisal, of disease status can be determined. Advances in the use of oral fluids as possible biological samples for objective measures of current disease state, treatment monitoring, and prognostic indicators have boosted saliva and other oral-based fluids to the forefront of technology. Oral fluids contain locally and systemically derived mediators of periodontal disease, including microbial, host-response, and bone-specific resorptive markers. Although most biomarkers in oral fluids represent inflammatory mediators, several specific collagen degradation and bone turnover-related molecules have emerged as possible measures of periodontal disease activity. Pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide (ICTP), for example, has been highly correlated with clinical features of the disease and decreases in response to intervention therapies, and has been shown to possess predictive properties for possible future disease activity. One foreseeable benefit of an oral fluid-based periodontal diagnostic would be identification of highly susceptible individuals prior to overt disease. Timely detection and diagnosis of disease may significantly affect the clinical management of periodontal patients by offering earlier, less invasive, and more cost-effective treatment therapies.

Machine Learning (ML) methods have the ability to learns from data, inferring from examples a general hypothesis that can approximate complex relationships in the data for descriptive or predictive aims. The ML is particularly useful for poorly understood domains due to the lack of a clear theory where, however, there are collections of relevant real-world data, which can be affected by uncertain or noise, or characterized by complex relationships that standard approaches cannot properly face. The achievement of successful results for problems in biochemical and medical domains may require the integration of different type of data (such as clinical, genetic, biochemical data), together with computational task (including descriptive or predictive purpose), model design, and learning methods. This survey summarizes typical aspects of the ML approach to problems and tasks, and treats the characteristics of data sets, models, tools, and evaluation techniques, in the context of their application in medical data analysis and bioinformatics, with emphasis on emergent approaches and research perspectives. Finally, we present and discuss some recent results, as a test application of a rule-based evolutionary classifier system to a concrete example of clinical and genetic data set, built up for studies on the susceptibility to cancer.

These techniques can be applied in fault identification and diagnosis in industrial scenarios by mean of expert systems. Different nonlinear features (based on chaos theory) to detect changes of the audio signal were studied: maximal Lyapunov exponent, correlation dimension and correlation entropy. We also studied related measurement such as the time delay and the value of the first minimum of the mutual information function, the first zero of the autocorrelation function and Shannon entropy. We used different recordings from different scenarios (PC fans, an iron cutter and an electric drill).

An effective automated grading system for HCC in biopsy images	PROCEEDING OF THE 11TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS: COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 4	Electrical and Computer Engineering Series		English	Proceedings Paper	11th WSEAS International Conference on Computers	JUL 26-28, 2007	Crete, GREECE			hepatocellular carcinoma; morphological reconstruction; watershed; snake; Support Vector Machine; Sequential Floating Forward Selection; hierarchical classification	FEATURES; SNAKES	Accurate grading for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in biopsy images is important to prognosis and treatment planning. However, visual grading is always time-consuming, subjective, and inconsistent. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to automatically classitiing biopsy images into five grades. At first, a dual morphological reconstruction method was applied to remove noise and accentuate nuclear shapes. Then we used watershed and snake techniques to smoothly segment nuclei from their background. Fourteen features were extracted according to six types of characteristics. We constructed a hierarchical classifier using Support Vector Machine and Sequential Floating Forward Selection method to automatically select an optimal set of features at each decision node of the classifier. Our experimental results demonstrated that 94.5% of accuracy can be achieved for a set of 604 biopsy images.	[Lai, Y. H.; Huang, P.

But given a limited amount of memory, which results should be cached in order to minimize the running time of the algorithm becomes a key question. Aiming at this problem, depth-first branch-and-bound method is proposed to search all the potential goal states, average running time under each state is computed, then some optimal time-space tradeoff curves were made. Through the curves, an optimal discrete cache scheme can be found, with this scheme, significant amounts of memory can be removed from the algorithm's cache with only a minimal cost in time. Applying this algorithm in turbo-generator unit fault diagnosis, based on analysis of vibration fault of the turbine machinery, the fault sets, manifestation sets, relation table for fault and manifestations to turbine fault were given, Bayesian networks for fault diagnosis was made, on the basis of which, a fault in turbine was identified. The results show that with the space optimization algorithm of Bayesian networks, the fault can be accurately diagnosed, and at the same time, and the storage capacity is reduced. It is estimated that the optimized strategy may be further applied in fault diagnosis.

Considering vibration signal is highly related with various faults of cylinder cover, we propose to diagnose faults of marine main engine cylinder cover based on vibration signal from engine. First, a wavelet analysis method is used to characterize the power spectrum of the vibration signal. Next, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to extract the most distinctive feature for faults diagnosis. The extracted features are then fed into a set of pre-trained support vector machines (SVM) for fault diagnosis. Importantly, we use a cascade framework to organize a set of SVMs, for classifying different types of faults. Experimental results are presented to show that our proposed method is able to not only detect faults but also classify different types of faults accurately.

The computer industry is the biggest user of semiconductor devices and consumer electronics. Due to the successful development of semiconductors, electronic system and controls have gained wide acceptance in power and computing technology and due to the continuous use of drive systems (rotating machines, controlling thyristors and associated electronic components) in industry and in power stations, and the need to keep such systems running reliably, the detection of defects and anomalies is of increasing importance, and on-line monitoring to detect any fault in these systems is now a strong possibility and certainly periodic monitoring of a drive systems in strategic situations. The principal aim of the paper is to use both software and hardware and develop a fault diagnosis knowledge-based system, which will analyze and manipulate the output obtained from sensors using a microcomputer for acquiring the plant condition data and subsequently interpreting them, data collected can be analyzed using suitable computer programs, and any trends can be identified and compared with the knowledge base. The probability of certain condition can then be diagnosed and compared, providing the necessary information on which subsequent decisions can be based and provide any necessary alarms to the operator. To achieve this objective, the simulation and experimental technique considered is to use sensors placed in the wedges closing the stator slots to sense the induced voltage. The induced voltage and for each fault is shown to have a unique voltage pattern, thus, the fault identification through voltage pattern recognition were the basic rules for the development of the knowledge base. The predicted results are verified by measurements on a model system in which known faults can be established.

Capturing the abnormal symptoms of machineries from vibration signatures involves the use of signal processing algorithms on measured vibrations. However, the commonly used method such as FFT based power spectra assumes the the signal is ergodic and stationary. The FFT based method may produce unpredictable results especially in an industrial environment that subjected to random or periodic noise. Such effects can be detected, however, with second-order cyclostationary statistical method such as Degree of Cyclostationary (DCS). This paper discussed the implementation of machinery fault diagnosis using the Quad-Phase Unconstrained Optimal Tradeoff Synthetic Discriminant Function (QUOTSDF) and DCS features for fault classification. Quad-Phase Unconstrained Optimal Tradeoff Synthetic Discriminant Function (QUOTSDF) is used in this effort because of its ability to provide high discrimination while providing noise tolerance. The machine health condition is identified based on the comparison of acquired real-time vibration features with template features. The vibration data were collected from the Schenck Motor MM-61. Four machinery conditions are simulated by the motor, which are normal (no fault), bearing damage, machine imbalance, and foundation looseness. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Degree of Cyclostationary (DCS) have been utilized for features extraction from the power spectrum of the vibration data. Fault diagnosis based on DCS features are shown to outperform FFT in accuracy.	[Loo, C.

Existing detection techniques for these errors, such as dual modular redundancy (DMR), have very high area overhead as they typically target all possible faults. In this paper, we analyze the effect of transient faults on sequential circuit behavior. We introduce the notion of transition errors (TEs) to capture the critical errors caused by both transient and permanent faults. We also present an error-monitoring scheme aimed specifically at TEs. Finally we describe experiments using the MCNC synthesis benchmark suite which show that, using the proposed monitoring scheme, all TEs can be detected with about 36% area overhead, which is significantly less than alternative approaches like DMR.

Most of the existing identification methods of symmetrical IMs are, strictly speaking, valid only at stationary conditions, which limitation results in either poor dynamics excitation or gross approximation errors, depending on the working conditions of the motor. In this paper, the topic of identification of all electrical parameters of faulty IMs is addressed for the first time. A method for on-line observer-based estimation of all electrical parameters of IMs with faulty stator is presented aiming primarily at fault tolerant control and fault detection. The approach does not rely on any assumptions regarding the rotor angular speed and/or acceleration.

Damage detection techniques, combined with advanced signal processing, are the core components of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system. In this context, feature extraction is an essential component of a SHM system that converts raw sensor data into useful information about the structure health condition. The level of signal processing that can be performed in a WISD depends on the capability of the processing element in terms of speed, memory and energy consumption. But the real bottle neck for energy efficiency is the fact that communications dominate the WISD energy consumption. Therefore, running intelligent local data interrogation algorithms on-board the WISD is a mechanism through which considerable battery power can be preserved. In that sense, in this paper a soft histogram feature extraction algorithm is developed to extract damage-sensitive information from measured response data of tie-bar component of the main rotor hub of a Lynx helicopter. In addition, a method for pattern recognition and critical degradation detection of tie-bar is proposed based on the extracted features and a combination of statistical process control and fuzzy sets theory. Results show the applicability of the proposed approaches.	[Escamilla-Ambrosio, P.

The wavelet transform is used to extract fault characteristics and neural network is used to diagnose the faults. To improve the performance of applying traditional fault diagnosis method to the vibrant faults,a novel method based on the statistic rule is brought forward to determine the threshold of each order of wavelet space and the decomposition level adaptively,increasing the signal-noise-ratio (SNR). The fault modes are classified by fuzzy diagnosis equation based on correlation matrix which shows good ability of self-adaption and self-learning. The improved least squares algorithm (LSA) is used to fulfill the network structure and the robustness of fault diagnosis equation is discussed. By means of choosing enough samples to train the fault diagnosis equation and the information representing the faults is input into the trained diagnosis equation,and according to the output result the type of fault can be determined. Actual applications show that the proposed method can effectively diagnose multi-concurrent fault for stator temperature :fluctuation and rotor vibration and the diagnosis result is correct,increasing the accuracy of the fault diagnosis for rotating machinery.

Two methods are employed to improve the diagnosis accuracy for DGA analysis. Firstly, bootstrap preprocessing is utilised to equalise the sample numbers for different fault types. Then, the preprocessed samples are inputted to a classier for fault classification. For comparison purposes, four classifiers are utilised, i.e. artificial neural network (ANN), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), simple SVM and LS-SVM. The classification accuracy of LS-SVM is then compared with the ones of ANN, KNN and a simple SVM. The results indicate that the LS-SVM approach can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracies for transformer fault classification.	[Tang, Wenhu; Almas, Shintemirov; Wu, Q.

The vibration signal of the generator set in different states is analyzed by using the signal re-construction technique of the wavelet packet theory. The time domain method is given for the generator set fault diagnosis. The analysis shows, the "energy-fault" diagnosis which is based on wavelet theory is dependable and applied in the vibration fault diagnose of the generator set, and is a good assistant of fault diagnostic. The experiment results show that the wavelet packet theory can be used to directly identify the state of the generator set, and provide a credible new idea for complex machinery fault diagnosis.

Application of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in combustion failure detection of IC engines	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis	SEP 27-29, 2007	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE		IC engine; DWT; combustion failure		Fault detection of internal combustion engines has been started to develop more rapidly in recent years. Few works have been published on time-frequency analysis of IC engine vibration signals. These types of analysis are fully adapted to transient nature of IC engine signals and do not possess the drawbacks of traditional methods based on Fourier analysis. In this paper we used the vibration signals taken experimentally from a typical 4-cylinder IC engine. Ignition failures were introduced and their effects were investigated. Since the signals were noisy the time synchronous averaging (TSA) was used to extract the dominant transient behavior of the signals. After TSA, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was employed to transfer the signal in time domain to the time-frequency domain. DWT holds significant properties which make it suitable for fault detection and diagnosis. The results showed that DWT decomposition in 4(th) approximation level is appropriate for fault detection. For this level and the higher levels, the trends of the signal variations were studied in different operating conditions of the engine, namely the healthy and faulty ones. The results are promising and reveal the effectiveness of the method. Comparison between our previous works and this new approach shows a simpler interpretation of DWT results over other time-frequency methods such as STFT and CWT These facts demonstrate the possibility of using DWT for monitoring combustion failure of IC engines in addition to traditional applications such as diagnosis of rotating machineries.

We are investigating the possibility of detecting microscopic disease using machine learning approaches based on features derived from gene expression levels and metabolic profiles. We use immunochemistry and QRT-PCR to measure the gene expression profiles from a number of antigens such as cyclin E, P27(KIP1), FHIT, Ki-67, PCNA, Bax, Bcl-2. P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of neuroendocrine tumors such as pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas; and the adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), adenomas (ACA), and hyperplasia (ACH) in Cushing's syndrome. We provide statistical evidence that, higher expression levels of hTERT, PCNA and Ki67 etc. are associated with a,higher risk that the tumors are malignant or borderline, as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of the P27(KIP1) and FHIT etc. are associated with a decreased risk of adrenomedullary tumors. While no significant difference was found between cell-arrest antigens such as P27(KIP1) for malignant, borderline, and benign tumors, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such antigens in normal adrenal medulla samples and in adrenomedullary tumors.

Endmill condition monitoring and failure forecasting method for curvilinear cuts of non-constant radii	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING - 2007			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Conference on Manufacturing Science and Engineering	OCT 15-18, 2007	Atlanta, GA	ASME, Mfg Engn Div			SYSTEM	In this paper, an endmill condition monitoring technique is presented for curvilinear cutting. This algorithm operates without the need for prior knowledge of cutting conditions, tool type, cut curvature, cut direction, or directional rate of change. This technique is based on an autoregressive-type monitoring algorithm which is used to track the tool's condition using a tri-axial accelerometer. Accelerometer signals are monitored due to the sensors relatively low cost and since use of the sensor does not limit the machining envelope. To demonstrate repeatability, eight life tests were conducted. The technique discussed herein successfully prognosis impending fracture or meltdown due to wear in all cases, providing sufficient time to remove the tools before failure is realized. Furthermore, the algorithm produces similar trends capable of forecasting failure, regardless of tool type and cut geometry. Success is seen in all cases without requiring algorithm modifications or any prior information regarding the tool or cutting conditions.

There exists much uncertainty in the field of fault diagnosis in the rotor system. This paper analyses the familiar faults of the rotor system and the corresponding faulty symptoms, then establishes the rotor's Bayesian network model based on above information. A fault diagnosis system based on the Bayesian network model is developed. Using this model, the conditional probability of the fault happening is computed when the observation of the rotor is presented. Thus, the fault reason can be determined by these probabilities. The diagnosis system developed is used to diagnose the actual three faults of the rotor of the rotating machinery and the results prove the efficiency of the method proposed.

A gas path diagnostic and prognostic approach for gas turbine applications	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2007, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd ASME Turbo Expo 2007	MAY 14-17, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers (ASME), Int Gas Turbine Inst				Gas turbine engines experience degradation over time that cause great concern to gas turbine users on engine reliability, availability and operating costs. It has been realized in recent years that gas turbine diagnostics and prognostics is one of the key technologies to enable the move from time-scheduled maintenance to condition-based maintenance in order to improve engine reliability and availability and reduce life cycle costs. The objective of this paper is to introduce a systematic diagnostic and prognostic approach to assess the health condition and estimate the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines before their next major overhaul. A non-linear Gas Path Analysis (GPA) approach is used to assess engine performance degradation with the confidence measured by a GPA Index. A combined regression techniques, including both linear and quadratic models, is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of gas turbine engines. A statistic "Compatibility Check" is used to determine the switch point from linear regression to quadratic regression. The developed diagnostic and prognostic approach has been applied to a model gas turbine engine similar to Rolls-Royce Industrial AVON 1535 implemented with compressor degradation over time. The analysis shows that the developed diagnostic and prognostic approach has great potential to provide an estimation of engine remaining useful life before next major overhaul for gas turbine engines experiencing a typical slow degradation.

This paper compares broadly three methods of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) dealing with variable length time sequences. Chosen methods are based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), k-Nearest Neighbor method, Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) which makes use of DTW ingeniously as its kernel. The time sequences are obtained from Turbo Propulsion Engines in their nominal conditions and two faulty conditions. Typically there is paucity of faulty exemplars and the challenge is to come up with algorithms which work reasonably well under such circumstances. Also, normalization of data plays a significant role in determining the performance of the classifiers used for FDD in terms of their detection rate and false positives. In particular spherical normalization has been explored considering the advantage of its superior normalization properties. Given sparse training data how well each of these algorithms performs is shown by means of tests performed on time series data collected at normal and faulty modes from a turbofan gas turbine propulsion engine and the results are presented.

Real-time health estimation and automated fault accommodation for propulsion systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2007, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd ASME Turbo Expo 2007	MAY 14-17, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers (ASME), Int Gas Turbine Inst				This paper presents the development of innovative real-time health estimation and automated fault accommodation techniques for advanced propulsion systems within a Dynamic Decision Support ((DS)-S-2) framework. The proposed approach uses dynamic models in a real-time computing environment to not only diagnose system degradation and faults, but also to determine "on the fly" how to accommodate for them. The real-time health estimation modules enhance on-board PHM (Prognosis & Health Management) capabilities with a dynamic system identification algorithm that is capable of detecting faults with a continuously updated dynamic model. In addition, a real-time, self-tuning Kalman filter and fault classification algorithm are combined to provide accurate health estimation. Based on the inferred health condition, mission requirements and flight regime information, the automated fault accommodation module automatically makes decisions regarding control reconfiguration and change of control strategies. The presented techniques have been applied to a generic turbofan engine model with simulated engine component faults and degradation and simulation results are presented. To further raise the technological readiness level, select algorithms have been implemented and evaluated on a PC 104 embedded platform. The dynamic modeling capabilities, techniques and tools sets will not only improve the reliability of the propulsion systems, but also greatly enhance maintenance decision support and contingency planning concepts.

Thermoacoustic oscillation problem, although deeply investigated during the last 15 years, is far from being solved, so that both theoretical and experimental approaches are being used in order to improve basic knowledge of this phenomenon. With this aim an optoelectronic detector based system has been developed to be installed on a 270MW gas turbine to detect radiative energy release fluctuations due to thermoacoustic oscillations. This optoelectronic device has been used in combination with standard piezoelectric sensors with the target to get a better insight of the humming phenomenon. A data analysis method based on well established data processing techniques has been applied to data gathered from the field. The ensemble of data processing techniques seems to offer a method to evaluate the actual risk of thermoacoustic instabilities. This is the very first application of the proposed tool, and a long way has to be run before it is assessed as a prognostic device. Nevertheless in the h.o. of the authors, this first application encourages the continuation of developing the tool extending the base of monitored plants.

Early detection of faults increases the window of opportunity to schedule maintenance actions both at a convenient time and before the fault progresses and causes equipment downtime and secondary damage to the system. Typically, diagnostic models are built using parametric sensor data to infer the state of the system. However, recording and collecting this data is costly, and it is generally limited to a few snapshots over the course of a flight for commercial aircraft. Another way to recognize faults is through the use of built-in tests that produce error log messages. These tests produce data that is less information rich, but provide insight over the course of the entire flight. Each data source provides a different perspective of the state of the system. Therefore, it may be advantageous to combine information from parametric and nonparametric sources to improve fault diagnosis in terms of accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis. In this paper, we investigate integrating parametric sensor data and nonparametric information in fault diagnosis, specifically the way to parameterize nonparametric information for use in diagnostic models that accept only parametric data (e.g., most machine learning techniques). Results from high bypass commercial engines are presented.

Early detection of lubrication anomalies in oil-lubricated bearings	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2007, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd ASME Turbo Expo 2007	MAY 14-17, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers (ASME), Int Gas Turbine Inst			FILM THICKNESS	Condition monitoring of roller element bearings is of considerable interest to many industries since faulty roller element bearings are known to cause the majority of problems in rotating machinery. The class of failure modes in roller bearings that has received the most attention include spalling or localized defect in one or more of the bearing components. This refers to dislodgement of a portion of the contact surface in one or more of the bearing components in the presence of various kinds of stresses like rotor imbalance, speed, bad lubrication, heavy radial and axial loads. Whereas substantial work has been done in the detection of spalls in bearing components, studies show that one of the primary root causes of spalls in a bearing tends to be ineffective lubrication resulting either from lack of lubrication conditions or the presence of contaminants in the lubricant. Leading bearing companies have indicated that incorrect lubrication can account for more than 90% of bearing failures because of which lubrication can be a key influence that can make or break bearing service and life. This emphasizes the need to develop techniques to sense lubrication anomalies as well as provide information needed to act upon them. In other words, monitoring the health and effectiveness of the bearing lubricant should be at the forefront of a condition-monitoring program for bearings. In this paper, we describe experiments, analyses and results obtained for monitoring and detecting anomalies in bearing lubrication for oil-lubricated bearings. More specifically, we consider two kinds of lubrication anomalies: lack of lubrication and contamination of lubrication. Our work involves the use of techniques in sensing and analyses of acoustic emissions from the bearing housing for detection of anomalous lubrication conditions of the above classes. We explore these techniques by conducting controlled experiments where, conditions equivalent to the appropriate fault condition are simulated in a test rig and AE readings are recorded; as a baseline, we also record vibration readings using traditional accelerometers. Our analyses will consist of extracting features from the AE signal that can suitably distinguish between normal and abnormal lubrication conditions. Additional analyses that can potentially be used to understand the degree of severity of the abnormality will also be presented.

Prognostics and health management software for gas turbine engine bearings	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO 2007, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd ASME Turbo Expo 2007	MAY 14-17, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Int Gas Turbine Inst				Based on the results of a successful Phase I and II SBIR program performed by Impact Technologies, a suite of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) algorithms have been developed for detecting incipient faults in the critical bearings associated with aircraft gas turbine engines. The component-level prognostic approach is presented that utilizes available sensor information from vibration transducers, along with material-level component fatigue models to calculate remaining useful life for the engine's critical components. Specifically, correlation between the sensed data and fatigue-based damage accumulation models were developed to provide remaining useful life assessments for life limited components. The combination of health monitoring data and model-based techniques provides a unique and knowledge rich capability that can be utilized throughout the bearings's entire life, using model-based estimates when no diagnostic indicators are present and using the monitored vibration features at later stages when incipient failure indications are detectable, thus reducing the uncertainty in model-based predictions. A description and specific implementation of this prognosis approach with application to high speed bearings is illustrated herein, using gas turbine engine and bearing test rig data as validation for the methods.

The four issues considered here include: (1) Can we characterize, a priori, the difficulty of fault classification via self-organizing maps? (2) Do data reduction techniques improve fault classification performance and enable the implementation of data-driven classification techniques in memory-constrained digital electronic control units (DECUs)?, (3) When does adaptive boosting, an incremental fusion method that successively combines moderately inaccurate classifiers into accurate ones, help improve classification performance?, and (4) How to synthesize classifier fusion architectures to improve the overall diagnostic accuracy? The classifiers studied in this paper are the support vector machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), principal component analysis (PCA), Gaussian mixture models (GMM), and a physics-based single fault isolator (SFI). As these algorithms operate on large volumes of data and are generally computationally expensive, we reduce the dataset using the multi-way partial least squares (MPLS) method. This has the added benefits of improved diagnostic accuracy and smaller memory requirements. The performance of the moderately inaccurate classifiers is improved using adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). These results are compared to the results of the classifiers alone, as well as different fusion architectures. We show that fusion reduces the variability in diagnostic accuracy, and is most useful when combining moderately inaccurate classifiers.

It is the main element for any maintenance program. Due to the basics of the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), vibration prediction systems based on this analysis tool are unable to identify unsteady and non-linear vibrations. They provide only the spectrum content of a signal, but due to its nature, the time interval and the instant when the vibration occurs are eliminated. Therefore, new modem signal analysis tools have been developed. Among them, wavelets have been extensively applied to non-linear vibration and transient analysis. In the case of a rotor rubbing the housing or the bearing, wavelets allow the identification of the "wave shape" through a predetermined time-frequency function. The challenge of this method is the definition of the function that represents the actual phenomenon. Results show that rubbing is a non-linear phenomenon, this was verified through a ramp-up and ramp-down test procedure. It was found that the most appropriate procedure for its identification is through wavelet analysis. The key factor is the definition of the best-fit wavelet.

The testing completed in these projects demonstrated that Induced Positron Analysis (IPA) technologies are sensitive to the tensile plastic strain damage induced in aerospace material specimens and components. The IPA process has shown that IPA methods can reliably detect and quantify plastic strain and plastic deformation under simulated and operational conditions. A preliminary functional relationship between total strain and the normalized IPA S parameter has been developed for several aerospace materials. The fatigue testing has demonstrated the IPA technologies have potential to detect fatigue damage induced in specimens and operational components when the loads are large enough to cause plastic deformation.

A new approach for health monitoring and detection of a shaft crack using an active magnetic actuator during steady-state rotor operation	Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo 2007, Vol 5			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd ASME Turbo Expo 2007	MAY 14-17, 2007	Montreal, CANADA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Int Gas Turbine Inst				This work demonstrates the capability of an Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB) to be used as an actuator for interrogating a system by applying multiple forces to a rotating shaft in order to monitor and evaluate the associated responses to these inputs. Similar to modal analysis techniques which apply input signals to static structures in order to monitor responses to those inputs, this approach allows for the measurement of both input and output response in a rotating system for evaluation. However, unlike these techniques, the procedure developed here allows for multiple forms of force inputs to be applied to a rotating structure. This procedure facilitates the development of new improved techniques for diagnosing subtle changes in machinery health or for identifying faults that would potentially go undetected by conventional methods before failure. Although it is expected that this approach can be used in rotors supported in AMBs, the technique developed here uses an AMB on the rotor in conjunction with conventional support bearings. Therefore, this approach has the potential to be used on any rotating machine that can be designed or retrofitted with a single AMB actuator. To demonstrate this approach experimentally, a notched shaft was chosen to represent a shaft crack for identification purposes. Three cases were examined, including a healthy (un-notched) shaft, and three cases of a shaft with a mid-span notch extending to a depth of 10%, 25%, and 40% of shaft diameter, respectively. During testing, excitations up to 1000 Hz were applied via one axis of the AMB actuator to the four rotor cases while the rotor was operating at a steady-state speed of 2400 rpm, and corresponding responses were recorded at the proximity probes. No changes in the 1(st) or 2(nd) natural frequencies were detected, but distinct shifts in the 3(rd) natural frequency were detected from the Frequency Response Function (FRF) data. Since the vast majority of rotating machinery are designed to operate below the 3(rd) natural frequency, the effect of the notch on the 3rd natural frequency would not have been identified without the application of excitation forces through the AMB actuator. This paper represents an introduction to the new health monitoring approach and results presented here demonstrate the viability of the technique for detecting shaft cracks that might otherwise go undetected in typical steady-state vibration monitoring approaches.

The high frequency system collects and analyzes vibration data to estimate the current condition of rotary components; detects and isolates anomalous behavior to a particular bearing, gear, shaft or coupling; and assesses the severity of the fault in the isolated faulty component. The system uses either single/multiple accelerometers, mounted on externally accessible locations, or non-contact vibration monitoring sensors to collect data. While there are published instances of vibration monitoring algorithms for bearing or gear fault detection, there are no comprehensive techniques that provide incipient fault detection and isolation in complex machinery with multiple rotary and drive train components. The author's techniques provide an algorithm-driven system that fulfills this need. The concept at the core of high frequency vibration monitoring for incipient fault detection is the ability of high frequency regions of the signal to transmit information related to component failures during the fault inception stage. Unlike high frequency regions, the lower frequency regions of vibration data have a high machinery noise floor that often masks the incipient fault signature. The low frequency signal reacts to the fault only when fault levels are high enough for the signal to rise over the machinery noise floor. The developed vibration monitoring system therefore utilizes high frequency vibration data to provide a quantitative assessment of the current health of each component. The system sequentially ascertains sensor validity, extracts multiple statistical, time, and frequency domain features from broadband data, fuses these features, and acts upon this information to isolate faults in a particular gear, bearing, or shaft. The techniques are based on concepts like mechanical transmissibility of structures and sensors, statistical signal processing, demodulation, time synchronous averaging, artificial intelligence, failure modes, and faulty vs. healthy vibration behavior for rotating components. The system exploits common aspects of vibration monitoring algorithms, as applicable to all of the monitored components, to reduce algorithm complexity and computational cost. To isolate anomalous behavior to a particular gear, bearing, shaft, or coupling, the system uses design information and knowledge of the degradation process in these components. This system can function with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) data acquisition and processing systems or can be adapted to aircraft on-board hardware. The authors have successfully tested this system on a wide variety of test stands and aircraft engine test cells through seeded fault and fault progression tests, as described herein. Verification and Validation (V&V) of the algorithms is also addressed.

In this Paper, we use a combined SVM method with RBF kernel function to predict incipient fault of power transformer and compare the effect with the traditional ANN method. Before the classification, the extracted features from original and preprocessed features are used as the input to the SVM classifier. The selection of input features and the appropriate classifier parameters have been optimized with a GA-based approach which improve the accuracy of classification systems by removing redundant input features that may confuse the classifier.

In order to make use of more information of mechanical system, multiple time series acquired from machinery equipment are combined with the multivariate embedding theory to reconstruct dynamical attractors. In the multivariate reconstructed phase space, a new attractor-based metric, angle of attractor evolution (AAE), is then introduced as a fault sensitive feature. An important property of AAE is that the differences of data distribution of dynamical attractor are used to reveal the change of mechanical system. The method is validated by using data measured from Lorenz chaotic system with additive Gaussian white noise and periodical impact with increasing amplitude. In addition, the method is applied to the analysis of vibration signals measured from a bearing test-bed. In the experiment, the outer races of the bearings are made with some pits on purpose, representing different levels of fault. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on AAE has an ability to discern the condition variation of dynamics. That is, with fault level increasing, AAE will grow up to reflect the changes. Also, the experiments indicate that AAE has advantage over the traditional features such as Lyapunov exponents and approximate entropy in terms of the noise robustness.

Time stepping finite element analysis of broken bars fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							STATE SPACE MODEL; ROTOR BARS; AIR-GAP; MACHINE; ECCENTRICITIES; DIAGNOSTICS; CONNECTORS; DRIVES	Broken rotor bars and end-ring are common faults in three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors. These faults reduce the developed toque and increase the speed fluctuations of the motor. Meanwhile, developed unsymmetrical magnetic generates noise and vibration in the motor. Local heat around the broken bars may gradually break the adjacent bars and the motor will be finally out of service. Finite element method (FEM) is the most accurate technique for diagnosis and analysis of induction motor, because it can include all actual characteristics of the healthy and faulty induction motors. However, current density is generally considered as input for performance computation process, while fault can inject a large harmonics to the stator current. These harmonics may not be ignored in the fault diagnosis of the motor. In addition, all FE applications consider the steady-state mode of operation. In this paper, a three-phase voltage-fed squirrel-cage induction motor with rotor broken bars is proposed and analyzed for the starting period of the motor. Both no-load and on-load cases are considered. Also, concentrated rotor broken bars under one-pole and the distributed rotor broken bars under different poles are studied and compared.

A cyclostationary process is defined as a non-stationary process which has a periodic time variation in some of its statistics, and which can be characterized in terms of its order of periodicity. This study is focused on the use of cyclic spectral analysis, as a tool to analyze second-order periodicity signals (SOP), such as, those who are generated by either localized or distributed defects in bearings. Cyclic spectral analysis mainly consists of the estimation of the random aspects as well as the periodic behavior of a vibration signal, based on estimation of the spectral correlation density. The usefulness of cyclic spectral analysis for the condition monitoring of bearings, is demonstrated in this paper, through the analysis of several sections of vibration data collected during an endurance test of one of the two main gearbox transmissions of a helicopter.

The most common structural damages in rotating machinery are rotor shaft crack, rotor to stator rub, and bolts looseness and so on. In the present paper, the model based identification method is used to detect single structural damage such as crack, rotor to stator rub, pedestal looseness, and also, coupling fault such as rotor to stator rub and crack, crack and pedestal looseness. Utilizing the characteristic that equivalent loads of rub forces are internal forces, and the equivalent loads of the crack are external moments, the coupling faults of crack and rub-impact and crack and pedestal looseness are analyzed and exampled. The merit of the method is that it is an online diagnosis method, which provides early warning of machine failure. Theoretical simulation and laboratory testing are conducted to validate the method.

Quick and accurate identification of the root cause of failures is an important prerequisite for building reliable systems. We describe a pragmatic model-based technique for application- specific fault diagnosis based on indicators, symptoms and rules. Customized wrapper services then apply this knowledge to reason about root causes of failures. In addition to user-provided diagnosis models we show that given a set of past classified fault events it is possible to extract new models through learning that are able to diagnose new faults. We investigated and compared algorithms of supervised classification learning and cluster analysis. Our approach was implemented as part of the Otho Toolkit that 'service-enables' legacy applications based on synthesis of wrapper service.

It is a promising tool for the machine condition monitoring and early fault feature extraction. But the traditional BSS algorithm is based on the hypothesis of the statistical independence of the sources and without using any other priori information about the sources. Aiming at the vibration signal analysis and condition monitoring of the gearbox, this paper studies on how to utilize the given information of gearbox vibration signals such as the gears meshing frequency, the feature frequency of bearing fault and etc, to improve the signal separation accuracy in BSS applications and how the impact of vibration signal transmission path on the separation results. The separation effectiveness of the new method has been analyzed and verified by its real application to the gearbox vibration signal detection.

Singularity analysis using dyadic wavelet transform for bearing fault diagnosis	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2007: QUANTIFICATION, VALIDATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION, VOLS 1 AND 2	Structural Health Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	SEP 11-13, 2007	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Off, Natl Sci Fdn, Off Naval Res	Stanford Univ		SIGNALS	Singularities often carry the most important information in signals. Singularity detection is a promising tool for the machine condition monitoring and early fault feature extraction. But the singularities in signals are normally buried in the wideband noise and high frequency structural resonance. Traditional method of signal processing cannot be used to detect singularities. Basing on B-spline wavelet function and fast - torus algorithm, This paper presents a new singularity detection technique, the new method uses the products of the adjacent two-stage detail signals as detected signal, then through the local maxima of a wavelet transform detects the singularity points. it has been shown that the new method can effectively enhance signal while restraining noises and can get the location of singularity point accurately through the local modulus maxima. And the new method has been successfully applied into the fault signal singularity detection of rolling bearings, and provides a new way for mechanical fault diagnosis.

In this paper we take the view that the modest fault detection of state-based class testing reported in the literature is actually due to the inappropriate state diagram used. We show that functional testing of a class can be reduced to state-based testing, provided that the right state model is produced. We present a strategy for constructing a state diagram for a class method, based on a domain partition derived through functional techniques. We also describe a method for deriving test sequences from the resulting state diagrams, essentially a variant of the W-method. The paper also reports results from an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach, based on mutants generated by Mu-Java.

We propose a new approach for EFSM-based passive fault detection which randomly selects a state in M and checks whether there is a trace in M starting from this state which is compatible with the observed behaviors. If a compatible trace is found, we determine that observed behaviors are not sufficient to declare the SUT to be faulty; otherwise, we check another unchecked state. If all the states have been checked and no compatible trace is found, we declare that the SUT is faulty. We use a Hybrid method in our approach which combines the use of both Interval Refinement and Simplex methods to improve the performance of passive fault detection.

The artificial intelligent such as neural network is widely used in fault diagnosis and substituted for traditional methods. In rotary machinery, the symptoms of vibration signals in frequency domain have been used as inputs to the neural network and diagnosis results are obtained by network computation. However, in gear or rolling bearing system, it is difficult to extract the symptoms from vibration signals in frequency domain which have shock vibration signals. The diagnosis results are not satisfied by using artificial neural network, if the training samples are not enough. The Bayesian networks (BN) is an effective method for uncertain knowledge and less information in faults diagnosis. In order to classify the instantaneous shock of vibration signals in gear train system, the statistical parameters of vibration signals in time-domain are used in this study. These statistical parameters include kurtosis, crest, skewness factors etc. There, based on the statistical parameters of vibration signals in time-domain, the fault diagnosis is implemented by using BN and compared with two methods back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) in gear train system.

The main objective of this paper is to determine the relationships between bearing vibration/noise and the amount of flaws in ball bearing assemblies for transmissions systems used in general household appliances. In this study, 30 "good" and 30 "bad" ball bearings, selected during factory "end of line" noise-based quality inspections, are used for experimental vibration testing and measurements of flaws. While the good bearings are obtained from the lot of bearings tested with acceptable noise level, the bad bearings are obtained from the lot with high rejection level. For the bad bearings, although some irregularities are found in the ball elements, most of the flaws are found in the outer races. The levels of the flaws are measured using micrometers and vibration signals of the bearings are acquired from the accelerometers attached to the bearing supports at the bearing test rig. In this study, vibration results from the time domain averaging, frequency component averaging, and the modified Poincare maps are examined. While the average time signal technique does not provide a clear definition for the bad bearings, both the average frequency component and the modified Poincare map techniques can provide a much clearer definition. It is also found that the modified Poincare map technique not only will give a clear definition for the bad bearings, it will also provide an effective means to identify the type or location of the flaw. In addition, by comparing the detection techniques with the level of the damage/flaw, it is found that the modified Poincare map technique can also provide a reasonable relationship between its amplitude and the damage level.

In this sense, it is aimed to find potential defects, which exist in healthy motor bearings as manufacturing defects as compared to the faulty case. This approach extracts the origin of the bearing damage that develops during the aging process. In this manner, the advantage of the SWT over the DWT is emphasized. Hence, it can be introduced as a new approach for condition monitoring studies in rotating machineries like the induction motors.	[Seker, Serhat; Karatoprak, Erinc; Kayran, A.

Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) have proven to be particularly suitable in this regard since they support small lot sizes and high numbers of variants at the same time. Among the most important problems of FMS are the huge expenditure of time and the high costs for engineering its control software. Engineering in this context refers to all aspects from planning the specific production process, assigning control programs to machines, implementing software modules, to testing the whole configuration. In this paper, we describe a new approach to verify a distributed agent-oriented shop floor control system systematically on the basis of a virtual process qualification.

Process data from normal historical batches are used to develop the MPLS model, and a series of single-input-single-output SVM networks are adopted to approximate nonlinear inner relationship between input and output variables. In addition, the application of a time-lagged window technique not only makes the complementarities of unmeasured data of the monitored batch unnecessary, but also significantly reduces the computation and storage requirements in comparison with the traditional MPLS. The proposed approach is validated by a simulation study of on-line fault detection for a fed-batch penicillin production.

Traditional methods mainly focused on developing prediction algorithms, rather than pay attention to the understanding of the data. This paper presents an innovative method to quantitatively evaluate the predictability of machinery performance based on information redundancy and a statistical simulation technique. The predictability of a series of simulated signals and practical vibration data were analyzed and a high-precision prediction was achieved by computing the redundancies of these sample sequences. The results show that evaluation tool can present a clear indication of machine performance predictability and therefore can guide the development and selection of prediction algorithms for predictive maintenance.

J	Fang, RM; Ma, HZ				Fang, Ruiming; Ma, Hongzhong			Hybrid rough set and support vector machine for faults diagnosis of power transformer	DYNAMICS OF CONTINUOUS DISCRETE AND IMPULSIVE SYSTEMS-SERIES B-APPLICATIONS & ALGORITHMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Complex Systems and Applications	JUN 16-18, 2006	Huhhot, PEOPLES R CHINA					The available testing data for power transformer are always incomplete and biased, which make the task of power transformer fault diagnosis difficult. This paper presents a method for fault diagnosis of power transformers using the hybrid of Rough Set (RS) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The approach uses the results of Dissolved Gas-in-oil Analysis (DGA) as the necessary attributes to classify different faults of power transformer. In virtue of the ability rough set has to decrease the amount of data and get rid of redundancy, the method can reduce amount of training data and overcome SVM's defect of slow running speed when processing large dataset. At the same time, by the aid of SVM algorithm the method can classify the core of property set so as to have extensiveness and high identification rate, and avoid disturbance. In particular, the historical data of transformer faults was used for validation and the results show the practical viability of the proposed approach.

This paper applies support vector machines (SVM) to predict the condition trend and fault feature value of mechanical equipment. A practical support vector regression (SVR) algorithm is developed according the method of time-series prediction. The parameters that affect the prediction performance are investigated. The corresponding optimal parameters are obtained based on the minimal prediction error with the change of the parameters on the testing set. Thus the prediction model of SVR is constructed based on the data. The analog data and practical data are respectively used to test the prediction performance. The optimal results have been obtained with the optimal parameters. In the practical data, the feature values of prediction can be used as an important evidence for judging what kind of fault will happen. Thus we can prognose and prevent incipient mechanical faults.

Independent components are found from the measured machine vibration signals, then they are inputted to the SVNI for fault.identification and classification. The experimental results show that by using ICA features we obtained a larger margin of separation and fewer support vectors than by training SVM directly on the measured data. This indicates better generalization performance, which was verified in our experiments.

Application of an additional excitation in inverter-fed induction motors for air-gap eccentricity diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						air-gap eccentricity; fault diagnosis; induction motor drives; position estimation	MACHINES	In this paper, the application of an additional excitation in induction motor (IM) drives for static, dynamic, and mixed eccentricity diagnosis is proposed. The additional excitation consists in a predefined inverter-switching pattern that is applied on the motor for a short time, while the fundamental excitation is canceled. This excitation was used previously to implement a position estimation strategy. The strategy obtains information about the rotor position from the motor saliencies effects over the zero-sequence voltage. The air-gap eccentricity is a kind of saliency that affects the zero-sequence voltage and allows. the use of the additional excitation for eccentricity diagnosis. For the evaluation of the feasibility of this proposal, a multiple-coupled circuit model of the IM is used. The effects of series and series-parallel stator winding connections on the diagnosis signals are shown. Experimental results to validate the proposal are also given. These results show that it is possible to use the diagnosis strategy in a self-commissioning scheme.

Interturn fault diagnosis in induction motors using the pendulous oscillation phenomenon	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						broken-bar; condition monitoring; induction motor; interturn short circuit; stator fault; transient modeling	STATOR; BAR; ORIENTATION; MACHINES	A robust interturn fault diagnostic approach based on the concept of magnetic field pendulous oscillation, which occurs in induction motors under faulty conditions, is introduced in this paper. This approach enables one to distinguish and classify an unbalanced voltage power supply and machine manufacturing/construction imperfections from an interturn fault. The experimental results for the two case studies of a set of 5-hp and 2-hp induction motors verify the validity of the proposed approach. Moreover, it can be concluded from the experimental results that if the circulating current level in the shorted loop increases beyond the phase current level, an interturn fault can be easily detected using the proposed approach even in the presence of the existence of motor manufacturing imperfection effects.

J	Jung, JH; Kwon, BH				Jung, Jee-Hoon; Kwon, Bong-Hwan			Corrosion model of a rotor-bar-under-fault progress in induction motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						corrosion model; induction motor; motor current signature analysis (MCSA); motor diagnosis; motor modeling; rotor-bar fault	DYNAMIC SIMULATION; ECCENTRICITY; MACHINES	A corrosion model of a rotor-bar-under-fault progress in induction motors is presented for simulations of induction machines with a rotor-bar fault. A rotor-bar model is derived from the electromagnetic theory. A leakage inductance of the corrosion model of a rotor bar is calculated from the relations of magnetic energy, inductance, current, and magnetic-field intensity by Ampere's law. The leakage inductance and resistance of a rotor bar varies when the rotor bar rusts. In addition, the skin effect is considered to establish the practical model of a rotor bar. Consequently, the variation of resistance and leakage inductance has an effect on the results of motor dynamic simulations and experiments, since a corrosive rotor bar is one model of a rotor bar in fault progress. The results of simulations and experiments are shown to be in good agreement with the spectral analysis of stator-current harmonics. From the proposed corrosion model, motor current signature analysis can detect the fault of a corrosive rotor bar as the progress of a rotor-bar fault. Computer simulations were achieved using the MATLAB Simulink with an electrical model of a 3.7-kW, three-phase, and squirrel-cage induction motor. Also, experimental results were obtained by real induction motors, which had the same specification as the electrical model used in the simulation.

J	Jung, JH; Lee, JJ; Kwon, BH				Jung, Jee-Hoon; Lee, Jong-Jae; Kwon, Bong-Hwan			Online diagnosis of induction motors using MCSA	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						induction motor; motor current signature analysis (MCSA); motor diagnosis; signal processing	DYNAMIC SIMULATION; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; ROTOR SLOT; ECCENTRICITY; MACHINES; FAULTS	In this paper, an online induction motor diagnosis system using motor current signature analysis (MCSA) with advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms is proposed. MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. The proposed system diagnoses induction motors having four types of faults such as breakage of rotor bars and end rings, short-circuit of stator windings, bearing cracks, and air-gap eccentricity. Although MCSA is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some shortcomings, which degrade performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They are composed of an optimal-slip-estimation algorithm, a proper-sample-selection algorithm, and a frequency auto search algorithm for achieving MCSA efficiently. The proposed system is able to ascertain four kinds of motor faults and diagnose the fault status of an induction motor. Experimental results obtained on 3.7-kW and 30-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors and voltage-source inverters with a vector-control technique are discussed.

Since the quality of the twisted yam is directly deteriorated by faults of the twister, such as the distortion of the spinning axis, bearing abrasion, and tension irregularity, it is important to detect faults of the TFO twister at an early stage. In this research, a new algorithm is proposed to detect faults of the TFO twister and their causes, by measuring the vibrations of the TFO twister and obtaining frequency components with a FFT algorithm. The TFO twister with faults showed increased vibrations and each fault generated vibrations at different frequencies. By analyzing changes of characteristics of vibrations, we can determine faulty twisters. The proposed fault detection algorithm can be implemented cheaply with a signal processor chip. It can be used to find when to repair a faulty TFO twister without much loss of yam on-line.

Proper condition monitoring on bearings is therefore essential to reduce the duration of machine down-times. This paper introduces feature extraction methodologies that can facilitate early detection of bearing faults. The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. Both linear and non-linear features are extracted using Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension (MFD). Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients and kurtosis. The extracted features are then used to classify faults using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and hidden Markov Models (HMM). Results demonstrate that HMM outperforms GMM in classification of bearing faults. However, the disadvantage of HMM is that it is computationally expensive to train compared to GMM.

J	Lee, SY				Lee, Sin-Young			Acoustic diagnosis of a pump by using neural network	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						acoustic diagnosis; pump; neural network; deformed cases; frequency domain	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET	A fundamental study for developing a fault diagnosis system of a pump is performed by using neural network. Acoustic signals were obtained and converted to frequency domain for normal products and artificially deformed products. The neural network model used in this study was 3-layer type composed of input, hidden, and output layer. The normalized amplitudes at the multiples of real driving frequency were chosen as units of input layer. And the codes of pump malfunctions were selected as units of output layer. Various sets of teach signals made from original data by eliminating some random cases were used in the training. The average errors were approximately proportional to the number of untaught data. Neural network trained by acoustic signals can detect malfunction or diagnose fault of a given machine from the results.

J	Li, HK; Zhou, PL; Ma, XJ				Li, Hongkun; Zhou, Peilin; Ma, Xiaojiang			Marine diesel engine fault diagnosis by using an improved Hilbert spectrum	JOURNAL OF SHIP RESEARCH			English	Article							TIME; NETWORKS	Vibration signal analysis is a useful method for recognizing the pattern of a machine's working condition. However, it is difficult to recognize nonstationary and nonlinear vibration signal patterns satisfactorily with the traditional Fourier spectrum method. This paper introduces a novel time-frequency distribution method: an improved Hilbert spectrum (HS) for nonstationary vibration signal analysis, that is, applying a wavelet packet de-noise method as a preprocess of the HS. The HS is developed according to instantaneous frequency analysis by using a new kind of signal analysis method called empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is highly accurate in analyzing various nonstationary and nonlinear signals. Due to a self-adaptive decomposition process, noise has a great effect on the accuracy of the EMD process and the corresponding HS. This has limited the application of the HS on real vibration analysis. In this study, a wavelet packet de-noising technique is employed as a preprocessing to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy of the HS. Experimental data of a marine diesel fuel injection system are used to evaluate the improved methodology for system pattern recognition and fault diagnosis.

J	Chinniah, Y; Burton, R; Habibi, S				Chinniah, Y.; Burton, R.; Habibi, S.			Failure monitoring in a high performance hydrostatic actuation system using the extended Kalman filter	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						fault detection; parameter identification; high performance actuation system; extended Kalman filter (EKF)	DESIGN	This paper describes the development and evaluation of a fault detection strategy for a high performance hydrostatic actuation system, the electrohydraulic actuator (EHA). The approach makes use of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique for parameter estimation purposes and changes in the estimated system parameters were related to faults in the EHA. The hydrostatic system has potential applications in the aerospace industry, in robotics, in machining and as such, failures in the EHA can pose a safety hazard as well as result in costly downtime and unscheduled maintenance. Monitoring failures in the hydrostatic system is achieved by estimating two parameters of interest, namely the viscous friction coefficient and the effective bulk modulus. Changes in the viscous friction coefficient in the actuator indicate deterioration of the hydraulic oil or wear in the seals. Lowering of the effective bulk modulus affects the response of the closed loop system, reduces system bandwidth and may cause instability. A simulation study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of the approach as well as the level of accuracy to be expected. The methodology was then verified using experimental results.

Vibration monitoring in electrical engines using an in-line fiber etalon	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL			English	Article						vibration monitoring; ILFE sensor; mass-spring accelerometer; electrical engine fault detection; Fabry-Perot interferometers	SENSORS	In this work a new scheme for condition monitoring of electrical engines using a fiber optic sensor is proposed. The in-line fiber etalon scheme, specifically designed for the detection of damages in large electrical machines, provides high robustness and stability. In general, these large systems are characterized by a low speed operation, and when a new mechanical or electrical fault appears, it can be monitored through the vibration spectrum in the low frequency range, with a maximum bandwidth of 500 Hz. The proposed sensor has been optimized to achieve minimum detectable acceleration amplitude of 0.05 g in the frequency range of interest, although the preliminary scheme can be customized to the specific motion system. The vibration sensor has been tested using laboratory induction motor test-rigs, showing a particularly good performance both in the detection of magnetic and mechanical nature vibrations.
