It is well known that there exists a tradeoff between the cost and the resilience. For instance, Crash Fault Tolerant (CFT) protocols have a low cost but can only handle crash failures while Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols handle arbitrary failures but have a higher cost. Hybrid protocols enjoy the benefits of both high performance without failures and high resiliency under failures by switching among different subprotocols. However, it is challenging to determine which subprotocols should be used. We propose a moving target approach to switch among protocols according to the existing system and network vulnerability. At the core of our approach is a formalized cost model that evaluates the vulnerability and performance of consensus protocols based on real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) signals. Based on the evaluation results, we demonstrate that a safe, cheap, and unpredictable protocol is always used and a high IDS error rate can be tolerated.

So to ensure safety and to avoid unexpected situation or accident, physical damage state and remaining useful life of electronic modules must be quantified prior to any future redeployment. Study on the effect of aging and the effect of aging on thermal cycling reliability through material property evolution is already done but evolution of strain as a function of aging and number of thermal cycling is yet to be studied. Additionally industry needs a more realistic and quicker approach to quantify damage. Prior studies have revealed that lead-free material properties degrade with prolonged exposure to high temperature storage or thermal fatigue environment which in turn influences the stress-strain behavior of solder ball. Effects include the degradation in the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength of the materials. [1-2]. In operational environment, it is of utmost necessity to assess the damage state and the remaining useful life of components to avoid any unexpected situation or accidents. From this aspect, evolution of shear strain range with number of thermal cycling undergone can be used as a strong prognostic tool. The degree of how much shear strain varies between aged and non-aged thermal cycled samples is worth investigating, as well. Mostly optical methods are employed to study strain field, mainly Moire and Digital Image Correlation (DIC), but DIC is much easier, quicker and cheaper than Moire, as it needs less surface preparation.

Cu being more reactive that Au, fails prematurely when subjected to high temperature-humidity conditions. To track down degradation of the Cu wirebonds over the period of its lifetime, leading indicators of failure must be identified. This data can be then used for development of prognostics framework and predict remaining useful life of field extracted part. Premature failure of Cu-Al wire bonded devices subjected to high temperature and humidity condition is a major reliability issue. Even though failure mechanisms for Cu wirebond (WB) for these conditions are available, leading indicators of failure which will reflect accumulative damage are not yet identified. In this paper, prognostics model for Cu WB subjected to high temperature-humidity environment is presented. A set of parts were subjected to high temperature-high humidity environment. Resistance, change in shear strength and shear failure modes were monitored during this study. Resistance spectroscopy was used for accurate measurement of resistance. Ball shear tester was used to calculate change in shear strength. This data was used to identify leading indicator of failure and prognostics matrix was developed for prediction of remaining useful life based on extended kalman filtering (EKF) technique.

While APC provides many benefits, it also presents many implementation and operational challenges including significant up-front configuration cost, lack of solution accuracy resulting in false/missed alarms, and lack of a consistent capability for prognostics leading to scrap, lost productivity and reduced quality. Next Generation APC (NG-APC) is an evolutionary solution that addresses these challenges and provides new capabilities for APC solutions. It leverages recent advancements in the traditional APC capabilities as well as benefits provided by big data and prediction capabilities. Key enhancements include single-threaded R2R control for improved high-mix process control capability, semi-automation of FDC model development with model and limits optimization through a move to "supervised" FDC, improved data management and analysis capabilities through leveraging of big data architectures, and incorporation of prediction capabilities in solutions for improved process quality and uptime with reduced cost. Additionally, NGAPC is structured as an extensible solution, thus it can continue to evolve as new APC and related technologies emerge.

The technique emphasizes on sensing the stator current of the induction motor and analyzing the current for detecting the fault. The technique is minimalist and uses less number of sensors and thus cost-effective and can also be easily implemented. The technique is also non-invasive and thus less intricate. The proposed scheme can be used on-line for fault diagnosis. Experimental studies on a machine with main winding inter-turn fault and comparison of the findings with a healthy machine of similar ratings shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Different types of bearing fault identification techniques have been discussed in literature with the analysis of time domain, frequency domain and time-frequency domain based features. The proposed methods were examined under laboratorial set-up keeping rotating speed and or load variation remains unchanged. And the practical situations of external vibrational effect and noises from various sources of process plant also have not been considered in a vast way. This paper delivers a brief idea of the identification of bearing faulty harmonics which are collected by accelerometer during running condition under random variation of both, speed and load of the motor with the presence of non-stationary external vibrations. The study also revealed that, faulty bearing can be identified from the vibration signal, by programming the PLC based system to collect vibration data only when process enters into some predefined situation, and thereafter by analyzing the vibration amplitude using standard deviation the faulty bearing can be identified.

Firstly, tear and isolate the target network with the use of AC and DC excitation. Then, prefer test node according to the concept of sub-network sensitivity and extract its information as fault feature after the Monte Carlo analysis and normalized processing. Finally, achieve fault network identification with the use of support vector machine classifier. The diagnosis principles and steps are described. Finally, the efficiency of the method is shown by practical examples comparing with the existing method, this approach which is suitable for tolerance and non-linear circuits, has smaller less computation, higher accuracy, and stronger engineering practicality.

There have been many investigations on methods to improve the accuracy of the diagnostic, and Machine Learning (ML) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) tools are among the most successfully employed modern methods. On the other hand, Logistic Regression (LR), a traditional and popular statistical method for classification, is not commonly used by computer scientists as those modern methods usually outperform it. Here we show that LR can achieve results that are similar to those of ML and EC methods and can even outperform them when useful knowledge is discovered in the dataset. In this paper, we employ the recently proposed Kaizen Programming (KP) approach with LR to construct high-quality nonlinear combinations of the original features resulting in new sets of features. Experimental analysis indicates that the new sets provide significantly better predictive accuracy than the original ones. When compared to related work from the literature, it is shown that the proposed approach is competitive and a promising method for automatic feature construction.

In this context, we investigate the problem of scheduling several jobs on a single machine subjected to predictive maintenance based on PHM. We propose a new hybrid genetic immune algorithm, called IPro-HGIA, which incorporates an emulation of GA with artificial immune system, to create an integrated prognostic based scheduling for planning both production and predictive maintenance interventions under the total interventions cost minimization criterion. Furthermore, we use the principals of vaccination and receptor editing in order to strengthen search ability. Computational results show the efficiency of our hybrid scheme.

When fault exists, gearbox vibration signals feature amplitude modulation as well as frequency modulation, resulting in complex frequency structure. Besides, gearboxes often work under nonstationary conditions due to time-varying speed/load, resulting in nonstationary vibration signals which makes conventional frequency domain analysis ineffective. In this paper, we propose a time-frequency demodulation analysis method for presenting time-frequency spectra of both amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of analyzed signal, which directly reflect the fault frequency components on time-frequency plane without complex sidebands. To fulfill the mono-component requirement of instantaneous frequency estimation by Hilbert transform, iterative generalized demodulation is effectively exploited to decompose multi-component nonstationary signals into mono-components. Both numerical simulated and lab experimental gearbox vibration signals under nonstationary conditions are analyzed by the proposed method, and gear faults are effectively detected.

A novel model combining SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) and binary tree (BT) based on Mahalanobis distance is put forward to address the multi-classification problems under unbalanced datasets. The idea of the proposed method is to divide the original samples into a series of subsets by adopting binary tree, and then build classifier by describing the boundary of the target via SVDD. The proposed method has emphatically studied on: 1) Separability measure based on Mahalanobis distance. It represents the separability degree which takes the unbalanced degree and distance between each class into account, and takes the advantages of considering the relations among all the features of the datasets by the definition of Mahalanobis distance, it is helpful to determine the structure of the binary tree. 2) Train classifiers by using SVDD. Choose the target class according to the order of binary tree. The proposed method can be applied to multi-classification problems with unbalanced datasets issues. To validate this methodology, samples from unbalanced rotor are employed for experiment. Then, the experimental result compared with other methods is presented showing that the proposed methodology has a better performance and higher classification accuracy on multi-classification problems under unbalanced datasets.

To gain maturity and to take more accurate decisions, algorithms need a reality check on the significance of their results. Algorithms have been deployed on in service fleets of engines, getting access to large amounts of data. Nevertheless, probabilities of failure are very low. Thus there are not enough degradation cases collected to compute with accuracy performance metrics, such as Probability of False Alarm (PFA) and Probability of Detection (PoD), for each algorithm. To address this issue, healthy indicators distributions are used to set detection alarm thresholds. Those thresholds are first checked on healthy data and on rare degradations. Algorithms shall indeed raise no alarm on healthy cases and detect all rare degradations. This allows to alarm the operator only when a health indicator is changing. On the base of following observed failure mechanisms, simulations can help to compute with accuracy performance metrics.

The concept of applying OS-ELM to fault detection is demonstrated on an artificial case study. We expect that OS-ELM can contribute to improve the fault detection and also the associated initiation of maintenance activities for engineering components working in an evolving environment such as electric components, bearings, gears, alternators, shafts and pumps, in which the monitored signals are not only significantly affected by working load and surrounding environment but may also experience some modifications due to a slow aging and degradation process.

Diagnosing Wind Turbine Faults Using Machine Learning Techniques Applied to Operational Data	2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 20-22, 2016	Carleton Univ, Ottawa, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Reliabil Soc	Carleton Univ	SCADA Data; Wind Turbine; Fault Detection; SVM; FDD		Unscheduled or reactive maintenance on wind turbines due to component failures incurs significant downtime and, in turn, loss of revenue. To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. By continuously monitoring turbine health, it is possible to detect incipient faults and schedule maintenance as needed, negating the need for unnecessary periodic checks. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost. In this paper, data is obtained from the SCADA system of a turbine in the South-East of Ireland. Fault and alarm data is filtered and analysed in conjunction with the power curve to identify periods of nominal and fault operation. Classification techniques are then applied to recognise fault and fault-free operation by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show success in predicting some types of faults.	[Leahy, Kevin; Hu, R.

Vibration signature analysis usually provides a good potential for gearbox incipient fault detection. This article presents an application of frequency analysis on vibration signatures obtained from a faulty gearbox. Experiments were carried out on an accessory gearbox of a J85 engine, which serves on several aircrafts such as Canadair CT-114 Tutor. Real operating system of the gearbox is reconstructed on a test rig located at the National Research Council of Canada. A spalling defect was artificially introduced to a flank of one of the pinions of the gearbox at the meshing section. Vibrations of the gearbox under various operating conditions are measured by an accelerometer mounted on the gearbox housing. Raw signals are first time synchronous-averaged (TSA) to reduce noise and then the averaged signals are transformed into frequency domain for analysis. Order analysis, which represents all frequencies in terms of shafts' rotating frequency, is employed instead of traditional frequency analysis in this investigation. Testing results demonstrate that the fundamental and the second gear mesh frequency (GMF) contain the major features of the gearbox health condition. Analysis results also show that at a constant operating speed, the spalling defect attenuates the power of the fundamental GMF while strengthens the power of the second GMF. Accordingly, the magnitude ratio between the fundamental and the second GMF is introduced as an indicator for spalling defect detection. The fault indicator is capable of clearly distinguishing the normal pinion from the defected one. It is also observed that the proposed fault indicator is robust and is consistent as the load on the gear is varied.

This paper presents a data-driven approach for estimating RUL using principle component and instance learning. The approach is especially suitable for situations in which abundant run-to-failure (RtF) data are available. Firstly, the principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find the low-dimensional principal components (PCs) from the statistical features of the measured signals. Then, the health indicators (HI) can be obtained by using weighted Euclid distance (WED), and regressed by the data-driven methods or model-based methods. Finally, the method based on instance learning is employed to estimate the RUL of the machine under operation. The performance of the prognostics approach introduced in this paper is demonstrated by using turbofan engine degradation simulation data set, which is supplied by NASA Ames.

EPS systems not only provide steering assist to drivers but they are also actuators for recently developed active safety features, such as lane keeping and lane changing assist. Failure of some component of the EPS system can lead to walk-home situations and increased warranty costs. Hence, for the improvement of reliability, safety, and efficiency of EPS systems, fault detection, diagnosis, and prognosis become increasingly important. This paper provides fault detection for EPS systems through model-based techniques using parameter estimation to determine the current electric parameters of the EPS motor. In addition, by monitoring the deviation of the self-aligning torque (SAT) estimated from two different methods, changes in EPS mechanical parameters can be detected. The progression of this deviation can be fed into a health state estimator which can give an indication of state of health and remaining useful life. Computer simulations as well as hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to illustrate this method. Finally, for integrated system diagnosis and fault isolation, a fault signature table is constructed based on estimations of motor parameters, calculations of road SAT, and residuals of parity equations. This table can be used to detect and isolate considered electrical, mechanical, and sensor faults in the EPS system and simulation results are shown to verify the developed ideas.

By their very nature, these systems pose several technical obstacles. The systems to be monitored are distributed, often at remote locations, requiring a data collection network infrastructure that is secure, robust to intermittent connectivity and scalable. Heterogeneous "leading indicator" data is collected from various sources: discrete forms of data such as status, state, mode, system error reporting and inputs from other software systems; parametric data such as environmental sensors and system sensors; and manually collected data such as operator observables and maintenance actions performed. Disparate sources and forms of data also pose a challenge for analysis. Thus, in order to implement a CBM solution for complex distributed systems, it must be based on three core pillars: smart sensors capable of collecting heterogeneous data types, scalable and generically applicable predictive analysis methodologies, and a secure network infrastructure. Mikros is currently deploying a CBM+ system for combat systems on the U.S. Navy's Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). In this CBM+ system application, smart sensors are used to collect heterogeneous data from Navy combat systems. Data is collected in IEEE SIMICA standard format and transferred securely from LCS ships deployed around the world to a central server in the U.S. The Prognostics Framework (R), a model-based prognostics reasoning engine, is used to analyze all data to produce prognostic alarms, identify maintenance action needs, report Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of key components, and provide a comprehensive health management capability for the LCS fleet. In summary, heterogeneous data collection made possible through smart sensor technology, model-based prognostics, and a secure network infrastructure provide a flexible and extensible framework to implement CBM for complex distributed systems.

Therefore accurate fault diagnosis of machine failure is vital to the operation and production departments. The majority of Machine imperfections and malfunctions have been related to bearings faults. Many researchers are still exploring to find suitable diagnosis strategies and techniques to detect incipient bearing faults. A new integrated Hilbert-Huang technique (iHT) is proposed in this paper for bearing fault detection. The iHT takes two processes; firstly: representative signatures are extracted and secondly the resulting selected features are employed to highlight defect-related impulses for incipient bearing fault detection. A novel Jarque-Bera analysis method is suggested to select most prominent characteristic feature functions and the signals are integrated to enhance the features of the condition related function. The effectiveness of the proposed iHT technique is verified by a series of experimental tests corresponding to different bearing health conditions.

In this paper, an improved method is proposed by using support vector regression-unscented particle filter (SVR-UPF), which increases the accuracy of the RUL prediction results. Firstly, an exponential model is adopted to approximately express the degeneration of battery capacity. Secondly, a novel SVR-UPF method is presented to solve the degeneracy phenomenon of the UPF algorithm, and then it is applied to predict the battery RUL. Finally, some experiments and comparisons have been done to validate the improved SVR-UPF prediction method. The results show that the proposed method is better than the standard particle filter (PF) prediction method and the standard unscented particle filter (UPF) prediction method.

For a complex system, there are a large number of components, and hence the failing models can be even more complicated due to diverse sub-systems and their components. The remaining useful life (RUL) of the system, as a whole, depends on many factors and there are often sudden changes in its progression pattern. The interacting multiple model (IMM) estimator is a filtering technique that tracks multiple models and reports the probability of each model. The information fusion ability of IMM with a built-in probabilistic metric is highly desirable in failure model tracking and higher level fusion. A general framework is proposed to describe the system health by a health index, then the RUL can be evaluated as the current health value divided by the degradation rate of the health index at that moment. Within the general framework of a health index, an IMM estimator is proposed to identify the failure models and evaluate both the values and the confidence interval of the RUL. Simulations on various health degradation models are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the IMM based RUL estimation. Specifically, the RUL sub-models can be with nearly constant degradation rate, with accelerated growing degradation rate, or some drastic break-down due to environmental changes such as a hard failure. In simulations, the truth is known, and hence the performance of the RUL estimator can be precisely assessed. This paper has not only proposed a fusion scheme to handle various failure models, but also presented the data generation procedure of health index in various situations. Such data sets can be used as benchmarks to compare various prognostics techniques.

However the development of predictive models for TTF estimation remains a challenge. To address this issue, we proposed to develop machine learning-based models for TTF estimation by using the techniques from machine learning and data mining. In the past decade, we have been working on the development of machine learning-based models for estimating TTF and applied the developed technology to various real-world applications such as train wheel prognostics, and aircraft engine prognostics. In this paper, we report two kinds of machine learning-based models for estimating TTF, including multistage classification, on-demand regression. The multistage classification improves the TTF estimation over one stage classification by dividing the time window into more small narrow time windows. A case study, APU prognostics, demonstrates the usefulness of the developed methods. The results from the case study show that the machine learning-based modeling method is an effective and feasible way to develop predictive models to estimate TTF for PHM.

It's particularly crucial to monitor the battery state of health and prognosis the battery remaining useful life (RUL). Considering the highly linear correlation between capacity and the changing rate of temperature (TR), a new RUL prediction approach is proposed which provides a better description on the capacity degradation based on the changing rate of battery temperature and cycle number N. First a binary linear regress model is proposed for battery state of health (SOH) and RUL prognosis. Then TR ratio which is extracted for TR prediction is predicted using the chosen historical data considering the similarity of different data sets. Finally, capacity is estimated sequentially based on the proposed model with the predicted TR and cycle number N. The results show that TR can not only indicate state-of-health more accurately, but also provide more precise and better robustness in RUL prediction and SOH monitoring. Furthermore, the regeneration of battery can be accurately predicted by our method.

This paper reports a novel capacity fade analysis method. The parameter degradation of multi-physics model is achieved, and the three main factors of capacity fade is quantitatively calculated by using the obtained parameters. The results show that the loss of active material and the loss of Li inventory is the main reason of capacity fade at high temperature and room temperature, respectively. And the proposed method can further help improving battery (pack) management, reliability and safety.

As an active branch of fault diagnosis, data-driven methods attract more and more attention in recent years, because they solely depend on information collected in historical databases. The support vector machine (SVM), aims at minimizing the structural risk, exhibits superior generalization ability, and succeeds in the nonlinear classification problem. This paper proposes an improved SVM based fault diagnosis framework, which consists of two primary components: (1) feature extraction; (2) classification. More specifically, multi scale principal component analysis (MSPCA) is performed to achieve multi-scale analysis and dimension reduction. Classification combines SVM classifier with parameters optimization method, which further encompasses grid search (GS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). To demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our approach, we perform experiments on the classical Tennessee Eastman (TE) process.

In this paper, the degradation of the electronic system is driven by a nonlinear Wiener process with a time drift, which is incorporated into the proportional hazards model to describe the hazard rate of the time to failure. Using the discretization of the degradation path and the time axis, closed-form approximations for the reliability quantities are obtained using the transition probability matrix. Unlike the conventional method which is applicable only for a small number of degradation states, the calculation of these quantities can be accomplished with just the basic manipulation of the transition matrix, which is computationally efficient and applicable to real-time conditional reliability calculation for a general number of states. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical study.

This paper presents a fault detection and identification diagnosis approach for asymmetrical faults in permanent-magnet synchronous machines, considering both inter-turn and phase-to-phase short-circuit faults, and employing both current- and voltage-based residual along with the cumulative-sum algorithm. The sum of positive-and negative-sequence current-and voltage-phase angles is used to identify the faulty phase(s); the two fault types are distinguished by defining different detection thresholds for the residuals. Simulations of phase-to-phase short-circuit with different short-circuit resistance have been carried to obtain the values of faulty phase indicators. Both the simulation results and the proposed diagnosis have been verified by practical experiments on a 2-kW test bench.

A rotor-position and current estimator based on air-gap power vector computation is used for residual generation. A cumulative-sum function permits detecting and isolating the investigated faults. The algorithm is experimentally tested on a 3 kW generator in steady and transient regimes. Sensor outages as well as current-sensor gain drifts and offsets are investigated. Transients do not significantly affect the algorithm, which also allows for a very short detection time for the most critical faults.

Starting with the rotor voltage equation in rotor reference frame, equations are transformed into usual field reference frame, after taking into account unequal parameters in both axes, as a consequence of the fault. In the process, several simplifications have been introduced and resistance change due to temperature has been accounted for. The model has been verified through simulations, with its stator current compared to the measured one. Spectra of both currents are in very good agreement regardless of the number of broken bars or load torque.

Influence of the stator current sensor faults to the properties of the DFOC drive system is presented. To the current sensor fault detection the simple algorithmic/logical mechanism, based on the measured currents is used. After the fault detection, drive topology is changed. For the calculation of the stator current components (in the stationary reference frame) other algebraic relations based on the signals from the active sensors are used. Drive is tested in simulation and in the laboratory set-up with 1.1kW machine under faulted and post-fault conditions, in wide speed reference changes. All tests were performed on the ds1202 card.

This surface PD causes bright white deposits on the stator coils, and is usually caused by poorly-made or poorly-applied partly-conductive and silicon carbide coatings. The problem is even more likely if the winding is connected to a voltage source-pulse width modulated inverter used in variable speed drives. If uncorrected, this surface PD leads to high ozone levels within the machine which degrades most metallic and organic components within the motor or generator enclosure. Eventually, a stator ground fault or rotor failure may occur. This paper reviews the mechanisms that may lead to surface PD in stator windings and discusses how PD can be detected using visual examination and ultraviolet imaging, as well as using condition monitoring tools such as electronic ozone monitors and on-line partial discharge measurements.

Experimental setup is also employed in order to verify the proposed modelling technique. The absolute value of the detail coefficient of wavelet decomposition at level 6 is used as a fault indicator for the detection of damage in stator winding insulation. Discrete wavelet transform, finite element analysis along with experimental setup in the laboratory are employed to detect the inter-turn short circuit fault shortly after its occurrence.

By monitoring their conditions and predicting their remaining useful lives (RULs), some proactive maintenance may be done to reduce the unscheduled machine downtime and even catastrophes. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at the early stage so as to alert the operator, maintenance personnel and logistics personnel before the defect develops into an unrepairable failure. Since the signature of an incipient defect is relatively weak and masked by strong noise, robust signal de-noising and feature extraction methods are crucial to bearing prognostics. This paper introduces an integrated method to detect the incipient defects of bearings by vibration analysis and feature extraction. First, the vibration signals collected from a bearing accelerated life test are de-noised by a 3-layer wavelet packet decomposition (WPD). Second, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is performed to decompose the de-noised signal into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) so as to extract features of bearing faults, and then some rules are defined to select the IMFs containing the fault information. Third, energy moments of the selected IMFs are extracted as features to detect the incipient defects. Fourth, the advantage of this energy moment is demonstrated by a comparative analysis with the classic time domain statistical features. In the end, the summary of this work and some future aspects are given.

However, few studies have been reported on prognostics of ceramic bearings. Compared with the degradation process of steel bearing, the deterioration of ceramic bear contains more nonlinearity and uncertainty. The prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of ceramic bearings remains a new topic. One of the most challenging problems in the prognostic task is the lack of accurate prediction model. Particularly, when the prognostic model is trained from a data set that undergoes different degradation rate compared with the testing data set due to different load condition and service life for each individual component, the prediction often display large discrepancy. In this paper, a particle filtering based method for hybrid ceramic bearing RUL prediction is presented. An integrated adaptive model based on Recursive Least Square (RLS) is proposed to account the parameter variation of the prognostic model. The method is validated using real hybrid ceramic bearing run to failure test data. The validation results prove the effectiveness and high accuracy of the presented methodology.

For this aim, Proximal Support Vector (PSVM), which is powerful algorithm for classification problems that needs small training time in solving nonlinear problems and applicable to high dimension applications, is employed. The complete dynamics of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind-turbine (WTG) model are imitated in an amalgamated domain of Simulink, FAST and TurbSim under six distinct conditions, i.e., aerodynamic asymmetry, rotor furl imbalance, tail furl imbalance, blade imbalance, nacelle-yaw imbalance and normal operating scenarios. The simulation results in time domain of the PMSG stator current are decomposed into the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using EMD method, which are utilized as input variable in PSVM. The analyzed results proclaim the effectiveness of the proposed approach to identify the healthy condition from imbalance faults in WTG. The presented work renders initial results that are helpful for online condition monitoring and health assessment of WTG. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The dataset is given as a finite set of pairs of finite-time system traces and labels, where the labels indicate whether the traces exhibit some desired behavior (e.g., a ship traveling along a safe route). We propose a decision-tree based approach for learning signal temporal logic classifiers. The method produces binary decision trees that represent the inferred formulae. Each node of the tree contains a test associated with the satisfaction of a simple formula, optimally tuned from a predefined finite set of primitives. Optimality is assessed using heuristic impurity measures, which capture how well the current primitive splits the data with respect to the traces' labels. We propose extensions of the usual impurity measures from machine learning literature to handle classification of system traces by leveraging upon the robustness degree concept. The proposed incremental construction procedure greatly improves the execution time and the accuracy compared to existing algorithms. We present two case studies that illustrate the usefulness and the computational advantages of the algorithms. The first is an anomaly detection problem in a maritime environment. The second is a fault detection problem in an automotive powertrain system.

Several distributed approaches have been proposed to solve the DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem in the IoT environment. The nature of distributed computation provides scalability, robustness and privacy protection, while it also poses more vulnerabilities to unexpected cyber faults and adversaries. One important concern in the distributed DC-OPF algorithm is to maintain the optimal power dispatch result in the face of compromised nodes which are exchanging false information. In this paper, we deal with the data integrity attack and develop an attack detection and mitigation method that could fit into the IoT environment to secure the distributed DC-OPF algorithm. It is a fully distributed mechanism that enables each bus to perform the following major functions based on two-hop neighbors' information: 1) verifying the correctness of the exchanged information without infringing neighbor's privacy; 2) identifying the malicious attacker and recovering the optimal power dispatch from the malicious impact. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is illustrated by the standard IEEE 14-bus system.

The diagnosis process is actually a pattern recognition process, and usually, the fault samples are lack of tags of fault types. In this case, the non-supervised learning method is more available, and kernel clustering is one of the most effective methods. In this paper, a novel electromagnetic particle swarm optimization clustering (EPSOC) was proposed. The weighted kernel clustering model was established by weighting the samples according to the effect of different characters. The clustering center, character weight and the model parameter were united as the optimal variable, and the Xie-Beni index was utilized as the objective function. To find the clustering center and model parameters effectively, the electromagnetism-like operator was introduce into the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the modified mixing algorithm was utilized. The UCI data and fault samples were used to test the performance of the proposed method EPSOC, and comparing with the other common algorithms, the superiority of EPSOC was demonstrated.

For the vibration symptoms extraction, the time-frequency domain analysis has been widely utilized. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is one of the most typical time-frequency method, but its performance is effected by the mode mixing problem. In this paper, a novel coupled EMD is proposed, and utilized to the vibration signal decomposition. In the CEMD, the differential vibration signal was obtained and decomposed by EMD, and then, the results were integrated and couple decomposed by EMD. After decomposition, the energy distribution vectors were extracted as the fault symptoms. At last, the obtained vibration symptoms were taken as input, and the classifier was utilized to identify the different kinds of faults for the large rotating machine. The proposed method was applied into the actual fault identification for the rolling element bearings, and the results demonstrated that, CEMD can improve the mode mixing problem significantly, while the energy distribution symptoms has the advantages of high universality and strong separability, and the vibration faults can be identified more accurately with higher efficiency.

The presence of these harmonics can compromise the reliability of the fault detection. In this paper, we present the winding fault diagnosis of induction machine connected to a harmonically polluted low voltage power system. The detection method is based on the Hilbert transform. This proposed approach allows the suppression of the harmonics from the network while keeping all possible clues to the presence of winding fault in the induction machine. The proposed approach is tested experimentally to an induction machine subjected to a 2.5% of inter-turns short circuit fault.

In many applications, ADT data consists of multiple degradation-related features, and these features are usually dependent. When dealing with such ADT data, it is important to fully utilize the multiple degradation features and take into account their inherent dependency. This paper proposes a novel reliability-assessment method that combines Brownian motion and copulas to model ADT data obtained from vibration signals. In particular, degradation feature extraction is first carried out using the raw vibration signals, and a feature selection method quantifying feature properties, such as trendability, monotonicity, and robustness, is adopted to determine the most suitable degradation features. Then, amultivariate s-dependent ADT model is developed, where a Brownian motion is used to depict the degradation path of each degradation feature and a copula function is employed to describe the dependence among these degradation features. Finally, the proposed ADT model is demonstrated using the vibration-based ADT data for an electric motor.

Towards Efficient and Effective Automatic Program Repair	2016 31ST IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (ASE)	IEEE ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE)	SEP 03-07, 2016	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE, ACM, ACM Special Interest Grp Software Engn, ACM SIGAI, Singapore Management Univ, LEE Fdn, Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Living Analyt Res Ctr, Software Analyt Res Ctr, Tata Consultancy Serv, Microsoft Res, NEC, FUJITSU		Automatic Program Repair; Deductive Reasoning; Mining Software Repository; Genetic Programming		Automatic Program Repair (APR) has recently been an emerging research area, addressing an important challenge in software engineering. APR techniques, if effective and efficient, can greatly help software debugging and maintenance. Recently proposed APR techniques can be generally classified into two families, namely search-based and semantics-based APR methods. To produce repairs, search-based APR techniques generate huge populations of possible repairs, i.e., search space, and lazily search for the best one among the search space. Semantics-based APR techniques utilize constraint solving and program synthesis to make search space more tractable, and find those repairs that conform to semantics constraints extracted via symbolic execution. Despite recent advances in APR, search-based APR still suffers from search space explosion problem, while the semantics-based APR could be hindered by limited capability of constraint solving and program synthesis. Furthermore, both APR families may be subject to overfitting, in which generated repairs do not generalize to other test sets. This thesis works towards enhancing both effectiveness and efficiency in order for APR to be practically adopted in foreseeable future. To achieve this goal, other than using test cases as the primary criteria for traversing the search space, we designed a new feature used for a new search-based APR technique to effectively traverse the search space, wherein bug fix history is used to evaluate the quality of repair candidates. We also developed a deductive-reasoning-based repair technique that combines search-based and semantics-based approaches to enhance the repair capability, while ensuring the soundness of generated repairs. We also leveraged machine-learning techniques to build a predictive model that predicts whether an APR technique is effective in fixing particular bugs. In the future, we plan to synergize many existing APR techniques, improve our predictive model, and adopt the advances of other fields such as test case generation and program synthesis for APR.

Hence, fault diagnosis of rotating components, like rolling bearings, can be done by analyzing the external relevant information obtained by measurements, in order to evaluate their internal states. The most widely used method for detection and fault diagnosis of rolling bearings is based on vibration measurements. In signal processing, there are many applications of neural networks (NN) combined with spectral analysis, using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The function approximation using neural networks is a complex task for problems with high dimension of the input space, like those based on signal spectral analysis. In this paper, some neural estimation aspects of spectral components of vibration signals for rolling bearings fault diagnosis are discussed. Inner race defect of bearings is considered in simulations. The goal is to find a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model for estimating spectral components, with computational complexity comparable with FFT algorithm, but easier to implement in hardware. Different FFNN architectures, with different data sets and training conditions, are analyzed.

Reliability and availability of induction motors is one of the required parameters in order to reduce down-time of the entire rotating machinery system. Vibration analysis and motor current signature analysis (MCSA) are widely used diagnostic techniques for the detection of various mechanical and electrical faults in induction motors. Major limitation of the MCSA is its inability in detection of faults in induction motors at no load condition. This paper addresses this limitation and proposes a suitable technique for more effective fault detection of an induction motor using vibration spectrum at no load condition. The results have been experimentally tested and validated in an electrical fault simulator set-up for broken rotor bar and bearing faults.	[Kumar, T. Ch. Anil; Singh, Gurmeet; Naikan, V. N.

Using FFT to analyze the time-frequency of local signal can extract fault features, which are utilized for SVM training. Once satisfied effects are achieved, SVM structure and internal parameters should be freezed. To compare the output and fault codes with given input can realize the goal of winding unbalanced fault diagnosis.

Its faults have a deep influence on the safety and effectiveness of the machine and huge cost is required for maintenance. Investigations have revealed that stator inter-turn short circuit fault may lead to more serious problems. More researches are to focus attention on fault detection and preventive maintenance strategies for industrial plant. In this paper, an experimental platform is developed, which can conduct different stator winding inter-turn faults, and some fault feature parameters are extracted and analyzed. Stator line currents are used for calculating RMS, phase difference, negative-sequence, and the Park's vector trajectory's eccentricity as feature parameters. Stator line currents are balanced under normal condition, so the negative sequence of stator currents is almost zero, and their phase differences are about 120'. The park's vector trajectory is a circle under healthy condition, and its eccentricity is near to zero. When stator short circuit fault occurs, the negative sequence and the Park's vector trajectory's eccentricity are increasing as fault degree enlarges, and also the phase differences related to fault phase increase while the other reduces. Finally, the experimental setup simulated the expected stator inter-turn short circuit fault successfully, and the extracted feature parameters will contribute to fault diagnosis of DFIG.

The framework encompasses three main contributions: 1) the definition of multi-layered templates to identify what to supervise while taking into account the physical, logical, virtual and service layers. These templates are also finer-granular, extendable and machine-readable; 2) a self-modeling module that takes as input these templates, instantiates them and generates on-the-fly the diagnosis model that includes the physical, logical, and the virtual dependencies of networking services; 3) a service-aware root-cause analysis module that takes into account the networking services' views and their underlying network resources observations within the aforementioned layers. We also present extensive simulations to prove the fully automated, finer granularity and reduced uncertainty of the root cause of networking services failures and their underlying network resources.

This is shown to be accomplished by the analysis on operating and faulty conditions as well as operating parameters of the construction machine. Consequently, the device can test, store and process the operating condition parameters, for example cooling water temperature, oil temperature, oil pressure, engine rotation speed, oil temperature of torque converter as well as oil level of sump and etc. Furthermore, the real time fault alarm and historical data analysis results can also be realized and illustrated by vivid graphical interface. The embedded ARM microcontroller, which is the core module of the system, manipulates the data acquisition of operating parameters for the construction machine. Application software of ARM chip processes the operating parameters and carries out alarm and control operations under faulty mode of the machine. The failure data can not only be displayed and alarmed synchronously, but also can be stored for further fault analysis. This device can store many different types of operating parameters and has a large storage capacity, so it is applicable to many different types of other construction machines.

The proposed method applies a single-phase AC voltage as a test signal on motor terminals, resulting in a stator backward-rotating magnetic field. The field ultimately causes additional current components in the stator windings whose magnitudes depend on the broken bar fault severity, even if the motor is unloaded. This allows robust broken bar fault detection based only on standard motor current signature analysis (MCSA) technique. The proposed fault detection method is at first verified via simulations, using an IM model based on finite element analysis (FEA) and multiple coupled circuit approach (MCCA). The subsequent experimental investigations have shown good agreement with both theoretical predictions and simulation results.

A systematic approach that incorporates dynamic fault tree (DFT) and discrete-time Bayesian network (DTBN) is developed in this research, in order to facilitate the analysis for shield cutter head failures in tunnel construction. A causal network model is built to simulate the behaviors of shield cutter head failures over time during the tunnel boring machine (TBM) operation. One of the tunneling projects recently completed in the Wuhan metro system in China is selected as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach. Results indicate that the developed approach is capable of predictive analysis for the estimation of the TBM performance, and diagnostic analysis in case a low performance or a failure is observed. This approach provides a powerful potential solution to modeling and analyzing various kinds of system components behaviors and interactions in a complex project environment.

In this study, a three-layer feed-forward back propagation ANN is used and trained by input-output pairs of data collected from real manufacturing process. We have tested the proposed ANN for five cases, and each case has different size of training data set. The test results show that the average of the absolute prediction errors in all five cases are very small, and as the size of the training data set increases, the prediction accuracy increases and the associated standard deviation decreases.

Moreover, presented equation takes into account corrected teeth (i.e. where the equality 2P+S=R is not fulfilled). This happens when gearboxes contain gears where corrected teeth procedure was adopted during designing stage. Presented solution can re fine the con figuration modules of the Condition Monitoring Systems (CMS) in such a way that allows to con figure systems into larger groups than now available, i.e. multistage gear sets systems with epicyclic gears. Such CMS are capable of early mechanical faults detection, which prevents from costly critical repairs. For instance, fault detection of wind turbines is typically based on vibration and process signals analysis. Illustrated possible enhancement of con figuration module is the basis for determining the energy bands in the spectra and envelope spectra in the process of identifying characteristic frequencies caused by gear defects.

Design/methodology/approach - The upper and lower extreme envelopes from a modulated and oscillatory time sequence present a particular characteristic being of, theoretically, symmetrical versions with regard to amplitude reflection around the time axis. Thus, one may say that they carry the same characteristics in terms of waveforms and, consequently, frequency content. These envelopes can easily be built by an interpolation process of the local extremes, maximums and minimums, from the original time sequence. Similar to modulator signals, they contain more detailed and useful information about the required electrical fault frequencies. Findings - Results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and its relevance to detecting and diagnosing faults in induction motors with the advantage of being a technique that is easy to implement in any computational code. Practical implications - A laboratory investigation carried out through an experimental setup for the study of faults, mainly related to the stator winding inter-turn short circuit and voltage phase unbalance, is presented. Originality/value - The main contribution of the work is the presentation of an alternative tool to demodulate signals which may be used in real applications like the detection of faults in three-phase induction machines.

The goal is to show the introduction of condition monitoring in aircraft systems. Design/methodology/approach - The research was done using the Airbus In-Service database to analyze the delay causes, delay length and to check if they are easy to detect via condition monitoring or not. These results were then combined with delay costs. Findings - Analysis shows that about 80 percent of the maintenance actions that cause departure delays can be prevented when additional sensors are introduced. With already existing sensors it is possible to avoid about 20 percent of the delay causing maintenance actions. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited on the data of the Airbus in-service database and on ATA chapter 21 (air conditioning). Practical implications - The research shows that delays can be prevented by using existing sensors in the air conditioning system for condition monitoring. More delays can be prevented by installing new sensors. Originality/value - The research focuses on the effect of the air conditioning system of an aircraft on the delay effects and the impact of condition monitoring on delays.

Towards Adaptive Scheduling of Maintenance for Cyber-Physical Systems	LEVERAGING APPLICATIONS OF FORMAL METHODS, VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION: FOUNDATIONAL TECHNIQUES, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Symposium on Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation (ISoLA)	OCT 10-14, 2016	Corfu, GREECE			Model-based scheduling; Predictive maintenance; Machine learning; Cyber-physical systems	TIMED AUTOMATA; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; TOOLS	Scheduling and control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming increasingly complex, requiring the development of new techniques that can effectively lead to their advancement. This is also the case for failure detection and scheduling component replacements. The large number of factors that influence how failures occur during operation of a CPS may result in maintenance policies that are time-monitoring based, which can lead to suboptimal scheduling of maintenance. This paper investigates how to improve maintenance scheduling of such complex embedded systems, by means of monitoring in real-time the critical components and dynamically adjusting the optimal time between maintenance actions. The proposed technique relies on machine learning classification models in order to classify component failure cases vs. non-failure cases, and on real-time updating of the maintenance policy of the sub-system in question. The results obtained from the domain of printers show that a model that is responsive to the environmental changes can enable consumable savings, while keeping the same product quality, and thus be relevant for industrial purposes.

J	Van, M; Franciosa, P; Ceglarek, D				Van, Mien; Franciosa, Pasquale; Ceglarek, Dariusz			Rolling Element Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Integrated Nonlocal Means Denoising with Modified Morphology Filter Operators	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ALGORITHM; VIBRATION; CLASSIFICATION; DECOMPOSITION; EXTRACTION	The impulses in vibration signals are used to identify faults in the bearings of rotating machinery. However, vibration signals are usually contaminated by noise that makes the process of extracting impulse characteristic of localized defect very challenging. In order to effectively diagnose bearing with noise masking vibration signal, a new methodology is proposed using integrated (i) nonlocal means- (NLM-) based denoising and (ii) improved morphological filter operators. NLM based denoising is first employed to eliminate or reduce the background noise with minimal signal distortion. This denoised signal is then analysed by a proposed modified morphological analysis (MMA). The MMA analysis introduces a new morphological operator which is based on Modified-Different (DIF) filter to include only fault relevant impulsive characteristics of the vibration signal. To improve further performance of the methodology the length of the structure element (SE) used in MMA is optimized using a particle swarm optimization- (PSO-) based kurtosis criterion. The results of simulated and real vibration signal show that the integrated NLM with MMA method as well as the MMA method alone yields superior performance in extracting impulsive characteristics of vibrations signals, especially for signal with high level of noise or presence of other sources masking the fault.

Big data sets and huge volumes of inputs give rise to equally massive computational requirements. In this paper the differences in input parameter selection using a subset of the original variables and using data reduction techniques are compared. Each selection procedure being illustrated by both statistical methods and machine learning techniques. It is shown that the subsequent classification models are highly comparable. Finally the merits of a combined multivariate statistical and wavelet decomposition approach is considered. Techniques are applied to output signals from an experimental compressor rig.

After db3 wavelet packet decomposition, the extracted circuit breaker vibration signal has a two-stage classification in SVM and the circuit breaker status will be quickly identified. The experimental results show that rapid recognition system of circuit breaker status based on wavelet packet decomposition and SVM can improve the speed of the circuit breaker fault diagnosis effectively without reducing the diagnosis accuracy.

This paper designs a rolling bearing fault diagnosis system based on Labview. First of all, by using the transducer, such as torque transducer, temperature transducer, eddy current sensor and photoelectric sensor, to carry on the real-time controlling and display the signal in the special domain and in the time domain, in the meantime, the system can store data. Then the next part is capably of processing data by using the methods of filter analysis, envelopment analysis, cepstrum analysis, orbit analysis and holo-spectrum analysis. Finally the system is able to create database and provide an easy method for storing and manipulating the data which is measured by transducer and processed by the system.

The PMSM is modeled using magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC). This method takes into account the impacts of stator teeth, rotor yoke and stator winding distribution precisely. First healthy and faulty PMSM is simulated for different fault severities. In the 2nd step, inter-turn short circuit fault is detected and its severity is determined using the amplitude of the side band components of the stator current. Finally, the frequency components of the extended Park vector magnitude are employed as the 2nd index for fault detection. This index is independent of the load and only depends on the fault severity.	[Faiz, Jawad; Exiri, A.

As far as landing is one of the most critical phase of a flight, before taking off, pilots have to take care of the aircraft's center of gravity, by estimating masses and their repartition. Aircraft owners also would like to be informed of landing gears wear, so predictive maintenance would be an added value for safety. This paper presents the design of an embedded system prototype which continously provides monitoring about the status of the shock absorbers (pressure and accelerations inside them). Our theoritical model shows that, on the first hand, pressure inside shock absorbers is directly linked to the mass estimation; on the other hand, acceleration at landing phase is linked to the effort. The authors propose a mechatronic sytem to measure masses sustained by each landing gear, using low-power electronic boards, MEMS sensors, and a Java Human Machine Interface (HMI) for smartphones.

Prognosis of Degradation through a Dynamic Estimation of Remaining Useful Life	2016 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS AND CONTROL (ICSC)	International Conference on Systems and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Systems and Control (ICSC)	MAY 25-27, 2016	Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech, MOROCCO	Univ Caddi Ayyad, Soc Sci Dev & New Technologies, IEEE Control Syst Soc	Fac Sci Semlalia		FAULT-DETECTION; MODEL; PREDICTION; OBSERVER; CELL	All industrial systems and machines are subjected to degradation processes which can be related to the operating conditions. This degradation can cause unwanted stops at any time and major maintenance work sometimes. Prognostic activity is now recognized as a key feature in maintenance strategies, it gives operators a potent tool in decision making by quantifying how much time is left until functionality is lost. The reason is to plan the heavy interventions and to manage the stock of spare parts. In addition, it can be used to improve the characterization of the material proprieties that govern damage propagation for the structure being monitored. The tool for measuring the size of damage and health status in industry is the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), which can be estimated by using four main approaches, namely experience based, model-based, data-driven and hybrid approaches. A new method of prognosis is developed in this paper to improve the accuracy of the system state. This framework of forecasting integrates the model-based information and the hybrid approach, which employs the structured residuals in the first one and the Particle Filter in the second. The performance of the suggested fusion prognostic framework is employed to predict the RUL of battery pack in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV).

For the dependability and performance, a combination of measures for fault avoidance, robust architecture, and runtime anomaly handling is necessary. These in turn call for a formalization of knowledge across different system lifecycle stages and a provision of novel methods and tools for qualified system synthesis and effective risk management. This paper presents a model-based approach to qualified process automation for the operation and maintenance of production systems. The contribution is centered on the formalizations of a wide range of system concerns, and thereby a consolidation of the rationale behind the design of run-time process logic in BPMN2.0. In particular, the approach allows an integration of formal system descriptions, FTA and FEMA based anomaly analysis, and executable process models for effective anomaly detection and treatment. The approach adopts mature modeling methods and tools through EAST-ADL. In this paper, a prototype tool-chain with MetaEdit+ Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) Workbench, HiP-HOPS Tool and Camunda BPM Platform is also presented.

This knowledge-intensive, expensive tasks urgently needs to be automated due to the limited time and budget available in this domain. A novel approach for computer-aided, automatic setup of FDD for BAS is described in this paper. Using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), the characteristics, requirements and necessary configuration of the FDD algorithms are formally specified in a machine-interpretable way. Also buildings and their BAS are described by OWL as building information model (BIM). Given these descriptions, the approach can match the specific characteristics and requirements of the FDD algorithms with the specific circumstances in the BAS in a formal evaluation process. All applicable FDD algorithms can be determined and subsequently configured to the individual characteristics of the BAS.

PdM is a important approach to tackle maintenance and it is gaining an increasing attention in advanced manufacturing to minimize scrap materials, downtime, and associated costs. PdM approaches are generally based on Machine Learning tools that require the availability of historical process and maintenance data. Given the exponential growth in data logging in modern equipment, time series dataset are increasingly available in PdM applications. To exploit time series data for PdM, a functional learning methodology, namely Supervised Aggregative Feature Extraction (SAFE), is here employed on a semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.

Only recently, physics-based model simulations have been considered as a valid help to understand the evolution of the chemical-physical processes leading to failure. Nevertheless, physics-based models have always been paired with data driven models and that has led to the development of heavy hybrid approaches. It is opinion of the authors that in a wide range of situations, with the current knowledge of physics, it is possible to model processes and their evolution based only on the physics model simulations, using what's called "propagation of uncertainty technique" on every aspect, from components to system behavior. The authors developed such a technique valid for both Time-Independent and Time-Dependent phenomena. This approach allows probabilistic simulations to be carried out. The proposed methodology simultaneously uses the rated values of the involved parameter in the considered process and their uncertainties as inputs. As outputs it provides the expected values of the process with their standard deviations (std) and their probability distributions. The authors developed also the software tool RELYSOFT which allows to directly supply rated values and their uncertainties as inputs. The simulations can be performed by means of analytical equations in definite form, differential equations or by Finite Element approach. The Finite Element simulation will be the subject of a later work. In case of simulations by means of analytical equations in definite and differential form, a new pseudo algebra has been developed in order to perform assessments. Two examples are reported concerning aero-spatial field: a Time-Independent and a Time-Dependent.

A necessary step in order to perform prognostic analysis is the study of system's components degradations. The degradation of a component is a case by case study, which characteristics that change significantly even inside the same component macro area (software, composites, mechanical parts etc..). The degradation models project over time the key factors of each component, eventually ending with the component failure (exceptions can be made for software). For those models the initial degradation state is an heavily influencing factor. Assuming that a component starts it's degradation process from a pristine state, relative to the value for which it is tested and conformed, introduces an error in the Remaining Useful Life assessment. Components used in systems have varying degrees of degradation at the to of the system, which may be greater or lesser than the assumed value. This happens cause conformity tests do have tolerances in the accepted values. Using the effective measurements derived from the conformity tests can improve the accuracy of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) evaluation.

Different maintenance, prognostics and diagnostics approaches are possible with the final aim to optimize both system's availability and safety. Aircraft engines represent a safety critical part of the airplane. For this reason it is a key issue to allocate the proper amount of maintenance at each individual maintenance event.

The method not only effectively reduces the amount of data but also keeps a few important characteristic parameters, thus, becoming a fault diagnosis for back-propagation network algorithms of primary input sources. The experimental results confirm that the back-propagation network algorithm has excellent fault identification capabilities and computing performance and verify shaft orbit technology for mechanical fault identification. In the future one could adopt motor current signature analysis techniques with this algorithm, thereby reinforcing it due to abnormal electrical parameters caused by electrical fault identification capabilities.

J	Islam, MR; Uddin, J; Kim, JM				Islam, Md. Rashedul; Uddin, Jia; Kim, Jong-Myon			Acoustic Emission Sensor Network Based Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors Using a Gabor Filter and Multiclass Support Vector Machines	AD HOC & SENSOR WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; wireless sensor network; gabor filter; discrete wavelet transform; acoustic emission; induction motor	FEATURE-EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM	Reliable and efficient fault diagnosis of induction motors is an important issue in industrial environments. This paper proposes a method for reliable fault diagnosis of induction motors using signal processing of acoustic emission (AE) data, including Gabor filtering and the use of multiclass support vector machines (MCSVMs), where a ZigBee based wireless sensor network (WSN) model is used for efficiently transmitting AE signals to a diagnosis server. In the proposed fault diagnosis approach, the induction motor's different state signals are acquired through proper placement of AE sensors. The AE data are sent to a server through the wireless sensor network and decomposed using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). An appropriate band is then selected using the maximum energy ratio, and a one-dimensional (1D) Gabor filter with various frequencies and orientation angles is applied to reduce abnormalities and extract various statistical parameters for generating features. In addition, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the extracted features to select the most dominant feature dimensions. Finally, one-against-one multiclass support vector machines (OAA-MCSVMs) are used to classify multiple fault types of an induction motor, where each SVM individually trains with its own features to increase the fault classification accuracy of the induction motor. In experiments, the proposed approach achieved an average classification accuracy of 99.80%, outperforming conventional fault diagnosis models.

Test conditions include safe, roller fault, seal fault and axis friction on the experimental setup of retainer and clutch mechanism of Massey Ferguson. The time-domain vibration signals with normal and defective modes processed for feature extraction. Three features of the time domain (T-11), frequency domain (A(8)) and phase angle (A(9)) data as premium features were selected. Data are classified into eight experimental models and also loaded in the ANFS network. In all models, appropriate membership functions were selected. For ANFIS training 1000 epoch was considered. The statistical indicators and the result of ANFIS prediction of evaluation models were presented. Total classification accuracy was 100% in both models. The results showed that ANFIS can be used as a powerful tool for intelligent fault classification of tractor mechanisms.

Manually modifying programs does not scale, and extending compilers to emit additional machine instructions lacks flexibility. However, since software-implemented hardware fault tolerance (SIHFT) can be understood as a cross-cutting concern, we propose aspect-oriented programming as a suitable implementation technique. We prove this proposition by implementing an AN encoder based on AspectC++. In terms of performance and fault coverage, we achieve comparable results to existing compiler-based solutions.

Rumen tissue derived decellularized submucosa collagen or its chitosan-treated film as a cutaneous wound healant and H-1 NMR-metabolite profiling of plasma	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							IN-VITRO EVALUATION; GROWTH-FACTOR; SKIN; SCAFFOLD; MATRIX; VIVO; EQUIVALENT; DRESSINGS; MIGRATION; MEMBRANES	Developing an ideal wound dressing material for skin defects is of significant importance in a clinical emergency and is currently a global burden. Decellularized extracellular matrix derivatives from various xenogeneic origins have been successfully used as dermal substitutes, since they contain perpetuated bioactive molecules that serve as a regenerative template for faster dermal reconstruction. The major objective of this study is to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility of an un-tapped type I collagen film (COL-F) derived from bovine rumen submucosa, in comparison to the same COL-F treated with 1% (w/v) chitosan solution to produce another film, COL/CS-F. The comparative study includes the evaluation of physical and biological properties of the films in treating open excision wounds in rats. Both COL-F and COL/CS-F were observed to possess excellent fluid uptake ability, good water retention and controlled degradation kinetics. The topical application of the films resulted in exquisite wound healing on day 16, with wound contraction rates of 92.83% +/- 0.95% and 94.83% +/- 0.46% for COL-F and COL/CS-F, respectively. The estimation of biochemical parameters (collagen, hexosamine and uronic acid) was correlated with histological observations, which elucidate the evidence for effective collagen synthesis and tissue vascularisation as a result of better wound prognosis. The metabolomics of the wound healing phase was acquired by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which demonstrated time-dependent up and down regulation of metabolites in response to injury. Overall, the presence of chitosan in the COL-F accelerated wound healing by exerting relevant biomimetic and chemotactic effects at the wound surface. The ability of COL-F and COL/CS-F to treat open wounds with favourable tissue re-epithelization and remodelling at a shorter duration demonstrates its potential feasibility in the field of skin tissue engineering.

Taking advantage of advances in sensor technologies, PHM systems enable a predictive maintenance strategy through continuously monitoring the health of complex systems. The core of PHM technology is prognostic which is able to estimate time to failure (TTF) for the monitored components or systems using the built-in predictive models. In this paper, the state of the art of TTF estimation will be first reviewed. After introduction of traditional methods of TTF estimation, we will present the developed approaches for estimating TTF, including classification, regression, on-demand regression, Particle Filtering (PF)-based method, and so on. The main purpose of this paper is to summarize the work on TTF estimation technologies developed in the past decade.

In this method, the RICA is first used to automatically extract features from raw vibration signals. Then, the learned features are used as the input data of MRVM for the classification of different health conditions of machines. The proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of locomotive rolling bearings. According to the diagnosis results, it is verified that the proposed method is able to reliably classify different health conditions. By comparing with diagnosis method based on time-domain statistical analysis and wavelet transformation, the proposed method shows its superiority in automatic features extraction from raw signals.

For this reason, we study ship diesel engine fault diagnosis from two aspects. First of all, we divided ship diesel engine system into four parts according its basic structure and fault features, the fuel system, the lubrication system, the intake and exhaust system and the cooling system, and then analyzed the fault features for the each subsystem respectively. We used the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to classify fault data for each subsystem of ship diesel engine. So that, we could implement the fault diagnosis for the each subsystem. It reduced the complexity of the whole system fault diagnosis. Secondly, Ship diesel engine fault often occurs between different the subsystems, and the occurrence of a fault is often accompanied by other fault. We could solve this high coupling by using association rule mining and then found out the implicit association rules of the fault in whole system.

This method can provide basic data support for rail vehicles' operation security and provide guidance for the optimization of maintenance strategy. Firstly, rolling bearings of rail vehicles was briefly introduced. And then, three specific steps of the proposed life prediction method were described in detail, which including sample data collection, parameter estimation and life prediction. Finally, the experiment was carried out which used vibration data and failure event data of the rolling bearings' full life cycle, and the results show that the correlation coefficient between PHM outputs and the targets was greater than 0.9. The experiment results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed residual life prediction approach based on PHM.

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is considered with aperiodic inspection at the beginning of every batch. And a prognosis threshold is taken to decide the maintenance action. A predictive planning model is proposed to make the production and maintenance plan considering the uncertain degradation of the equipment. The objective is to minimize the expected total cost during a finite planning horizon, including production, maintenance and depreciation costs. A two-stage relaxation heuristic algorithm is designed and the results show that the method has a good quality.

Existing methods rely on expensive, purpose-built condition monitoring systems to conduct diagnosis and prognosis of wind turbine generator failures. In this paper, we present a prognosis method to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of generators, which requires no additional hardware support beyond widely adopted SCADA system. This work first introduces a notion, Anomaly Operation Index (AOI), to quantitatively measure wind turbine performance degradation in runtime. It then presents a data-driven wind turbine anomaly detection method and a time series analysis method to predict the wind turbine generator RUL. Experimental study on real-world wind farm data demonstrates that the proposed methods can achieve accurate prediction of wind turbine generator RUL and provide sufficient lead time for scheduling maintenance and repair.

C	Tsypkin, M			IEEE	Tsypkin, Mikhail			THE ORIGIN OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC VIBRATION OF INDUCTION MOTORS OPERATING IN MODERN INDUSTRY: PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE - ANALYSIS AND DIAGNOSTICS	2016 PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE (PCIC)	Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference (PCIC)	SEP 19-22, 2016	Philadelphia, PA	IEEE		Induction motors; Voltage distortions; Voltage/current imbalance; Adjustable speed drives; Vibration analysis; Torque pulsation; Speed pulsation; Radial electromagnetic forces; Resonance condition; Torsional vibration	AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; NOISE	Different kinds of anomalies in industrial power lines create a number of problems for normal operation of induction motors. One of them is an excessive amount of motor vibration. The industry today widely uses different kinds of nonlinear systems operating in the power lines, for example, adjustable speed drives (ASD), which cause voltage distortion in the power lines. Single phase load in three phase power systems may cause voltage imbalance. Induction motors operating under voltage distortion or voltage imbalance usually have experienced significant vibration of an electromagnetic nature. Vibration of an electromagnetic nature may also be a result of an internal fault in the motor. Motor vibration data contains substantial analytical information about stator and rotor winding and core condition, air gap eccentricity, current/voltage imbalance, and voltage distortions in the power line, etc. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of induction motors based on the vibration analysis technique are widely used in modern industry. Accuracy of the machinery diagnosis made using vibration analysis depends on the ability to correctly analyze vibration data. The aim of this paper is to clarify the origin of the motor vibration of electromagnetic nature at line frequency, twice line frequency, harmonics of line frequency and at twice slip frequency. This opinion is based on the author's many years of experience in the field of vibration diagnostics on electrical machines from different industries.

We propose a novel fault tolerance as a service scheme, where cloud applications utilize suitable fault tolerance service as specific added services, such as the live migration of virtual machines, software rejuvenation, and real-time failure detection, to be worked cooperatively with cloud applications themselves. Our proactive fault tolerance as a service scheme tends to achieve promising improvements on the high availability for cloud applications.

The fourth Industrial standard is based on advanced Automation and Robotics, sensor based computer technology, interconnected by wireless communication, and supported by BIG Data solutions. Effective management and human cooperation i.e. teamwork and SUM (c) processes will be increasingly important in the future. This paper also focuses on the new industrial standard in relation to OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), Predictive Maintenance and total performance related to all equipment in the industrial factory processes. Not a few highly automated machines, but the system as whole. OEE is a well-known standardized tool for performance measurement throughout the industry. In order to utilize data systems as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and PLM (engineering systems), they must be integrated with business systems. Management normally acts on the bases of facts and financial performance. In most companies increased profit is the overall goal. Future management systems aim for a fully integrated and automated data flow based on advanced sensor technology. Increased use of digital systems enables quicker and better decisions.

J	Qin, WL; Zhang, WJ; Wang, ZY				Qin, Wei-Li; Zhang, Wen-Jin; Wang, Zhen-Ya			Improvement of Roller Bearing Diagnosis with Unlabeled Data Using Cut Edge Weight Confidence Based Tritraining	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Roller bearings are one of the most commonly used components in rotational machines. The fault diagnosis of roller bearings thus plays an important role in ensuring the safe functioning of the mechanical systems. However, in most cases of bearing fault diagnosis, there are limited number of labeled data to achieve a proper fault diagnosis. Therefore, exploiting unlabeled data plus few labeled data, this paper proposed a roller bearing fault diagnosis method based on tritraining to improve roller bearing diagnosis performance. To overcome the noise brought by wrong labeling into the classifiers training process, the cut edge weight confidence is introduced into the diagnosis framework. Besides a small trick called suspect principle is adopted to avoid overfitting problem. The proposed method is validated in two independent roller bearing fault experiment vibrational signals that both include three types of faults: inner-ring fault, outer-ring fault, and rolling element fault. The results demonstrate the desirable diagnostic performance improvement by the proposed method in the extreme situation where there is only limited number of labeled data.

Second-order tensor representation of multisensor fused conditional features is employed to replace the prevailing vector description of features from a single sensor. Then, an SSTLPP algorithm under AMDM (SSTLPP-AMDM) is presented to realize dimensional reduction of original highdimensional feature tensor. Compared with classical second-order tensor locality preserving projection (STLPP), the SSTLPPAMDM algorithm not only considers both local neighbor information and class label information but also replaces the existing Frobenius distancemeasure withAMDMfor construction of the similarityweightingmatrix. Finally, the obtained low-dimensional feature tensor is input into WKNNC with AMDM to implement the fault diagnosis of the rotation machinery. A fault diagnosis experiment is performed for a gearbox which demonstrates that the second-order tensor formed multisensor fused fault data has good results for multisensor fusion fault diagnosis and the formulated fault diagnosis method can effectively improve diagnostic accuracy.

In this paper, a method, which takes into account both the system redundancy and the adaptation of operational modes in degraded functioning, is proposed and formalized. This method makes the system-level prognostics more relevant. The main feature of the method is to re-compute the components Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using the degradation rate associated to the future operating mode(s) due to system reconfiguration. This results in an improvement of both the System RUL (SRUL) and the components RUL. The proposed method is applied on a simplified aircraft bleed valve system to illustrate its effectiveness. This method is primarily destined to aeronautic systems, which are usually resilient. It has not been tested whether or not it could be useful in other fields.

Influence of the start-up system in the diagnosis of faults in the rotor of induction motors using the Discrete Wavelet Transform	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AMBIENT SYSTEMS, NETWORKS AND TECHNOLOGIES (ANT 2016) / THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SEIT-2016) / AFFILIATED WORKSHOPS	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT) / 6th International Conference on Sustainable Energy Information Technology (SEIT)	MAY 23-26, 2016	Madrid, SPAIN			Induction motors; fault diagnosis; transient analysis; wavelet transforms; start-up current	MACHINES; SIGNATURE	In previous articles, both the procedure and the advantages of the use of advanced mathematical tools, (as for example the Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT) and the continuous wavelet transforms (CWT)), for the time-frequency analysis of current signals captured in the stator during transients of starting and stopping have been deeply justified. The purpose of this analysis is the detection of rotor asymmetries as well as of possible eccentricities in induction motors. This article aims to analyze, from a qualitative point of view, the influence of the starting system on the results of the diagnosis method based on the analysis of the start-up current by using the DWT. Likewise, emphasis made on the impact and influence in the Wavelet Analysis (either through DWT or CWT) of harmonics introduced by the network, the motor itself and the possible fluctuations in the load torque. The results demonstrate the validity of the method, which presents a great robustness, regardless of the starting method or operating conditions. The theoretical conclusions were supported by actual measurements obtained in laboratory motors. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A new mathematical approach is introduced to analyze the fault signature behaviors in PM motors with different design specs such as combinations including winding types, number and location of stator coils / magnet defects etc. Thanks to the flexible features of the proposed method, it is possible to analyze various winding configurations (including full, short and fractional pitch, single and double layer, delta and star connection) and combination of multiple magnet defect effects on the motor variables' frequency spectrum. It is shown that depending on the motor topology, the corresponding spectrum can be different from others and the generalized fault models may not be valid. In addition, current or back-emf spectrums do not include any fault related harmonics in some cases or the fault components showing up in the stator back-emf do not show up in the stator current. Comparative 2-D Finite Element (FE) simulation and experimental results justify the theoretical magnet defect fault analysis and show the efficacy of proposed approach.

As known, flux spectrums of electric machines contain most critical and direct fault related information to monitor and characterize various faults and their progressions. In this paper, a remote/on case fault monitoring prototype is prepared which includes fluxgate sensor, signal sensing/conditioning circuit, and a microcontroller for leakage flux data streaming. In order to identify magnet defect faults in PMSMs, faults patterns in the leakage flux spectrum are exhaustively analyzed at different torque-speed profiles. Simulation and experimental results show that deployment of fluxgate sensor in magnet defect fault detection yields better results than the classical stator current analysis in PMSMs both in time and frequency domains.

We describe here a recurrent neural network (RNN) for classification of EEG data collected from RBD patients and healthy controls (HC) forming a balanced cohort of 118 subjects in which 50% of the RBD patients eventually developed either PD or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). In earlier work [ 1,2], we implemented support vector machine classifiers (SVMs) using EEG mean spectral features to predict the course of disease in the dual HC vs. PD problem with an accuracy of 85 %. Although largely successful, this approach did not attempt to exploit the non-linear dynamic characteristics of EEG signals, which are believed to contain useful information. Here we describe an Echo State Network (ESN) classifier capable of processing the dynamic features of EEG power at different spectral bands. The inputs to the classifier are the time series of 1 second-averaged EEG power at several selected frequencies and channels. The performance of the ESN reaches 85% test-set accuracy in the HC vs. PD problem using the same subset of channels and bands we selected in our prior work on this problem using SVMs.	[Ruffini, Giulio; Ibanez, David; Castellano, Marta; Dunne, Stephen; Soria-Frisch, Aureli] Starlab Barcelona, Neuroelect, Avda Tibidabo 47 Bis, Barcelona 08035, Spain		Ruffini, G (corresponding author), Starlab Barcelona, Neuroelect, Avda Tibidabo 47 Bis, Barcelona 08035, Spain.	giulio.ruffini@starlab-int.com; david.ibanez@starlab-int.com; stephen.dunne@starlab-int.com; aureli.soria-Frisch@starlab-int.com					Albert R, 2002, REV MOD PHYS, V74, P47, DOI 10.1103/RevModPhys.74.47; BENGIO Y, 1994, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V5, P157, DOI 10.1109/72.279181; Brazete JR, 2016, NEUROBIOL AGING, V37, P74, DOI 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2015.10.007; Fantini ML, 2003, ANN NEUROL, V53, P774, DOI 10.1002/ana.10547; Hochreiter S, 1997, NEURAL COMPUT, V9, P1735, DOI 10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735; Jaeger H., 2001, 14834 GMD GERM NAT R; Lukosevicius Mantas, 2012, Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade.

It is a powerful algorithm for classification of faults that needs a limited set of small sampling data, a case of applications with non-linear behavior, and a high number of parameters; however, appropriate model parameters must be determined carefully. The selection of parameters has a direct effect on the machine's classification accuracy. In this study, a multi-layer support vector machine classifier is optimized by a grid search method and three heuristic approaches: (1) genetic, (2) differential evolution, and (3) particle swarm optimization algorithms. The performance analysis of the support vector machine hybridized with these optimization methods is demonstrated using the same classification set. The employed structure has five support vector machine layers, each of which uses a Gaussian kernel function due to its advantages of needing one parameter for optimization and providing excellent classification ability for non-linear data. The proposed approach gives highly accurate performance for diagnosis of power transformers.

They provide evaluation of patients' status so that they can get the best distribution of the intensive care. However, the accuracy and reliability of the existing systems is still not ideal. A new combination of just-in-time learning (JITL) and extreme learning machine (ELM) was proposed, aiming at improving mortality prediction accuracy. JITL was utilized to gather the most relevant data samples for patient-specific modeling while ELM was chosen for fast model building. In this study, 4000 records of ICU patients from PhysioNet database were selected, including 554 dead and 3446 survival records in which physiological parameters values were used for mortality prediction. In terms of the area under receiver-operating curve (AUC), JITL-ELM achieved the best performance, compared with ELM, BP neural network, logistic regression model and traditional score models.

The horizontal and vertical vibration signals of the bearings are utilized as the input of the method. First, the signals, after preprocess, are decomposed into certain number of intrinsic mode functions ( IMF) using EEMD. Second, the IEs of the IMFs are calculated as the features for further fault diagnosis. Third, the selected features are adopted to train the SVM model using 10-fold cross validation. Fourth, the trained SVM model is used to conduct bearing fault diagnosis. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, three types of faults including inner-ring fault, outer-ring fault and rolling element fault are injected and data from three individual experiments are used. The results demonstrate that the approach has desirable diagnostic performance both for cylindrical roller bearing and deep groove ball bearing.

To solve the engineering problems of the low interpretation efficiency encountered in the construction of expert system, a reasoning machine based on the combination of Fault Tree (FT) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is brought forward. First, the FT model is built and simplified. Second, the FT model is transferred to Fault Dictionary (FD). And third, the GRNN model is built to learn the FD samples to achieve the rapid diagnostic reasoning of the complex FT logical criterion. Simulation shows that the GRNN model is better than the BP neural network model in the FD samples learning and has higher diagnosis accuracy. The reasoning machine is applied to the design of the aviation fault diagnosis expert system and improves the speed of reasoning.

In this paper, a fault diagnosis method based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD)-sample entropy (SampEn) combined with random forest (RF) is presented and applied to practical fault diagnosis for centrifugal pumps. CEEMD, a novel noise assisted method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD), is applied to decompose the nonlinear and non-stationary vibration signals into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, the SampEn is utilized to characterize the complexity of the IMF components in different time scales. After the feature extraction, an RF classifier is introduced for identification and classification of fault modes of the centrifugal pumps.

The traditional way to ensure productivity is to replace rolling bearings regularly which is a waste of resources and could increase maintenance costs, because of the large discreteness of rolling bearing's lifetime. So changing the fail-and-fix practices into a predict-and-prevent methodology is the most effective method. At present, the most common way used for rolling bearing fault diagnosis is vibration signal analysis. This paper explores the Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) algorithm to self-adaptively decompose the vibration signal into several PF components, and further calculates the power spectrum of each PF component, and extracts the sum of power value at the characteristic frequency band of inner ring fault/outer ring fault/rolling element fault. The sum of power value is used to train the BP neural network. And the experimental results show that the BP neural network trained in this way has high classification ability.

EEMD is used for adaptive decomposition of bearing vibration signals into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The IMF component energy characteristics and dimensionless factor of time domain characteristics were extracted as the original features. After that, Back Propagation (BP) neural network and Genetic Algorithm (GA) were employed for feature selection. Then, dimension-reduced feature based on principal component analysis (PCA) is to establish the SVM model and monitor bearing fault state. The experiment shows that with this method diagnosis of rolling element bearing faults could be realized effectively.

J	Asghar, F; Talha, M; Kim, SH				Asghar, Furqan; Talha, Muhammad; Kim, Sung Ho			Neural Network Based Fault Detection and Diagnosis System for Three-Phase Inverter in Variable Speed Drive with Induction Motor	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							FED PWM INVERTER; MODES	Recently, electrical drives generally associate inverter and induction machine. Therefore, inverter must be taken into consideration along with induction motor in order to provide a relevant and efficient diagnosis of these systems. Various faults in inverter may influence the system operation by unexpected maintenance, which increases the cost factor and reduces overall efficiency. In this paper, fault detection and diagnosis based on features extraction and neural network technique for three-phase inverter is presented. Basic purpose of this fault detection and diagnosis system is to detect single or multiple faults efficiently. Several features are extracted from the Clarke transformed output current and used in neural network as input for fault detection and diagnosis. Hence, some simulation study as well as hardware implementation and experimentation is carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Results show that the designed system not only detects faults easily, but also can effectively differentiate between multiple faults. These results prove the credibility and show the satisfactory performance of designed system. Results prove the supremacy of designed system over previous feature extraction fault systems as it can detect and diagnose faults in a single cycle as compared to previous multicycles detection with high accuracy.

We recorded audio samples in an uncontrolled environment and extracted Fourier, Wavelet and Mel-frequency Cepstrum features from normal and abnormal engines. We then implemented Fisher Score and Relief Score based variable ranking to obtain an informative reduced feature set for training and testing classification algorithms. Using this feature set, we were able to obtain a model accuracy of over 99% using a linear SVM applied to outsample data. This application of machine learning to vehicle subsystem monitoring simplifies traditional engine diagnostics, aiding vehicle owners in the maintenance process and opening up new avenues for pervasive mobile sensing and automotive diagnostics.

From the features reflecting different types of faults such as insulation, mechanical, temperature rise, arc and so on, the original feature set for switchgear fault can be achieved which is including some diagnostic indicators. Two kinds of score with local preserving and global separation is weighted by introducing a weight coefficient, then the improved Laplacian score is formed to sort the importance level of fault features, which refines the local preserving for adjacent samples and global separation for non-adjacent samples of the features subset. By using fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) classifier to check feature subset, and then the optimal fault feature subset of switchgear is obtained. Finally, the fault diagnosis of switchgear is implemented by using Mahalanobis distance (MD) to quantify the similarity of fault features and standard samples. According to the instance analysis of monitoring data from a switching station, the correction of the proposed method is verified.

This method utilizes the advantage of EEMD which can effectively restrain model mixing and combined with information entropy theory, firstly, original signals were decomposed into a finite number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IFMs). Secondly, singular value and singular entropies of a feature pattern matrix whose rows are IMFs are extracted.

Due to the requirement for a short and rapid response, it is important to study robust sensor data representation schemes. However, the conventional holospectrumdefined by one-dimensional or two-dimensional methods does not sufficiently present this information in both the frequency and time domains. To supply a complete holospectrummodel, a newthree-dimensional spatial representation method is proposed. This method integrates improved three-dimensional (3D) holospectra and 3D filtered orbits, leading to the integration of radial and axial vibration features in one bearing section. The results from simulation and experimental analysis on a complex compressor show that the proposed method can present the real operational status and clearly reveal early faults, thus demonstrating great potential for condition-based maintenance prediction in industrial machinery.

It is well known that vibration signals from machineries can be effectively used to detect certain gear faults. Yet it is still not an easy task to find a symptom that reflects a particular fault from vibration signals. This paper presents an advanced time-frequency signal processing technique for extracting important gear fault information from the vibration signal that is heavily corrupted by measurement noise. Experiments were performed on a bevel gearbox test rig using vibration measurements. The Time Synchronous Average (TSA) was initially utilized to eliminate all asynchronous component of vibration signal obtained from the gear. The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) method was then used to capture the non-stationary behaviour of the impulse signal generated from the broken bevel gear tooth. It was shown that the diagnosis method using the Continuous Wavelet Transform combined with Time Synchronous Averaging outperformed the conventional spectral analysis, capable of identifying the angular location of broken teeth in the gear.

Firstly, the gathered vibration signals were decomposed into a number of product functions (PFs) by LMD, with each PF corresponding to an instantaneous amplitude (IA) signal and instantaneous frequency (IF) signal. Then, introduce the concept of fault characteristic amplitude ratios which can be used to construct fault feature vectors; the extracted characteristic features were input into SVM to train and construct the fault identification model; the bearing running state identification was thereby realized. Cases of normal and fault were analyzed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can diagnose the bearing failures reasonable and efficient.

Several hundered measurement signals are evaluated for every EOL test, up to 100% of production volume. The difficulty of finding and maintaining accurate test limits makes EOL testing of complex products interesting as a machine learning problem. In this work, we define the EOL application as a one-class classification problem which can be solved by the support vector data description. The focus is on the comparison of three hyperparameter tuning methods that use little or no measurements from rarely occuring faulty engines. Experimental results with real production data show that fault detection rates of 95% are achievable in the industrial environment despite the high dimensionality of the EOL test data.

Continuous operation of an assembly machine results in wear of its various mechanisms that in turn lead to machine faults and subsequent machine downtime. The goal of this research project is to develop and validate a Machine Vision Inspection (MVI) system to detect and classify multiple faults using a single camera as a sensor. The results are experimental in nature, with an industrial O-ring assembly machine used for test purposes. The machine places O-rings on to continuously moving plastic carriers at a rate of over 100 assemblies per minute. The machine is controlled by a PLC with an HMI used to introduce the controlled faults such as transfer track jams, air knife jams, and hopper supply failures. Three MVI methods based on computer vision techniques are developed for this application: 1) Gaussian Mixture Models with blob analysis, 2) optical flow and 3) running average. In order to provide a measure of performance that can be used to better differentiate relative performance, a novel Machine Vision Performance Index (MVPI) was developed. The MVPI is based on five measures of performance: accuracy, processing time, speed of response, robustness against noise, and ease of tuning.

Fault Classification of Ball Bearing by Rotation Forest Technique	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIONS IN AUTOMATION AND MECHATRONICS ENGINEERING 2016, ICIAME 2016	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Innovations in Automation and Mechatronics Engineering (ICIAME)	FEB 05-06, 2016	Vallabh Vidhyanagar, INDIA	G H Patel Coll Engn & Technol, Dept Mechatron Engn		Bearing fault classification; Statistical features; Bootstraping; PCA; Rotation Forest	DIAGNOSIS	Bearing failure is one of the most common causes of breakdown in rotating machines. The machine learning techniques such as Support vector machines (SVM), Artificial neural network (ANN) are widely used for fault classification. These methods are slow and sometime give inaccurate results. Therefore, the search for new classifier techniques is a necessity to increase the classification efficiency with less computation time. In this study, a classifier ensemble is used for fault classification called Rotation forest. Data obtained from Case Western Reserve University have been used to extract time-based statistical features. In all kappa subsets are formed by randomly bifurcating the feature set. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used on each subset. All principal components are saved to preserve the transformation in the data. The novel features are calculated using kappa axis rotations. This results in improved efficiency of fault classification. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Kavathekar, S.; Upadhyay, N.; Kankar, P.

The present work focuses on effect of machining parameters on Surface Roughness (Ra) and Tool Vibrations (VIB) in manufacturing operational methods like tangential and orthogonal turn-milling processes. Single cut machining on A-axis of CNC Vertical Milling centre using HSS and carbide end mill cutters are adopted. Process parameters like cutter (tool) speed, feed rate and depth of cut with constant rotation of workpiece on A-axis are chosen while machining Extruded brass material under dry condition. Statically design experiments based on Taguchi's philosophy of Orthogonal Array (OA) is adopted for experimentation. Online capturing of Acousto-optic emissions (AOE) of tool shank vibrations is done using Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) and is analyzed using VibSoft analyzer. Peak vibrations displacements of the cutting tool shanks are identified using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) over time domain signals and are used for vibration diagnosis and prognostics as a measure of machine tool condition monitoring, Failure Mode and Effective Analysis (FMECA) based on ISO standards is used for vibration prognostics.

The motivation for IPAS is that, due to natural error masking, only a subset of SDC errors actually affects the output of scientific codes-we call these errors silent output corruption (SOC) errors. Thus applications require duplication only on code that, when affected by a fault, yields SOC. We use machine learning to learn code instructions that must be protected to avoid SOC, and, using a compiler, we protect only those vulnerable instructions by duplication, thus significantly reducing the overhead that is introduced by instruction duplication. In our experiments with five workloads, IPAS reduces the percentage of SOC by up to 90% with a slowdown that ranges between 1.04x and 1.35x, which corresponds to as much as 4 7 % less slowdown than state-of-the-art instruction duplication techniques.

The 122.4m(2) plant heats the make-up water of a fossil-fired steam boiler in a meat factory in Austria. The test bench consists of a plant model implemented in a Real-Time machine, which is electrically connected to the plant control hardware (PLC) through several I/O terminals. Within the test bench, it is possible to run different test cycles and emulate critical operation scenarios like collector loop overheating. The control strategy of the solar plant can be checked with minimal risk. The test bench also enables to improve the control ability to cope with weather and sensor disturbances. A suitable fault detection strategy is prepared, which minimizes the risk of component damage and enhances the plant availability. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

BROACHING TOOL DEGRADATION CHARACTERIZATION BASED ON FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTORS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 11TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	Blacksburg, VA	ASME, Mfg Engn Div		Broaching process; Clustering; Degradation measures; Functional data; Prognostics	DIGITAL IMAGES; WEAR; PROFILES; ALLOYS; ONLINE; MODEL	With rapid advancements in sensing technologies and computation capabilities, high-resolution machine vision data have become available for various manufacturing processes. For machining, the use of machine vision data has shown great promise in machining tool condition monitoring, a critical factor for final product quality. Extensive research has been performed on wear characterization using intensity-based methods, but limited work has made use of process knowledge for image processing phases. Additionally, previous work focuses on single cutting edge machining tools, but no methods have been proposed for multiple cutting edge machining tools, such as broaches. In this paper, a process knowledge-based image filtering method is proposed to eliminate within-image and between-image noise to obtain effective wear region(s) for each cutting edge on a broach. In addition, these wear regions across multiple cutting edges are jointly described by fitting their relationship with each cutting edge's respective chip load. Finally, the extracted model parameters are used for unsupervised learning to determine the entire tool's degradation levels from a training dataset. A case study is introduced to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology using a hexagonal broach.

Capabilities are needed for collecting and processing large volumes of real-time data generated from manufacturing machines and processes as well as for diagnosing the root cause of identified defects, predicting their progression, and forecasting maintenance actions proactively to minimize unexpected machine down times. Although cloud computing enables ubiquitous and instant remote access to scalable information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures and high volume data storage, it has limitations in latency-sensitive applications such as high performance computing and real-time stream analytics. The emergence of fog computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent radical changes in the way sensing systems, along with ICT infrastructures, collect and analyze large volumes of real-time data streams in geographically distributed environments. Ultimately, such technological approaches enable machines to function as an agent that is capable of intelligent behaviors such as automatic fault and failure detection, self-diagnosis, and preventative maintenance scheduling. The objective of this research is to introduce a fog enabled architecture that consists of smart sensor networks, communication protocols, parallel machine learning software, and private and public clouds. The fog-enabled architecture will have the potential to enable large-scale, geographically distributed online machine and process monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis that require low latency and high bandwidth in the context of data-driven cyber-manufacturing systems.

To enhance the proactiveness of maintenance service, the failure time of product need to be predicted. This study provides insight into how the maintenance time can be predicted accurately for the service decision-making of IPSS based on the historical failure time data, avoiding the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring. An improved grey prediction model is introduced to obtain a predictive interval of maintenance service time which is used as basis for making a decision of proactive maintenance service. The method is applied in an instance of maintenance service for agricultural machinery. In three examples of different types of agricultural machinery, the predicted intervals of maintenance time are given and the fitted values have high accordance with the real ones. The result shows that this approach can be used effectively to predict production failure time. Moreover, the output results of this approach can provide the necessary support to make a decision for proactive maintenance service without the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring in a reliable way.

In this paper, we first propose a virtualized and monitoring SaaS model with predictive maintenance to minimize the costs of fault tolerance. Then with the monitored and predicted available states of servers, we focus on dynamic real-time task scheduling in large-scale heterogeneous SaaS, targeting at jointly optimizing the long-term performance benefits and energy costs in order to improve scheduling quality. We formulate a dynamic programming problem, where both the state and action spaces are too large to be solved by simple iterations. To address these issues, we take advantage of Machine Learning theory, and put forward an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We utilize value function approximation and candidate-heuristic method to separately solve state and action explosions. Thus, computation complexity is significantly reduced and scheduling speed is greatly enhanced. Finally, we conduct experiments with both random simulation data and Google cloud trace-logs. Qos evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that our approach is effective and efficient under bursty requests and high throughputs.

The flexibility regarding scaling-out and migration of virtual machines for seamless maintenance has enabled a new level of continuous operation and changed service provisioning significantly. Meanwhile, services from domains striving for highest possible availability - e.g. from the telecommunications domain - are adopting this approach as well and are investing significant efforts into the development of Network Function Virtualization (NFV). However, the availability requirements for such infrastructures are much higher than typical for IT services built upon standard software with off-the-shelf hardware. They require sophisticated methods and mechanisms for fast detection and recovery of failures. This paper presents a set of methods and an implemented prototype for anomaly detection in cloud-based infrastructures with specific focus on the deployment of virtualized network functions. The framework is built upon OpenStack, which is the current de-facto standard of open-source cloud software and aims at increasing the availability and fault tolerance level by providing an extensive monitoring and analysis pipeline able to detect failures or degraded performance in real-time. The indicators for anomalies are created using supervised and non-supervised classification methods and preliminary experimental measurements showed a high percentage of correctly identified anomaly situations.

Effective fault diagnosis of TBM is vital for the safety of tunnel boring since the failure of TBM might cause harm for the workers accompanying with the loss of time and economy. A Web Service-Based Remote Diagnosis System (WSRDS) with Bayesian network (BN) as the faults analysis model is proposed in this paper. BN is a concise, practical and intuitive method to determine the exact cause for failure. The WSRDS enables an easy access for the diagnosis system of TBM and highlights an enhancement to the ubiquitous information processing. Taken the thrusting system of TBM as an example, the architecture of the WSRDS is formulated and the function of every module is described. The key system modules including general diagnostic procedure and integrated design of the diagnostic database are elaborated. The WSRDS could effectively realize the data integration among distributed enterprises of heterogeneous systems and greatly improves system reusability. The proposed WSRDS might have a promising wide application in the maintenance of TBM.

Thus, it is necessary to develop the prognostic system. In this study, we propose a prognostic method in order to assess and predict the health status of the cutting wheel, which is based on an integration of Kernel PCA and Mahalanobis Distance. In this methodology, a mapping relationship between the build-in sensor data from the SCADA system and the cutting wheel performance is established. The features that are sensitive to the mixshield machine performance are extracted and mapped to the kernel principal component space. The health value of the cutting wheel performance in each ring is calculated by the Mahalanobis distance measurement. Compared with the traditional empirical methods in engineering, the results show that the proposed method is more accurate and has good real-time performance. The parameters related to the cutting wheel are available in the PLC interface of mixshield machine. Among many cutting wheel assessment technologies, this method assessment can only perform on the data from the SCADA system without any extra sensors. So it can be embedded in the SCADA system and enable the online real-time assessment for the performance of cutting wheel of the shield machine.

To assess SVM faults classification capability based on diverse optimization algorithms and various kernel functions, an evaluation index system that is based upon accuracy, recall and precision was proposed, which comprehensively considers overall accuracy, false alarm probability, missing detection probability and robustness of SVM fault classifiers. Tennessee Eastman (TE) process benchmark was used as simulation platform to evaluate SVM classifying faults ability. The results showed that SVM with radical basic function (RBF) is the most sensitive to the optimization algorithm and that SVM with polynomial kernel optimized by Grid Search Method (GSM-Polynomial-SVM) provides the highest robustness. The suggested evaluation index system is conducive to selecting optimum faults classifier and could be used as a framework for future comparison.

Firstly, this paper uses statistical analysis and overall empirical mode decomposition method to construct high dimensional mixed domain initial feature vector from the characteristics of different indicators, and characterized by different description of the automaton fault analysis of different angles, then through principal component analysis, dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, the high dimensional variables changes into less dimensional independent eigenvector. At last, the principal component vectors using PCA to support vector machine, realizes the fault recognition. The experimental results show that the hybrid domain initial feature vector can accurately describe the fault characteristics, and the main feature vector extracted by PCA can discard the redundant information and simplify the classifier, and the SVM network diagnosis can improve the classification accuracy.

In this paper, a novel Two-Step fault diagnosis framework is proposed to diagnose the status of rolling element bearings with imbalanced data. The Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) is used to determine the feature vectors. 16-dimensional wavelet packet node energies were extracted from the original datasets as the feature vectors prepared to input to the classifiers. Next, our proposed framework consists of two steps for the fault diagnosis, where Step One makes use of Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (weighted ELM) in an effort to classify the normal or abnormal categories, and Step Two further diagnoses the underlying anomaly in details. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is testified on the raw data collected from the rolling element bearing experiments conducted in our Institute, and the empirical results showed that our approach is really fast and can achieve the diagnosis accuracies more than 95%.

Firstly, the original vibration signals of bearings are adaptively decomposed into a series of band-limited intrinsic mode function (BLlMF) components using VMD. Considering the reason that the permutation entropy can quantify the complexity of the signals to some extent, then permutation entropy is used to extract the feature information of the obtained BLIMF components and the feature vectors could be constructed. Finally, the feature vectors are fed into the SVM classifier to achieve automatic condition identification. The experimental data analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method could be applied to distinguish the different working conditions of rolling bearings. Simultaneously, the comparison results showed that the performance of the proposed method outperforms that of the method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and PE.

The electromagnetic force caused by rotor unbalance is one of main vibration sources of motorized spindle. Firstly, the research on the frequency spectrum characteristic of electromagnetic force under different rotor eccentricities is very necessary to suppress electromagnetic vibration. An electromagnetic finite element model was built for a motorized spindle based on Ansoft Maxwell in this paper. The electromagnetic force spectrum variation under the static and dynamic eccentricities is studied. The Unbalance Magnetic Pull(UMP) of the motorized spindle under different rotating speeds and different eccentricities are analysed. The results show that the motorized spindle with the static or dynamic eccentricity both produces new components in the electromagnetic force. Simultaneously, the eccentricity increase positively results in the increase of UMP amplitude. The UMP is constant under the rotor static eccentricity, which has a small impact on rotor vibration, while the frequency of UMP under the rotor dynamic eccentricity is the rotating frequency, which will increase the motorized spindle vibration. Finally, by the experiment the correctness of theoretical analysis and simulation are verified. This work provides a theoretical foundation for the fault diagnosis and dynamic balance of the motorized spindle.

DTCWPT is used to extract the component which expresses the fault feature most obviously among all the components of the decomposed signal. A one dimension signal can be transformed into a matrix through continuous truncation. By performing SVD on the matrix, singular values are obtained which can present the inherent characters of the matrix. To evaluate the classifying performance of proposed feature, Fisher measure is introduced and computed. Four roller bearings operating conditions such as inner race spalling, outer race spalling, roller element spalling and normal are simulated in experiment rig to test the performance of the proposed feature. The result suggests that the mean of singular values performs better in distinguishing the above four conditions of roller bearings than traditional characters such as root mean square (RMS), kurtosis and sample entropy.

One of the major challenges of ferrograph analysis is feature construction from the existing features of wear particles to improve classifier efficiency. The current feature construction method is trial and error based on previous experience and mass data, which is time-consuming, laborious and blindness. In this paper, genetic programming-based approach was proposed to construct new features from the five existing morphological features of ferrograph wear particles to improve the ability of classification process. The GP-based feature construction approach is used for fault classification of ferrograph wear particles for the first time and the results show that the method can be used in wear condition monitoring and fault prognosis of machinery equipment.

Three different faults were set on easy-to-crack locations of automaton, using electrospark wire-electrode cutting. Then two groups of piezoelectrical acceleration transducers were set on the front of the catridge receiver and the top of the machine gun's tail respectively. Each transducer group detected the vibration of two directions. The author took one set of signals (five shoots in succession) from each working condition's database as a test sample. And another sample (three shoots in succession) from Fault 3 signal database was taken additionally as the reference sample. In order to diagnose the fault more easily, the local narrow-band decomposition was used to highlight fault features. Then the similarity measurement based on frequency-domain fuzzy nearness degree was used to compare similarities between the reference sample and each test sample. The results showed that the nearness degree of Fault 3 (five shoots in succession) was much lower than other test samples. So this method could distinguish different working conditions of automaton and retlect the severity of fault.

Firstly, EEMD decomposition method was used for automaton vibration signal and the first five Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) components was selected to analyze with the help of correlation coefficients. Then the energy percentage of each component was extracted as the fault feature and its validity was verified. The singular entropy, which is a more sensitive feature, was selected in this paper to reflect the characteristics of the fault information. Phase space reconstruction was then performed for each IMF component. After that, using the mutual information method and false nearest neighbor method, the optimum delay time and embedding dimension were determined. Then singular entropy was calculated respectively, and this multi-component singular entropy was used as a feature that provides a quantitative description of the change of the signal state. Finally, the support vector machine (SVM) was used to recognize the fault pattern. The diagnostic results show that the method proposed can extract the fault feature and recognize the faults effectively, which can be used to solve the problem of the fault diagnosis for automaton. This work provides a new way for the fault diagnosis of automatic weapons and has great theoretical and practical significance for the fault diagnosis of high-speed automaton.

However, poor choice of parameters involving penalization coefficient and kernel parameters decided by kernel function type, dramatically decreases the classification accuracy and generalization ability of SVM. To address the above issue, quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) is introduced into parameters optimization of SVM, and moreover a novel dynamic adjustment mechanism of quantum gate rotation angle based on quantum entropy, Hadamard gate-based mutation strategy and population catastrophe strategy are appended to classical QGA to ameliorate local searching ability of the algorithm, and furthermore an improved bi-layer quantum genetic algorithm (IBQGA) which possess the ability of solving the blindfold preinstall problem of the mutation probability and the timing parameter of catastrophe, is put forward to realize the parameters optimization of SVM. Finally the optimal SVM is utilized for fault diagnosis of gearbox. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis approach is validated by a gearbox'S fault simulation experiment. Experiment results demonstrate that SVM optimized by the developed IBQGA outperforms classical quantum genetic-optimized SVM and genetic-optimized SVM in converging rate and fault identification rate.

Firstly, the gathered vibration signals were decomposed by the LMD to obtain the corresponding product functions (PFs). The morphological spectrums of the chosen PFs that include typical feature information are calculated and defined as the characteristic features. However, the extracted features remained high-dimensional, and excessive redundant information still existed. So, the principal components analysis (PCA) is used to extract the characteristic features to extract the characteristic features and reduce the dimension. The characteristic features are input into the SVM model, in order to get a higher accuracy of the diagnosis accuracy, because of the fuzzy features, the transfer learning strategy is used to optimized the SVM model, and the optimized model is used to construct the fault state identification model, the bearing fault state identification is realized. The fault states of a bearing normal and several inner races with different degree of fault were recognized, the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AN ADAPTIVE FAULT IDENTIFICATION SCHEME FOR DC MICROGRID USING EVENT BASED CLASSIFICATION	2016 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICACCS)	International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS)	JAN 22-23, 2016	Sri Eswar Coll Engn, Chennai, INDIA		Sri Eswar Coll Engn	Event-based classification; Artificial Inductive Line Impedance (AILI); Super capacitor		The recent high penetration of stationary renewable energy sources yielding DC output coupled with the increased interest in storage systems, electronic loads, machine drives and other components operating with DC input, require the development of new techniques for control and link integration. Faults in power distribution systems have high impact on continuous supply and quality service. If a contingency occurs in a system, instability and cascading failures blackout would be possible. Protection against such severe faults increases the transfer capabilities of the existing transmission systems. The literature survey shows various methods available for the fault identification and fault location. In the existing system each protection unit is able to autonomously identify the type of fault using the current derivative fault identification method. Then the event judgment is sent to other interconnected protection units through high level data communication. But in the existing system there is a limitation that it is possible to limit the load voltage drop up to 2.88%. A novel protective method is proposed to identify the fault, isolate the faulted area and restore the system quickly. The fault identification is based on voltage derivative method. In the voltage derivative protection method, the derivatives partial derivative V/partial derivative t and partial derivative I/partial derivative t are calculated from the dc voltages and currents measured locally at the relaying point to detect, locate and isolate the fault. The local voltage and current measurements are taken for each instance of time. It requires less data and doesn't require high speed communication and synchronization. The advantage of this method is that the first incident/reflected wave from the fault is used in the detection and, therefore, the response time is very fast, providing fault detection within 2-3ms than current derivative method.

In this model, all non-ideal effects are taken into account. That they include the machine geometry, slots effects and saturation, non-linear behavior due to ferromagnetic materials, type of winding connection and winding distribution and static and dynamic eccentricity between the stator and rotor. That is able to consider most of the important features of a salient pole machine. In order to analyze the behavior of machine in normal conditions and faulty, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been used for eccentricity fault identification. Torque and stator current spectra of the SynM under different condition are computed and a novel approach is presented to detect static and dynamic eccentricity in salient-pole SynM based on vibration torque and currents signature.

Although this converter offers low current ripple, but an open-circuit switch fault can lead to unacceptable current ripples. In this paper, a very fast and simple method is proposed to detect an open-circuit switch fault and its location. This method doesn't need any additional sensors, is efficient in CCM and DCM modes of operation, and can detect the fault in less than one switching period. Moreover, this method is suitable for implementation on an FPGA, due to the use of simple math and state machine blocks. Simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of this method.

In a real environment (e.g. forested terrain), presence of PD usually means that branch or tree have direct contact with CC. The detection of the PD in a real environment is an important task because it helps technicians to accurately identify fault and therefore it has economical benefits. However, the automatic detection of PD in a real environment has to deal with high interference of background noise. A novel approach of PD detection based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Particle Swarm Intelligence (PSO) is proposed in this paper. Its performance is compared to Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back Propagation (BP) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) methods. These methods use standard features like number of peaks, fractal dimension, etc. The quality of the detection was successfully increased by the proposed approach. So the faults in a real environment can be more accurately detected and thus more economically repaired.

RS theory is used to analyze the stator current fault data of mine hoist machine in order to exclude uncertain, duplicate information. For getting the optimal decision table, the equivalence relationship of positive domains of between decision attributes and different condition attributes is analyzed in the decision tables to simplify condition attributes. The optimal decision table is as the SVM input samples to establish the SVM training model. And the mapping model which reflects the relation of the characteristics between condition attribute and decision attribute is obtained by SVM training model in order to realize the fault diagnosis of the mine hoist machine. The simulation results show that the fault diagnosis method based on RS and SVM can improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

For such applications, the fault tolerance and the reliability of the drive (PMSM and the power converter) are important to take into account for design. The addressed work aims essentially to analyze the dynamic of the measured phase currents in post-fault operation with a real-time fault diagnostic purpose in the VSI. The paper starts with a presentation of the electric drive system structure and its control used in pre-fault and post-fault operation. Then, fault effects analysis (FEA) on the system will be considered. All results are verified analytically and through simulation software using Matlab/Simulink (R). The theoretical development and the simulation results show that the five-phase PMSM under inverter faults presents typical characteristics which can be used as better input variables for designing a high performance real-time fault diagnostic and classification process.

Influence of Current Transducer Transfer Properties on Stator Insulation Condition Monitoring of Inverter-fed Drives	2016 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POWER ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL DRIVES, AUTOMATION AND MOTION (SPEEDAM)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation, and Motion (SPEEDAM)	JUN 22-24, 2016	Anacapri, ITALY			AC machines; current measurement; fault diagnosis; insulation; electric breakdown		Insulation condition monitoring is important in case of inverter-fed machines due to the high strains on the machine and especially on its winding insulation system. In particular in traction applications the usage of new emerging semiconductor technologies, which enable higher inverter switching frequencies and rapid voltage rises, transient overvoltages at the machine occur. The insulation system suffers due to these overvoltages and a reduced lifetime and increased risk of unexpected outage of the drive are the consequences. A strategy to monitor the insulation health state during the operation of the drive based on transient current signal evaluation to detect incipient insulation degradation enables the possibility to define further maintenance tasks. Using only the measuring equipment available in the inverter, space and costs of the monitoring system are optimized. Experimental results of this concept, tested at a 1.4MW induction machine for railway application are presented. Additionally, the variance in the transfer function of different current transducer's of the same type and its influence on the proposed method is analyzed.

The proposed technique exploits the monitoring of the motor d, q axes inductances via a Recursive Least Square Algorithm (RLS). The motor parameters, which have been pre-mapped with reference to the d, q axes current components, are compared to the results of the online identification procedure and their discrepancy is evaluated in real time. A fault indicator index is derived and its behavior conditioned in order to properly recognize any anomalous condition. The proposed method is tested via numerical simulations on the basis of a real PM brushless machine whose parameter have been evaluated in different operating conditions by means of several off-line experimental measurements.

Operating in aggressive environments, the detection of anomalies at an incipient stage is crucial to decide about the operating continuity of the machines. In this paper the behavior of DFIM is investigated under the assumption that the stator and rotor windings are simultaneously unbalanced owing to faults or incipient windings damage. The aim of the presented work is to investigate the spectral signature frequencies issued from stator and rotor currents under mixed stator-rotor asymmetry. The derived chains of interhamonics are firstly validated by numerical simulations, and then by experimental tests with a 5.5 kW wound rotor induction motor.

SE is one of the most common mechanical faults in electrical machines on. In order to achieve this goal, the proposed machine is studied under different degrees of static eccentricity fault to analyze machine condition. Finite element modeling (FEM) as the most accurate numerical approach is used to obtain precise results. The magnetic flux distribution of rotor and stator are calculated. In addition, air-gap flux density as a parameter which has a direct impact on back-EMF is assessed by using finite element analysis (FEA). It is found that static eccentricity has noticeable influences on back-EMF of coils of the machine. Furthermore, Fourier analysis is performed in order to achieve appropriate index for the diagnosis process. The results are provided for the healthy machine and the machine with different values of SE and the proposed index has been derived for the fault detection process in the machine.

During the last ten years, numerous RUL prediction models have been developed. These methods usually treat completed time-series only, i.e. full statistics before the item fails. Under actual operating conditions occasionally number of failed items is too small, and therefore application of uncompleted (suspended) time-series is necessary, and using Semi-Supervised methods instead of Supervised is required. In this paper, we propose an approach based on regression and classification models we have introduced in the past. These models consider monitoring data (time-series) as inputs and RUL estimation as output. Significant difference of this model is using suspended time-series to estimate optimal RUL for each suspended time-series, so they can be used for initial model training. This article describes the procedures that have been developed and applied successfully for Suspended Time-Series using. Several models based on modification of the SVR and SVC methods (Support Vector Regression and Support Vector Classification) are proposed for consideration. Number of uncompleted time-series used for training and cross-validation is proposed as additional control parameter. Suggested methodology and algorithms were verified on the NASA Aircraft Engine database. Numerical examples based on this database have been also considered. Experimental result shows that the proposed model performs significantly better estimations than pure supervised learning based model.

In the majority of fall events external support is imperative in order to avoid major consequences. Therefore, the ability to automatically detect these fall events could help reducing the response time and significantly improve the prognosis of fall victims. This paper presents a practical real time fall detection system running on a smartwatch (F2D). A decision module takes into account the rebound after the fall and the residual movement of the user, matching a detected fall pattern to an actual fall. The last module of F2D is the location module which makes our system very useful for nursing homes that host elderly people. The fall detection algorithm has been tested by Fondation Suisse pour les Teletheses (FST), the project partner who is responsible for the commercialization of our system. By testing with real data and achieving an accuracy of 96.01% we have a fall detection system ready to be deployed on the market and by adding the location module we can provide it to nursing homes for elderly people.

A parametric predictive maintenance decision framework considering the system health prognosis accuracy	APPLIED MATHEMATICS IN ENGINEERING AND RELIABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Applied Mathematics in Engineering and Reliability (ICAMER)	MAY 04-06, 2016	Ton Duc Thang Univ, Ho Chi Minh, VIETNAM	Tech Univ Ostrava, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc	Ton Duc Thang Univ		LIFE	Nowadays, the health prognosis is popularly recognized as a significant lever to improve the maintenance performance of modern industrial systems. Nevertheless, how to efficiently exploit prognostic information for maintenance decision-making support is still a very open and challenging question. In this paper, we attempt at contributing to the answer by developing a new parametric predictive maintenance decision framework considering improving health prognosis accuracy. The study is based on a single-unit deteriorating system subject to a stochastic degradation process, and to maintenance actions such as inspection and replacement. Within the new framework, the system health prognosis accuracy is used as a condition index to decide whether or not carrying out an intervention on the system. The associated mathematical cost model is also developed and optimized on the basis of the semi-regenerative theory, and is compared to a more classical benchmark framework.

It also is one of important indicators of carcinoma patterns. In general, it depends on three indices: tubule formation, nuclear plemorphism, and mitotic counts by scoring based on the degrees of cell differentiation or proliferation. However, scoring on these indices often subjects to intra-and inter-observer variability due to its complexities and manual classifications by pathologists. This study aims to accurately determine the scoring of tubule formation for histological grading using a series of image processing and a classifier consisting of support vector machine with Gaussian kernel function. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a number of H&E stained images acquired from biopsy tissues of patients were tested with the proposed system for the scoring. Experimental result reveals that the proposed algorithms can obtain satisfactory scoring compared to other reported works. Therefore, it can provide reliable scores in the tubule formation and grade of breast carcinoma especially for ductal carcinoma.

In addition, the drive to downsize maintenance staff of production facilities decreases the available man-hours. If preventative maintenance is not taken seriously, action items may fall behind or become neglected leaving opportunities for more issues to arise in time. This leads to counterproductive behavior as the preventative intentions actually transition to becoming reactive. DC machines are critical components to a paper machine and must be serviced correctly - including the carbon brushes. When motor-brush practices are overlooked, motors will develop symptoms that will eventually cause a motor to fail. These symptoms can be caught and corrected when preventative maintenance practices are being executed correctly. Motor-brush practices should be thorough in order to limit the need for serious repair work. Thorough practices can help determine the quality of performance of the motor (health), allow for correct troubleshooting, and simplify brush organization which will ultimately lead to improved motor performance and decreased maintenance costs.

Ibrahim			Development of a machine vision system for yarn bobbin inspection	INDUSTRIA TEXTILA			English	Article						Machine vision; fiber mixture; yarn bobbin inspection; image processing; fault detection		When the different raw materials are blended in any step of the yarn production, it causes fiber mixture fault on the yarn bobbin. Since each fiber has different dye affinity characteristics, this fault causes off-quality fabric production. Despite the new automation systems used in yarn manufacturing mills, the fiber mixture fault is still inspected by human eye. This process takes long time and the evaluation is made subjectively. Furthermore, many bobbins with fiber mixture fault may be escaped from the worker notice. In this study, a prototype of vision inspection system was developed to detect the yarn fiber mixture fault by using image processing method. It was aimed that the fiber mixture faults of the yarn bobbins can be detected automatically and the fault evaluation can be made objectively. The fault detection algorithm was based on Wiener filtering, Gaussian filtering and morphological operations. Six yarn bobbins; three of them with fiber mixture fault and other three having no mixture fault as control group were detected successfully and the fault areas were labeled.	[Celik, H.

Due to the growing number of women undergoing first-level screening tests, systems that can make these operations faster and more effective are required. This paper presents a Computer Assisted Detection system based on medical imaging techniques and capable of labeling potentially cancerous breast lesions. This work is based on MRIs performed with morphological and dynamic sequences, obtained and classified thanks to the collaboration of the specialists from the University of Bari Aldo Moro (Italy). A first set of 60 images was acquired without Contrast Method for each patient and, subsequently, 100 more slices were taken with Contrast Method. This article formally describes the techniques adopted to segment these images and extract the most significant features from each Region of Interest (ROI). Then, the underlying architecture of the suggested Artificial Neural Network (ANN) responsible of identifying suspect lesions will be presented. We will discuss the architecture of the supervised neural network based on the algorithm named Robust Error Back Propagation, trained and optimized so to maximize the number of True Positive ROIs, i.e., the actual tumor regions. The training set, built with physicians' help, consists of 94 lesions and 3700 regions of any interest extracted with the proposed segmentation technique. Performances of the ANN, trained using 60 % of the samples, are evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity indices. In conclusion, these tests show that a supervised machine learning approach to the detection of breast lesions in Magnetic Resonance Images is consistent, and shows good performance, especially from a False Negative reduction perspective.

The fuzzy feature ranking vector is acquired by setting the corresponding spectrum value to 1 or 0 according to the sequence of the harmonics of the signal, the inner product between the feature ranking vector of observed signal and the feature ranking vector of each standard state is calculated, and the principal components of source signal are extracted according to the maximum inner product step by step. We chose an air conditioner, a microwave oven and a washing machine as the test object to testify the proposed method. The experimental results showed that the aggregated current signal of the multiple home appliances can be fast and accurately separated using this method and which can be widely used in the field of remote Prognostics and Health Management for home appliances.

Premised upon the concept of time-frequency (TF) reassignment, SST provides a sharp representation of signals in TF plane compared to many popular TF methods. Additionally, it can also extract the individual components, called intrinsic mode functions or IMFs, of a non-stationary multi-component signal, akin to empirical mode decomposition. The rich mathematical structure based on continuous wavelet transform makes SST a promising candidate for gearbox diagnosis. This work utilizes the decomposing power of SST to extract the IMFs from gearbox signals. For robust detection of faults in gear-motors, a fault detection technique based on time-varying autoregressive coefficients of IMFs as features is utilized. Sequential Karhunen-Loeve transform is employed on the condition indicators to select the appropriate window sizes on which SST can be applied. Laboratory experimental data obtained from drivetrain diagnostics simulator provides test bed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2016 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Being critical member of the entire system, these bearings play an important role in the overall performance of the system. Failure of such bearings in any one of the critical machine of process industry disrupts entire production process and loads to heavy production loss. Early detection of faults in the bearing is, therefore, highly essential to avoid catastrophic. Monitoring and analysis of vibration signal generated by faults in the bearings helps to diagnose exact fault in the bearings. This paper deals with the study of vibration response of roller bearings by using mathematical model. Mathematical model considers the influence of the bearing structure parameters on the vibration of the system. The experimental data technique is used to find out bearing vibration amplitude and defect frequencies. The method proposed in this paper for vibration characteristics calculation of a roller bearing is credible and will save time and costs by timely detection of imminent bearing failure.

This paper presents a methodology to detect various bearing faults from the measured vibration signal. Features such as kurtosis, skewness, mean, root mean square and complexity measure such as Shannon entropy are calculated from time domain, frequency domain and discrete wavelet transform. In total 40 features are calculated from bearing conditions such as Healthy bearing, Inner race fault, Outer race fault and Ball fault. Feature ranking methods such as Chisquare, ReliefF method are used to select most informative feature and subsequently to reduce size of feature vector. Comparison has been made between feature ranking methods and classifiers to obtain best diagnosis result with reduce feature set. Our results shows good fault identification accuracy with minimum number of features. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Maximizing asset productivity and ensuring that the associated processes are as efficient as possible are key aspects for organizations striving to gain their strong financial returns. Maintenance costs are one of the largest factors impacting a plant's budget. Attempts to reduce these costs have led to the development of several maintenance strategies. To achieve reliability of process/system, effective utilization of predictive maintenance has proven to be very effective and beneficial. Predictive maintenance can contribute a lot in improving the bottom line through eliminating unscheduled outages of machine/processes, optimizing the process parameters, improving reliability and productivity.

The failures of bearing without warning will result catastrophic consequences in many situations. Therefore condition monitoring of bearing is very important. In this paper, artificial intelligence techniques are used to predict and analyses the bearing faults. Experiments were carried out on rolling bearing having localized defects on the various bearing components for wide range of speed and vibration signals were stored. Condition monitoring systems is divided in two important part one feature extraction and second diagnosis through extracted features. Daubechies wavelet is popular for smoothing of signals so, it is chosen for reducing the background noise from vibration signal. Kurtosis, RMS, Creast factor and Peak difference as suitable time domains features are extracted from decompose time velocity signals. Back propagation multilayer neural network was train and tested by 369 pre-treated normliesed features. Support vector machine is also used for the same data for predicting bearing faults. Finally, it is found that Support vector machine techniques gives better results over ANN. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Patel, J.

Response surface methodology (RSM) is employed for the experimentation and to explore the dependence of various factors on the vibrations of these bearings. A numerical analysis performed in the study showed the effectiveness of MMDA model along with frequency domain scrutiny of the vibration data for detection of localized bearing defects.

Detection of Combined Gear-Bearing Fault in Single Stage Spur Gear Box Using Artificial Neural Network	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON VIBRATION PROBLEMS 2015	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Vibration Problems (ICOVP)	DEC 14-17, 2015	Guwahati, INDIA	Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Dept Sci & Technol, Def Res & Dev Org, Board Res Nucl Sci, Indian Natl Sci Acad		Vibration; Combined gear-bearing fault; Feature extraction; Artificial neural network	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; VIBRATION; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSIS	Gears and bearings are important components of almost every machines used in industrial environment. Hence detection of defect in any of these must be detected in advance to avoid catastrophic failure. This paper aims to address the effect of bearing defect on gear vibration signature and effect gear defect on bearing vibration signature. Also its purpose is to make vibration analysis of single stage spur gear box, when both gear and bearing are defective. A condition monitoring set up is designed for analyzing the defect in outer race of bearing and damaged tooth of gear. MATLAB is used for feature extraction and neural network is used for diagnosis. In the literature, many authors have analyzed defects in bearings and gears separately. But it is found that the real situation may be more complex. The work presents a laboratory investigation carried out through an experimental set-up for the study of combined gear - bearing fault. This paper proposes a novel approach of damage detection in which defects in multiple components are analyzed using vibration signal. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A big data MapReduce framework for fault diagnosis in cloud-based manufacturing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						big data analytics; class imbalance problem; radial basis function; support vector machine (SVM); fault diagnosis and Cloud-based manufacturing	PREDICTION; MACHINE; FUSION; SET	This research develops a MapReduce framework for automatic pattern recognition based on fault diagnosis by solving data imbalance problem in a cloud-based manufacturing (CBM). Fault diagnosis in a CBM system significantly contributes to reduce the product testing cost and enhances manufacturing quality. One of the major challenges facing the big data analytics in CBM is handling of data-sets, which are highly imbalanced in nature due to poor classification result when machine learning techniques are applied on such data-sets. The framework proposed in this research uses a hybrid approach to deal with big data-set for smarter decisions. Furthermore, we compare the performance of radial basis function-based Support Vector Machine classifier with standard techniques. Our findings suggest that the most important task in CBM is to predict the effect of data errors on quality due to highly imbalance unstructured data-set. The proposed framework is an original contribution to the body of literature, where our proposed MapReduce framework has been used for fault detection by managing data imbalance problem appropriately and relating it to firm's profit function. The experimental results are validated using a case study of steel plate manufacturing fault diagnosis, with crucial performance matrices such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. A comparative study shows that the methods used in the proposed framework outperform the traditional ones.

During its O&M (Operation and Maintenance) phase, since the accidental occurrence of offshore plant equipment causes catastrophic damage, it is necessary to make more efforts for managing critical offshore equipment. Nowadays, due to the emerging ICTs (Information Communication Technologies), it is possible to send health monitoring information to administrator of an offshore plant, which leads to much concern on CBM (Condition-Based Maintenance). This study introduces three approaches for predicting the next failure time of offshore plant equipment (gas compressor) with case studies, which are based on finite state continuous time-Markov model, linear regression method, and their hybrid model.

The key step is the derivation of two indicators from the sequence component model of the induction machine. One main challenge in inter-turn fault isolation is discriminating with voltage imbalance, which invariably exists in the system. The identification of the inter-turn fault and information on voltage imbalance condition can be obtained by employing the proposed technique. Different types of voltage imbalances have been examined to show the robustness of the proposed approach. The method is also insular to load variations which may occur in the real conditions.

In particular, inter-turn short fault (ISF) is one of the most frequent electrical faults in PMSMs. In this paper, we propose a method using negative sequence components (NSC). The NSC method not only calculates a fault indicator that is not easily affected by the changes of the rotor speed, but also diagnoses the degree of failure for PMSMs with the ISF more accurately. In addition, the method can be applied to PMSMs with weak ISF or low rotational speed. The effectiveness of the NSC method to diagnose the ISF was verified through various operating conditions.

Nevertheless, the use of diode rectifier increases the difficulty of the analysis of drive's behavior, as it introduces uncertainty of harmonic components. Especially in fault mode, this irregularity greatly affects the fault detection. Harmonic components analysis can give us a better comprehension of operation modes, as well as detection methods. This paper uses simulation to make a detail harmonic study in health and fault modes; a fault detection method is thereby applied among them.

Based on support vector regression algorithm, this article proposes a wall thinning model for carbon steel pipes in a nuclear power plant using in-service inspections data and further performs the uncertainty quantitive assessment for the proposed model. In the beginning, Latin hypercube sampling method is used to create new sample sets from the original observation with certain distribution of the mean values which are assumed from the observed data. Furthermore, part of the reconstructed sample sets are chosen as training sets to develop a wall thinning model and the remaining samples are used as test sets to verify the model. By comparing model predicted wall thickness values of the test sets and the observed values, a quantitative assessment of the degradation model uncertainty is obtained. The obtained results demonstrate that the deviations between observed thickness values and average model predicted values fluctuate around 1%, while model predicting variances are much smaller than the observed variances. This report concludes that the proposed support vector regression model for component degradation can provide accurate condition assessments with rather small variance.

This article presents a fault diagnosis method of feedwater pump by using parameter-optimized support vector machine (SVM). While the fault features of feedwater pump are reflected from the power spectrum of the vibration signals, we trained and diagnosed the fault feature table with support vector machine. The optimal penalty factor C and kernel parameter y of support vector machine are selected by grid search and k-fold cross validation. Then the faults are diagnosed by the SVM model under the optimal parameters. Diagnostic results show that the parameter-optimized SVM method achieves higher diagnostic accuracy than the PNN method, exhibiting superior performance to effectively diagnose the faults of feedwater pump.

The transient phase estimation is very important for order tracking, especially when the tachometer installation is not convenient. The transient phase is usually obtained by integrating the instantaneous frequency (IF), so the IF estimation has attracted a great deal of concerns. This article describes a new IF estimation method based on the joint application of the synchrosqueezing transform(SST) and the multiscale chirplet path pursuit (MSCPP) method. The SST method as its high frequency resolution merits is used to estimate the frequency parameters for the parameter settings of the MSCPP method, that will resolve the high computation problem of the MSCPP method to a certain degree, so as to extensively use the high accuracy of the MSCPP method in IF estimation. The order spectrum based on the estimated IF can provide the demodulation information for the bearing fault diagnosis. The performance of the proposed method has been validated by both simulation and experimental data.

For this purpose, a novel assessment method is proposed based on lifting wavelet packet symbolic entropy (LWPSE) and support vector data description (SVDD). LWPSE is presented for feature extraction by jointing use of lifting wavelet packet transform and symbolic entropy. Firstly, the LWPSEs of bearing signals from normal bearing condition are extracted to train an SVDD model by fitting a tight hypersphere around normal samples. Then, the relative distance from the LWPSEs of testing signals to the hypersphere boundary is calculated as a quantitative index for bearing performance degradation assessment. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method were validated by the life-cycle data obtained from NASA's prognostics data repository and the comparison with Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Finally, the assessment results were verified by the envelope spectrum analysis method based on empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert envelope demodulation.

Here, the simulation is made using both the Ansys Maxwell and Simplorer. The finite element of the PMSM model is calculated and then its performance is optimized. This model is created in Maxwell two-Dimensional (2D). Moreover, the power inverter and control circuit are established based on the Ansys-Simplorer. The global dynamic model of the PMSM is obtained by co-simulation using Maxwell and Simplorer. The proposed model is exploited to analyze the system with faults caused by electric component such as the short circuit fault in the stator. Here the study of the machine in the faulty case is made and its effects are studied by the illustration of the simulation results.

To ensure reliable drive with an induction machine requires deep insight in electro-mechanical dynamics during its operation. The flexible multibody modeling technique enables the simulation of dynamic loads on all drive components. This paper focuses on complex dynamic modeling of machine's behavior in case of eccentrically placed rotor supported by nonlinear bearing with radial clearance. The life time of machine's bearing becomes very important issue of machine's maintenance and reliability and is markedly influenced by any unbalanced forces acting on the rotor. Only the complex electro-mechanical models of the rotor considering all unbalanced electrical and mechanical rotor forces can provide the very detailed information about the bearing load. The methodology of determination of such loading is applied to the 11 kW squirrel-cage induction machine.

Influence of Parasitic Capacitances of IGBT Inverter on Insulation Condition Monitoring of Traction Machines Based on Current Signal Transients Analysis	2016 18TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS (EPE'16 ECCE EUROPE)	European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	18th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE)	SEP 05-09, 2016	GERMANY			AC machine; Electric breakdown; Fault detection; Insulation testing; Pulse width modulation inverters		At inverter-fed traction drives stray currents due to parasitic capacitances in frequency converters and machine cause high frequency voltage components spreading into all conductive components of the drive system. These hf voltages are harmful and origin from the inverter side through fast switching power semiconductors with high levels of output voltage steepness. Additionally overvoltage at the machine occurs by inverter operation of the machine and is thus stressing the machine insulation system. These effects can lead to a reduction of the machine insulation lifetime due to loss of insulation strength. Thus, insulation condition monitoring systems are necessary to enable a safe and reliable operation of a drive. Insulation condition monitoring of inverter-fed traction drives is implemented in this work by evaluating the transient current response after voltage step excitation. The current measurement is performed using the built-in current transducers of the inverter, normally used for the control of the drive, to save cost and space. Insulation degradation usually is a slowly developing process, at which the parasitic capacitances of the winding system change and thus also the transient current response. However, influences from the inverter capacitances cannot be neglected and thus the influence of the parasitic capacitances located in the inverter on the proposed insulation condition monitoring is investigated.

An Investigation of Electrical Motor Parameters in a Sensorless Variable Speed Drive for Machine Fault Diagnosis	2016 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION AND COMPUTING (ICAC)			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Conference on Automation & Computing (ICAC)	SEP 07-08, 2016	Univ Essex, Colchester, ENGLAND	Chinese Automat & Comp Soc, Int Journal Automat & Comp, Hefei Univ	Univ Essex	electrical motor signature analysis; Sensorless variable speed drive; gearbox; tooth breakage	BISPECTRUM	Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is regarded as an effective technique for motor and its downstream equipment fault diagnostics. However, limited work has been carried out for motors based on a sensorless variable speed drive (VSD). This study focuses on investigation of mechanical fault detection and diagnosis using electrical signatures from a VSD system. An analytic analysis was conducted to show that the fault can induce sidebands in instantaneous current, voltage and power signals in the VSD system, rather than just the sideband in a drive without closed loop control. Then different degrees of tooth breakages in an industrial two-stage helical gearbox were experimentally studied. It has found that even though the measured signal is very noisy, common spectrum analysis can discriminate the small sidebands for the fault detection and diagnosis. However, it has found that the power signals resulted from the multiplication of the current and voltage can provide a better diagnostic results.

The ability to predict degradation of power electronic components can minimise the risk of their failure while in operation. Research in this area aims to develop prognostics strategies for predicting degradation behaviour, failure modes and mechanisms, and remaining useful life of these electronic components. In this paper, data driven prognostics approaches based on Neural Network (NN) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models are developed and used to predict the degradation of an IGBT device. IGBT life data under thermal overstress load condition with square signal gate voltage bias, available from NASA prognostics data repository, is used to demonstrate the proposed data-driven prognostics strategy. The monitored collector-emitter voltage is used to identify the pattern and duration of different phases in the applied voltage load. The NN and ANFIS models are trained with a subset of the test data to predict remaining useful life (RUL) of the IGBT device under varying load test profiles. The predictive capability and performance of the models is observed and analysed.

If this need can be defined reliably beforehand so that no unpredicted failures take place then the maintenance actions can be carried out economically with minimum disturbance to production. There are two basic challenges in solving the above. First understanding the development of wear and failures, and second managing the measurement and diagnosis of such parameters that can reveal the development of wear. In principle the development of wear and failures can be predicted through monitoring time, load or wear as such. Monitoring time is not very efficient, as there are only limited numbers of components that suffer from aging which as such is result of chemical wear i.e. changes in the material. In most cases the loading of components influences their wear. In principle the loading can be stable or varying in nature. Of these two cases the varying load case is much more challenging than the stable one. The monitoring of wear can be done either directly e.g. optical methods or indirectly e.g. vibration. Monitoring actual wear is naturally the most reliable approach, but it often means that additional investments are needed. The paper discusses the above issues and what are the requirements that follow from these for optimising maintenance based of the use of Cyber Physical Systems.

Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) come from this motivation and refer to any virtual execution environment configured to provide a given network service. VNFs constitute a new paradigm and related dependability evaluation mechanisms are still not thoroughly defined. In this paper we propose a preliminary evaluation of an anomaly detection approach applied to VNF. Our approach uses a supervised machine learning algorithm. It notably relies on data provided by the underlying hypervisor of the VMs hosting the VNF, making it a black-box approach. Such an approach is actually well suited for infrastructure or telecommunication service providers willing to deploy tools that are easily configurable while reducing deployment costs. We validate our approach with the case study of the vIMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) implemented by the Clearwater project.

The above classification method modifies the current OAR algorithm using decision tree during the testing phase. To be specific, the K classifiers of OAR algorithm are arranged to form a decision tree in descending order and to reduce the average testing numbers of classifiers is the optimization object. Meanwhile, the threshold value of distance function is set and function value of each classifier is calculated in the sequence of decision tree. Once the function value of the i-th classifier exceeds the threshold, the testing sample will be assigned to the i-th class without any other evaluations. If none of values exceeds the threshold, the sample is classified to the class of the maximal decision function value as same as that of OAR. Theoretical analysis and experimental results both demonstrate that the presented approach performs better than traditional methods in terms of diagnosis time, diagnosis accuracy and diagnosis efficiency.

This technique monitors the concentration of various gases in transformer oil and uses it to interpret the type of fault. In this study, support vector machines (SVM) is proposed to classify and predict electrical faults in transformers depending on the key-gas ratios concentrations. A dissolved gas analysis data obtained from published papers are used as a sample for the training and test set with a supervised machine learning from MATLAB software.

While the fault occurrence rate in such systems increases, the fault tolerance techniques are becoming even more expensive and one cannot rely on them alone. Rapid emergence of embedded instrumentation as an industrial paradigm and adoption of respective IEEE 1687 standard by key players of semiconductor industry opens up new horizons in developing efficient on-line health monitoring frameworks for prognostics and fault management. The paper describes a cross-layer framework capable of handling soft and hard faults as well as the system's degradation. In addition to mitigating/correcting the faults, the system may systematically monitor, detect, localize, diagnose and classify them (manage faults). As a result of such fault management approach, the system may continue operating and degrade gracefully even in case if some of the system's resources become unusable due to intolerable faults. The main focus of this paper is however to discuss the dependability properties of the Fault Management framework itself and related infrastructure.

C	Murphree, J			IEEE	Murphree, Jerry			Machine Learning Anomaly Detection in Large Systems	2016 IEEE AUTOTESTCON PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE AUTOTESTCON	SEP 12-15, 2016	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, AESS, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc		Machine Learning; Anomaly Detection; Large Systems; Sparse Autoencoder; Neural Networks		We have a need for methods to efficiently determine the health of a system. Diagnostics and prognostics determine system heath through analysis of data from sensors. Anomalies in the data can help us determine if there is a failure or a pending failure. There are common statistical methods to detect anomalies in individual measurements. For systems with many measurements, the anomalies may occur as specific combinations of values. Large systems have various associated states and modes which define the valid measurements. The amount of data to analyze grows very quickly as the system becomes more complex. In recent years techniques have been developed to address large data analysis. Machine Learning encompasses a broad selection of tools to optimize a statistical model of the data. These tools include supervised learning techniques, such as linear regression and logistic regression, in which training data exists to tune the model. Unsupervised learning, such as clustering, is used to explore data which does not have a defined output label associated with inputs data. Standard approaches to training supervised learning systems require a large sample of positive and negative outcome data. Some uses of machine learning involve data where there are very few cases of negative outcomes. There are machine learning algorithms defined as Anomaly Detection which are designed to deal with this type of data. Simple algorithms include Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which assumes independence in distributions of data. Large Systems with anomalies defined in the dependent combinations of data require either a manual creation of combinations of independent variables, or Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which does not scale well for large systems. A further complication is the mixture of linear and discrete data. Neural Networks are a type of learning system which has been applied to each of the individual needs addressed above. This paper describes an approach to anomaly detection using neural networks for the specific problems in large systems to efficiently determine system health.

The intent of this paper is to study the effects of using principle component analysis in a vibration based fault detection process and to understand the capability of this method of maintenance. Because vibration-based maintenance practices are capable of identifying motor faults based on their respective vibration patterns, principle component analysis observed in frequency domain can be used to automate the fault detection process. To test this theory, an experiment was set up to compare health conditions of a motor and determine if their patterns could be grouped using principle component analysis. The result from this study demonstrated that the proposed method successfully identified healthy, unbalance and parallel misalignments of rotary rotor. Therefore, it is capable of detecting faults in early stages and reducing maintenance costs.

To regulate the oil level automatically it has to be determined automatically. In this paper infrared thermal imaging is used for this purpose. Several infrared thermal videos are captured of a rotating set-up using various rotation speeds, loads, oil temperatures and flow rates. These infrared thermal videos are given as input to an image processing and machine learning system that can automatically extract the relevant region of interest, features, and subsequently make a prediction regarding the oil level in the bearing. Evaluation showed that the system achieves an accuracy of 96.67 % and misclassifies only one infrared thermal video which is a recording taken during a very high rotation speed which induced unfavorable conditions for the proposed approach.

A straightforward algorithm for test-suite reduction would select elements of the test-suite randomly and remove them if and only if the reduced test-suite fulfills the same or similar coverage or mutation score. Such algorithms rely on the execution of the program and the repeated computation of coverage or mutation score. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that purely relies on a model learned from the original test-suite without requiring the execution of the program under test. The idea is to remove those tests that do not change the learned model. In order to evaluate the approach we carried out an experimental study showing that reductions of 60-99% are possible while still keeping coverage and mutation score almost the same.

Our approach is to use classification to predict where bugs are located in components. This classification is a form of automatic fault localization (AFL) at the component level. The approach only relies on historical bug reports and does not require detailed analysis of source code or detailed test runs. Our approach addresses two problems identified in user studies of AFL tools. The first problem concerns the trust in which the user can put in the results of the tool. The second problem concerns understanding how the results were computed. The proposed model quantifies the uncertainty in its predictions and all estimated model parameters. Additionally, the output of the model explains why a result was suggested. We evaluate the approach on more than 50000 bugs.

The increasing demand of wind-turbine generated power has led to the construction of larger turbines which require higher reliability guarantees in order to operate with reduced down-times and moderate repair costs. The use of advanced techniques for fault detection and isolation (FDI), and the subsequent fault tolerant control implementation in wind turbines is one of the proposed solutions to reduce losses in efficiency and ensure their continued operation. Although the implementation of FDI strategies in wind turbines have been developed greatly in the last decade, little work has been done at the wind farm level; this approach can solve the problems of detecting certain faults that have proven to be difficult to detect at the wind turbine level (e.g. those caused by mechanical wear on the internal structure of the wind turbine). This article presents the results of designing a data-driven FDI strategy for a wind turbine farm system via Weighted Support Vector Machines (W-SVM), achieving a fast and reliable way to detect faults with reduced missed detections, low number of false positive and fast enough detection rates.

It is well known that if such a high resolution is not achieved, significant leakage errors may arise and misleading diagnostic information can be obtained from the measured current spectrum. This paper presents a leakage error compensation technique that allows accurate results even when the resolution is limited by the requirement of short observation time. This technique is based on the independent knowledge of the frequencies of the relevant components in the spectrum, which only depend on the power supply frequency and on the motor rotation speed, whose measurements are often available. The proposed method is here applied to the detection of rotor bar breakages and it is tested on simulated motor current waveforms.

The method is based on a new nonlinear filtering scheme under the name Derivative-free nonlinear Kalman Filter and on statistical processing of the obtained state estimates, according to the properties of the.. 2 distribution. To apply this fault diagnosis method, first it is shown that the dynamic model of the distributed interconnected power generators is a differentially flat one. Next, by exploiting differential flatness properties a change of variables (diffeomorphism) is applied to the power system, which enables also to solve the associated state estimation ( filtering) problem. Additionally, statistical processing is performed for the obtained residuals, that is for the differences between the state vector of the monitored power system and the state vector provided by the aforementioned filter when the latter makes use of a fault-free model. It is shown, that the suitably weighted square of the residuals' vector follows the.. 2 statistical distribution. This property allows to use confidence intervals and to define thresholds that demonstrate whether the distributed power system functions as its fault-free model or whether parametric changes have taken place in it and thus a fault indication should be given. It is also shown that the proposed statistical criterion enables fault isolation to be performed, that is to find out the specific power generators within the distributed power system which have exhibited a failure. The efficiency of the proposed filtering method for condition monitoring in distributed power systems is confirmed through simulation experiments.

Especially in the case of mass production of consumer goods - e.g. automobiles, washing machines, computer - an increasing percentage of damaged products within the product fleet can lead to garage or recall actions. If the manufacturer receives knowledge about the first damage claims based on a field observation, a risk probability prognosis is the base of operations regarding further actions. State of the art concerning risk calculation methods consider the failure behaviour and allow the univariate determination of the risk probability regarding the product fleet. These methods do not consider the load or usage profile of the products based on any life span variable. In fact, current technical complex products save a lot of life data ("Big Data"), which can be additionally used for risk analysis within product fleets. This paper outlines an approach to determine the risk probability in product fleets based on a combined multivariate analysis of the product failure behaviour and the customer product usage profile. The theory and application of the approach is shown with the help of a synthetic data set within an automotive case study, which includes real effects of typical field failure behaviour and usage profiles of an automobile fleet.

The Prognostics & Health Management of fuel cell is an emerging field, which is paving the way for large scale industrial deployment of PEMFC technology. More precisely, prognostics of PEMFC become a major area of focus nowadays that enables predicting the behavior of PEMFC to produce actionable information to extend its life span. This paper contributes the first application on data-driven prognostics of PEMFC stack under variable load for combined heat and power generation (mu CHP). In brief, an ensemble structure of Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine models is proposed with a new incremental learning scheme, to achieve long-term predictions on stack state of health (SOH) and to give confidence for better decisions. The proposed prognostics model is validated on data from PEMFC stack used for a mu CHP application under variable load profile for a complete year.

The solution for this problem should be characterized by good resolution both in frequency and in time domain this is because sudden and very short lasting load changes or sudden changes of control signals dictated by technology demands, cause effects in currents, voltages, vibrations of others diagnostic signal of damage machines which are of short duration. In the time domain, these effects are similar to the effects of variations of machine parameters or variation of supply system parameters which impede or even prevent an the assessment of the machine's condition. In the frequency domain, a non-stationary signal from the machine or the inverter's transient state usually becomes fuzzy in the spectrum. The approach proposed by the authors is based on time-frequency analysis of signals with non-parametric analysis of the faults' identification. Wavelet decomposition has been used, with mother wavelet active generation and choosing the optimal level of decomposition. It has been proven that a proper selection of mother wavelet for a particular signal corresponding to a specific machine's fault increases the effectiveness of fault detection. Inappropriate choice of a mother wavelet and decomposition level results in fuzzitication of the spectrum or can cause its nonlinear deformation, which impedes or even prevents achieving a proper diagnosis.

The detection is based on load torque estimation of the investigated torque transmission system. The load torque is calculated besides the computation of other variables that are mandatory for sensorless drive operation such as rotor flux and speed. The implemented LC filter smooths the voltage inverter output voltage to a close sinusoidal shape and improves the efficiency and faultless operation time of the motor. Nevertheless, this additional elements have to be considered in the control structure whereby the control will become more complicated. The properties of an observer system will be compared with focus on disturbance detection in a torque transmission system. The tests are done on a drive system which consists of two coupled 5.5 kW squirrel cage induction motors, where one machine serves as disturbance generator of different amplitudes and frequencies. The second machine represents the investigated object with LC filter and is equipped with a disturbance detection procedure. The paper includes theoretical background as well as the experimental results of the proposed solution.

In the case of synchronous generators, specifically, out of step (OOS) protection, we show that a "hacked" relay can be made to respond exactly contrary to design, which can be disastrous to system operation. We propose a computational alternative - using the concept of Dynamic State Estimation (DSE) and inputs from Phasor Measurement Units to address this problem. Since DSE does not rely on the "settings" used in traditional relays, it can be used to independently supervise the operation of the traditional relay. The generator's dynamic states are continuously tracked and monitored using the DSE module during steady state conditions and the dynamics following a fault. We show that this approach can detect OOS conditions consistent with traditional schemes, thus supervising conventional protection and help detection of anomalous behavior from a compromised relay. Dynamic simulation results are presented on the IEEE 10 machine, 39-bus system to illustrate the proposed approach.

It has been shown that 25% of adults around the world have MetS. The main concern is that those with MetS are more likely to develop type 2 Diabetes, which is found to be the fourth leading cause of global death by disease. Other life threatening complications of MetS include cardiovascular diseases (CVD), heart attack and stroke. It has also been shown that early screening and detection of people at risk may help in preventing or delaying MetS and its further complications. Within this context, data mining and machine learning can be valuable tools for identifying those people, based on their success in diagnosis and prognosis of related diseases like type 2 Diabetes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid diversity based model for diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome. The proposed model utilizes two learning algorithms only, in particular; a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the base-level classifier and a different classification algorithm at the meta level. The choice of the meta level classifier is based on different pairwise diversity measures. This is then followed by a final voting stage. Results on real life data set for diagnosis of MetS show that the proposed model is a promising technique, which compares favorably to other well established ensemble methods, and the choice of meta classifiers based on diversity measures was beneficial in this case.

Firstly, cost of the equipment predictive maintenance model is proposed, which fully utilizes the big data technology. Particularly, the best maintenance cycle and maintenance times can be obtained exploiting the mutual game of the cost model based on the big data technology. Secondly, a novel equipment predictive maintenance method is proposed using general regression neural network, which is able to mine the relationship of data in a specific time series.

C	Liu, C; Ghosal, S; Jiang, ZH; Sarkar, S			IEEE	Liu, Chao; Ghosal, Sambuddha; Jiang, Zhanhong; Sarkar, Soumik			An unsupervised spatiotemporal graphical modeling approach to anomaly detection in distributed CPS	2016 ACM/IEEE 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (ICCPS)	ACM-IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	ACM/IEEE 7th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)	APR 11-14, 2016	Vienna, AUSTRIA	ACM, IEEE			CAUSALITY	Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions is different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validate the proposed approach.

The features are statistically processed (FP) using their central tendency (CT) estimations, prior to the classification process. Vibration data is acquired from faulty bearings, and the features are extracted to form data set. The FP algorithm deals with outliers present in the features by suppressing them. Utilization of the smoother feature distributions reduces the unwanted impact of vibration randomness and background noise in PR based fault diagnostic procedure. This significantly enhances the classification accuracy of classifiers. The results are compared with similar work in terms of maintaining an optimum classification accuracy of a diagnostic system with minimum number of features. The proposed scheme provides 93.6% classification accuracy for four bearing faults employing three features only, and even higher using additional features.	[Tahir, M.

Experimental Bearing Fault Detection, Identification, and Prognosis through Spectral Kurtosis and Envelope Spectral Analysis	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						ball bearings; fault detection; kurtosis; envelope; spectral analysis	INDUCTION-MOTORS; DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORM; MACHINES	Rolling element bearings are machinery elements that are widely used in aerospace and industrial applications to support rotating shafts, thereby reducing mechanical friction and heating. However, these components are subject to several kinds of faults which, in general, can be divided into single-point or localized and distributed faults. A common way to detect ball bearing localized or raceway faults is by identifying and analyzing the so-called characteristic bearing frequencies. This article presents an approach to bearing condition-based maintenance which comprises fault detection and identification and condition prognosis, based on spectral kurtosis and squared envelope spectral analysis of stator current. In this work, envelope spectrum analysis, based on spectral kurtosis, is applied to identify these frequencies and to evaluate its applicability as a severity estimation index. To evaluate the performance of this index, experimental tests were carried out considering bearings with outer raceway defects at different stages, simulating different fault severities. The numerical results confirm the applicability of the described methodology for detecting and identifying faults, as well as estimating the generated fault severity levels, suggesting that the proposed fault severity index can be applied for bearing monitoring in real world industrial applications.

With the world moving toward digitization, Cloud computing provides an ideal solution to manage and analyze the colossal data through big data analytics and machine learning techniques. Cloud computing, the delivery of on-demand computing resources, has applications in fields such as Education, Governance, Health care, etc. But the benefit of cloud for medical purposes, especially for heart disease prediction, is seamless. Therefore, we propose an emerging green ICT-based prognosis model for medical experts to predict heart disease status based on the historical data of patients. Naive Bayes has been selected as an effective model among various data mining algorithms applied on the heart disease dataset as it provides the highest accuracy of 86.42 %. The experimental results are further validated using Hadoop on a cloud platform which yields an accuracy of 88.89 %.

Local mean decomposition is a novel adaptive time-frequency analysis method, which is widely used in rotating machinery fault diagnosis. However, traditional LMD decomposition results method is sensitive to noise. In order to eliminate influence of noise, Hermite-LMD is introduced. Firstly, the vibration signal is decomposed by Hermite-LMD method. Then, the fault frequency of gear is found through the envelope spectrum analysis of the first PF component. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the simulation data and the practical gear fault diagnosis.

As most sewer networks consist of pipes too small for engineers to traverse, CCTV footage is used to record the interior of these pipes. This footage is manually analysed by qualified engineers, to determine the condition of the pipe and the presence of any faults. We propose a methodology, which automatically detects faults within the CCTV footage. This has the potential to dramatically reduce the time required to process the large volume of CCTV footage produced during a survey. The proposed methodology first characterises localised regions of each video frame using multiscale GIST features. Extremely randomised trees are then used to learn a classifier that distinguishes between frames showing a fault and normal frames. The technique is tested on 670 video segments from real sewer inspections of a variety of pipes, supplied by Wessex Water. Detection performance is assessed by plotting receiver operating characteristics and quantifying the area under the curve. Preliminary results indicate high detection accuracy of 88% and an area under the ROC curve of 96%. The machine learning used reduces the footage to a selection of frames containing faults, which can be quickly identified (whether by an engineer or another piece of software), showing promise for use in industrial wastewater network surveys.

On account of the non linearity and non-stationarity, the paper first does pre-process to the vibration signal using wavelet threshold de noising method and this method can bring a smooth signal. Then it decomposes the vibration signal using local mean decomposition(LMD), which is effective to the vibration signal. The LMD decomposes the signal into many PFs as the frequency from high to low. These PFs are composed of the production of envelop signal and pure frequency modulated signal. Finally, it takes most use of the kurtosis which is sensitive to the fault impact. By calculating the kurtosis of PF, it can assess the distribution of fault impact signal in every frequency band, consequently distinguishing the operating state of bearing and recognizing the fault mode according to the growth of turtosis. The experiment of actual bearing vibration signal demonstrates that the methods this paper proposed can effectively diagnose the vibration fault and has good performance.

Learning the Repair Urgency for a Decision Support System for Tunnel Maintenance	ECAI 2016: 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE	Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)	AUG 29-SEP 02, 2016	Hague, NETHERLANDS	European Assoc Artificial Intelligence, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Taylor & Francis Grp, Essence ITN Network, Vrije Univ Amsterdam				The transport network in many countries relies on extended portions which run underground in tunnels. As tunnels age, repairs are required to prevent dangerous collapses. However repairs are expensive and will affect the operational efficiency of the tunnel. We present a decision support system (DSS) based on supervised machine learning methods that learns to predict the risk factor and the resulting repair urgency in the tunnel maintenance planning of a European national rail operator. The data on which the prototype has been built consists of 47 tunnels of varying lengths. For each tunnel, periodic survey inspection data is available for multiple years, as well as other data such as the method of construction of the tunnel. Expert annotations are also available for each 10m tunnel segment for each survey as to the degree of repair urgency which are used for both training and model evaluation. We show that good predictive power can be obtained and discuss the relative merits of a number of learning methods.	[Gatsoulis, Y.; Mehmood, M. O.; Dimitrova, V. G.; Magee, D. R.; Cohn, A.

Bearing is one of the critical components in the rotating machinery. Various maintenance techniques such as breakdown maintenance, preventive maintenance are performed for the protection of a machine. Vibration analysis of bearing is the predictive maintenance technique used for fault diagnosis of the machine bearing. Fault in the bearing causes changes in the vibration of the bearing. The main objective of this project is to detect the bearing faults (outer race) in the mechanical system using the vibration signal from the bearing. The vibrational signal is sensed by a piezoelectric transducer, which is analyzed using LabVIEW software. For avoiding the difficulties in the time domain analysis, FFT is employed for a quick comparison between a healthy and defective bearing.

Abdul			CANCER PREVENTION INITIATIVE: AN INTELLIGENT APPROACH FOR THYROID CANCER TYPE DIAGNOSTICS	JURNAL TEKNOLOGI			English	Article						Image mining; FNAB; cancer diagnosis and prognosis; ensemble methods; medical support system	NODULES; SYSTEM; IMAGES	In recent, medical Image mining has witnessed to be one of the emerging fields of machine learning. Particularly; the classification problem of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) images has become a prominent challenge. Thyroid cancer must be detected as earlier as possible; a little delay would extremely be proved hazards for human health and may be resulted into the most fatal threat to human life. Infect in-depth study of physical components of cells of FNAB (Fine needle aspiration Biopsy) would help to refine the results and provide more precise decisions about the potential occurrences of cancer, this paper proposes a system, so called 'TCTD' (Thyroid Cancer Type Diagnostics), which aims to assist the doctors during their diagnostic process conducted for thyroid follicular carcinoma and its sub-types. There are five main steps of our methodology. In first step image pre-processing techniques are used. In the second step; we use ensemble methods, such as Multi-SVM to build decision model and to analyze the frequencies between the variables. In third, fourth and fifth steps, model testing, result visualization and performance evaluation are performed by using precision, recall and f-measure estimations. The measured classification accuracy of proposed system is about 98.50% using 10 K-fold cross validation.	[Ahmed, Jamil; Rehman, M.

Although the field of predictive maintenance is growing and considerable research effort has been targeted to the technical aspects of CBM, we observe that many firms in the process industry do not yet systematically use advanced CBM approaches. This research therefore aims to contribute to our understanding of the contextual barriers (beyond the technical issues) that hinder organisations from employing condition-based maintenance programs to improve their asset management.

Having a limited medical support from mission control center on space exploration missions, crew members need a personal health-tracking tool to predict and assess his/her health risks if no preventive measures are taken. This paper refines a concept employing technologies from Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) for systems, namely real-time health monitoring and condition-based health maintenance with predictive diagnostics capabilities. Mapping particular PHM-based solutions to some Human Health and Performance (HH&P) technology candidates, namely by NASA designation, the Autonomous Medical Decision technology and the Integrated Biomedical Informatics technology, this conceptual paper emphasize key points that make the concept different from that of both current conventional medicine and telemedicine including space medicine. The primary benefit of the technologies development for the HH&P domain is the ability to successfully achieve affordable human space missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond. Space missions on the International Space Station (ISS) program directly contribute to the knowledge base and advancements in the HH&P domain, thanks to continued operations on the ISS, a unique human-tended test platform and the only test bed within the space environment. The concept is to be validated on the ISS, the only "test bed" on which to prepare for future manned exploration missions. The paper authors believe that early self-diagnostic coupled with autonomous identification of proper preventive responses on negative trends are critical in order to keep astronauts healthy.

But many classification tasks involve imbalanced training examples in practice. Two novel algorithms are proposed to solve some imbalanced data classification by adapting transductive support vector machine (TSVM) and edited nearest neighbor (ENN) rules. Algorithm 1 chooses some useful test samples of positive class and adds them to the training sets. Those samples are used to add the lack of training samples. However, they may contain noisy examples. Therefore, edited nearest neighbor rule is removed the noisy examples. Algorithm 2 selects some useful testing documents of both positive class samples and negative class samples and then adds them to the training sets. Removing the noisy examples is similar to the first algorithm. Both of the two algorithms add the testing samples to maintain the balance between the minority class and the majority class. Simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

First of all, signals of original acceleration and vibration are decomposed at several levels for bearings through MRSVD (Multi-resolution Singular Value Decomposition) to extract detailed components including fault features. Subsequently, PE values are extracted from the detailed components as values of fault characteristics, in order to construct feature vectors and input them to the ELM for training and recognition. This method is used for diagnosing local faults of roller bearings in their balls, inners and outers in practices, by analyzing the experimental data, the precision of fault recognition is up to 97.5% and thus proves that this method is highly effective for diagnosing faults of the bearings.

Focusing on the shortcoming, this paper proposes a MSICA-OCSVM method that was combined with Multi-scale Independent Component Analysis (MSICA) and One-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to monitor the process. First, we can use the wavelet transform decomposition to monitor data at different scales. And then, the data was processing by threshold denoising, and was monitored on each scale extraction by using ICA independent principal component. Subsequently, we can use the wavelet transform coefficients for each scale would scale back on the reconstruction of the new signal matrix (X) over cap. Finally, new OCSVM model was constructed by the reconstructed matrix (X) over cap. We can make the use of determined hyper-plane to construct a nonlinear statistic, and the appropriate control limits was determined by using kernel density estimation. What is more, this method is applied to penicillin fermentation process simulation platform, the experimental results show that this method can effectively utilize the structure information data compared to traditional MSICA fault monitoring method, the failure rate of false positives, false negative rate was significantly reduced.

Through appropriately decomposing the obtained original vibration signals into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using EEMD, the significant IMFs can be selected in respect to the exacted features based on the energy ratio and approximate entropy. As a result, an early fault diagnosis model can be finally derived by the use of support vector machine (SVM) approach. The proposed algorithmic solution is assessed through simulation experiments and the numerical result validates that the solution can efficiently identify the early faults accurately with sufficient robustness.

But the original stochastic resonance method has several defects. For example, adjustment and settlement of its system parameters totally depend on artificial to complete, or only one system parameter has been optimized according to the change of the fault signal at the cost of ignoring the interaction between the various parameters. In order to overcome the defects the original stochastic resonance method above, an improved method based on ant colony stochastic resonance is proposed in the paper. In the improved method, various system parameters of stochastic resonance can be adaptively optimized and the signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal can be increased with help of the ant colony algorithm. In order to compare the improved stochastic resonance with the original one, the simulation experiments and practical engineering experiments had been carried out. The experiment results showed that the improved stochastic resonance method can be used to detect much weaker fault signal in the rotating machinery diagnostics.

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is introduced to filter the input signal before they are forwarded to the expert system. The RAIN is trained based on existing operational data so that it can adapt to a specific machine's configurations and conditions. The RNN is able to generate proper baseline signal even if the machine is not under the exact same condition. A fuzzy logical expert system is then used for diagnosis based on the residual signal generated by the RAW. The system is incorporated into an existing comprehensive roto-dynamics software package named LVTRC.

Materials have been developed or improved to avoid energy dispersions and new strategies have been developed in order to exploit at best renewable and non renewable energy sources. Other paths are currently followed to pursue the same goal, for instance, the introduction of innovative monitoring system and techniques. In this framework, the concept of virtual sensing reveals itself as one of the most powerful tools. Several physical quantities are relevant to define the health status of the system. Unfortunately, many of these quantities cannot be directly measured in many practical applications due to lack of specific sensor or to the environment in which the system is operating. As a consequence, state estimation techniques come out as an extremely helpful tool. These techniques allow combining the world of measurements with the one of numerical modeling leading to the estimation of the desired unmeasurable system quantities. In the current research a Kalman Filter based algorithm is applied to investigate and assess the health condition of a rotor system. The system under investigation is a classical example in rotordynamics. The attention is focused on the estimation of one of the most common malfunction in rotating machinery: the unbalance.

DEFECT DETECTION IN AN ANNULAR SWIRL-BURNER-ARRAY BY OPTICAL MEASURING EXHAUST GASES	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME TURBO EXPO: TURBINE TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION, 2016, VOL 6			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME Turbo Expo: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition	JUN 13-17, 2016	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	Int Gas Turbine Inst				Defects in combustion chambers of aircraft engines might have an impact on the reliability of the downstream turbine and the machine's performance. Detecting failures in the combustion chamber of an aircraft engine during operation may improve the resource management and the availability of the system. Aim of the ongoing research project is to find an approach to evaluate the state of the jet engine by analyzing the temperature and emissions field in the exhaust jet. This investigation is part of the collaborative research center SFB 871. The SFB 871 deals with the improvement of the regeneration process of complex capital goods such as aircraft engines. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul processes would be more efficient if the internal status of the engine would be known while still on the wing before it is disassembled. The feasibility of this approach is investigated for a pilot scaled model combustor, which provides optical access and allows the selection of "defined errors" in the combustor. It consists of an atmospheric tubular combustor with an array of eight premixed swirl burners with a maximum output of 160 kW The operating conditions of one of the eight burners concerning power and air-fuel ratio, can be controlled. A power distribution between the burners is typical fault in an aircraft combustor and will be investigated in this study. It is observed that it is possible to determine small deviations by measuring density profiles applying a tomographic background-oriented schlieren (BOS) technique behind the combustor Additionally, particle image velocimehy is used to measure differences in the velocity field of the exhaust gases. This study shows that a minimum power deviation of one burner in an array of a total of eight burners is detectable in the exhaust plane with the above mentioned measurement techniques.

They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and environment.

Organisations have adapted a proactive approach to maintenance by incorporating predictive maintenance and condition monitoring techniques. Machinery and equipment are required to operate non-stop for organisations to achieve maximum capabilities. Recent advanced analytical instrumentation for the maintenance of machinery has become more compact and portable and has been developed to maintain the harsh continuous cycling of machinery. This research explores if one of these latest and sophisticated analytical instruments developed, namely, a portable Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) oil analysis instrument, can be successfully incorporated into a predictive maintenance program. The research examines if maintenance personnel can use the results from such analysis to successfully identify maintenance actions within a maintenance program. A case study on how maintenance personnel perform when analyzing used engine oils was carried out. Post training interviews established that experienced maintenance personnel struggled to identify a maintenance action from the results of the portable instrument. Hence, further training was created and performed to overcome these difficulties. Therefore, this research has shown there is a deficiency in maintenance training regimes.

This trend allows the collection of machine operation data in the shop floor, in order to interact with cyberspace computers through a communication network, therefore enabling the Cyber Physical System concept (CPS). Furthermore, the rapid advances of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provide means to analyze Big Data, more quickly, autonomously, ubiquitously and in real time, offering information that assist in more efficient decision making in manufacturing processes. Nowadays, Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) leverages researches in the new generation of manufacturing. For this, an architecture called 5Cs, that directs the PHM implementation in CPS context is being adopted with expressive results, which allows the application of several math and/or Artificial Intelligence techniques to estimate the assets' remaining useful life. In particular, the use of Experts Systems and semantic information modeling can make it possible to represent knowledge found in the scientific literature and consolidated standards about the subject. This paper uses methodology of ontology development 101, which guides management, development and documenting of a formal taxonomy of failure prognostics.

Based on it, the traditional mapping type of extreme learning machine (ELM) has been changed and the eigenvectors extracted from signal processing methods are directly regarded as outputs of the network's hidden layer. Then the uncertainty that training data transformed from the input space to the ELM feature space with the ELM mapping and problem of the selection of the hidden nodes are avoided effectively.

J	Lu, N; Zhang, GT; Cheng, YC; Chen, DY				Lu, Na; Zhang, Guangtao; Cheng, Yuanchu; Chen, Diyi			Signal Denoising Method Based on Adaptive Redundant Second-Generation Wavelet for Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; ELEMENT; TRANSFORM	Vibration signal of rotating machinery is often submerged in a large amount of noise, leading to the decrease of fault diagnosis accuracy. In order to improve the denoising effect of the vibration signal, an adaptive redundant second-generation wavelet (ARSGW) denoising method is proposed. In this method, a new index for denoising result evaluation (IDRE) is constructed first. Then, the maximum value of IDRE and the genetic algorithm are taken as the optimization objective and the optimization algorithm, respectively, to search for the optimal parameters of the ARSGW. The obtained optimal redundant second-generation wavelet (RSGW) is used for vibration signal denoising. After that, features are extracted from the denoised signal and then input into the support vector machine method for fault recognition. The application result indicates that the proposed ARSGW denoising method can effectively improve the accuracy of rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

Therefore, this paper proposes a spectrum correction based BSS algorithm. Through the incorporation of FFT, spectrumcorrection, a screen procedure (consisting of frequency merging, candidate pattern selection, and single-source-component recognition), modified kappa-means based source number estimation, and mixing matrix estimation, the proposed BSS algorithm can accurately achieve harmonics sensing on field rotating machinery faults in case of short-sampled observations. Both numerical simulation and practical experiment verify the proposed BSS algorithm's superiority in the recovery quality, stability to insufficient samples, and efficiency over the existing ICA-based methods. Besides rotating machinery fault diagnosis, the proposed BSS algorithm also possesses a vast potential in other harmonics-related application fields.

J	Luo, SR; Cheng, JS; Wei, KX				Luo, Songrong; Cheng, Junsheng; Wei, Kexiang			A Fault Diagnosis Model Based on LCD-SVD-ANN-MIV and VPMCD for Rotating Machinery	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SPECTRUM; DECOMPOSITION; TREE; EMD	The fault diagnosis process is essentially a class discrimination problem. However, traditional class discrimination methods such as SVM and ANN fail to capitalize the interactions among the feature variables. Variable predictive model-based class discrimination (VPMCD) can adequately use the interactions. But the feature extraction and selection will greatly affect the accuracy and stability of VPMCD classifier. Aiming at the nonstationary characteristics of vibration signal from rotating machinery with local fault, singular value decomposition (SVD) technique based local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) was developed to extract the feature variables. Subsequently, combining artificial neural net (ANN) and mean impact value (MIV), ANN-MIV as a kind of feature selection approach was proposed to select more suitable feature variables as input vector of VPMCD classifier. In the end of this paper, a novel fault diagnosis model based on LCD-SVD-ANN-MIV and VPMCD is proposed and proved by an experimental application for roller bearing fault diagnosis.

Vestas V90-3MW Wind Turbine Gearbox Health Assessment Using a Vibration-Based Condition Monitoring System	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FAULT-DETECTION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; EMISSION; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNALS	Reliable monitoring for the early fault diagnosis of gearbox faults is of great concern for the wind industry. This paper presents a novel approach for health condition monitoring (CM) and fault diagnosis in wind turbine gearboxes using vibration analysis. This methodology is based on a machine learning algorithm that generates a baseline for the identification of deviations from the normal operation conditions of the turbine and the intrinsic characteristic-scale decomposition (ICD) method for fault type recognition. Outliers picked up during the baseline stage are decomposed by the ICD method to obtain the product components which reveal the fault information. The new methodology proposed for gear and bearing defect identification was validated by laboratory and field trials, comparing well with the methods reviewed in the literature.

J	Wang, Y; Cheng, YJ				Wang, Yang; Cheng, Yujie			An Approach to Fault Diagnosis for Gearbox Based on Image Processing	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FEATURES	The gearbox is one of the most important parts of mechanical equipment and plays a significant role in many industrial applications. A fault diagnostic of rotating machinery has attracted attention for its significance in preventing catastrophic accidents and beneficially guaranteeing sufficient maintenance. In recent years, fault diagnosis has developed in the direction of multidisciplinary integration. This work addresses a fault diagnosis method based on an image processing method for a gearbox, which overcomes the limitations of manual feature selection. Differing from the analysis method in a one-dimensional space, the computing method in the field of image processing in a 2-dimensional space is applied to accomplish autoextraction and fault diagnosis of a gearbox. The image-processing-based diagnostic flow consists of the following steps: first, the vibration signal after noise reduction by wavelet denoising and signal demodulation by Hilbert transform is transformed into an image by bispectrum analysis. Then, speeded up robustness feature (SURF) is applied to automatically extract the image feature points of the bispectrum contour map, and the feature dimension is reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, an extreme learning machine ( ELM) is introduced to identify the fault types of the gearbox. From the experimental results, the proposed method appears to be able to accurately diagnose and identify different types of faults of the gearbox.

Considering the nonlinear characteristics of hydraulic-pump vibration signals and the mode mixing problem of the original Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method, first, we use the Complete Ensemble EMD (CEEMD) method to decompose the signals. Second, the time-frequency analysis methods, which include the Short-Time Fourier Transform(STFT) and time-frequency entropy calculation, are applied to realize the robust feature extraction. Third, the multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is introduced to automatically classify the fault mode in this paper. An actual hydraulic-pump experiment demonstrates the procedure with a complete feature extraction and accurate mode classification.

Variations in the values of these metrics are often thought to be indicative of the presence of a developing fault. However, it may also be observed that often these parameters are also dependent on the operating conditions of the machine. This paper proposes a method for the assessment of the technical condition of powertrain components taking into consideration changes to system loading and rotational speed. The method allows diagnostic parameters to be determined which are independent of the speed or the loading of the power train. This decoupling allows robust condition indicators, independent of operating state, to be determined. The method proposed is based on the order analysis of vibroacoustic signals, properly scaled in terms of amplitude for the loading and rotational speed. A diagnostics experiment was carried out using a laboratory test facility comprised of a motor, a parallel shaft gearbox and a worm gear. Shaft misalignment was simulated for various components at various rotational speeds of the input shaft and different system load conditions.

Reliable degradation assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation make sense on both aviation safety and rational maintenance decisions. This paper proposes a data-driven prognostic method on the premise of run-to-failure (RtF) data which are multivariate sensory data collected from the engines operating from normal to failure. After necessary pre-processing to the data, clustering analysis is executed to generate the clusters which represent the multi-states of the degradation process. The failure state cluster is extracted, and then the distance between the pre-processed data and the cluster is calculated. Therefore, one-dimensional time series are generated and defined as the health indices. Afterwards the degradation models are built based on the health indices. Finally, the RUL of a testing unit can be estimated by similarity analysis with the models. Hierarchical clustering (HC) and relevance vector machine (RVM) are the main algorithms employed in this paper. To validate the proposition, a case study is performed on turbofan engines data from Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) at NASA Ames Research Center, and sufficient comparisons were given.

For that purpose, the physics-based modelling of these machine elements is an interesting method The use of rolling element bearings is extended to many fields, what implies a variety of the configurations that they can take regarding the kind of rolling elements, the internal configuration and the number of rows. Moreover, the differences of the applications make rolling element bearings to take different sizes and to be operating at different conditions regarding both speed and loads. In this work, a methodology to create a physics-based mathematical model to reproduce the dynamics of multiple kinds of rolling element bearings is presented. Following a multi-body modelling, the proposed strategy takes advantage of the reusability of models to cover a wide range of bearing configurations, as well as to generalise the dimensioning of the bearing and the application of the operating conditions. Simulations of two bearing configurations are presented in this paper, analysing their dynamic response as well as analysing the effects of damage in their parts. Results of the two case studies show good agreement with experimental data and results of other models in literature.

There is limited research of space information network, especially in fault diagnosis domain. This paper gives expectation about future SIN features, and based on these features proposes a fault self-diagnosis algorithm based on finite-state machine. We design a series of novel fault detectors through which multiple satellites nodes can cooperate with each other in a diagnosis task. The fault detectors encode the diagnosis process to state transitions. Each satellites can participate in the fault diagnosis by transiting the detector's current state to a new one based on local evidence and then pass the fault detector to other satellites.

Mechanical faults, usages, or electrical faults, can be detected through noises and/or vibrations which have different amplitude and frequency against the normal sound of the induction motor. Different vibration transducers can be used for noise and vibration measurements with fault detection purpose. The conditioning circuit of the vibration transducers can be resistive type also and in this case the vibration is converted into a variation of resistance (strain gauges). From resistance variation of the strain gauges a voltage variation can be obtained with proper conditioning circuit. This voltage is measured and analyzed to obtain the vibration components. The amplitude and frequency of the vibration are changing when the functioning conditions of the machine are changing. It is important to determine the harmonic spectra of the vibration for different faults and to compare with the spectra corresponding to the normal functioning of the electrical motor. Two virtual instruments were developed in LabView and LabWindows/CVI to measure and analyze the vibration. Using the virtual instruments the acquired signal was analyzed and the vibration characteristics and spectra were studied in different cases. It is shown through simulations and measurements for a small electrical motor that the weak base influences the amplitude of frequency components of the harmonics spectra. (C) 2016 The Authors.

While many methods have been developed for a wide range of systems, relatively little research has examined the potential benefits of concepts from reliability engineering such as fault-tolerance. This paper applies majority fault tolerance to improve the accuracy of classifications made by machine learning algorithms. Support vector machine, artificial neural network, and naive Bayes algorithms are applied to a single data set. The reliability and correlations between the individual classifiers are analyzed. Our results suggest that fault-tolerance can improve the accuracy of classification, but that correlation between the individual algorithms can lower the overall effectiveness of the approach. Thus, detailed assessment of alternative algorithms will be necessary before the full potential of fault tolerant classification can be achieved.

The methodology estimates the remaining useful life (RUL) of a system by using a pattern-based machine learning and knowledge discovery approach called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). The LAD approach is based on the exploration of the monitored system's database, and the extraction of useful information which describe the physics that characterize its degradation. The diagnostic information, which is updated each time the new data is gathered, is combined with a non-parametric reliability estimation method, in order to predict the RUL of a monitored system working under different operating conditions. In this paper, the developed methodology is compared to a known CBM prognostic technique; the Cox proportional hazards model (PHM). The methodology has been tested and validated based on the Friedman statistical test. The results of the test indicate that the proposed methodology provides an accurate RUL prediction.

It aims to ensure the proper functioning of an equipment. It no longer has the sole objective to repair a system but also to anticipate and prevent its failures. Recently, new failure prediction techniques have emerged. They provide information on the real-time condition of equipment and its remaining useful life (RUL). Thus, new methods of decision-making based on the analysis of these recent developments can be considered. Indeed, this paper presents a heuristic method for solving the makespan and the cost of a resumable job shop problem while predicting and preventing failures. It is based on the elimination of duplication that may exist between the different operations at a given point in time, while selecting a single operation and shifting the others at the end of the execution thereof. The best selection of the operation to assign on the machine depends on the effectiveness of the decision rule used for scheduling. The proposed method has been successfully tested on sonic experimental benchmarks and it allows a satisfactory resolution of relatively important problem in a reasonable time.

Through the application of advanced sensor technologies, more detailed information about manufacturing plants is obtained. Although evaluation and improvement have been made on individual machine performance based on sensor data, there is still no data-driven system model for the identification of system inefficiencies and process optimization. In this paper, we build a mathematic model based on sensor data to describe the production dynamics Furthermore, a systematic methodology is further de eloped to perform real-time diagnosis and prognosis on permanent production loss and conduct analysis on system robustness to disruption events, which can enhance overall system efficiency by increasing System responsiveness.

Controller area network (CAN) has been widely adopted due to its electrical robustness, low price and deterministic access delay. However, there are numerous factors that can sabotage the reliability of networks. The fault at intermittent connection (IC) of the network cable is one of the major issues. When multiple IC faults occur in the network, especially on the trunk cable, the troubleshooting for these IC faults becomes very difficult. IC problems may result in delayed or deceptive information of machines and production status which can severely impede manufacturing; normal operation. To improve the network reliability and communication quality, a novel data-driven fault detection methodology is developed in this paper, which can locate multiple IC faults in the network. By analyzing IC induced network errors, the characteristics of error frames can be captured. The information extracted from the error frames is utilized to filter the network error and facilitate a two-level procedure to identify the IC faults. Case studies are performed to demonstrate the proposed method. This research provides a multiple IC faults location method which is accurate and easy to implement.

For this reason, predictive maintenance Lee must be properly integrated in the production scheduling in order to take into account the wear and tear of the equipment to prevent it from die failure risk. In this context, we investigate the problem of a single multifunctional machine subjected to predictive maintenance based on Prognostic Health Management (PHM). We propose a new interpretation of PHM outputs to define the machine degradation corresponding to the processing of every task. We design a genetic algorithm that we called IPro-GA with the objective of minimizing the total interventions cost. Computational results show the efficiency of our scheme with an average deviation of about 0.1% over a lower bound. (C) 2016, IFAC (International of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

FDCA of an induction motor (IM) can increase its operational life and efficiency. In this paper, FDCA of induction motors is done on the basis of available dataset. Induction motors external faults are online controlled by LVQ i.e. vector quantization by learning & then the comparison is done with MLP neural network, which states that the fault identification by LVQ is better & less time consuming than MLP. For the diagnosis of external faults & normal condition in induction motor's RMS voltages and RMS currents have been used as input variables for the proposed algorithm. In this paper, LVQ model is used to investigate seven states of IM under different operating conditions with the help of 160 testing samples. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

CVD may lead to heart attacks and strokes and most of these are caused by atherosclerosis; this is a medical condition in which the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to an excessive build-up of plaque on the inner artery wall. Arterial calcification and, in particular, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is a manifestation of atherosclerosis and a prognostic indicator of CVD. In this paper, a two-stage automatic method to detect and quantify the severity of AAC is described; it is based on the analysis of lateral vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) images. These images were obtained on a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner used in single energy mode. First, an active appearance model was used to segment the lumbar vertebrae L1-L4 and the aorta on VFA images; the segmentation of the aorta was based on its position with respect to the vertebrae. In the second stage, feature vectors representing calcified regions in the aorta were extracted to quantify the severity of AAC. The presence and severity of AAC was also determined using an established visual scoring system (AC24). The abdominal aorta was divided into four parts immediately anterior to each vertebra, and the severity of calcification in the anterior and posterior walls was graded separately for each part on a 0-3 scale. The results were summed to give a composite severity score ranging from 0 to 24. This severity score was classified as follows: mild AAC (score 0-4), moderate AAC (score 5-12) and severe AAC (score 12-24). Two classification algorithms (k-nearest neighbour and support vector machine) were trained and tested to assign the automatically extracted feature vectors into the three classes. There was good agreement between the automatic and visual AC24 methods and the accuracy of the automated technique relative to visual classification indicated that it is capable of identifying and quantifying AAC over a range of severity.

In this study, we address the application of the CHB-nL converter as a single-phase active filter. The OCFs are modeled as additive signals into the subsystems describing the dynamics of each H-bridge in the converter. For diagnosis purposes, a bank of nonlinear proportional-integral (PI) observers are suggested to estimate the OCF profiles, independently of the operating point of the converter. Based on the estimated components, fault detection, isolation and reconfiguration is achieved. Furthermore, no additional sensors are needed to carry out the diagnosis media besides the ones used for control purposes. To validate the ideas proposed in this work, an experimental evaluation is carried out for a single OCF condition. The experimental results are used to confirm that the current tracking, voltage regulation and balance objectives can be obtained despite of OCFs in the active filter and highly distorted load currents.

Maintaining a good control of the disease is critical to avoid not only severe long-term complications but also dangerous short-term situations. Diabetics need to decide the appropriate insulin injection, thus they need to be able to estimate the level of glucose they are going to have after a meal. In this paper we use machine learning techniques for predicting glycemia in diabetic patients. The algorithms utilize data collected from real patients by a continuous glucose monitoring system, the estimated number of carbohydrates, and insulin administration for each meal. We compare (1) non-linear regression with fixed model structure, (2) identification of prognosis models by symbolic regression using genetic programming, (3) prognosis by k-nearest-neighbor time series search, and (4) identification of prediction models by grammatical evolution. We consider predictions horizons of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes.

These systems can store tremendous amounts of data on buildings' performance and energy usage. A significant amount of data on buildings' mechanical devices, particularly electricity-consumption data, is now available for analysis. However, the quality of the collected data is questionable. Some data are mislabeled, and others contain gaps and errors. In this article, a methodology based on a correlation coefficient and a wavelet-based support vector machine predictor is proposed to detect and recover the proportional deviation data faults and faults caused by network communication. After testing this methodology with electricity data collected from a large commercial building, it is found that a high accuracy of faulty data alerts and automated data recovery can be achieved.

Aerospace-Electronics Reliability-Assurance (AERA): Three-Step Prognostics-and-Health-Monitoring (PHM) Modeling Approach	2016 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THERMAL, MECHANICAL AND MULTI-PHYSICS SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTS IN MICROELECTRONICS AND MICROSYSTEMS (EUROSIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Thermal, Mechanical and Multi-Physics Simulation and Experiments in Microelectronics and Microsystems (EuroSimE)	APR 18-20, 2016	Montpellier, FRANCE					When encountering a particular reliability problem at the design, fabrication, testing, or an operation stage of an electronics product's life, and considering the use of predictive modeling to assess the seriousness and possible consequences of its detected malfunction and likely failure, one has to choose whether a statistical, or a physics-of failure -based, or a suitable combination of these two major predictive modeling tools should be employed to address the problem and to decide on how to proceed. An effective aerospace-electronics reliability-assurance (AERA) approach is suggested as a possible way to go in such a situation. In this approach the classical statistical Bayes formula (BF) is used at the first step as a technical diagnostics (TD) tool, with an objective to identify, on the probabilistic basis, the faulty (malfunctioning) device(s) from the obtained prognostics-and-health-monitoring (PHM) signals ("symptoms of faults"). The physics-of failure -based Boltzmann-Arrhenius-Zhurkov's (BAZ) equation, a powerful, flexible and physically meaningful modeling tool suggested about five years ago can be employed at the second step with an objective is to assess the remaining useful life (RUL) of the malfunctioning device(s). If the predicted RUL is still long enough, no action might be needed, but if not, a corrective (restoration) action becomes necessary. It is shown in this connection how short/long the repair time should/could be, so that the availability of the equipment (the probability that it is sound and available to the user when needed) does not fall below the allowable level. In any event, after the first two steps of the AERA modeling effort are carried out, and the assessed probability of the product's continuing operation is found to be satisfactory, the device is put back into operation (testing). If failure nonetheless occurs, the third AERA step should be undertaken to update reliability. A well-known four-parametric statistical beta-distribution (BD), in which the probability of failure is treated as a random variable, can be used at this step. The general AERA concept is illustrated by a detailed numerical example geared to an en-route flight mission. The approach can be used, however, also beyond the aerospace field in other vehicular technologies: maritime, automotive, railroad, etc.	[Suhir, E.] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Suhir, E.] Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria; [Suhir, E.] Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel; [Suhir, E.] ERS Co, 727 Alvina Ct, Los Altos, CA 94024 USA		Suhir, E (corresponding author), Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA.; Suhir, E (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Technol, Vienna, Austria.; Suhir, E (corresponding author), Ariel Univ, Ariel, Israel.; Suhir, E (corresponding author), ERS Co, 727 Alvina Ct, Los Altos, CA 94024 USA.	suhire@aol.com					Abramowitz M, 1966, HDB MATH FUNCTIONS F; Amin S, 2009, REV ADV MAT SCI, P21; [Anonymous], 701 COND DC POW SUPP; [Anonymous], 1998, MILHDBK338B; Arrhenius S., 1896, P ROYAL SWEDISH ACAD, V22; Bayes T., PHILOS T ROYAL SOC L, V53, P1763; Beckman R.J., 1978, J STAT COMPUTATION S, V7; Bensoussan A, 2013, AEROSP CONF PROC; Bernardo J.M., 1994, BAYESIAN THEORY; Blasch E, 2012, ARTECH HSE INTEL INF, P1; Boltzmann L., 1886, COMMUNICATION; Bonissone P., 2007, UNCERTAINTY INTELLIG; Bonissone P., 2006, IPMU 2006 IND SESS J; Bonissone P., 2007, AAAI FALL S ART INT; Bonissone P., 2008, P FLINS 2008 MADR SP; Casewell G., 2014, 2014 AER C BIG SKY M; Crowe  Dana, 2001, ELECT HDB SERIES, V2001; Czilos H., 2013, HDB TECHNICAL DIAGNO; Daigle M., 2012, ANN C PHM SOC SEPT; Das S, 2008, ARTECH HSE ELEC WARF, P1; Daston L., 1988, CLASSICAL PROBABILIT; EDWARDS AWF, 1986, AM STAT, V40, P109, DOI 10.2307/2684867; Fienberg S.E., 2006, DID BAYESIAN INFEREN; Goebel K., 2013, P 15 NOND APPR C COL; Goebel K., 2013, P 2013 AIAA INF AER; GU J, 2007, MICROELECTRONICS REL, V47; GU J, 2007, 53 ANN REL MAINT S R; Jaynes E, 1986, MAXIMUM ENTROPY BAYE; Lall P., 2005, 55 IEEE EL COMP TECH; Lall P., 2006, IEEE CPMT T, V29; Landzberg A.H., 1993, MICROELECTRONICS MAN; McGrayne SB, 2011, THEORY WOULD NOT DIE; Mishra S., 2002, EUR MICR PACK INT S; Mitchell H.

The Influence of Feature Vector on the Classification of Mechanical Faults using Neural Networks	2016 IEEE 7TH LATIN AMERICAN SYMPOSIUM ON CIRCUITS & SYSTEMS (LASCAS)	IEEE Latin American Symposium on Circuits and Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE Latin American Symposium on Circuits and Systems (LASCAS)	FEB 28-MAR 02, 2016	Florianopolis, BRAZIL	IEEE, Univ Fed Santa Catarina, MentorGraphics, Creat Solut, Macnica DHW, Synopsys, imec		Rotating machine; pattern classification; fault diagnosis; feature extraction	DIAGNOSTICS	This paper investigates the problem of automatic detection of rotating-machine faults based on vibration signals acquired during machine operation. In particular, two new signal features, namely the kurtosis and entropy, are considered along with main spectral peaks to discriminate between several machine conditions: normal operation, (vertical and horizontal) misalignment, unbalanced load and bearing faults. Moreover, the inclusion of one set of three accelerometers for each roller bearing associated to the system acquiring more vibration signals also affects the generation of feature vector and is part of our proposal. In order to evaluate the rotating machine fault classification, a database of 1951 fault scenarios with several different fault intensities and rotating frequencies was designed and recorded, taking into consideration the specificities of the proposed machine learning task. The artificial neural networks recognition system employed in this work reached 95.8% of overall accuracy, showing the efficiency of the proposed approach.

Time-frequency analysis is capable of revealing time as well as frequency information simultaneously on time-frequency spectrum. However, conventional linear time-frequency analysis methods are subject to Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and bilinear representations suffer from cross term interferences. Hilbert transform is capable of accurately estimating the instantaneous frequency of nonstationary signals, yet it requires the analyzed signal to be mono-component. In this paper an improved version of generalized demodulation, i.e., iterative generalized demodulation is used to decompose multi-component nonstationary signals into monocomponents. Hence time-frequency spectrum based on iterative generalized demodulation, which is of fine time-frequency resolution and free from cross term interferences, is achieved. Both numerical simulated and lab experimental gearbox vibration signals are analyzed, and gear fault is successfully diagnosed.

In this context, a novel health monitoring method based on a two-class model and nonlinear manifold learning is proposed to assess bearing performance degradation timely and reliably. This method does not need much historical operation information and can enhance the practicability in real industrial application. The two-class model is constructed by involving healthy data and monitored data together. The manifold learning is then implemented to extract the sensitive features for good class separable measure. According to within-class and between-class scatter measure, a discriminant factor is introduced to assess the distribution of the monitoring data as compared to the healthy data, which can reflect the bearing performance degradation. In the experiments for monitoring bearings in full cycle life, the proposed health indicator has provided a much more accurate degradation path and rather monotonic profile as compared to other classical indicators. Results indicate the potential of the proposed two-class model as an effective method for bearing health monitoring.

But its performance is low as incipient feature extraction and fault diagnosis of REB as noise has greatly effect on the classification accuracy. How to effectively improve the signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) is important for characteristic frequency(CF) determination based on FK. In this research, the SNR can be improved by using particle filter(PF) to be satisfied with noise interference. It can be useful for the improvement of FK after de-noise. Firstly, state space function for the analyzing signal is constructed, background noise of origin signal can be extracted by using the PF and improve the SNR. Then, the optimal band is chosen by using FK after PF preprocessing. In the end, fault CF can be obtained by using spectrum analysis. Simulation and monitored vibration signals for REB are used to verify the effectiveness of this method. It can be concluded that the proposed method has better performance compared with that of FK and EMD-Kurtogram on REB fault early classification.	[Li, H.

Such processes would consume plenty of human labor, especially when dealing with massive vibration signals. So it is interesting to automatically extract features using machine learning techniques, instead of manually extracting them. To deal with the problem, this paper presents a new automatic feature extraction method of machines. The proposed method first learns features from the vibration signals by K-means, and then maps the learned features into a salient low-dimensional feature space using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Through the feature extraction results of a bearing dataset, it is verified that the proposed method is able to effectively learn the features from the raw vibration signals and is superior to the manual features like time-domain features and wavelet features. Therefore, the proposed method has potential to be a tool in the automatic data mining of intelligent fault diagnosis.

Firstly, the vibration signals and stator current signals are obtained and analyzed. The energy features at several characteristic frequencies related to motor faults from each type of signal are extracted and used as input to corresponding random forest classifier. Then clustering analysis is applied to both testing and training samples to determine the weight of each classifier for decision making on diagnostic result.

Therefore, this paper describes and analyzes a novel tight frame learning scheme for machine fault diagnosis. The objective cost is evolved by integrating the tight frame constraint into the popular dictionary learning model. The resulting tight frame design strategy thus could be formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which can be solved by alternatively implementing hard thresholding operation and singular value decomposition. Then, fault information is sparsely represented over the learned dictionary and could be effectively detected through sparse pursuit techniques. Compared with the state of the art analytic wavelet tight frame, the proposed algorithm has two main advantages: firstly, the tight frame filters are directly learned from the noisy signals and thus the sparse intrinsic structures of feature information could be profoundly captured. Secondly, sparse level of representation coefficients is promoted largely and the process of extracting fault feature information is highly adaptive. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated through numerical experiments and its superiority with respect to the analytic wavelet tight frame is further demonstrated through performing the diagnosis of an engineering gearbox.

However, different feature extraction methods may lead to different diagnostic results. It increases the difficulty in feature selection as well as the diagnostic uncertainty. A deep belief network (DBN), composed of multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), is one of the typical deep learning methods, which can obtain more abstract concepts through layer-wise feature learning to discover the data structure. Therefore, a DBN-based fault soft-max classifier was constructed. Bearing experiments were conducted, and the proposed scheme was applied for bearing fault classification.

This paper presents a novel method for radial vibration measurement through electrostatic sensing and HHT (Hilbert-Huang Transform) signal processing. The foundational characteristics of the electrostatic sensor in the vicinity of a drifting shaft are studied through Finite Element Modelling. Experimental tests were conducted on a purpose-built test rig to characterize the operating condition of the rotor at different rotational speeds (400 rpm and 600 rpm). A normal working shaft and an eccentric shaft were tested and the output signals from the electrostatic sensors were analyzed. Through empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on the electrostatic signals, the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) including the vibration information of the shaft are identified and further analyzed in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results suggest that the electrostatic sensing technique in conjunction with HHT provides a simple and cost-effective approach to radial vibration measurement of rotary shafts.

Its idea is to count the obtained signal's distribution in all intervals and transform them to statistical features. This idea differs from the conventional time and frequency domain methods and offers promising advantages, e.g., no need to select parameters and less calculation, over the conventional ones. To cope with the accompanied high dimensional problem, we apply the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method for projecting statistical features to 2D or 3D space, which is feasible for visualization with the purpose of fault diagnosis. Other dimensionality reduction method, principle component analysis (PCA), is took into comparison in order for demonstrating the advantages of the proposed method. The visualization results of motor bearing data & hard disk drive (HDD) data prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the relationship between visualization results and condition monitoring is established and a modification for LDA based on original criterion function is given.

In proposed algorithm, samples of fault current signals are used for fault diagnosis and wavelets transform (WT) applied for feature extraction from the signals. The faulty current signals are decomposed using Db5 mother wavelet. Features of faulty signals are extracted in terms of norm entropy value of the wavelet coefficients. Those extracted features have been fed to PNN (Probabilistic neural network) for classification of faults category. The accuracy and practicability of the proposed algorithm has been assessed on a 400 KV, 300 km series compensated network for all types of faults using MATLAB simulation. The results acquired, suggested that the proposed approach is creditable and have good accuracy in classifying the faults in compensated transmission network.	[Singh, Sunil; Vishwakarma, D.

Thus typical applications include electric utilities, ships, helicopters, and many other industrial applications. Monitoring the condition of large gearboxes in industries has attracted increasing interest in the recent years owing to the need for decreasing the downtime on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures. This paper addresses the development of a condition monitoring procedure for a gear transmission system using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). Seven conditions of the gear were investigated: healthy gear and gear with six stages of depthwise wear simulated on the gear tooth. The features extracted from the measured vibration and sound signals were mean, root mean square (rms), variance, skewness, and kurtosis, which are known to be sensitive to different degrees of faults in rotating machine elements. These characteristics were used as an input features to ANN and SVM. The results show that the multilayer feed forward neural network and multiclass support vector machines can be effectively used in the diagnosis of various gear faults.

The application of condition monitoring techniques to entire petrochemical process plants, however, remains lacking. This Can he ascribed to the significant complexity involved in applying; existing techniques to such plants. In this work a novel energy-based fault detection scheme is applied to an autothermal reformer of a gas-to liquids process. The performance of the technique is evaluated, against a set of representative faults, and it is shown to provide adequate fault detection performance. The use of the energy based detection scheme shows promise in terms of reduced modelling efforts and increased computational efficiency.

For online prognosis, the fault degradation process should be well revealed. To well capture the evolution process, the proposed approach includes three components, First, the stability factor is defined to identify those significant faulty variables that show degradation process. Second, the fault variations departing from normal status are extracted by performing a modified Fisher discriminant analysis (MFDA) on the selected variables in normal and fault data. These critical variations are deemed to be evolving with time and thus responsible to the future process failure. Third, the significant variations arc captured to track the fault evolution process for fault prognosis by developing a vector auto-regression model to reveal how soon the process failure will happen. By the above modeling strategy, uninformative fault effects that do not present degradation arc excluded so that the true fault degradation process can be focused on for online fault prognosis. The proposed method is verified by both numerical and experimental data. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, C.

First, the vibration signal was decomposed by ELCD; then a series of intrinsic scale components (ISCs) were obtained. Second, according to the kurtosis of ISCs, principal ISCs were selected and then the permutation entropy of principal ISCs was calculated and they were combined into a feature vector. Finally, the feature vectors were input in RVM classifier to train and test and identify the type of rolling bearing faults. Experimental results show that this method can effectively diagnose four kinds of working condition, and the effect is better than local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) method.

Probabilistic Error Models for Machine Learning Kernels Implemented on Stochastic Nanoscale Fabrics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 DESIGN, AUTOMATION & TEST IN EUROPE CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION (DATE)	Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition		English	Proceedings Paper	Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition (DATE)	MAR 14-18, 2016	Dresden, GERMANY	Tech Univ Dresden, Cisco, DREWAG, Univ Frankfurt Main, Aeneas, imec, OFFIS, Penta, Systematic, Synopsys, Mentor Graph, XFAB, MathWorks, Imagination				Presented in this paper are probabilistic error models for machine learning kernels implemented on low-SNR circuit fabrics where errors arise due to voltage overscaling (VOS), process variations, or defects. Four different variants of the additive error model are proposed that describe the error probability mass function (PMF): additive over Reals Error Model with independent Bernoulli RVs (REM-i), additive over Reals Error Model with joint Bernoulli random variables (RVs) (REM-j), additive over Galois field Error Model with independent Bernoulli RVs (GEM-i), and additive over Galois field Error Model with joint Bernoulli RVs (GEM-j). Analytical expressions for the error PMF is derived. Kernel level model validation is accomplished by comparing the Jensen-Shannon divergence D-JS between the modeled PMF and the PMFs obtained via HDL simulations in a commercial 45nm CMOS process of MAC units used in a 2nd order polynomial support vector machine (SVM) to classify data from the UCI machine learning repository. Results indicate that at the MAC unit level, D-JS for the GEM-j models are 1-to-2-orders-of-magnitude lower (better) than the REM models for VOS and process variation errors. However, when considering errors due to defects, D-JS for REM-j is between 1-to-2-orders-of-magnitude lower than the others. Performance prediction of the SVM using these models indicate that when compared with Monte Carlo with HDL generated error statistics, probability of detection p(det) estimated using GEM-j is within 3% for VOS error when the error rate p eta <= 80%, and within 5% for process variation error when supply voltage V-dd is between 0.3V and 0.7V. In addition, p(det) using REM-j is within 2% for defect errors when the defect rate (the percentage of circuit nets subject to stuck-at-faults) p(saf) is between 10(-3) and 0.2.

J	Tao, J; Liu, YL; Yang, DL				Tao, Jie; Liu, Yilun; Yang, Dalian			Bearing Fault Diagnosis Based on Deep Belief Network and Multisensor Information Fusion	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE	In the rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the vibration signal of single sensor is usually nonstationary and noisy, which contains very little useful information, and impacts the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a novel fault diagnosis method using multivibration signals and deep belief network (DBN). By utilizing the DBN's learning ability, the proposed method can adaptively fuse multifeature data and identify various bearing faults. Firstly, multiple vibration signals are acquainted from various fault bearings. Secondly, some time-domain characteristics are extracted from original signals of each individual sensor. Finally, the features data of all sensors are put into the DBN and generate an appropriate classifier to complete fault diagnosis. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of multivibration signals, experiments are carried out on the individual sensor with the same conditions and procedure. At the same time, the method is compared with SVM, KNN, and BPNN methods. The results show that the DBN-based method is able to not only adaptively fuse multisensor data, but also obtain higher identification accuracy than other methods.

A main purpose is to investigate how different strategies for test suite generation affect quality attributes of the generated test suites, in a realistic industrial environment. We develop a functional model in the form of an extended finite state machine, from which we generate test suites using several different (model) coverage criteria, alongside with randomly and manually generated test suites. We compare test suites with respect to fault-detection capability, incurred (source) code coverage, and test generation and execution time. The system under test is a commercially released version, not seeded with any faults, implying that exposed faults are "real" faults that passed previous testing. We did not find clear difference between coverage-based and random test suites. Test suite generation and execution is performed using the tool ERLY MARSH, developed by the first author.

One of the reasons is that it offers test generation techniques which under well-defined assumptions guarantee complete fault coverage for a given fault model of a specification FSM. Checking experiments have already been extended to remove assumptions that the specification Mealy machine need to be reduced, deterministic, and completely specified, while keeping the input, output and state sets finite. In our recent work, we investigated possibilities of removing the assumption about the finiteness of the input set, introducing the model FSM with symbolic inputs. In this paper, we report on our efforts of further lifting the theory of checking experiments for Mealy machines with symbolic inputs and symbolic outputs. The former are predicates defined over input variables and the latter are output variable valuations computed by assignments on input variables. Both types of variables can have large or even infinite domains. Inclusion of assignments in the model complicates fault detection, as different assignments may produce the same output valuations for some input valuations. We address this issue by using a transition cover enhanced with assignment discriminating predicates specifying symbolic inputs on which the assignments produce different outputs. The enhanced transition cover is then used in checking experiments, which can detect assignment/output faults and more general transition faults under certain assumptions.

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) use numerous sensors spread across various sub-systems to perform a variety of functions such as stability control, adaptive cruise control, power train control, autonomous driving, etc. The accuracy of sensors degrades over the vehicle lifetime. The control logic of vehicles uses sensor measurements to detect the vehicle state and give appropriate commands to control the vehicle. Faults in sensors cause wrong feedback to be sent to the control logic and subsequently commands given by the control logic become faulty. Thus the effect of a sensor fault can be observed in subsystems controlled by the control logic. So advanced diagnosis techniques are required to detect the sensor degradation. In this work, a comparison is made between two different automotive sensor health monitoring methods used to diagnose sensor faults. The methods that are compared are: lookup table based method and machine learning (using multiple linear regression) based method. The comparison will enable one to choose the appropriate method by considering the attributes required for a particular application like accuracy, amount of computation required, simplicity, etc. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the current sensor output with a nominal no-fault sensor block output at the particular operating point of the system. The lookup table method was implemented in Matlab while the machine learning method was implemented using R programming language. The proposed methods are illustrated on the case example of motor fault in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle to analyze their efficacy. They have been found to be valid for all drive cycles and can be used for diagnosing sensor faults in real time.

The situation leads to abrupt or degradation faults resulting in inefficient energy uses, excessive energy consumption and high service costs. To solve these aforementioned problems, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is utilized to firstly detect any abnormal conditions of a system and then diagnoses and determines their causes. In order to apply this concept in HVAC oversizing designs, this paper proposes the state-of-art procedure of a FDD procedure for analyzing the inherently faulty design (oversizing) of multiple packaged air-conditioning units used to supply cooling for an open space in light commercial buildings. A generic process of FDD for a packaged unit is briefly introduced to efficiently design FDD algorithms and to illustrate an overview picture for new researchers in FDD areas. In the procedures, compressor statuses, time-on and time-off operations and outdoor air temperatures are recorded by means of the on-board controller of each machine unit. These physical and electrical monitoring data are applied to diagnose and evaluate oversizing level in terms of runtime fraction (RTF) and cycling rate (N). Eventually, an adaptive control is designed and implemented to enhance process recovery for soft-repairing and permanently reducing fault effect caused by oversizing without intervening system operations (non-invasive technology).

The manual quantification of lung tumor composition is very time consuming, but it can potentially be aided by a machine learning application. We have updated our previously developed methodology to segment and distinguish solid and micropapillary lung tumor subtypes. Binary tumor masks delineated by machine learning were defined by the mean area of binary objects and by the number of objects found in an image frame. These two features distinguished solid (n = 31) and micropapillary (n = 61) histologic subtypes with excellent performance (p < 4.04e-19) for three different frame sizes.

J	Pang, S; Yang, XY; Zhang, XF				Pang, Shan; Yang, Xinyi; Zhang, Xiaofeng			Aero Engine Component Fault Diagnosis Using Multi-Hidden-Layer Extreme Learning Machine with Optimized Structure	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article							DEEP; NETWORK	A new aero gas turbine engine gas path component fault diagnosis method based on multi-hidden-layer extreme learning machine with optimized structure (OM-ELM) was proposed. OM-ELM employs quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization to automatically obtain the optimal network structure according to both the root mean square error on training data set and the norm of output weights. The proposed method is applied to handwritten recognition data set and a gas turbine engine diagnostic application and is compared with basic ELM, multi-hidden-layer ELM, and two state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms: deep belief network and the stacked denoising autoencoder. Results show that, with optimized network structure, OM-ELM obtains better test accuracy in both applications and is more robust to sensor noise. Meanwhile it controls the model complexity and needs far less hidden nodes than multi-hidden-layer ELM, thus saving computer memory and making it more efficient to implement. All these advantages make our method an effective and reliable tool for engine component fault diagnosis tool.

Recently, a new approach for hierarchical clustering based on data field, was put forward and obtained good effect. Thus, inspired by the principle, a new efficient and intelligent fault diagnosis method called Mass Optimizing Group Identification Classification Algorithm (MOGICA) has been proposed in this article. In this classifier, the classification rate and size of used objects population have some fluctuation with the change of only parameter delta. Thus, with the purpose of making data field distribution more reasonable and increasing the classification accuracy, Entropy is introduced to determine the parameter d. The performance of the method has been tested through two kinds of experiments. In the first experiment, four benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. In the second experiment, the algorithm was used to diagnose the faults of ball bearing. Compared with other classification techniques in the two experiments, our method is more competitive.

J	Keshtan, MN; Khajavi, MN				Keshtan, Majid Norouzi; Khajavi, Mehrdad Nouri			Bearings Fault Diagnosis Using Vibrational Signal Analysis by EMD Method	RESEARCH IN NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION			English	Article						Nondestructive test; empirical mode decomposition; Hilbert transformation; EEMD	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; DAMAGE DETECTION; HILBERT SPECTRUM	Studying vibrational signals is one reliable method for monitoring the situation of rotary machinery. There are various methods for converting vibrational signals into usable information for fault diagnosis, one of which is the empirical mode decomposition method (EMD). This article is about diagnosing bearing faults using the EMD method, employing nondestructive test. Vibration signals are acquired by a bearing test machine. The discrete wavelet bases are used to translate vibration signals of a roller bearing into time-scale representation. Then, an envelope signal can be obtained by envelope spectrum analysis of wavelet coefficients of high scales. Local Hilbert marginal spectrum can be obtained by applying thr EMD method to the envelope signal from which the faults in a roller bearing can be diagnosed and fault patterns can be identified. The results have shown bearing faults frequencies are easily observable. There is a variant of the EMD method called the ensemble EMD (EEMD), which overcomes the mode mixing problem which may occur when the signal to be decomposed is intermittent. The EEMD method is also applied to the acquired signals, and the two methods were compared. While the outcomes of both methods do not differ much, one important merit of the EMD is that it has much less computational processing time than EEMD.

C	Mekaroonkamon, T; Wongsa, S			IEEE	Mekaroonkamon, Tapana; Wongsa, Sarawan			A Comparative Investigation of the Robustness of Unsupervised Clustering Techniques for Rotating Machine Fault Diagnosis with Poorly-Separated Data	2016 EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (ICACI)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)	FEB 14-16, 2016	Chiang Mai, THAILAND			Unsupervised clustering; unlabelled data; vibration signal; fault diagnosis; robustness	NUMBER	The data recorded in industry for rotating machine health monitoring are often a large number and unlabelled. It is impractical to label these data manually. Traditionally unsupervised algorithms have been applied to address this challenge. In the situation where relevant features are included or when the features are not selected properly, it could lead to poorly-separated clusters and deteriorate the clustering performance. It is of interest to investigate the performance of clustering techniques in these circumstances. This paper aims to provide a comparative study and investigation of three well-known clustering techniques, i.e. the k-means clustering algorithm, hierarchical clustering algorithm and expectation-maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm, combined with Calinski-Harabasz index, Davies-Bouldin index, Gap value index, and Silhouette index for determining the number of clusters for both well-and poorly-separated clusters. The experimental results on two real bearing datasets show that the expectation-maximisation (EM) clustering algorithm combined with the Gap value index is the most efficient and robust method to determine the optimal number of clusters in the dataset and classify the unlabelled data.

However, there has been lack of practical and effective extraction methods. For this reason, this paper suggests a novel method for the PD signal feature extraction based on multidimensional feature region. Firstly, in order to better describe differences in each frequency band of fault signals, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) band-pass filter wave for raw signal is carried out. And the component of raw signals on each frequency band can be obtained. Secondly, the sample entropy value and the energy value of each frequency band component are calculated. Using the difference of each frequency band energy and complexity, signals feature region is established by the multidimensional energy parameters and the multidimensional sample entropy parameters to describe PD signals multidimensional feature information. Finally, partial discharge faults are classified by sphere-structured support vector machines algorithm. The result indicates that this method is able to identify and classify different partial discharge faults.

Unlike previous studies in this space, we have combined multiple data inputs for the model and obtained a better model performance compared to earlier published models. In this paper we explain how we developed and deployed the predictive model in a large scale cloud service. To build the model, we used a combination of two open data sources - Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting technology (S.M.A.R.T or SMART) data and Windows performance counters. The nature of both these data sources is different and complex. The paper provides unique ways of parsing and transforming the data to make it most suited for a classification problem. Trails with different machine learning(ML) and statistical modeling techniques led us to the best performing two-stage ensemble model. We implemented this model to be configurable such that it could be deployed on large scale distributed cloud management systems and iterated on with minimal code impact. We provide a glimpse of the complex cloud hardware ecosystem and how a predictive model would impact such an ecosystem. Although our study focused on hard disk drives, we believe a similar modeling approach can apply to other hardware components as well. A successfully executed hard disk failure prediction model can pre-empt negative impact to client workloads and improve the economics of running a large scale cloud service. We provide the details of our model as a possible template for future extensions and improvements towards building more robust hardware fault prediction services. Finally we give a staged approach to operationalizing the model in large scale cloud systems.

It may be noted that we cannot afford to miss an alarm (fault) condition in a mission critical application as the cost of a failure can be fatal and very expensive, and this means that we need to have a high alarm accuracy, i.e., sensitivity. A better alarm accuracy is desired in mission critical applications, even at the expense of a lower no-alarm detection accuracy, i.e., specificity. A lower specificity means more false alarms. In this work, we propose a novel approach to fine tune a decision tree based machine fault identification system towards a mission critical application like aerospace by improving the sensitivity. We experiment the proposed approach with a three phase 3kVA synchronous generator to diagnose the inter-turn short circuit faults. The proposed approach outperforms the baseline system by an absolute improvement in sensitivity of 1.08%, 0.82%, and 0.53% for the R, Y, and B phase faults respectively.	[Gopinath, R.; Kumar, C.

In this paper, local and global unsupervised kernel extreme learning machine and support vector data description (LGUKELM-SVDD) is proposed for effective fault detection. LGUKELM model incorporates the global structure analysis into the standard UELM model. Meanwhile, the kernel trick is adopted to avoid the problem of explicitly selecting the number of the hidden layer nodes. After the nonlinear data features are extracted from LGUKELM model, SVDD is applied to build a monitoring index to detect fault. The simulation results on the continuous stirred tank reactor system show that the proposed method can detect process fault more effectively than conventional methods.

On the role of Prognostics and Health Management in advanced maintenance systems	PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL			English	Article						PHM; RCM; maintenance policies; proactive maintenance; CBM	STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; BUSINESS	The advanced use of the Information and Communication Technologies is evolving the way that systems are managed and maintained. A great number of techniques and methods have emerged in the light of these advances allowing to have an accurate and knowledge about the systems' condition evolution and remaining useful life. The advances are recognised as outcomes of an innovative discipline, nowadays discussed under the term of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In order to analyse how maintenance will change using PHM, a conceptual model is proposed built upon three views. The model highlights: (i) how PHM may impact the definition of maintenance policies; (ii) how PHM fits within the condition-based maintenance; and (iii) how PHM can be integrated into reliability-centred maintenance programmes. The conceptual model is the research finding of this review note and helps to discuss the role of PHM in advanced maintenance systems.	[Guillen, A.

However nowadays, multistage constructions are encountered in industries. These are not necessarily planetary, but generally epicyclic. Current state of the art, according to the authors knowledge, does not give general equations for a case where multistage systems are considered, where some of the gears consist all moving parts. Hence, currently available CMS systems are not suitable for condition monitoring of these kinds of systems. The paper presents a new general equation, which allows calculating the characteristic frequencies of any kind of multistage gear sets, as a result of theoretical investigation. Illustrated solution does not assume a fixed speed of any element. Moreover, presented equation takes into account corrected teeth, making developed equations most general from all available in tribology science. Presented scientific development is currently implemented in a modern European CMS.

This can be partly achieved by continuous monitoring of operation conditions to detect any fault before it causes serious problem or breakdown of rotating machines. The detection of faults in rotating blades via direct blade vibration measurements and analysis is somewhat difficult because blades often operate in a very harsh environment (gas turbine blades are rotating in high temperature and pressure environment). This paper presents indirect detection of blade faults from lateral vibrations of a rotor-disk-blade system, which can easily be measured, using laboratory test-rig. A rotor, disk, 6 normal blades and 3 blades with different defects were designed. The modal parameters of the normal and defective blades were determined experimentally and by modal analysis using ANSYS. The lateral vibrations, in the x- and y-axis, of the rotor-disk system with normal 6 blades and with 5 normal blades and 1 defective blade at a time were measured and analyzed. The results revealed that defective blades showed some distinct characteristics in the frequency domain, which can be used to identify blade faults in a bladed rotor-disk system.

Failure in such systems is unacceptable, even though engineers try to achieve very low failure probability in these systems. The ability to accurately model and analyze the characteristics of such systems would reduce the rates of false positives and missed detections in structural health monitoring. Previously, a detection model was developed to investigate the effects of combined impact of geometrical variations of machining errors and crack presence in beams. The model utilized the Leap Frog finite difference method, which had a restrictive condition on stability of the numerical method. This restriction would show to be critical with materials with high modulus and low density values. The proposed work will overcome the drawback of the current detection model by utilizing other finite difference methods to remove or relax the stability condition of the method; namely, the Weighted Average method and Du Fort-Frankel method. The presented result clearly shows that the Theta method could be used to obtain an unconditionally stable finite difference model with high accuracy. It is also observed that the result from the Du Fort-Frankel method is still conditionally stable, but the stability condition is more relaxed compared to the Leap Frog method. The results obtained from the improved model show good agreement with the example in the literature. The improved model is also applied to investigate a cantilevered beam with the presence of cracks and geometrical variations.

The weak fault feature extraction is crucial to mechanical fault diagnosis and machine condition monitoring. A new method EWT-based (Empirical Wavelet Transform) for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. It consists of four parts. Firstly, the frequency ranges of meaningful modes are self-adaptively obtained by combining scale-space representation and Otsu's method. Secondly, the meaningful modes are acquired by utilizing EWT to decompose the raw vibration signal. Thirdly, the first two modes possessing maximum kurtosis are selected as fault components. Lastly, the fault-related features could be observed in the time domain and envelope spectra of the selected modes. Experimental results verify that the proposed method is very effective for bearing weak fault diagnosis and the performance of proposed method is obviously better than the method of empirical mode decomposition (EMD).

Integrated Approach for Vibration-based Condition Monitoring of Rotating Machines	INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 8			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 02-05, 2015	Boston, MA	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		Rotating Machine; Vibration-based Condition Monitoring (VCM); On-shaft Vibration (OSV); Data Fusion; Machine Composite Spectrum	DIAGNOSTICS	Conventional Vibration-based Condition Monitoring (VCM) is well known and well accepted in industries to identify the fault(s), if any, in rotating machine since decades. However over the last 3 decades, significant advancement in both computational and instrumentation technologies has been noticed which resulted in number of research studies to find the alternate and efficient methods for fault(s) diagnosis. But most of the research studies may not be leading to an Integrated Modern VCM (IMVCM). It may be because of mainly 2 reasons; (a) the recent proposed methods in the literature are based on numerically simulated studies and a very limited experimental studies and (b) none of the recent studies applied on all kind of faults. In this paper, a summary of a couple of methods proposed and published earlier by author to meet the requirement of the IMVCM is presented.

J	Chen, MC; Hsu, CC; Malhotra, B; Tiwari, MK				Chen, Mu-Chen; Hsu, Chun-Chin; Malhotra, Bharat; Tiwari, Manoj Kumar			An efficient ICA-DW-SVDD fault detection and diagnosis method for non-Gaussian processes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						process control; statistical process control (SPC); independent component analysis; support vector data description	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MODEL; PCA; NUMBER	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been extensively used for detecting faults in industrial processes. While applying ICA to process monitoring, the inability of identifying the important components affect the fault diagnosis ability. For further improving the competence of ICA, this paper proposes an approach integrating ICA, Durbin Watson (DW) criterion and Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) to monitor non-Gaussian process for detecting faults. In the proposed approach, namely ICA-DW-SVDD, ICA is a non-Gaussian information extractor from original variables, DW identifies dominating ICs, and SVDD plays the role of fault detector. This paper also discusses the retracing method to detect original variables causing disturbance in the process. One simulation case and the Tennessee Eastman Process are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

The universal expression of the magnetic flux density under different forms of SAGE is firstly deduced, based on which the detailed UMP formulas for the normal condition and three SAGE cases are obtained, respectively. Then the exciting characteristics of the UMP for each SAGE form to generate vibrations are analyzed. Finally, numerical FEM calculations and segmental experiments are carried out to investigate the effect of SAGE forms on the rotor UMP, taking the SDF-9 type non-salient-pole fault simulating generator as the object. It is shown that, no matter what kind of SAGE occurs, amplitude increments at each even harmonic component of the UMP and the rotor vibration, especially the 2nd harmonic component, will be brought in. Meanwhile, the UMP keeps directing to the very position where the minimum radial air-gap is.

Such parameter, which has to be considered as a damage index, is based on a series of post-processing algorithms to be implemented on the vibration signals acquired on static supporting elements. The vibrations acquired from rotating machinery could be influenced by non-stationary and non-linear features, especially when the rotating elements are affected by dynamical unbalances due to misalignments or uneven mass distribution. The authors use the Hibert-Huang Transform tool, that is able to decompose the original signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), each of them holding quite significant information about the instantaneous frequencies and the energy content of the original signal.

This paper presents a multi-attribute classification fusion approach which leverages the strengths provided by multiple membership classifiers to form a robust classification model for structural health diagnostics. The developed classification fusion approach conducts the health diagnostics with three primary stages: (i) fusion formulation using a k-fold cross validation model; (ii) diagnostics with multiple multi-attribute classifiers as member algorithms; and (iii) classification fusion through a weighted majority voting with dominance system. State-of-the-art classification techniques from three broad categories (i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and statistical inference) are employed. as the member algorithms. The developed classification fusion approach is demonstrated with the 2008 PHM challenge problem. The developed fusion diagnostics approach outperforms any stand-alone member algorithm with better diagnostic accuracy and robustness.

Reliability of Li-ion batteries used in these devices has been recognized as of high importance from a broad range of stakeholders, including medical device manufacturers, regulatory agencies, patients and physicians. To ensure a Li-ion battery operates reliably, it is important to develop health monitoring techniques that accurately estimate the capacity of the battery throughout its life-time. This paper presents a sparse Bayesian learning method that utilizes the charge voltage and current measurements to estimate the capacity of a Li-ion battery used in an implantable medical device. Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is employed as a probabilistic kernel regression method to learn the complex dependency of the battery capacity on the characteristic features that are extracted from the charge voltage and current measurements. Owing to the sparsity property of RVM, the proposed method generates a reduced-scale regression model that consumes only a small fraction of the CPU time required by a full-scale model, which makes online capacity estimation computationally efficient. 10 years' continuous cycling data and post-explant cycling data obtained from Li-ion prismatic cells are used to verify the performance of the proposed method.

This paper investigates performances of typical data-driven methodologies when the amount of training data sets is insufficient. The purpose is to better understand these methodologies especially when offline training datasets are insufficient. The neural network, similarity based approach, and copula-based sampling approach were investigated when only three run-to-failure training units were available. The example of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery capacity degradation was employed for the demonstration.

This classification technique was selected to take advantage of an expected correlation between measurable state variables and equipment and operation specifications and system control targets. The hidden variable is the faultiness of the chiller and can take on one of three possible states. The five observed variables correspond to sensor measurements that are typically available and monitored in commercially available chiller plants. The fault detection algorithm is trained on simulated data for the Molecular Foundry at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and tested on measured sensor data. The results show that detection of severe faults and no faults are relatively accurate, while detection of moderate faults is sometimes mistaken for severe faults. The computation needs are moderate enough for deployment and continuous energy monitoring. Future research outlines the next steps in regards to sensitivity analyses with alternate probability density functions.	[Hu, R.

A simulation model of a manufacturing system generates real-time monitoring data for machine status and these data are then mined by data mining algorithms to discover hidden knowledge that might not be predefined in the simulation model. The new knowledge is then fed into the simulation model such that the model adapts and evolves, and eventually it can predict future status. This procedure involves heterogeneous modeling techniques, information exchange among different tools, as well as model composition and interaction. We extend an early presented "Hypercube" information model that was specifically developed for the purpose of formal representation of smart manufacturing systems, in order to hamionize the information required by the simulation modeling tool and the data analytics tool. A strong emphasis is given to emerging areas of multi-domain and multi scale modeling by means of integration and interoperability between existing modeling tools and technologies.

A PLANT-WIDE AND FUNCTION-SPECIFIC HIERARCHICAL FUNCTIONAL FAULT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION (HFFDI) SYSTEM FOR MULTIPLE FAULT SCENARIOS ON COMPLEX SYSTEMS	INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 1B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 02-05, 2015	Boston, MA	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div			ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANTS; QUANTITATIVE MODEL; DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSIENTS	The development of Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) systems for complex mechatronic systems is a challenging process. Many quantitative and qualitative fault detection methods have been proposed in past literature. Few methods address multiple faults, instead an emphasis is placed on accurately proving a single fault exists. The omission of multiple faults regulates the capability of most fault detection methods. The Functional Failure Identification and Propagation (FFIP) framework has been utilized in past research for various applications related to fault propagation in complex systems. In this paper. a Hierarchical Functional Fault Detection and Identification (HFFDI) system is proposed. The development of the HFFDI system is based on machine learning techniques, commonly used as a basis for FDI systems, and the functional system decomposition of the FFIP framework. The HFFDI is composed of a plant-wide FDI system and function-specific FDI systems. The HFFDI aims at fault identification in multiple fault scenarios using single fault data sets, when faults happen in different system functions. The methodology is applied to a case study of a generic nuclear power plant with 17 system functions. Compared with a plant-wide FDI system, in multiple fault scenarios the HFFDI gave better results for identifying one fault and also was able to identify more than one faults. The case study results show that in two fault scenarios the HFFDI was able to identify one of the faults with 79% accuracy and both faults with 13% accuracy. In three fault scenarios the HFFDI was able to identify one of the faults with 69% accuracy, two faults with 22% accuracy and all three faults with 1% accuracy.

Due to the non stationary and transient nature of the signals in speed up process, the traditional diagnostic methods that have been put forward based on stationary assumption are no longer satisfactory. This paper proposes a new Speed Transform based method for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery in variable speed. Speed Transform decomposes a complicated signal over a basis of elementary oscillatory functions, whose frequencies follow the speed variation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both simulated signal and startup vibration signal collected from a rotor system with early rub impact fault. Analyzed results showed that the proposed method could effectively extract fault features of the rotor under varying speed condition.

System response in form of time series data can be used to identify type of defect, severity of defect etc. However, a central issue with time series classification is that of identifying appropriate features for classification. In this paper, we explore a new feature set based on a delay differential equations (DDEs). DDEs have been used recently for extracting features for classification but have never been used to classify system responses. The Duffmg oscillator and Van der Pol-Duffmg (VDP-D) oscillator are used as dynamic systems, and the responses are classified into self-similar groups. Responses with the same period should belong to the same group. Misclassification rate is used as an indicator of the efficacy of the feature set. The proposed feature set is compared to a statistical feature set, a power spectral coefficient feature set and a wavelet coefficient feature set. In work described in this paper, a density estimation algorithm called DBSCAN is used as the classification algorithm. The proposed DDE-based feature set is found to be significantly better than the other feature sets for the classifying responses generated by the Duffmg system. The wavelet and the power spectral coefficient data sets are not found to be significantly better than the statistical feature set for the Duffmg system. None of the feature sets tested are discerning enough on the VDP-D system.

To solve this deficiency, a new method, objective function optimization based on a genetic algorithm and the split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm applied to RSSD, is proposed. This method utilizes the global optimization ability of genetic algorithms to adaptively optimize each element value of the weight coefficient matrices of the objective function of RSSD and achieve the optimal value of the objective function in the range of the desirable weight coefficients. Thus, this method adaptively realizes a sparse decomposition of the high- and low-resonance components according to the input signal and minimizes the information leakage in the process of signal decomposition. Finally, the proposed method was applied to diagnose a rolling bearing with composite faults of the inner and outer races and used to effectively extract the composite fault characteristics of the rolling bearing vibration signal. Accurate diagnosis of the early composite fault validated the practicability of the proposed method.

Once a bearing fails, it accelerates failures of other adjacent components and results in unexpected machine breakdown. To prevent machine breakdown and reduce unnecessary economic loss, bearing fault must be detected as early as possible. Besides spectral kurtosis, empirical mode decomposition, cyclostationarity, etc., wavelet transform has proven to be an effective method for identification of different bearing faults because it aims to highlight the inner product between an artificial wavelet function and a signal to be analyzed. In the application of wavelet transform, optimization of wavelet parameters attracts much attention because proper selection of wavelet parameters can maximize performance of wavelet transform and extract impulses caused by bearing faults in the case of interruption from other strong low frequency vibration components and heavy noises. Compared with other optimization methods, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, etc., an analytic and fast Bayesian inference on optimal wavelet parameters for an optimal wavelet filtering for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. Prior to Bayesian inference, a state space model of wavelet parameters should be constructed to reflect the relationship between wavelet parameters and measurements. Here, measurements are monotonically increasing kurtosis values, which are able to quantify bearing fault signals. The first kurtosis value and initial wavelet parameters are provided by the fast kurtogram, which is a fast algorithm that can be used to locate one of resonant frequency bands for further demodulation with envelope analysis. For other measurements, they are generated by artificial extrapolations of the first kurtosis value. To iteratively infer posterior probability density functions of wavelet parameters and track the artificial measurements, an unscented transform based Bayesian method is introduced. As the iteration number increases, posterior probability density functions of wavelet parameters converge. Then, the optimal wavelet parameters can be found to conduct an optimal wavelet filtering so as to isolate bearing fault signals from other strong low-frequency vibration components. At last, squared envelope analysis and Fourier transform are utilized to demodulate bearing fault signals enhanced by the proposed method and to identify bearing fault characteristic frequencies, respectively. One real case study is used to illustrate how the proposed method works and to demonstrate that the proposed method can be effectively and efficiently used to extract bearing fault signatures. Additionally, a comparison with the fast kurtogram is conducted to show the proposed method is better than the fast kurtogram for bearing fault diagnosis.

For highly reliable products, it is difficult to obtain abundant degradation data to precisely predict the residual life under normal stress levels. Thus, how to make use of historical degradation data to improve the accuracy of the residual life prediction is an interesting issue. Accelerated degradation testing, which has been widely used to evaluate the reliability of highly reliable products, can provide abundant accelerated degradation data. In this paper, a residual life prediction method based on Bayesian inference that takes accelerated degradation data as prior information was studied. A Wiener process with a time function was used to model degradation data. In order to apply the random effects of all the parameters of a Wiener process, the non-conjugate prior distributions were considered. Acceleration factors were introduced to convert the parameter estimates from accelerated stress levels to normal stress levels, so that the proper prior distribution types of the random parameters can be selected by the Anderson-Darling statistic. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with Gibbs sampling was used to evaluate the posterior means of the random parameters. An illustrative example of self-regulating heating cable was utilized to validate the proposed method.

An important unit of the hardware that implements arithmetic codes is a residue generator. This is a circuit that generates the residue of a number with respect to a check base. The existing design methods for residue generators are oriented to the special values of the check base. We propose an approach to designing the residue generators with an arbitrary check base. We show how to reduce the probability of error escape, when this type of generator is used for detecting arithmetic errors. We then demonstrate how to embed the designed circuit into a microprogrammable finite state machine to test its operation without adding test hardware overhead. The proposed scheme can be used in arithmetic/algebraic error-control coding and fault-tolerant digital designs.

A complexity based look-ahead mechanism for shop floor decision making	RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN MANUFACTURING: KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FACTORIES OF THE FUTURE - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 48TH CIRP CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	Procedia CIRP		English	Proceedings Paper	48th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP CMS)	JUN 24-26, 2015	Ischia, ITALY			Complexity; Undesirability index; Decision making; Integrated approach; Simulation; Uncertainty modeling	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	Manufacturing Complexity has been extensively reported in the literature in the ways it can be classified, modelled, assessed and measured. However, the use of complexity measures for shop floor decision making has not been studied exhaustively. The paper demonstrates the use of a complexity measure for shop floor decision making. Knowledge of the transition of shop floor complexity into undesirability can give a correct indicative for any decision maker to intervene and take the necessary corrective actions to bring the system back to its desirable state. The current paper presents an information-theoretic approach based model which considers production scheduling, maintenance and quality functions simultaneously to come up with a complexity quantifier for a shop floor. At any point in time, various environmental factors like machine failures, corrective maintenance time variability, due date alteration, process shifts etc. are simulated into the future and their effect on the job states both in terms of schedule and quality are observed. The probability of these state occurrences is then quantified as complexity of situation which is subsequently scaled to a penalty based "undesirability index". The complexity is re-evaluated every time a fresh event occurs, thus enabling the decision maker to be more predictive about the future state of the system and in turn, the performance of each of the manufacturing functions. Thus, the model so developed, deploys a complexity based look-ahead mechanism for identifying undesirable state transitions.

However, the detection of these anomalies and disruptions is time consuming and not applicable to real-time applications. Moreover many technical systems like e.g. machines and plants require a real-time decision support for emergency shutdowns in order to enable human machine interactions and avoid cost-intensive machine breakdowns. Thereby, anomalies and system changes have to be detected in a fast and secure way. In this context, conventional FDS are not designed for real-time control of sensor networks. Such networks continuously generate a large volume of data and are vulnerable for sensor failures. Therefore, it is a challenging task to derive appropriate information and analyze them in real time. In this paper we propose an event-driven fault detection systems (ED-FDS) using complex event processing (CEP) approach, which provides a robust detection mechanism for severe machine failures in real-time. The idea of ED-FDS is based on discretization of continuous sensor signals by applying an event scheme for sensor data changes. The event scheme includes several event rules, which are generated by applying of data mining methods. Thereby, relevant features are extracted and uncommon behavior of the system is described by event rules. One emphasis of the paper is the combination of different basic events to complex events in a way that different warning levels can be processed. The evaluation of the proposed system is performed on a test-bed demonstrator, which allows the tuning of different disruptions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Improved signal characterization via Empirical Mode Decomposition to enhance in-line quality monitoring	RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN MANUFACTURING: KEY ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FACTORIES OF THE FUTURE - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 48TH CIRP CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	Procedia CIRP		English	Proceedings Paper	48th CIRP International Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP CMS)	JUN 24-26, 2015	Ischia, ITALY			Monitoring; Quality Assurance; Waterjet Machining	WAVE-FORM SIGNALS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	The machine tool industry is facing the need to increase the sensorization of production systems to meet evolving market demands. This leads to the increasing interest for in-process monitoring tools that allow a fast detection of faults and unnatural process behaviours during the process itself. Nevertheless, the analysis of sensor signals implies several challenges. One major challenge consists of the complexity of signal patterns, which often exhibit a multiscale content, i.e., a superimposition of both stationary and non-stationary fluctuations on different time-frequency levels. Among time-frequency techniques, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a powerful method to decompose any signal into its embedded oscillatory modes in a fully data-driven way, without any ex-ante basis selection. Because of this, it might be used effectively for automated monitoring and diagnosis of manufacturing processes. Unfortunately, it usually yields an over-decomposition, with single oscillation modes that can be split into more than one scale (this effect is also known as "mode mixing"). The literature lacks effective strategies to automatically synthetize the decomposition into a minimal number of physically relevant and interpretable components. This paper proposes a novel approach to achieve a synthetic decomposition of complex signals through the EMD procedure. A new criterion is proposed to group together multiple components associated to a common time-frequency pattern, aimed at summarizing the information content into a minimal number of modes, which may be easier to interpret. A real case study in waterjet cutting is presented, to demonstrate the benefits and the critical issues of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Duan, F; Zivanovic, R				Duan, Fang; Zivanovic, Rastko			Induction Motor Stator Fault Detection by a Condition Monitoring Scheme Based on Parameter Estimation Algorithms	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						induction motor; condition monitoring; stator fault detection; parameter estimation algorithms	ROTOR FAULT; DIAGNOSIS	This article presents a simple, low-cost, and effective method for the early diagnosis of stator short-circuit faults. The approach relies on the combination of an induction motor mathematical model and parameter estimation algorithm. The kernel of the method is the efficient search for the characteristic parameters that indicate stator short-circuit faults. However, the non-linearity of a machine model may imply multiple local minima of an objective function implemented in the estimation algorithm. Taking this into consideration, the suitability of two industry-proven optimization algorithms (pattern search algorithm and genetic algorithm) as applied in the proposed condition monitoring method was investigated. Experimental results show that the proposed diagnosis method is capable of detecting stator short-circuit faults and estimating level and location of faults. The study also indicates that the proposed method is robust to motor parameters offset and unbalanced voltage supply. Application of the pattern search algorithm is suitable for a continuous monitoring system, where the previous result can be used as starting point of the new search. The genetic algorithm requires longer computation time and is suitable for the offline diagnostic system. It is not sensitive to the starting point, and achieving global solution is guaranteed.

J	Diehl, EJ; Tang, J				Diehl, Edward J.; Tang, J.			Predictive Modeling of a Two-Stage Gearbox towards Fault Detection	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							NONLINEAR DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; HARMONIC-BALANCE METHOD; MESH STIFFNESS; SPUR GEAR; WAVELET ANALYSIS; PROGNOSTICS; SYSTEMS; INSTABILITIES; DIAGNOSTICS; VIBRATION	This paper presents a systematic approach to the modeling and analysis of a benchmark two-stage gearbox test bed to characterize gear fault signatures when processed with harmonic wavelet transform(HWT) analysis. The eventual goal of condition monitoring is to be able to interpret vibration signals from nonstationary machinery in order to identify the type and severity of gear damage. To advance towards this goal, a lumped-parameter model that can be analyzed efficiently is developed which characterizes the gearbox vibratory response at the system level. The model parameters are identified through correlated numerical and experimental investigations. The model fidelity is validated first by spectrum analysis, using constant speed experimental data, and secondly by HWT analysis, using nonstationary experimental data. Model prediction and experimental data are compared for healthy gear operation and a seeded fault gear with a missing tooth. The comparison confirms that both the frequency content and the predicted, relative response magnitudes match with physical measurements. The research demonstrates that the modeling method in combination with the HWT data analysis has the potential for facilitating successful fault detection and diagnosis for gearbox systems.

The ability to accurately identify the malignancy in early stage is the key for better prognosis and preparation of effective treatment. In the developing world, even though at times imaging machines are available in the rural areas but due to the absence of the relevant medical expertise early detection of cancer remains only a pipe dream. Along with the imaging machines, internet has made inroads into rural surroundings. That makes the availability of online automatic systems that can identify the presence or absence of malignancy, without human involvement, an important aspect of healthcare systems in the underdeveloped rural surroundings. This paper presents an online tumor detection application, that uses mammogram images. The mammogram images taken at a local facility are transferred over the internet to a remote server that hosts the application that can classify tumour. It was trained on 322 mammographic images, from the mini-MIAS database. We have achieved sensitivity of 90.15 %.

It involves employment of an efficient multi-energetic model suited for diagnostics and prognostics, developed in Bond Graph (BG) framework. The Electrical-Electrochemical (EE) part constitutes the main focus for the problem of prognostics, wherein deviation of the global resistance and limiting current inspires a statistical linear degradation model (DM), under constant current solicitation conditions. The benefits of Particle Filters (PF) is integrated with the BG model derived Analytical Redundancy Relations (ARRs), for the prognostics of the electrical-electrochemical (EE) part. The prognostic problem is formulated as the joint state-parameter estimation problem in Particle Filter framework. Using PF algorithms, estimation of State of Health (SOH) is obtained along with the estimation of the associated parameter that influences the rate of degradation, in probabilistic terms. A simplified variance adaptation scheme is employed to ameliorate the accuracy of remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. Influence of variance adaptation on SOH estimation as well as RUL prediction is assessed. It is shown that a proportional type of variance control leads to better accuracy in RUL predictions accompanied with precise confidence bounds. As the degradation data is obtained from a real industrial PEMFC, the economic viability of this approach for prognostics of PEMFC is significantly high.	[MayankShekhar, J. H.

J	Zheng, K; Zhang, Y; Zhao, C; Li, TL				Zheng, Kai; Zhang, Yun; Zhao, Chen; Li, Tianliang			Fault diagnosis for supporting rollers of the rotary kiln using the dynamic model and empirical mode decomposition	MECHANIKA			English	Article						Supporting rollers; fault diagnosis; numerical analysis; empirical mode decomposition; vibration monitoring	HILBERT SPECTRUM; EXTRACTION; MACHINERY	Rotary kiln is key equipment widely used in the cement, metallurgical and environmental protection industry. The operation state of the rotary kiln was largely determined by the working condition of supporting rollers. This paper models the vibration mechanism of the supporting rollers under the rotary kiln crank caused by the internal thermal process. Based on the numerical analysis, a methodology based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for the fault diagnosis of the supporting rollers was proposed. By using EMD, the complicated vibration signal of the kiln can be decomposed into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). An analysis was made over the energy moment of IMF components to indicate the energy variation of the kiln harmonic and the roller harmonic of the vibration signals. Simulation and in field experiment results proved that the proposed method provided a validity of the approach for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the low-speed machinery like the rotary kiln.

Degradation model of the bearings by wiener process	MECHANIKA			English	Article						predictive maintenance; vibration analysis; stochastic processes; Wiener process; modeling		Recently the monitoring and diagnosis of rotating machines has become an effective tool for early detection of defects and monitor changes over time. Maintenance was considered by companies as a post of unavoidable expense for long time but today it liberates of this reputation to be regarded as a competitive factor it requires a good understanding of phenomena related to the onset and development of defects detected, the appearance of a defect at an early stage and follow their evolution shows a great industrial value, for this we execute the predictive maintenance following the extrapolated forecast of the analysis and evaluation of significant parameters of the degradation of the property, the methodology proposed in this paper aims to model the phenomenon of degradation of the bearing by via a stochastic process specially wiener process starting with the statistical test to determine the distribution of our measurements values also the parameters of the model the average (mu), standard deviation (sigma) and the degree of risk (alpha) then we draw the curve of the probabilistic model and determine the critical level of failure of bearings, it allows us to plan the operations of maintenance and improve the availability of equipment also increase the lifetime of the equipment and finally the simulation of trajectories by wiener simulation.

It is urgent to develop a reliable and efficient fault diagnosis method. And an intelligent fault diagnosis approach for supporting rollers using OAO SVM with parameter optimization and PCA for feature reduction was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the fault related time-frequency features were extracted by the CEEMD method as that the vibration signals of the supporting rollers usually contain background noise, which significantly affects the results of fault diagnosis. Also, another twenty time domain and frequency domain were extracted. Secondly, the extracted feature was dimensionality reduced through the principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, in order to find the optimal parameters for the multiclass SVM model, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was used. The proposed method was verified with the experiment data collected by the monitoring system in field experiment. The result indicated that the method could effectively identify the vibration mode of the supporting roller.

Early diagnosis and classification of such malignant disorders are necessary, and it has always been a challenge in the field of haematology and laboratory medicine. Accurate and authentic diagnosis of leukaemia is essential for the confirmation of the disease, prognostic classification and effective treatment planning. Visual microscopic examination of blood slides is considered as an indispensable diagnostic technique for the screening and classification of leukaemia across continents. However, manual investigation is often slow and limited by subjective assimilation and reduced diagnostic precision. In this study, we investigate the use of image morphometry and pattern recognition techniques for subtyping leukaemic lymphoblasts as per French-American-British classification. Reliable classification results were obtained using the robust segmentation methodology, prominent morphological features and an ensemble of classifiers. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, a comparative study is realised over the available image data-set. The classification rates achieved with the standard classifiers, that is naive Bayesian, K-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron, probabilistic neural network and support vector machines, were compared with that obtained using an ensemble of classifiers. It is observed that the classification rate is improved with the use of multiple classifier ensemble and is expected to assist clinicians in making the diagnostic process faster and more accurate.

J	Elhadef, M; Nayak, A				Elhadef, Mourad; Nayak, Amiya			Using support vector machines to solve the comparison-based system-level fault diagnosis problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						fault tolerance; system-level self-diagnosis; comparison models; partial syndromes; support vector machines	MULTIPROCESSOR SYSTEMS; IDENTIFICATION	This paper introduces a new system-level fault diagnosis approach using support vector machines (SVMs). The objective of the fault diagnosis problem is to identify the set of permanent faulty nodes when at most t nodes can fail simultaneously. We consider both the asymmetric and symmetric comparison models which assume that nodes are assigned a set of tasks and their outcomes are compared. Based on the comparison outcomes, the diagnosis algorithm must identify all faulty nodes. In both models, it is assumed that two fault-free nodes give matching results, while a faulty and a fault-free node give mismatching outcomes. The two models differ in the assumption on comparisons involving pairs of faulty nodes. In the asymmetric model, two faulty nodes always give mismatching outputs, while in the symmetric model, both comparison outcomes are possible in this case. For the asymmetric comparison model, we show that a linear SVM is sufficient to solve the diagnosis problem, while for the symmetric model a nonlinear SVM is developed. The new SVM-based diagnosis is first trained using various input syndromes with known fault sets. Then, it is extensively tested using randomly generated diagnosable systems of different sizes and under various fault scenarios. Results from the thorough simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the SVM-based fault diagnosis approach, in terms of diagnosis correctness, latency and scalability. We also conducted extensive simulations using partial syndromes, i.e. when not all the comparison outcomes were available before initiating the diagnosis phase. Simulations showed that the SVM-based diagnosis performed efficiently, i.e. diagnosis correctness was around 99% even when at most half of the comparison outcomes were missing, making it a viable addition or alternative to existing diagnosis algorithms.

For key parameters, a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is first used to filter data before classification models of fault detection are established by using SVM and AdaBoost algorithms. A decision tree is then used to locate the key step for root cause identification. In the preliminary study in terms of a set of real wafer fabrication profile data in semiconductor manufacturing, the AdaBoost classifier with PCA has been shown the most effective in identifying key parameters in fault detection. Subsequently, these key parameters along with associated reading values at different timings were used to build a decision tree for the set of empirical rules to best identify problematic timing. It has been further verified that the critical timing among this set of empirical rules had occurred in the same manufacturing phase.

WAVELETS AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS METHOD FOR VIBRATION MONITORING OF ROTATING MACHINERY	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED MECHANICS			English	Article						vibration; fault diagnosis; wavelet analysis; principal component analysis; squared prediction error	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TRANSFORM	Fault diagnosis is playing today a crucial role in industrial systems. to improve reliability, safety and efficiency advanced monitoring methods have become increasingly important for many systems. The vibration analysis method is essential in improving condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Effective utilization of vibration signals depends upon effectiveness of applied signal processing techniques. In this paper, fault diagnosis is performed using a combination between Wavelet Transform (WT) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). WT is employed to decompose the vibration signal of measurements data in different frequency bands. The obtained decomposition levels are used as the input to the PCA method for fault identification using, respectively, the Q-statistic, also called Squared Prediction Error (SPE) and the Q-contribution. Clearly, useful information about the fault can be contained in sonic levels of wavelet decomposition. For this purpose, the Q-contribution is used as an evaluation criterion to select the optimal level, which contains the maximum information Associated to spectral analysis and envelope analysis, it allows clear visualization of fault frequencies. The objective of this method is to obtain the information contained in the measured data. The monitoring results using real sensor measurements from a pilot scale are presented and discussed.

We present an overview of the framework we have developed to help standardize and to objectively assess CT image quality for different models of CT scanners used for security applications. Within this framework, we have developed methods to quantitatively measure metrics that should correlate with feature identification, detection accuracy and precision, and image registration capabilities of CT machines and to identify strengths and weaknesses in different CT imaging technologies in transportation security. To that end we have designed, developed and constructed phantoms that allow for systematic and repeatable measurements of roughly 88 image quality metrics, representing modulation transfer function, noise equivalent quanta, noise power spectra, slice sensitivity profiles, streak artifacts, CT number uniformity, CT number consistency, object length accuracy, CT number path length consistency, and object registration. Furthermore, we have developed a sophisticated MATLAB based image analysis tool kit to analyze CT generated images of phantoms and report these metrics in a format that is standardized across the considered models of CT scanners, allowing for comparative image quality analysis within a CT model or between different CT models. In addition, we have developed a modified sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) method to generate a modified set of PCA components as compared to the standard principal component analysis (PCA) with sparse loadings in conjunction with Hotelling T-2 statistical analysis method to compare, qualify, and detect faults in the tested systems.

Bearings are considered a main part in various mechanical systems. Multi component vibration signals are generated when the machine works. Accelerometers are used to capture generated vibration signal. Vibration signal analysis is effectively used to diagnose bearing faults. There are various methods using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) as their fundamental method to diagnose bearing faults. The proposed method consists of analyzing the kurtosis of residue obtained after removing higher frequency components of the original signal. The proposed technique identifies the boisterous frequency segment in the signal through the iterative procedure. The experimental data were collected from Case Western Reserve University, Ohio. The simulation is done over MATLAB 7.8.1.

A wall conveyor is an essential device in coal mines. Its work is usually represented by three time series of current values of three conveyor engines. The startup of the conveyor is the phase with the maximal observed load during its work cycle. In the research, each startup is described with almost twenty variables. On the basis of 1000 real monitored startups, a set of association rules was inducted. On the basis of the further rules analysis and interpretation, a set of almost 50 rules was selected to the diagnosis system. The proposed diagnosis system compares the quality (precision) of each association rule from a selected subset-the precision evaluated on the representative data-with the precision of the same rule, evaluated on newly detected startups.

Modern gas turbines are integral elements in these plants operating at very high temperature with high efficiency. Improvements in plant reliability, availability and maintainability (RAM) have been major areas of concern for power producers to ensure competitive positions. In gas turbine based power generation systems, the performance of the turbine drops due to several reasons like compressor fouling and inlet filter clogging. For improving plant RAM, advanced methods of health monitoring are vital for gas turbine plant components such as inlet air filter, compressor, combustion chamber and turbine. This paper focuses on health monitoring of gas turbine compressor considering major fault condition of compressor fouling. The health monitoring is achieved by developing a compressor model, to predict the performance of the compressor at design and off-design operational conditions. A thermodynamic model of the gas turbine system has limited applicability for health monitoring applications. The modelling framework has to incorporate the complex assembly of various components that make up the overall system and the real time off-design operations of the system. With the recent developments in computational methods and availability of vast computing power, process history data models are found to be convenient options for the system modelling. Among the process history data based methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have proved to be effective for modelling non-linear and complex processes. Hence, ANN is used as the modelling platform for this study and the model is developed from process data of a GE frame 9E machine. Residuals generated from the model are used for analysing the health of the system. The prediction of future events achieved through the model is found to provide vital information for the decision making and planning of maintenance actions. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a suitable method that is efficient in accounting the variability of the data. It derives the loading vectors and is suitable for improving the effectiveness of the ANN model. Different fault conditions relevant to the gas turbine compressor are demonstrated with actual plant data using the ANN based health monitoring system. Effect of compressor fouling and recouping of fouling effect with off line compressor water wash are also analysed in this paper.

Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) become unavoidable component serving as an energy storage element in transportation industry as well as in solar and wind energy systems. The problems related to battery state monitoring in hybrid electric vehicles refer to the estimation of immeasurable degradation parameters. Concerning existing literature, the measurements indirectly correlated to the deterioration process are used for the calculation of degradation parameters. Special attention is given to LIB parameters related to battery aging such as capacity fade and internal resistance increase. Existing approaches to these parameters estimation/calculation concern no direct measurement of degradation parameters. Indirect relations can be established assuming suitable assumptions. The contribution addresses the main issues related to LIB parameters monitoring as well as to the adopted control strategy providing high energy efficiency while maintaining as less as possible rate of component degradation.

Bending moment will be induced by the uneven force around the center of bearing. Non-uniform preload methodology is proposed in this paper aiming to stimulate the skewing installation in a spindle. Wavelet threshold technique for noise reduction and wavelet package method for feature extraction were introduced in order to identify the bearing posture through analyzing the vibration signal of the healing. To validate the proposed method, the raw vibration signals are reconstructed, the eigenvector is structured and normalization processing is done between uniform preload and non-uniform preload conditions, respectively. The analysis results shows that the wavelet packet threshold de-noising technology can effectively eliminate the noise of the spindle vibration signal. The bearing posture identification and bearing preload identification are realized through the change of frequency energy.

All damage mechanisms share a common feature namely energy dissipation. Dissipation, as a fundamental measure for irreversibility in a thermodynamic treatment of non-equilibrium processes, is quantified by entropy generation. Based on the theoretical relationship between entropy generation and generalized thermodynamic forces and fluxes, the entropic damage is measured during a corrosion-fatigue degradation experiment. Life estimation of components, which were subject to complex corrosion-fatigue degradation mechanism, was then estimated through a proposed entropic-based prognostic framework. The performance of predictions was evaluated and compared with previous predictions in terms of the influence of additional features on components health assessment.

J	Wang, GP; Wang, JW				Wang, GuiPing; Wang, JiaWei			An Anomaly Detection Framework for Detecting Anomalous Virtual Machines under Cloud Computing Environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cloud Computing; Virtual Machine (VM); Environment-aware; Anomaly Detection; Support Vector Machine (SVM)		A variety of faults may cause performance degradation or even downtime of virtual machines (VMs) under Cloud environment, thus lowering the dependability of Cloud platform. Detecting anomalous VMs before real failures occur is an important means to improve the dependability of Cloud platform. Since the performance or state of VMs may be affected by the environmental factors, this article proposes an environment-aware anomaly detection framework (termed EaAD) for VMs under Cloud environment. EaAD partitions all the VMs in Cloud platform into several monitoring domains based on similarity in running environment, which makes the VMs in a same monitoring domain have similar running environment. In each domain, the equipped anomaly detection algorithm detects anomalous VMs based on their performance metrics. In addition, anomaly detection in a certain monitoring domain faces such challenges as multiple anomaly categories, imbalanced training sample sets, increasing number of training samples.

This paper adopts a new method that uses multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to calculate the multifractal singularity spectrum of soft fault signals of nonlinear analog circuits. Moreover, this method endows the parameters of the spectrum with definite physical meanings including width, maximum singular index, minimum singular index, and corresponding singularity index of the extreme point. Therefore, this method can be applied to characterize the internal dynamic mechanism of the soft fault signals of nonlinear analog circuits, making it suitable for the feature extraction of fault circuits. All multifractal feature parameters can be organized into a feature set, which will be then input to a support vector machine, and fault detection for the nonlinear analog circuit can be conducted via the support vector machine.

The method reconstructs high-dimension phase space from one-dimension vibration signals of different fault states of the rolling bearing so that deep data mining is achieved. Then through analysis of varying correlation dimension of phase space feature signals, FCD that corresponds to each fault state is extracted. The experiment shows that feature correlation dimension extracted by the method is effective to fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. The method can provide reliable feature information for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of complicated rotating machinery, and has a broad application prospect.

After extracting the rolling bearing vibration signal, the denoised signal should be transformed by wavelet packet into several sub-signals which are attached to different frequencies. Next, the wavelet packet correlation coefficient will be calculated. Combined with the information entropy theory, the MRCE is obtained. The signal classification and state identification are realized by support vector machine (SVM) intelligent algorithm, and the results reflect the truth that applying MRCE as the feature index to detect the working state of rotating machinery can get good diagnostic accuracy, so that MRCE can be used in rotating machinery fault diagnosis in the future.

Process monitoring and fault trace for annealing furnace is quite essential for its essential influence on the product quality. In view of the complex annealing process and the nonlinear relationship between the fault reasons and symptoms, nonlinear methods kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is used to monitor the condition and support vector machine (SVM) is used for fault trace. Method based on data reconstruction is used to distinguish the fault variables. Depending on the monitoring method, simulation study for annealing furnace of galvanizing line is conducted. This method proposed is proved usable through results of the simulation experiments.

This technology can be useful for the early diagnosis of complex diseases such as bipolar disorder, providing useful information for its genetic background. The ability to classify bipolar disorders may have a major impact on our understanding of disease pathophysiology, as well as it may be essential for guiding the appropriate treatment strategy and determining prognosis for successful targeted therapy. In this preliminary meta-data-study, we propose an analytic framework for biomarker identification aiming at prediction of bipolar disorder, by considering peripheral gene expression differences between bipolar patients and healthy controls. The aim of this paper is to extract a significant genomic signature for which biological knowledge may already exists and discover novel genomic information that can motivate further analysis. We study two classification algorithms based on support and relevance vector machines. The observed results indicate that the latter approach performs better in the specific biological environment.

In the case of non-stationary conditions, speed variations must be distinguished from angular velocity perturbation caused by the presence of a defect. In the framework of diagnosis of rotating machinery, angular approaches are well suited to make monitoring resistive to speed disturbances. This paper proposes a reformulation of the MCSA associated with angular approach in modeling multiphysic behavior. The resulting model described in this paper can be used to investigate of the influence of the Instantaneous Angular Speed (IAS) variations on the electrical responses of the whole rotating system.

The main advantages with respect to vibration and Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) are the high resolution of the result obtained combined with small data storage. The hi-quality information shows many hi-order harmonics that are not easy to interpret and correlate with the machine construction. In this paper a review of the analytic characteristics frequencies due to electromagnetic effects is reported and, furthermore, theoretical results and experiments are compared. From the comparison obtained, the authors conclude that IAS has the potential of extract information due to the rotor's skewness.

The purpose of the analysis is to detect localized damage in REB. The problem of damage detection in REB is widely described in literature, in general. However, known techniques might be not successful in case of crushers due to presence of heavy non-Gaussian, impulsive noise. Impulsiveness of the signal from bearings is commonly used as an indicator of damage as well as a filter optimization criterion in order to enhance raw observation (to extract informative part-signal of interest (SOI)). A crusher is a kind of machine which use a metal surface to crumble materials into small fractional pieces. During this process, as well as during entering material stream into the crusher, a lot of impacts/shocks appear. They are present in vibration signal acquired from bearing's housing. These non-periodic, strong impulses are non-informative from diagnostic point of view and should be removed from the raw signal before further processing, because they mask completely informative, cyclic impulses related to damaged part of REB. Unfortunately, impulsiveness cannot be basis for signal extraction anymore. So, commonly used kurtosis-based optimization of pre-filtering (kurtogram, spectral kurtosis) cannot be used here. Promising approach is to search for cyclic/periodic nature of impulses (envelope analysis, spectral correlation density, protrugram, etc.). However, as mentioned, even before enveloping there is also a need to pre-filter the signal. In the paper we will introduce the problem including description of the machine, investigation on structure of vibration and we will present preliminary results of vibration processing using protrugram approach. At the end, we will propose an enhancement of protrugram in order to identify cyclo-stationary signal in presence of randomly spaced impulses and narrowband amplitude modulation of discrete components.

The time-varying nature of the IFB might be caused by e.g. time-varying load or speed, time-varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), presence of other damages with distributed nature or time-varying transmission path, especially for source signals that propagate through a rolling element bearing or a planetary gearbox. Linear time-invariant filters cannot follow such phenomena, i. e. they might indicate too wide or too narrow frequency band as informative. Thus, the filtered signal contains too much noise or does not contain the whole information about the damage, respectively. Adaptive blind deconvolution is a time-varying filter which in each step tends to a filter that minimizes or maximizes given criterion of the deconvolved signal. In the classical version it maximizes kurtosis of the deconvolved signal, since high kurtosis (impulsiveness) is expected in the case of local damage. There exist also alternative measures that might provide equivalent results, or sometimes better in specific cases. Such combination of impulsiveness detection and ability of adaptation due to non-stationary operational conditions seems to be very promising. The methodology is illustrated by analysis of real data representing vibration acceleration of a heavy-duty rotating machinery (planetary gearbox used in bucket wheel excavator) operating in industrial conditions of an open-pit mine. The analyzed signal reveals strong dependency between time-varying load applied to the gearbox and properties of cyclic impulses related to damage.

Under such circumstances changes in the calculated features can not be unambiguously associated with change in system condition. In this paper we propose a feature appropriate for diagnosing faults in mechanical drives that is robust to fluctuations in operating conditions. Therefore, its time evolution seems to be correlated only with the machine condition. Instead of relying on spectral properties of the vibration signal, we rather observe changes in the statistical patterns of the derived distribution functions. The effectiveness of the algorithm was evaluated on three datasets comprising both gear and bearing faults under constant and variable load.

However, the quality of the demodulated signal depends on the selected frequency band for demodulation. Kurtogram is widely used to detect the frequency bandwidth which is the most excited by a defect. However in presence of high noises, the Kurtogram may be deficient in effectively detecting the resonances and it presents some instabilities. In the last decade, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique has been used by a lot of researchers for the signal decomposition. In this study, the EMD and Empirical Wavelet (EW) are used to generate a new feature. The EW is used to generate a filter bank which depends on the content of the component frequencies of the signal. A segmentation of the spectrum to define the support boundaries of the filter is proposed. The new indicator is proposed in order to track the frequency band that is more excited by a bearing fault. This study shows that the proposed technique can detect the resonances in all cases of simulation. On the other hand, the proposed method is able first to detect the resonance frequencies and secondly to detect on which Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF), the bearing default occurs. The proposed technique has confirmed its effectiveness by testing it on experimental signals obtained from a test bench with defects on a bearing outer race. A defect of only 40 mu on the outer race has been detected, which makes this method very effective for an early detection of bearing defects.

If the rotating speed of the shaft is invariable, the gear-fault-induced modulation phenomenon which manifest as frequency sidebands equally spaced around the meshing frequency and its harmonics in vibration spectra. The Hilbert transform has been widely used in demodulation of such signals and has given good results. However, under variable rotating speed of the shaft, the meshing frequency and its harmonic and the sidebands vary with time and hence the vibration signal becomes non-stationary. The use directly of the Hilbert transform doesn't allow detecting the variation of the rotating machine and its harmonics which reflect the gear fault. In this study, we propose to use first the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) which is particularly suitable for processing non stationary signals. By using EEMD the signal can be decomposed into a number of IMFs which are mono component, and then we use the Hilbert transform to calculate the instantaneous frequency and the envelope of each IMF. To identify the fault, we apply the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) in second time to the instantaneous frequency to obtain mono component frequency and we calculate the spectrum of each IMF to evaluate the frequency. In this works, to validate this strategy, we analyze simulated signals for healthy and faulty gear boxes when the speed of machine is regular and variable; these models are based on the models of McFadden.

Ideally, thresholds should be selected in a way that the diagnostic system keeps alert to the appearance of fault with minimal delay while under normal conditions false alarms should be avoided. If the thresholds are set too high, missed alarms may occur while too low values implicate false alarms. In practice thresholds are often set heuristically by a skilled person for each component of the machine. The task is nontrivial as usually many thresholds need to be defined. Moreover, a feature may be related to diverse faults with different sensitivity levels. Motivated by this issue, the intention of this paper is to lay the basis for rigorous threshold selection that implies the need for minimal design parameters. The idea is to first elaborate the probabilistic model of the feature. In order to check the relative change in the probabilistic pattern, the statistical hypothesis tests are employed. The only required priors, needed to tune the diagnostic algorithm, are data records collected under nominal condition and the probability of false alarm (PFA) as a sole " tuning knob". Technically, the approach converts into the problem of statistical hypothesis testing. The performance of the algorithms is preliminarily confirmed via simulations and a real case study with a motor drive subjected to imbalance.

In this work, we propose to use angular measurements and support vector machines (SVM) to detect and diagnose gear faults in normal and nonstationary conditions. For this purpose, features are extracted from angular and angle frequency domains of AA, TE, and IAS. Then, the classification is performed by SVM in order to improve the detection and identification of gear defects.

Among many, machine learning and pattern recognition techniques are often applied. When dealing with complex machinery use of one classifier is often insufficient. It is known that classifier ensembles (combined prediction from several classifiers) have the capability to outperform single classifier, because ensemble results are less dependent on peculiarities of a single training set. Additionally a combination of multiple classifiers may learn a more expressive class. In the paper a comparative study of different diversity measures for the rotating machine common faults detection and isolation. The main premise was to investigate if there is a link between diversity measure and classification accuracy. Although in several cases the connection between diversity and fault detection as well as isolation performance was revealed, the generalization of the diversity measuring concept cannot be clearly formulated.

This is particularly based on the premise that affluent information about a rotating machine's operating conditions is usually conveyed by the sounds of the machine. Several earlier studies have already shown the usefulness and capabilities of amplitude spectra for faults diagnosis. However, very limited analyses of rotating machine's vibro-acoustic signals are available in literatures.

In the present work, the misalignment fault of a motor shaft is studied using multi-scale entropy in combination with a back-propagation neural network algorithm. Experiments were performed, first with an aligned motor shaft, and then with a motor shaft that had angular and parallel misalignment at different operating speeds. Real-time motor current and vibration signals from aligned and different misaligned motor shafts were acquired for the diagnosis of faults. The existing literature mostly focused in the context of frequency-domain analysis. However, in this work multi-scale entropy is used, which accounts for the system complexity. A clear indication of reduction in complexity is observed with the faulty system. The proposed methodology is the first of its kind to detect the misalignment fault using the analysis of both vibration and current signals. The proposed work has also successfully identified for different types of misalignment.

In the case of six-phase induction generators, the operation with opened phases is associated with torque and consequently power oscillations even in steady state conditions. Previous works have reported different methods to reduce these oscillations but they only deal with sensored control issues. Therefore, this paper deals with on-line modification of a sensorless control system applied to a squirrel cage six-phase induction generator (SC6PIG) when one to three phases of the machine are lost. Designing ten different off-line Luenberger speed observers as well as ten control systems corresponding to the different possible fault types and switching between them as a function of a detection system is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, on-line imposing of the nonzero initial conditions induces a smooth switching between the observers as well as the controllers with minimum associated transient at switching instants. The proposed strategy is tested on a wind turbine simulator driven by a permanent magnet dc motor. The experimental results in healthy and faulty modes assess the validity of the proposed strategy.

As faulty features of bearings are usually demodulated into a high-frequency band, determining the informative frequency band (IFB) from the vibratory signal is a challenging task for weak fault detection. Existing approaches for IFB determination often divide the frequency spectrum of the signal into even partitions, one of which is regarded as the IFB by an individual selector. This work proposes a fuzzy technique to select the IFB with improvements in two aspects. On the one hand, an IFB-specific fuzzy clustering method is developed to segment the frequency spectrum into meaningful sub-bands. Considering the shortcomings of the individual selectors, on the other hand, three commonly-used selectors are combined using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to guide the clustering. Among all the meaningful sub-bands, the one with the minimum comprehensive cost is determined as the IFB. The bearing faults, if any, can be detected from the demodulated envelope spectrum of the IFB. The proposed fuzzy technique was evaluated using both simulated and experimental data, and then compared with the state-of-the-art peer method. The results indicate that the proposed fuzzy technique is capable of generating a better IFB, and is suitable for detecting bearing faults.

J	Tang, GJ; Wang, XL; He, YL				Tang, Guiji; Wang, Xiaolong; He, Yuling			A Novel Method of Fault Diagnosis for Rolling Bearing Based on Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Packet Transform and Improved Multiscale Permutation Entropy	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TANGENT-SPACE ALIGNMENT; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; MACHINE	A novel method of fault diagnosis for rolling bearing, which combines the dual tree complex wavelet packet transform(DTCWPT), the improved multiscale permutation entropy (IMPE), and the linear local tangent space alignment (LLTSA) with the extreme learning machine (ELM), is put forward in this paper. In this method, in order to effectively discover the underlying feature information, DTCWPT, which has the attractive properties as nearly shift invariance and reduced aliasing, is firstly utilized to decompose the original signal into a set of subband signals. Then, IMPE, which is designed to reduce the variability of entropy measures, is applied to characterize the properties of each obtained subband signal at different scales. Furthermore, the feature vectors are constructed by combining IMPE of each subband signal. After the feature vectors construction, LLTSA is employed to compress the high dimensional vectors of the training and the testing samples into the low dimensional vectors with better distinguishability. Finally, the ELM classifier is used to automatically accomplish the condition identification with the low dimensional feature vectors. The experimental data analysis results validate the effectiveness of the presented diagnosis method and demonstrate that this method can be applied to distinguish the different fault types and fault degrees of rolling bearings.

Even if lot of work has been done regarding these methodologies applied on machines or industrial plants, the same care is not applied to other critical devices. In the case of Low Voltage Circuit Breakers, in particular for critical applications, conservative approaches are usually applied. That implies a scheduled replacement of devices could occur with a significant Remaining Useful-Life. This paper deals with Pattern Recognition techniques supporting the first step of prognostics of an electrical circuit breaker. The goal is to develop a methodology for Fault Detection, the first phase of a system of Fault Detection and Isolation.	[Campagnoni, V.

Firstly, PSO algorithm is chosen to determine the optimum parameters of SVM, to avoid the blindness of choosing parameters, improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Then, PSO-SVM is applied to predict the fault diagnosis of diesel engine, and compared with the traditional BP neural network (BPNN) and RBFNN network. The result shows that the prediction accuracy of PSO-SVM is greatly improved compared with BPNN and RBFNN, thus PSO-SVM is developed as an efficient tool so that various SVMs can be used conveniently as the core of PSO-SVM for diagnosis of diesel engine.

J	Liu, KB; Huang, S				Liu, Kaibo; Huang, Shuai			Integration of Data Fusion Methodology and Degradation Modeling Process to Improve Prognostics	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data fusion; degradation modeling; prognostics; remaining life prediction	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; DIAGNOSTICS; ALGORITHMS; SIGNALS; LEVEL	The rapid development of sensing and computing technologies has enabled multiple sensors embedded in a system to simultaneously monitor the degradation status of an operation unit. This creates a data-rich environment for degradation modeling and prognostics that could potentially lead to an accurate inference about the remaining lifetime of the degraded unit. However, as data collected from multiple sensors are often correlated and each sensor data contains only partial information about the same degradation process, there is a pressing need to develop data fusion methodologies that can integrate the data from multiple sensors for better characterizing the stochastic nature of the degradation process. Unlike other existing data fusion methodologies that treat the fusion procedure and the degradation modeling as two separate tasks, this paper aims at solving these two challenging problems in a unified manner. Specifically, we develop a methodology to construct a health index via fusion of multiple degradation-based sensor data. Our goal is that the developed health index provides a much better characterization of the condition of the unit and thus leads to a better prediction of the remaining lifetime.

While the research on multivariate statistical process monitoring tools is vast, the application of these tools for big data sets has received less attention. In this expository paper, we give an overview of the current state of data-driven multivariate statistical process monitoring methodology. We highlight some of the main directions involving statistical learning and dimension reduction techniques applied to control charts in research from supply chain, engineering, computer science, and statistics. The goal of this paper is to bring into better focus some of the monitoring and surveillance methodology informed by data mining techniques that show promise for monitoring large and diverse data sets. We introduce an example using Wikipedia search information and illustrate a few of the complexities of applying the available methods to a high-dimensional monitoring scenario. Throughout, we offer advice to practitioners and some suggestions for future research in this emerging area of research.	[Weese, Maria; Martinez, Waldyn; Jones-Farmer, L.

In this paper, a machine learning based aeroengine sensor analytical redundancy technique is developed and verified through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. The modified online sequential extreme learning machine, selective updating regularized online sequential extreme learning machine (SROS-ELM), is employed to train the model online and estimate sensor measurements. It selectively updates the output weights of neural networks according to the prediction accuracy and the norm of output weight vector, tackles the problems of singularity and ill-posedness by regularization, and adopts a dual activation function in the hidden nodes combing neural and wavelet theory to enhance prediction capability. The experimental results verify the good generalization performance of SROS-ELM and show that the developed analytical redundancy technique for aeroengine sensor fault diagnosis based on SROS-ELM is effective and feasible.

J	Liu, PY; Li, B; Han, CE; Wang, F				Liu, Peng-yuan; Li, Bing; Han, Cui-e; Wang, Feng			Feature Extraction and Selection Scheme for Intelligent Engine Fault Diagnosis Based on 2DNMF, Mutual Information, and NSGA-II	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GENERALIZED S-TRANSFORM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DECISION TREE; FILTER; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTRUM	A novel feature extraction and selection scheme is presented for intelligent engine fault diagnosis by utilizing two-dimensional nonnegative matrix factorization (2DNMF), mutual information, and nondominated sorting genetic algorithms II (NSGA-II). Experiments are conducted on an engine test rig, in which eight different engine operating conditions including one normal condition and seven fault conditions are simulated, to evaluate the presented feature extraction and selection scheme. In the phase of feature extraction, the.. transform technique is firstly utilized to convert the engine vibration signals to time-frequency domain, which can provide richer information on engine operating conditions. Then a novel feature extraction technique, named two-dimensional nonnegative matrix factorization, is employed for characterizing the time-frequency representations. In the feature selection phase, a hybrid filter and wrapper scheme based on mutual information and NSGA-II is utilized to acquire a compact feature subset for engine fault diagnosis. Experimental results by adopted three different classifiers have demonstrated that the proposed feature extraction and selection scheme can achieve a very satisfying classification performance with fewer features for engine fault diagnosis.

J	Bayar, H; Terzi, UK				Bayar, Haydar; Terzi, Umit Kemalettin			Grid-connected induction generator interturn fault analysis using a PCA-ANN-based algorithm	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						PCA; induction generator; faults; protection	WIND TURBINE; PROTECTION ALGORITHM; FIXED-SPEED; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; DIAGNOSIS	It is difficult for short circuits among the internal windings of one phase in electrical machines to be determined in a reliable and speedy manner. The failure currents that occur, especially in short circuits with a few windings, are at such low levels that they cannot be determined by relay systems. This results in growing faults and damage. In this study, we designed a model that can define winding failures successfully at very small levels by using the PCA and ANN algorithms. We tested the real-time faults and measured the system performance with the installed test rig. The developed protection model determined fault determination in very small (2.5%) winding failures with acceptable accuracy. The suggested model is a counter-speed, selective, flexible, and economical protection model that may be used for internal failures of electrical machines. It has a structure that may be used in different systems or kinds of failure with data receiving and software changes.

J	Fang, YS; Zhang, QS				Fang, Yu-Shun; Zhang, Qing-Song			Quality of life after lumbar spinal surgery.	BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH-INDIA			English	Article						Lumbar spinal stenosis; HRQoL; Quality of life; Prognosis; Surgery	STENOSIS	Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common disease for spinal surgeries among elderly adults. However, the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after LSS has not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the HRQoL after surgery in 127 patients with LSS in a Chinese population. The Medical Outcome Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate the HRQoL before surgery and one year after the treatment. We observed improvements in all 8 domains of the HRQoL one year after discharge, though only those in two mental health domains and three physical health domains. Nevertheless, comparing with a healthy reference group, the HRQoL among these patients remained poorer in all domains. Our study suggests that surgical treatment may improve HRQoL in patients with LSS. This study also implies that the HRQoL assessment is a useful tool to assess the outcomes in patients with LSS after surgeries.

This method is achieved through constructing an Adaboost combined with a weak RVM multiclassifier based on a binary tree, and the fault features are extracted from the three phase shifts between the line current and the phase voltage of IM by establishing a global stator faulty model. The simulation results show that, compared with other competitors, the proposed method has a higher precision and a stronger generalization capability, and it can accurately detect and locate an interturn short circuit fault, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The proposed method consists of two stages. Firstly, the data features are extracted from the CCFA, which, calculated from dynamic responses and as a representation of the modal shapes of the structure, changes when damage occurs on the structure. The data features are then input into the SVM with the one-against-one (OAO) algorithm to classify the damage status of the structure. The simulation data of IASC-ASCE benchmark model and a vibration experiment of truss structure are adopted to verify the feasibility of proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is suitable for the damage identification of skeletal structures with the limited sensors subjected to ambient excitation. As the CCFA based data features are sensitive to damage, the proposed method demonstrates its reliability in the diagnosis of structures with damage, especially for those with minor damage. In addition, the proposed method shows better noise robustness and is more suitable for noisy environments.

Currently, researches on fault prediction are mainly focused on the evaluation of the intensities of the failure and the remaining life of the machine. There is lack of methods on the prediction of fault locations and fault characters. To satisfy the requirement of the prediction of the fault characters, the data acquisition and fusion strategies were studied. Firstly, the traditional vibration measurement mechanism and its disadvantages were presented. Then, the full-vector data acquisition and fusion model were proposed. After that, the sampling procedure and information fusion algorithm were analyzed. At last, the fault prediction method based on full-vector spectrum was proposed. The methodology is that of Dr. Bently and Dr. Muszynska. On the basis of this methodology, the application study has been carried out. The uncertainty of the spectrum structure can be eliminated by the designed data acquisition and fusion method. The reliability of the diagnosis on fault character was improved.

J	Yao, DC; Yang, JW; Li, X; Zhao, CQ				Yao, Dechen; Yang, Jianwei; Li, Xi; Zhao, Chunqing			A Hybrid Approach for Fault Diagnosis of Railway Rolling Bearings Using STWD-EMD-GA-LSSVM	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; OPTIMIZATION; EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM; SELECTION; MACHINE; SYSTEM	Vibration signals resulting from railway rolling bearings are nonstationary by nature; this paper proposes a hybrid approach for the fault diagnosis of railway rolling bearings using segment threshold wavelet denoising (STWD), empirical mode decomposition (EMD), genetic algorithm (GA), and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). The original signal is first denoised using STWD as a prefilter, which improves the subsequent decomposition into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using EMD. Secondly, the IMF energy-torques are extracted as feature parameters. Concurrently, a GA is employed to optimize the LSSVM to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, the extracted features are used as inputs for classification by the GA-LSSVM. Actual railway rolling bearing vibration signals are used to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the novel method is effective and accurate for fault diagnosis of railway rolling bearings.

The key variable that could be used for diagnostic purposes is vibration amplitude of MF corpse. However its mode values include a great deal of randomness. Therefore the application of deterministic dependencies with correcting coefficients is non-effective for MF predictive modeling. Standard statistical and probabilistic (Bayesian) approaches are also inapplicable to estimate MF vibration state due to non-stationarity, non-ergodicity and the significant noise level of the monitored vibrations. Adequate for the case methods of computational intelligence [fuzzy logic, neural networks and more general AI techniques-the precedents' method or machine learning (ML)] must be used. The present paper describes promising initial results on applying the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) approach for intelligent diagnostic of the mill fan working capacity using its vibration state.

There are several techniques associated with the fault diagnosis in rotating machinery; however, vibration and stator currents analysis are commonly used due to their proven reliability. Indeed, vibration and current analysis provide fault condition information by means of the fault-related spectral component identification. This work presents a methodology based on vibration and current analysis for the diagnosis of wear in a gearbox and the detection of bearing defect in an induction motor both linked to the same kinematic chain; besides, the location of the fault-related components for analysis is supported by the corresponding theoretical models. The theoretical models are based on calculation of characteristic gearbox and bearings fault frequencies, in order to locate the spectral components of the faults. In this work, the influence of vibrations over the system is observed by performing motor current signal analysis to detect the presence of faults. The obtained results show the feasibility of detecting multiple faults in a kinematic chain, making the proposed methodology suitable to be used in the application of industrial machinery diagnosis.

Models and Data Sources Used in Systems Medicine A Systematic Literature Review	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Review						Systems medicine; systematic literature review; data sources; models; medical informatics	PERSONALIZED MEDICINE; GENE-EXPRESSION; BIG DATA; THERAPY; BIOLOGY; DRUG; REALIZATION; PROGRESSION; UNDERSTAND; DISEASES	Background: Systems medicine is a new approach for the development and selection of treatment strategies for patients with complex diseases. It is often referred to as the application of systems biology methods for decision making in patient care. For systems medicine computer applications, many different data sources have to be integrated and included into models. This is a challenging task for Medical Informatics since the approach exceeds traditional systems like Electronic Health Records. To prioritize research activities for systems medicine applications, it is necessary to get an overview over modelling methods and data sources already used in this field. Objectives: We performed a systematic literature review with the objective to capture current use of 1) modelling methods and 2) data sources in systems medicine related research projects. Methods: We queried the MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases for papers associated with the search term systems medicine and related terms. Papers were screened and assessed in full text in a two-step process according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Results: The queries returned 698 articles of which 34 papers were finally included into the study. A multitude of modelling approaches such as machine learning and network analysis was identified and classified. Since these approaches are also used in other domains, no methods specific for systems medicine could be identified. Omics data are the most widely used data types followed by clinical data. Most studies only include a rather limited number of data sources. Conclusions: Currently, many different modelling approaches are used in systems medicine. Thus, highly flexible modular solutions are necessary for systems medicine clinical applications. However, the number of data sources included into the models is limited and most projects currently focus on prognosis. To leverage the potential of systems medicine further, it will be necessary to focus on treatment strategies for patients and consider a broader range of data.

Plant operators often face difficulties in predicting appropriate time for maintenance and would usually rely on time based predictive maintenance intervals as recommended by original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The objective of this work is to develop the computational model to find the isentropic head value using genetic programming. The isentropic head value is calculated from the OEM performance chart. Inlet mass flow rate and speed of the compressor are taken as the input value. The obtained results from the GP computational models show good agreement with experimental and target data with the average prediction error of 1.318%. The genetic programming computational model will assist machinery engineers to quantify performance deterioration of gas compressor and the results from this study will be then utilized to estimate future maintenance requirements based on the historical data. In general, this genetic programming modelling provides a powerful solution for gas compressor operators to realize predictive maintenance approach in their operations.

Firstly, the current signals are decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The Hilbert Huang spectrum for each IMF is an energy representation in the time-frequency domain using the instantaneous frequency. The marginal spectrum of each IMF can then be obtained. Secondly, the IMFs that includes dominant fault information are modeled using an autoregressive (AR) model. Finally, the AR model parameters serve as the input fault feature vectors to support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Experimental studies show that the marginal spectrum of the second IMF can be used for the detection and classification of bearing faults. The proposed approach provides a viable signal processing tool for an online machine health status monitoring.

A New Feature Extraction Technique Based on 1D Local Binary Pattern for Gear Fault Detection	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							MODEL	Gear fault detection is one of the underlying research areas in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machines. Many methods have been proposed as an approach. One of the major tasks to obtain the best fault detection is to examine what type of feature(s) should be taken out to clarify/improve the situation. In this paper, a new method is used to extract features from the vibration signal, called 1D local binary pattern (1D LBP). Vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal, break, and crack gears are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from the original signals are utilized as inputs to a classifier based on.. Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for three classes (normal, break, or crack). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated for gear fault detection, on the vibration data obtained from the Prognostic Health Monitoring (PHM'09) Data Challenge. The experiment results show that the 1D LBP method can extract the effective and relevant features for detecting fault in the gear. Moreover, we have adopted the LOSO and LOLO cross-validation approaches to investigate the effects of speed and load in fault detection.

J	Shi, PM; Su, CJ; Han, DY				Shi, Peiming; Su, Cuijiao; Han, Dongying			Fault Diagnosis of Rotating Machinery Based on Adaptive Stochastic Resonance and AMD-EEMD	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ENTROPY	An adaptive stochastic resonance and analytical mode decomposition-ensemble empirical mode decomposition (AMD-EEMD) method is proposed for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery in this paper. Firstly, the stochastic resonance system is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the best structure parameters are obtained. Then, the signal with noise is put into the stochastic resonance system and denoising and enhancing the signal. Secondly, the signal output from the stochastic resonance system is extracted by analytical mode decomposition (AMD) method. Finally, the signal is decomposed by ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The simulation results show that the optimal stochastic resonance system can effectively improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the number of effective components of EEMD decomposition is significantly reduced after using AMD, thus improving the decomposition results of EEMD and enhancing the amplitude of components frequency. Through the extraction of the rolling bearing fault signal feature proved that the method has a good effect.

J	Mahgoun, H; Chaari, F; Felkaoui, A				Mahgoun, Hafida; Chaari, Fakher; Felkaoui, Ahmed			Detection of gear faults in variable rotating speed using variational mode decomposition (VMD)	MECHANICS & INDUSTRY			English	Article						Vibration analysis; non stationary operation; time-varying frequency; variational mode decomposition (VMD); ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); gear fault detection; rotating machines	TRANSFORM; AMPLITUDE	The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was largely used in the diagnosis of the rotating machines, this method could detect the defect at an early stage in the case of non variable speed or slightly variable, but when the speed of the machine varies in acceleration or deceleration the use of the EEMD under these conditions shows a limitation with the detection of the impulses, that are influenced by the presence of the mode mixing, and the end effect. To detect the shocks due to the defect where the variation of speed is forced by the working conditions, we propose to use the Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) which was recently proposed by Konstantin Dragomiretskiy. This method gave promising results in the detection of the defects on machine elements under non stationary conditions imposed by the variation of speed and torque. In this work, first we show by simulated signal the advantage of VMD compared to the EEMD in the detection of impulses in the case of variable speed and load. Then, we analyze vibration signals given by a dynamic modeling of a gear transmission in the case of non stationary load and speed, for healthy gear and two different of localized faults (early and advanced). The modes are extracted using VMD and followed by calculation of spectrogram and statistics values, which give more information about the defect and allow us to detect it at an early stage.

J	Qin, WL; Zhang, WJ; Lu, C				Qin, Wei-Li; Zhang, Wen-Jin; Lu, Chen			A Method for Aileron Actuator Fault Diagnosis Based on PCA and PGC-SVM	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Aileron actuators are pivotal components for aircraft flight control system. Thus, the fault diagnosis of aileron actuators is vital in the enhancement of the reliability and fault tolerant capability. This paper presents an aileron actuator fault diagnosis approach combining principal component analysis (PCA), grid search (GS), 10-fold cross validation (CV), and one-versus-one support vector machine (SVM). This method is referred to as PGC-SVM and utilizes the direct drive valve input, force motor current, and displacement feedback signal to realize fault detection and location. First, several common faults of aileron actuators, which include force motor coil break, sensor coil break, cylinder leakage, and amplifier gain reduction, are extracted from the fault quadrantal diagram; the corresponding fault mechanisms are analyzed. Second, the data feature extraction is performed with dimension reduction using PCA. Finally, the GS and CV algorithms are employed to train a one-versus-one SVM for fault classification, thus obtaining the optimal model parameters and assuring the generalization of the trained SVM, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four types of faults are introduced into the simulation model established by AMESim and Simulink. The results demonstrate its desirable diagnostic performance which outperforms that of the traditional SVM by comparison.

ASTF is proposed to obtain weak fault features under background noise, ASTF is based on statistic hypothesis testing in the frequency domain to evaluate similarity between reference signal (noise signal) and original signal, and remove the component of high similarity. The optimal level of significance is obtained using particle swarm optimization (PSO). To evaluate the performance of the ASTF, evaluation factor I-pq is also defined. In addition, a simulation experiment is designed to verify the effectiveness and robustness of ASTF. A sensitive evaluation method using principal component analysis (PCA) is proposed to evaluate the sensitiveness of symptom parameters (SPs) for condition diagnosis. By this way, the good SPs that have high sensitiveness for condition diagnosis can be selected. A three-layer DBN is developed to identify condition of rotation machinery based on the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) theory. Condition diagnosis experiment for rolling element bearings demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Discovering Cluster Dynamics Using Kernel Spectral Methods	COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS: DYNAMICS, CONTROLS AND APPLICATIONS	Springer Complexity		English	Article; Book Chapter							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE	Networks represent patterns of interactions between components of complex systems present in nature, science, technology and society. Furthermore, graph theory allows to perform insightful analysis for different kinds of data by representing the instances as nodes of a weighted network, where the weights characterize similarity between the data points. In this chapter we describe a number of algorithms to perform cluster analysis, that is finding groups of similar items (called clusters or communities) and understand their evolution over time. These algorithms are designed in a kernel-based framework: the original data are mapped into an high dimensional feature space; linear models are designed in this space; complex nonlinear relationships between the data in the original input space can then be detected. Applications like fault detection in industrial machines, community detection of static and evolving networks, image segmentation, incremental time-series clustering and text clustering are considered.

J	Bao, XH; Wang, HF; Di, C; Cheng, ZH				Bao, Xiaohua; Wang, Hanfeng; Di, Chong; Cheng, Zhiheng			Magnetic field monitoring in submersible motor under eccentricity fault considering slotting effect	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS AND MECHANICS			English	Article						Submersible motors; eccentricity fault; diagnostic signal; slotting effect	ROTOR ECCENTRICITY; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; INDUCTION MACHINE; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS; FLUX	Large submersible motors make a huge contribution to national security prevention and control of water. But the eccentricity fault has a strong impact on the operational reliability. Therefore, this paper uses new diagnostic signals of air-gap magnetic field to detect eccentricity fault in submersible motor. Compared with the previous papers, this paper combines the effects of eccentricity and slotting. Firstly, a new air-gap permeance model is established considering slotting effect aimed at eccentric motor. Then the time harmonics of air-gap magnetic field are obtained based on MMF and permeance wave approach. Compared with healthy motor, the characteristic frequencies are chosen as diagnostic signals. The air-gap magnetic field is measured by search coil placed around stator tooth. The way is applied to detecting dynamic eccentricity and mixed eccentricity. Finally, for validating the theoretical results, the induced voltages of search coil are gained under different conditions in high voltage submersible motor by finite element method. The simulation is consistent with the theory in the process of data analysis.

Within this framework, fuzzy logic was proposed for planning the predictive maintenance activities of the textile machines. A fuzzy decision making system was developed and its effectiveness was illustrated for the planning of the predictive maintenance of a sewing machine needle.

Due to misoperation, manufacturing deficiencies, or the lack of monitoring and maintenance, it is often found to be the most unreliable component within these systems. Therefore, effective and efficient fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings has an important role in ensuring the continued safe and reliable operation of their host systems. This study presents a trace ratio criterion-based kernel discriminant analysis (TR-KDA) for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. The binary immune genetic algorithm (BIGA) is employed to solve the trace ratio problem in TR-KDA. The numerical results obtained using extensive simulation indicate that the proposed TR-KDA using BIGA (called TR-KDA-BIGA) can effectively and efficiently classify different classes of rolling element bearing data, while also providing the capability of real-time visualization that is very useful for the practitioners to monitor the health status of rolling element bearings. Empirical comparisons show that the proposed TR-KDA-BIGA performs better than existing methods in classifying different classes of rolling element bearing data. The proposed TR-KDA-BIGA may be a promising tool for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings.

The fault detection is accomplished by interpreting well-defined measurements into the machine mathematical model. First, the studied machine is modeled by means of a dynamic state-space model in the abc reference frame. This model simulates the machine behavior under healthy and faulty cases in both transient and steady-state conditions. The signature of the interturn fault is captured using the magnetic pendulous oscillation technique. The proposed inverse problem is validated numerically and experimentally. The results show the robustness of the proposed scheme against the measurement noise.

J	Jiang, XX; Li, SM; Wang, Q				Jiang, Xingxing; Li, Shunming; Wang, Qian			A Study on Defect Identification of Planetary Gearbox under Large Speed Oscillation	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TIME-FREQUENCY FEATURE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL; VIBRATION; ORDER; EXTRACTION; TRANSFORM; BEARINGS	Rotational speed of a reference shaft is the key information for planetary gearbox condition monitoring under nonstationary conditions. As the time-variant speed and load of planetary gearboxes result in time-variant characteristic frequencies as well as vibration magnitudes, the conventional methods tracking time-frequency ridge perform a poor robustness, especially for large speed variations. In this paper, two schemes, time-frequency ridge fusion and logarithm transformation, are proposed to track the targeted ridge curve reliably. Meanwhile, the identified ridge curve by logarithm scheme can be further refined by the time-frequency ridge fusion scheme. Hence, a procedure involving the proposed ridge estimation methods is presented to diagnose the planetary gearbox defects. Two simulation signals and a vibration signal collected from a planetary gearbox in practical engineering (provided by the conference on condition monitoring of machinery in nonstationary operations (CMMNO)) are used to verify the proposed methods. It is validated that the proposed methods can well-track the targeted ridge curve compared with two conventional methods. As a result, the characteristic frequency of each component in the planetary gearbox is clearly demonstrated and the inner race defect of one of the planet bearings is successfully discovered in the order spectrum depending on the derived expression of planet bearing fault frequency.

The vibration signals of rotating machines were decomposed by local mean decomposition to obtain the signal components, and then energy moment is calculated for each state feature component for feature extraction. For state identification, the directed acyclic graph support vector machine is established, multiple classical support vector machine were trained, and then multi-state identification was completed using directed acyclic graph support vector machine.

To demonstrate the potential capability of the proposed approach for the typical interpolated and extrapolated predictions, other two classical data-driven modeling methods including feed-forward back-propagation neural network and support vector machine are compared. An assessment is performed and discussed on the sensitivity of different models to the number of training samples (48 training samples, 32 training samples, and 18 training samples). All the results indicate that the proposed neural network in this article has superior prediction performance to the existing feed-forward back-propagation neural network and support vector machine, especially for the extrapolation with small samples. Furthermore, this study can be utilized in refining the existing performance-based modeling for improved simulation analysis, condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis of gas turbine compressor.

J	Naderi, P				Naderi, Peyman			Inter-turn short-circuit fault detection in saturable squirrel-cage induction motor using magnetic equivalent circuit model	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Induction motor; Modelling	SYNCHRONOUS RELUCTANCE MACHINE; STATOR-CURRENT; ECCENTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS; ROTOR; HEALTHY; SIGNATURE	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to obtain an integrated method for inter-turn short circuit fault detection for the cage-rotor induction machine (CRIM) considering saturation effect. Design/methodology/approach - The magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed for machine modeling and nonlinear B-H curve is considered for saturation effect. The machine has some differential equations which are converted to algebraic type by trapezoidal method. On the other hand, some nonlinear equations are present due to saturation effect. A set of nonlinear algebraic equation should be solved by numerical method. Therefore, the Newton-Raphson technique is used for equation solving during of the considered time step. Findings - Generally, the operating point of electrical machines is close to the saturation zone due to designing considerations. Moreover, some current and torque harmonics will be produced due to time and space harmonics combination, which cannot be studied when saturation modeling is neglected. Considering both space and time harmonics, a method is proposed for inter-turn short circuit fault detection based on the stator current signatures and the machine performance is analyzed in healthy and faulty cases. In order to obtain the integrated method, two sample machines (two and also four-pole machines) are modeled and finally the accuracy of the proposed method is verified through the experimental results. Research limitations/implications - The calculations have been done in this work is limited to CRIM considering. However, the presented modeling method can be used for another types of electrical machines by some minor modifications. Originality/value - Obtaining of an integrated formula for the inter-turn short circuit fault detection which has been presented for first time is the more advantages of present work. Moreover, in order to saturation effect considering, a new method is presented for solving of nonlinear equations which is another novelty of paper.

The fault detection scheme starts by computing the baseline principal component analysis (PCA) model from the healthy or undamaged wind turbine. Subsequently, when the structure is inspected or supervised, new measurements are obtained are projected into the baseline PCA model. When both sets of datathe baseline and the data from the current wind turbineare compared, a statistical hypothesis testing is used to make a decision on whether or not the wind turbine presents some damage, fault or misbehavior. The effectiveness of the proposed fault-detection scheme is illustrated by numerical simulations on a well-known large offshore wind turbine in the presence of wind turbulence and realistic fault scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed strategy provides and early fault identification, thereby giving the operators sufficient time to make more informed decisions regarding the maintenance of their machines.

Because of the limitation of a lack of samples of each fault type; some fault conditions can be recognized as a normal condition. The fault diagnosis results of HVCBs seriously affect the operation reliability of the entire power system. In order to improve the fault diagnosis accuracy of HVCBs; a method for mechanical fault diagnosis of HVCBs based on wavelet time-frequency entropy (WTFE) and one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) is proposed. In this method; the S-transform (ST) is proposed to analyze the energy time-frequency distribution of HVCBs' vibration signals. Then; WTFE is selected as the feature vector that reflects the information characteristics of vibration signals in the time and frequency domains. OCSVM is used for judging whether a mechanical fault of HVCBs has occurred or not. In order to improve the fault detection accuracy; a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of OCSVM; including the window width of the kernel function and error limit. If the mechanical fault is confirmed; a support vector machine (SVM)-based classifier will be used to recognize the fault type. The experiments carried on a real SF6 HVCB demonstrated the improved effectiveness of the new approach.

In order to reveal the internal chaotic properties, vibration intensity time series are reconstructed based on chaos theory in phase-space, the delay time is computed with C-C method and the optimal embedding dimension and saturated correlation dimension are calculated via the Grassberger-Procaccia (G-P) method, respectively, so that the chaotic characteristics of vibration intensity time series can be jointly determined by the largest Lyapunov exponent and phase plane trajectory of vibration intensity time series, meanwhile, the largest Lyapunov exponent is calculated by the Wolf method and phase plane trajectory is illustrated using Duffing-Holmes Oscillator (DHO). The Hurst exponent and long range dependence prediction method are proposed to verify the typical fractional order features and improve the prediction accuracy of bearing vibration intensity time series, respectively. Experience shows that the vibration intensity time series have chaotic properties and the LRD prediction method is better than the other prediction methods (largest Lyapunov, auto regressive moving average (ARMA) and BP neural network (BPNN) model) in prediction accuracy and prediction performance, which provides a new approach for running tendency predictions for rotating machinery and provide some guidance value to the engineering practice.

J	Lu, WQ; Zhang, LB; Liang, W; Yu, XC				Lu, Wenqing; Zhang, Laibin; Liang, Wei; Yu, Xuchao			A novel feature extraction and optimisation method for fault diagnosis by combining WPT with FCM	INSIGHT			English	Article						feature extraction and optimisation; fault diagnosis; wavelet packet transform; fuzzy c-means; support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ENTROPY; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORM; ENERGY	In the process of fault diagnosis, features of the vibration signals have to be extracted and optimised before fault pattern recognition. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is one of most widely used methods in feature extraction for fault diagnosis. According to a number of previous studies, a vibration signal can be decomposed into several nodes (sub-bands) by WPT, and then Shannon entropies of all the nodes are calculated to compose a vector, which is taken as the feature of the vibration signal in the subsequent processing. However, not all the elements included in the feature vector contain useful information for fault diagnosis. Without optimisation, the computation quantity of fault pattern recognition would be increased and the accuracy of fault diagnosis would be decreased. Therefore, a novel feature extraction and optimisation method called WPT-FCM, which combines WPT with fuzzy c-means (FCM), is proposed to solve the problem in this paper. FCM is employed to identify and remove the useless elements in the feature vector and a new feature vector can be obtained after optimisation. Next, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained by new feature vectors of known fault samples and then unknown faults can be identified accordingly. A case study of rotor fault diagnosis conducted on a rotor model system (RMS) experiment platform has been performed to validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method. The result of experimental verification shows that the accuracy of fault diagnosis by WPT-FCM has been improved significantly compared with WPT- and PCA-based methods.

J	Huang, CG; Wu, F; Zhao, J; Zhou, DH				Huang, Chengguang; Wu, Feng; Zhao, Jin; Zhou, Dehong			A novel fault diagnosis method in SVPWM voltage-source inverters for vector controlled induction motor drives	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS AND MECHANICS			English	Article						PWM voltage-source-inverter; induction motor drives; inverter; open-circuit; fault diagnosis	MACHINE DRIVE; PWM INVERTER; MODES	This paper presents a novel single and multiple open circuit fault detection and identification method for three phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) fed vector controlled drives. In healthy condition, d-axis reference voltage is constant. When fault occurs, it is distorted, which is applied to detect the insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) open circuit fault occurrence. The d-axis reference voltage distorted last for an interval time, the fault can be isolated by calculating the instant current vector rotating angles when the d-axis reference voltage gets distorted and recovered to constant, respectively, combined with space position of the current arc trajectory. The proposed method is fair robust to load torque changes and variable speed, and can be embedded into the existing drive software as a subroutine without excessive computational effort. The feasibility of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithm is evaluated by both simulation and experimental results.

First, demagnetization patterns, such as equality, inequality, and weighted demagnetizations, are defined and classified by considering the possibility of demagnetization resulting from motor operating characteristics. Second, an available diagnostic model for the harmonic analysis of BEMFs is defined according to pole slot coefficients because the characteristics of BEMFs under demagnetization conditions are affected by the combination of poles and slots. Third, BEMFs and their harmonic components under normal and demagnetization conditions are analyzed through simulation and experiment to verify the proposed demagnetization detection technique.

Sample entropy and multiscale entropy are used to extract the desired entropy features from motor vibration signals. Sample entropy is used to estimate the complexity of the original time series while multiscale entropy is employed to measure the complexity of time series in different scales. The entropy features are directly extracted from the nonlinear, nonstationary induction motor vibration signals which are then sorted by using mutual information so that the elements in the feature vector are ranked according to their importance and relevant to the faults. The first five most important features are selected from the feature vectors and classified using support vector machine. The proposed method is then employed to analyze the vibration data acquired from a motor fault simulator test rig. The classification results confirm that the proposed method can effectively diagnose various motor faults with reasonable good accuracy. It is also shown that the proposed method can provide an effective and accurate fault diagnosis for various induction motor faults using only vibration data.

J	Chebel-Morello, B; Malinowski, S; Senoussi, H				Chebel-Morello, Brigitte; Malinowski, Simon; Senoussi, Hafida			Feature selection for fault detection systems: application to the Tennessee Eastman process	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Feature selection; Wrapper method; Fault detection; Contextual measure	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; MACHINE; DIAGNOSIS; RELEVANCE	In fault detection systems, a massive amount of data gathered from the life-cycle of equipment is often used to learn models or classifiers that aims at diagnosing different kinds of errors or failures. Among this huge quantity of information, some features (or sets of features) are more correlated with a kind of failure than another. The presence of irrelevant features might affect the performance of the classifier. To improve the performance of a detection system, feature selection is hence a key step. We propose in this paper an algorithm named STRASS, which aims at detecting relevant features for classification purposes. In certain cases, when there exists a strong correlation between some features and the associated class, conventional feature selection algorithms fail at selecting the most relevant features. In order to cope with this problem, STRASS algorithm uses k-way correlation between features and the class to select relevant features. To assess the performance of STRASS, we apply it on simulated data collected from the Tennessee Eastman chemical plant simulator. The Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) has been used in many fault detection studies and three specific faults are not well discriminated with conventional algorithms. The results obtained by STRASS are compared to those obtained with reference feature selection algorithms. We show that the features selected by STRASS always improve the performance of a classifier compared to the whole set of original features and that the obtained classification is better than with most of the other feature selection algorithms.

Time-frequency analysis gives insight into the structure of an arbitrary nonstationary signal in joint time-frequency domain, but conventional time-frequency representations suffer from either time-frequency smearing or cross-term interferences. Reassigned wavelet scalogram has merits of fine time-frequency resolution and cross-term free nature but has very limited applications in machinery fault diagnosis. In this paper, we use reassigned wavelet scalogram to extract fault feature from wind turbine planetary gearbox vibration signals. Both experimental and in situ vibration signals are used to evaluate the effectiveness of reassigned wavelet scalogram in fault diagnosis of wind turbine planetary gearbox. For experimental evaluation, the gear characteristic instantaneous frequency curves on time-frequency plane are clearly pinpointed in both local and distributed sun gear fault cases. For in situ evaluation, the periodical impulses due to planet gear fault are also clearly identified. The results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of reassigned wavelet scalogram in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under nonstationary conditions.

To address the end distortion and frequency aliasing issues in conventional lifting wavelet transform, a Volterra series assisted undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform (ULWPT) is investigated for machinery incipient fault diagnosis. Undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform is firstly formulated to eliminate the frequency aliasing issue in traditional lifting wavelet packet transform. Next, Volterra series, as a boundary treatment method, is used to preprocess the signal to suppress the end distortion in undecimated lifting wavelet packet transform. Finally, the decomposed wavelet coefficients are trimmed to the original length as the signal of interest for machinery incipient fault detection. Experimental study on a reciprocating compressor is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method. The results show that the presented method outperforms the conventional approach by dramatically enhancing the weak defect feature extraction for reciprocating compressor valve fault diagnosis.

This conclusion is derived from numerous summary papers. They reveal that, on the one hand, gearboxes are one of the most fault susceptible elements in the drive-train and, on the other, the most expensive to replace. Although state-of-the-art CMS can usually provide advanced signal processing tools for extraction of diagnostic information, there are still many installations, where the diagnosis is based simply on the averaged wideband features like root-mean-square (RMS) or peak-peak (PP). Furthermore, for machinery working in highly changing operational conditions, like wind turbines, those estimators are strongly fluctuating, and this fluctuation is not linearly correlated to operation parameters. Thus, the sudden increase of a particular feature does not necessarily have to indicate the development of fault. To overcome this obstacle, it is proposed to detect a fault development with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and further observation of linear regression parameters calculated on the estimation error between healthy and unknown condition. The proposed reasoning is presented on the real life example of ring gear fault in wind turbine's planetary gearbox.

To address this problem, a new fault diagnosis method was developed to perform feature extraction and intelligent classification of various fault position and damage degree of rolling bearing signals. Firstly, Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) was used to compute five MFDFA features while five Alpha Stable Distribution (ASD) features were obtained by fitting the distribution to the vibration signals of each status and calculating the Probability Density Function (PDF). Secondly, Kernel Principle Component Analysis (KPCA) was used to achieve dimensionality reduction fusion of the combination of original features to gain the Kernel Principle Component Fusion Features (KPCFFs). Thirdly, the KPCFFs served as the input of Least Squares Support Vectors Machine (LSSVM) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to assess rolling bearings' fault position and damage severity. Finally, the effectiveness of the method was validated by bench test data. The results demonstrated that the developed method can achieve intelligent diagnosis of rolling bearings' fault position and damage degree and can yield better diagnosis accuracy than single feature method or corresponding single feature fusion method.

The proposed research is an interdisciplinary work of informatics and health care, with the help of data mining techniques to predict the relationship among interventions of hypertension and diabetes. As the study shows persons who have diabetes can have chances of hypertension and vice versa. In the present work we would like to approach the life style intervention of hypertension and diabetes and their effects using data mining. Life style intervention plays a vital role to control these diseases. The intervention includes the risk factor like diet, weight, smoking cessation and exercise. The regression technique is used in which dependent and Independent Variables (IV) are defined The four interventions are treated as (IV) and two diseases hypertension and diabetes are Dependent Variables (DV). We have established the relationship between hypertension and diabetes, using the data set of Non Communicable Disease (NCD) report of Saudi Arabia, World Health Organisation's (WHO). The Oracle Data Miner (ODM) tool is used to analyse the data set. Predictive data analysis gives the result that interventions weight control and exercise have the direct relationship between them in both the diseases.

J	Gao, YG; Liu, SB; Li, F; Liu, ZG				Gao, Yunguang; Liu, Shunbo; Li, Feng; Liu, Zhiguo			Fault detection and diagnosis method for cooling dehumidifier based on LS-SVM NARX model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DU FROID			English	Article						Cooling dehumidifier; Fault diagnosis; HVAC&R device; NARX model; LS-SVM; Genetic algorithm	BUILDING SYSTEMS; HVAC SYSTEMS; ARX MODEL; PROGNOSTICS; PCA	Developing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for the cooling dehumidifier is very important for improving the equipment reliability and saving energy consumption. Due to the precise mathematic physical model for cooling dehumidifier FDD is difficult to build, a novel Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous (NARX) method for the cooling dehumidifier FDD based on Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) is proposed. Firstly, the dehumidifier system is divided into two level models. Secondly, the parameters of the NARX model are identified by LS-SVM, and the parameters C and sigma of the LS-SVM are optimized by adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) in order to improve the model building precision. Lastly, two faults in condenser and compressor component are diagnosed by the built models. The experiment result indicates this proposed method is effective for cooling dehumidifier FDD and the model generalization ability is favorable.

J	Wang, C; Liu, X; Liu, H; Chen, Z				Wang, Chao; Liu, Xiao; Liu, Hui; Chen, Zhe			A Fault Diagnostic Method for Position Sensor of Switched Reluctance Wind Generator	JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Fault diagnostics; Finite element analysis; Switched reluctance generator	EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ROTOR-POSITION; MOTOR-DRIVES	Fast and accurate fault diagnosis of the position sensor is of great significance to ensure the reliability as well as sensor fault tolerant operation of the Switched Reluctance Wind Generator (SRWG). This paper presents a fault diagnostic scheme for a SRWG based on the residual between the estimated rotor position and the actual output of the position sensor. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which could build a nonlinear mapping among flux linkage, current and rotor position, is utilized to design an assembled estimator for the rotor position detection. The data for building the ELM based assembled position estimator is derived from the magnetization curves which are obtained from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of an SRWG with the structure of 8 stator poles and 6 rotor poles. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed fault diagnosis method are verified by simulation at various operating conditions.

J	Schaeffer, E; Auger, F; Shi, ZH; Guillemet, P; Loron, L				Schaeffer, Emmanuel; Auger, Francois; Shi, Zhihao; Guillemet, Philippe; Loron, Luc			Comparative Analysis of Some Parametric Model Structures Dedicated to EDLC Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Model-based diagnosis; parametric estimation; predictivemaintenance; supercapacitor aging; system identification	DOUBLE-LAYER CAPACITORS; SUPERCAPACITORS; CHARGE; TEMPERATURE; LIFETIME	Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are now widely used as power buffers in energy storage systems, especially for electrical transport applications. Because of their high acquisition costs, their predictive maintenance represents a key issue for the development of electrical traction systems. This paper investigates the diagnosis of EDLCs by a parametric estimation of a dynamic continuous-time model. Indeed, the physical interpretation of their parameters simplifies the supercapacitor diagnosis and prognosis. Due to the complex electrochemical phenomena occurring in EDLC cells, modeling errors are far more important than measurement noise. Therefore, we propose to use the output error minimization techniques and the relative sensitivity functions to evaluate and compare the diagnosis potential of several model structures. This allows the use of some comprehensive comparison criteria without any assumption about the statistical characteristics of the system disturbances. An experimental accelerated aging process of 200 commercial super capacitors (Nichicon, 1F, 20 weeks long aging at 65 degrees C, 0 and 2.5 V dc polarization) is also performed to make statistics and illustrate the methodology.

This specific model has been developed by using only resistances, inductances, and controlled voltage sources. The coupling effects between both the stator and the rotor have been taken into account by the computation of stator-rotor mutual inductances. The model has been developed under the MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to have a universal tool that is easy to use with any control techniques. With this model, it is possible to simulate any type of electrical faults during the motion by closing or opening corresponding switches. The performances of the model have been validated by comparing simulation and experimental results of a 90-W 14-V 50-Hz two-pole 6PIM operating with different levels of load torque in healthy and faulty modes. Furthermore, this model has been associated to a faulttolerant speed control method in phase opening occurrences in order to test the model accuracy.

Their geographically distributed nature makes failure detection, forecasting and maintenance planning extremely important. Prognostics, forecasting the time to failure in order to achieve effective maintenance planning, has attracted increasing attention from industry and researchers in recent years. The prognostic approach has great potential to achieve reduced costs and increased availability. However, the applicability of any engineering model requires economic and practical justifications. This paper presents an analysis of different prognostic methods for railway turnout systems. Five different sensors, installed in a real turnout system used on Turkish State Railways, are individually analysed by applying various prognostic methods.

Rolling element bearing fault diagnostics using acoustic emission technique and advanced signal processing	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY			English	Article						Signal processing; wavelet packet transform; de-noising; acoustic emission	WAVELET PACKET TRANSFORM; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; VIBRATION ANALYSIS; ROTATING MACHINES; DEFECTS	Acoustic emission (AE) signal generated from defects in rolling element bearings are investigated using simulated defects and experimental measurements in this paper. Rolling element bearings are crucial parts of many machines and there has been an increasing demand to find effective and reliable health monitoring technique and advanced signal processing to detect and diagnose the size and location of incipient defects. Condition monitoring of rolling element bearings comprises four main stages, which are, statistical analysis, faults diagnostics, defect size calculation, and prognostics. A modified and effective signal processing algorithm is designed to diagnose localized defects on rolling element bearing components under different operating speeds, loadings, and defect sizes. The algorithm is based on optimizing the ratio of Kurtosis and Shannon entropy to obtain the optimal band pass filter utilizing wavelet packet transform (WPT) and envelope detection. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting bearing characteristic frequencies from the raw acoustic emission signals masked by the background noise under different operating conditions.

J	Liu, L; Zhou, FQ; He, YZ				Liu, Liu; Zhou, Fuqiang; He, Yuzhu			Automated Visual Inspection System for Bogie Block Key Under Complex Freight Train Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						AdaBoost; automated visual inspection system; cascaded detector; gradient coded co-occurrence matrix (GCCM) features; hierarchical inspection framework; support vector machine (SVM)	VISION	With the development of hardware and software in camera and computing units, visual inspection system (VIS) plays an increasing significant role in fault inspection task. This paper proposes a VIS to inspect the missing of bogie block key (BBK) used on freight trains. BBK is an important component to keep wheel sets from separating out of bogies. The missing of BBK is one of the most common faults threatening the running safety. VIS first acquires a bogie image by the image acquisition system, and then a hierarchical inspection framework containing bearing cap (BC) detection, fault region localization, and BBK classification is proposed. Specifically, a cascaded detector trained by the AdaBoost approach combined with the gradient coded co-occurrence matrix (GCCM) features is used to achieve fast and accurate BC detection. Then, a fault region is located on the basis of the relationship between the BC and BBK. Finally, a BBK classifier based on the GCCM features and a support vector machine is used to process the fault region to identify the missing of BBK. The proposed system has been applied on a long sequence of real images showing high inspection speed and accuracy.

Among various machine health monitoring approaches, data-driven methods are gaining in popularity due to the development of advanced sensing and data analytic techniques. However, sensory data that is a kind of sequential data can not serve as direct meaningful representations for machine conditions due to its noise, varying length and irregular sampling. A majority of previous models focus on feature extraction/fusion methods that involve expensive human labor and high quality expert knowledge. With the development of deep learning methods in the last few years, representation learning from raw data has been redefined. Among deep learning models, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are able to capture long-term dependencies and model sequential data. Therefore, LSTMs is able to work on the sensory data of machine condition. Here, the first study about a empirical evaluation of LSTMs-based machine health monitoring systems is presented. A real life tool wear test is introduced. Basic and deep LSTMs are designed to predict the actual tool wear based on raw sensory data.

A rotor fault diagnosis system including a fault simulation platform, a set of testing devices and a signal analysis program is developed. The signal analysis program can be used to realize some functions such as data acquisition, signal analysis, processing and display, pattern recognition and fault diagnosis. With this program the fault diagnosis system can be operated to automatically measure and identify the shaft orbit of a rotor and get fault results, which the key principle is on the basis of the invariant moment algorithm for pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the shaft orbit of a rotor can be synthesized and identified through the invariant moment calculation. Because the shape of the shaft orbit of the rotor is close to an ellipse shape the fault result is imbalance. This study is helpful to develop an online fault diagnosis system based on LabVIEW for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.

In this paper, we extract three features of the vibration signals of rolling bearings as the parameters in time-domain, and then multi-scale possibilistic clustering (MPCM) algorithm is applied to unsupervised fault diagnosis. Because of the number of clusters is controlled by multi-scale factors automatically, the proposed method for fault detection can meet the actual demand of the machinery industry environment. The experimental results for bearing signals show that the method not only can automatically determine the number of clusters, but also has a better clustering performance than conventional possibilistic clustering algorithms.

A possibility of stator faults detection using a neural-network detector, possibly at the early stage of the damage, is checked. The experimental research was carried out for a small power induction motor, with different levels of the stator failures (special motor design allowed to test short circuits in each phase of the motor), load torque and converter frequencies. The measurement of stator phase currents, phase-to-phase voltages and their transformation to symmetrical components are used in stator winding condition monitoring. For diagnostic purposes, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural detectors are developed. Preliminary research of the neural network response (offline) showed that the neural networks with simple internal structure, used for the fault level detection, give satisfactory results, that is very important in practical realization. The designed detector was implemented in LabVIEW and tested during the operation of the machine (online).

The method is based on oversampling of the phase currents during the zero voltage vector. It is independent from any parameter sensitivity and current sensor errors. Furthermore, the detection can be done within the next sampling time after the occurence of the fault. It allows a determination of the back EMF at every operating point. Test bench measurements demonstrate the functionality of the method.

Detection of Mitotic Nuclei in Breast Histopathology Images using Localized ACM and Random Kitchen Sink based Classifier	2016 38TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 16-20, 2016	Orlando, FL	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				The exact measure of mitotic nuclei is a crucial parameter in breast cancer grading and prognosis. This can be achieved by improving the mitotic detection accuracy by careful design of segmentation and classification techniques. In this paper, segmentation of nuclei from breast histopathology images are carried out by Localized Active Contour Model (LACM) utilizing bio-inspired optimization techniques in the detection stage, in order to handle diffused intensities present along object boundaries. Further, the application of a new optimal machine learning algorithm capable of classifying strong non-linear data such as Random Kitchen Sink (RKS), shows improved classification performance. The proposed method has been tested on Mitosis detection in breast cancer histological images (MITOS) dataset provided for MITOS-ATYPIA CONTEST 2014. The proposed framework achieved 95% recall, 98% precision and 96% F-score.	[Beevi, Sabeena K.; Bindu, G.

Fault detection on bearings coupled to permanent magnet DC motors by using a generalized Takagi-Sugeno PI observer	2016 3RD CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AND FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS (SYSTOL)	Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Control and Fault-Tolerant Systems (SysTol)	SEP 07-09, 2016	Barcelona, SPAIN	Univ Politecnica Catalunya, Res Ctr Sypervis Safety & Automat Control, Ministerio Economia Competitividad, European Union, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Control Syst Soc, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Monitoring Safety & Automat Control Res Ctr		Terms Proportional-integral observer; Takagi-Sugeno system; fault detection; LMIs (linear matrix inequalities)		This paper presents a fault detection system for rotative machinery. A permanent-magnet DC motor is used as case of study. The main idea is to estimate on-line the non-load torque (To) in order to monitor the bearing health condition. The fault detection system is based on the design of a generalized Takagi-Sugeno P1 (proportional-integral) observer. The main advantage of this approach is that it can be easily implemented because the observer gains are obtained by solving a set of LMIs (linear matrix inequalities). Moreover, the method can be extended to more complicated nonlinear systems by using the Takagi-Sugeno approach. A simulation is performed to show that this fault detection scheme can be applied to detect abrupt faults on rotative machinery which can lead the system to undesirable performance caused by vibrations or breakdown.

The integration of Internet of things and Cloud manufacturing becomes increasingly important for the development of the industry 4.0. The objective of industry 4.0 is not just to improve the production management but also manage and reduce equipment downtime, for that many strategies could be implemented to ensure the good condition of equipment. The efficient one is the predictive maintenance which collects information from sensors and predicts the malfunction or failure in the system. Prognostics Health Manager (PHM) offers significant benefits for maintenance. It predicts the future behavior of a system as well as its remaining useful life. This paper offers a new architecture to provide PHM solutions as a service in cloud computing environment (PHM-SaaS, PHM-PaaS, PHM-IaaS). We defined the entities and actors as well as their behavior in this architecture. To test our approach we were interested by the prognostics and post-prognostics process which are the main steps in the PHM technology, the remaining useful life is estimated in the prognostics step and according to this RUL a decision is automatically provided by the post prognostics process.

More recently with the emergence of inverter drives, there has been an increase of high-frequencies bearing currents and shaft voltages creating mainly premature failure of bearings. Although those phenomena and the associated mitigation techniques are now well-known, one must be kept in mind that there are still potential issues for industrials. Lots of papers have analyzed these concerns and proposed various models and remedies. The purpose of this article is to give an overview on the subject, from causes and origins of shaft voltages, mitigation techniques for engineers new to this subject, to measurements methods, fault diagnosis and online condition monitoring. Finally it is believed that condition monitoring and fault diagnosis through shafts will expend from generators to Induction Motors and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors.

Numerous types, styles, and abilities exist within the field of instrumentation and diagnostic system for the detection, recording, and analysis of the harmonics distorted waveform. The essential shortage is in experienced strength machine engineers who can interpret the facts, diagnose the problems, and propose practical answers. This review is one attempt to employ Artificial Intelligence (Al) or intelligent water drop algorithm inside the Harmonics analysis expert system (HAES). The aim is to perform the analysis on the manner of applying this Al method that includes: schooling the consumer, measurements (non obligatory), prognosis, and to answer the strength of the system for harmonics disturbances to acceptable power.

With the huge amount of real-time data being collected in modern fab, the conventional standards and indexes defined for the yield and the productivity shall be inevitably altered in accordance with more predictable functions. Starting from the calculation for the tool productivity, this paper proposes the Predictive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (POEE) to evaluate and monitor the forthcoming effectiveness of a single tool. The POEE is composed of two parts: i) the deterministic effectiveness such as the preventive maintenance, engineering experiments, and job scheduling and dispatching, and ii) the predictive effectiveness in terms of the extra production time due to the abnormal tool condition and undesired product quality. In the diagnostic perspective, POEE serves as a consolidated index to be inspected and controlled. When the POEE is low, the practitioner can intuitively identify the critical causes beforehand in the three fundamental dimensions: tool availability, tool performance, and product quality. Through scheduling optimization, tool availability will be increased. By looking into the tool performance and product quality, abnormal tool conditions which impact on the process efficiency and product yield can be addressed and resolved. By monitoring the POEE over a set of tools in the same group, the high priority jobs can be dispatched to the tools with high POEE to avoid the yield loss and the long cycle time due to unscheduled machine breakdown. A Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) tool is taken as the study vehicle to demonstrate the proposed method in this research.

Time-series forecasting of critical industrial signals presents itself as a way to reduce this impact by extracting knowledge regarding the internal dynamics of the process and advice any process deviations before it affects the productive process. In this paper, a novel industrial condition monitoring approach based on the combination of Self Organizing Maps for operating point codification and Recurrent Neural Networks for critical signal modeling is proposed. The combination of both methods presents a strong synergy, the information of the operating condition given by the interpretation of the maps helps the model to improve generalization, one of the drawbacks of recurrent networks, while assuring high accuracy and precision rates.

Optimising Fault Tolerance in Real-time Cloud Computing IaaS Environment	2016 IEEE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUTURE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD (FICLOUD 2016)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud (FiCloud)	AUG 22-24, 2016	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Bradford, Oxford Brooks Univ, Univ Wien		Cloud computing; fault tolerance; virtual machine; pass rate; fail rate; cloud fault handler		Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to respond swiftly to an unexpected failure. Failures in a cloud computing environment are normal rather than exceptional, but fault detection and system recovery in a real time cloud system is a crucial issue. To deal with this problem and to minimize the risk of failure, an optimal fault tolerance mechanism was introduced where fault tolerance was achieved using the combination of the Cloud Master, Compute nodes, Cloud load balancer, Selection mechanism and Cloud Fault handler. In this paper, we proposed an optimized fault tolerance approach where a model is designed to tolerate faults based on the reliability of each compute node (virtual machine) and can be replaced if the performance is not optimal. Preliminary test of our algorithm indicates that the rate of increase in pass rate exceeds the decrease in failure rate and it also considers forward and backward recovery using diverse software tools. Our results obtained are demonstrated through experimental validation thereby laying a foundation for a fully fault tolerant IaaS Cloud environment, which suggests a good performance of our model compared to current existing approaches.

In this paper we present a novel fault prognosis approach using echo state network (ESN) and recurrent multilayer perceptron (RMLP), two functional forms of recurrent neural network, based on vibration signal of rotating machinery. Both ESN and RMLP methods are able to improve the capacity of machinery performance prediction within a relatively short time period and only with limited data available. The successful outcomes of the ESN/RMLP fault prognosis approach can give obvious explanation for future states of machine, which make it possible to enhance machine condition monitoring and health management in practical situations. The experiment results show that accuracy of fault prognosis has improved significantly, and prove that the proposed approach is practical and efficient for fault prognosis of the rolling bearing system.

Some of the main challenges in microgrid protection include topology changes of microgrid, week-infeed fault, bidirectional power flow effects, blinding of the protection, sympathetic tripping, high impedance fault, and low voltage ride through (LVRT). Besides these challenges, it is desired to eliminate the relays for distribution lines and locate faults based on distributed generations (DGs) voltage or current. On the other hands increasing in the number of DGs and lines would result in high computation burden and degradation the efficiency and accuracy of the methods that utilize all these information. This paper deals with this issue by analyzing only DGs' voltage. In the first step, a fault is detected by the voltage of each DG, then the DG with the highest voltage collapse injects 333 Hz harmonic to find another DG that the fault occurs within them. Two criteria are defined in such a way to prevent injection of voltage harmonic by the other DGs. Finally, the fault is located in the reduced space of search by wavelet transform and optimized multiclass support vector machine (M-SVM).

Although it can provide low cost, remote monitoring of rotor faults, cases of false indications have been reported, where the causes of some false indications are still unknown. It is shown for the first time in this work that high-amplitude blade pass frequency (BPF) vibrations produced in pumps, fans, or compressors can cause false rotor fault indications, if the number of motor poles is an integer multiple of the number of blades. The influence of BPF vibration on MCSA based rotor fault detection is analyzed, and it is shown that the interaction between BPF vibration and rotor faults can produce false positive and negative fault indications. Alternative test methods capable of separating the influence of the BPF vibration and rotor faults are suggested for avoiding false MCSA alarms. The claims made in the paper are verified experimentally on a custom-built 380 V induction motor-centrifugal pump system setup.

(PMSMs)	MACHINES	In this paper, an comprehensive impedance analysis is proposed to detect inter turn short circuit fault in PMSMs at start-up. This method requires a very small computational load (less than 5% CPU bandwidth) and is easy to implement. The procedure is performed at start-up during standstill mode, and hence agnostic to well-known issues caused by transients, load/speed level or controller coefficient dependency. In order to distinguish the inter turn shorts from the eccentricity fault which exhibits similar behaviors, a classification algorithm is introduced based on stator resistor and inductances. Moreover, the effect of stator iron core saturation on the electric parameters analyzed in depth. Both 2-D FEA simulation and experimental test results are provided to show the efficacy of this method.

Due to technology and processes changes, some of these spares become obsolete or dead inventory. Factories have huge dead inventory worth millions of dollars accumulating over time. This is due to lack of a scientific methodology to identify them and send the inventory back to the suppliers on a timely basis. The standard approach followed across industries to deal with this is to declare a part as dead if a part is not used for a set pre-defined period of time. This leads to accumulation of the dead parts over time and these parts cannot be sold back to the suppliers as it is too late as per contract agreement. Our main idea is that the time period for identifying a part as dead cannot be a fixed pre-defined duration across all parts. This time period should depend on various properties of the part like the historical consumption pattern of the part, type of part, how many machines this part is associated with, if this part is a preventive maintenance part etc. We have designed a predictive algorithm which predicts part obsolescence well in advance with reasonable accuracy thus helping save millions of dollars.

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has the characteristics of simple, easy to implement and found the local optimum quickly. This paper proposes the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) to optimize the two parameters and to obtain the electronics system fault diagnosis based on PSO-ELM. Two analog circuits, one is complex; the other is simple, are designed to obtain the original data in the essay. Then, wavelet transform and PCA are combined to extract the feature of samples information. Take the processed data into the PSO-ELM to get the diagnosis results, meanwhile, compared the optimal performance of PSO, glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) and bat algorithm (BA) to ELM, experiments show that PSO is the most efficient to improve the diagnostic accuracies of the two circuits, the results obtained with PSO-ELM reach to 98.89% and 99.46% respectively.

These data-driven techniques include neural networks, group method of data handling, neuro-fuzzy networks, and random forests as an ensemble-based system. These prognostic techniques make use of the past and current data to predict the upcoming values of the capacity to estimate the remaining useful life of the battery. This work presents a comparative study of these data-driven prognostic techniques on constant load experimental data collected from Li-ion batteries. Experimental results show that these data-driven prognostic techniques can effectively estimate the remaining useful life of the Li-ion batteries. However, the random forests and neuro-fuzzy techniques outperform other competitors in terms of the RUL prediction error and root mean square error (RMSE), respectively.

The performance of such systems immensely relies upon the quality of features extracted and the classifier model learned. Traditionally features were handcrafted, where engineers would manually design them with statistical parameters and signal transforms based energy distribution analysis. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown new ways of obtaining useful feature representation that provide state of the art results in image and speech processing applications. This paper first presents a brief survey of traditional handcrafted features and later presents a short analysis of handcrafted features v/s features learned by deep neural networks (DNN), for doing fault diagnosis. The DNN based features in this paper were generated in 3 phases: 1) extracted handcrafted features using traditional techniques 2) initialized the weights of DNN by learning de-noising sparse auto-encoders with the handcrafted features in unsupervised fashion and 3) applied two generic fine tuning heuristics that tailor DNN's weights to give good classification performance. The experimentation and analysis were performed on 5 datasets: one each on Air compressor monitoring, Drill bit monitoring and Steel plate monitoring, and two on bearing fault monitoring data. The results clearly show the prospects of DNN obtaining good feature representations and good classification performance. Further, it also finds that Fast Fourier Transform based features with DNN are more suited for Support Vector Machine as classifier than Random Forest.

MTR, a world-class railway operator in Hong Kong, has been industrial leader bringing in technologies in process improvement. Chief of Operations Engineering, Ir Dr Tony Lee, has brought sensors technologies "on track" via award-winning railway applications such as monitoring train speed and position via capabilities of GPS and RFID[1], employing sensors' intelligence [2] to monitor temperature of rolling stock axle counter[3], rail integrity and even equipment rooms, sculpting the shape of future asset management of MTR with foresighted FAST 2030+ initiative (Fig. 1). Ir May Tso specializes in systems' data analysis and defining information to be captured and implanted in designing railway systems [4][5] for effective data analytics during Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cycles. These implementations provide all handy yet very effective probes to excel in managing railway engineering systems and assets that require foresightedness and vision. The Railway Mastermind is effected by the ability in consolidating centrally the railway asset condition from the track, overhead lines, rolling stock, point machines, etc. real-time so that personnel in the master chair can make efficiently effective decisions to timely or even proactively action to ensure train service reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) which are very much crucial to the O&M of a railway system. For a railway system that has been running for decades, this systematic sensor data acquisition universal platform/model effectuates the sustainability of engineering knowledge through precise capturing of critical information that facilitates data analytics to substantiate maintenance or asset management decisions.

But short life duration of the PEMFCs still limits their large scale commercialization. The prognostics and health management (PHM) is a series of methods that not only monitor the state of health (SOH), but also take proper actions to extend the remaining useful life (RUL) of PEMFCs. Prognostics is the key process of PHM that can predict the future behavior and RUL of the PEMFCs, which is the main topic discussed in this paper.

In industrial domains, Condition Monitoring Systems (CMS) enable fault-tolerant, predictable production systems. Unfortunately, CMS development is challenging due to the distribution of computational tasks among heterogeneous industrial Internet of Things and Services (IoTS)-architectures. It is usually started from scratch, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In times of IoTS the employee as a maintenance worker, who ensures the availability of production machinery, is still important. In order to address these challenges, we propose a modular framework for web-based condition monitoring and fault diagnostics. The implementation relies on technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language 5 (HTML5), JavaScript (JS) and node. js as well as industrial internet communication standards. Finally, verification and validation are performed in a case study on a modular robot cell for the inspection of electronic assemblies.

In order to discriminate between islanding and non-islanding situations, the phase angle derived at the rotating machine or inverter-based distributed generation terminal is used an input feature vector for the principal component technique. The change in principal components are prominent for both islanding situations and non-islanding situations like the fault type, load switching, DG tripping, capacitor switching and feeder disconnection. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated using the data simulated with a Real-Time Digital Simulator for IEEE 13-bus microgrids. Critical issues such as a perfect power match islanding situations, different scenarios of microgrids having synchronous generator, BESS, DFIG, and PV units are addressed during performance evaluation of the proposed technique. It is found that, the technique identifies the islanding situations under low active and reactive power mismatches and hence overcomes the non detection zone problem.

The ELM is a kind of single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFNN) with a fast learning. The basic idea is the use of a certain number n of ELM classifiers to deals with n types of faults affecting the wind turbine. Different parts of the process were investigated including actuators and sensors faults. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through simulation.

First of all, voltage and current signals are calculated through pointer to draw into a two-dimensional characteristic diagram so as to find failure characteristics from the relationship between imbalance rate and harmonic distortion, then shaft orbit diagram is mapped through vibration signals and fractal theory is used to extract characteristic parameters of orbit so as to find failure characteristics of mechanical vibration; based on this, fuzzy theory is used to integrate the expert knowledge and a complex failure decision-making system with electrical and vibration analysis technology is designed. This research develops four common failure models and a normal model for experiment and analysis, and it is known from the results that the failure diagnosis performance is not ideal with separate electric or vibration test method, which can only distinguish a few types of failures, but if it is combined with fuzzy failure decision- making system, it will have very excellent diagnosis performance, which can accurately distinguish failure problems of the experimental models to make the rotating electrical machinery have more complete failure prediction ability and it can effectively detect anomaly characteristics in the case of failure symptoms in order to avoid more serious accidents, and it also verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of hybrid failure diagnosis system proposed in this research. In- depth research will be continued in future to explore more physical signals and its analysis methods so as to establish a more reliable rotation machine failure decision-making system to make lots of factories using rotating electrical machinery to have intelligent production capacity, and long-term operation of important units can obtain more reliable security guarantee.

The scheme of fault discrimination proposed in this paper depends on the measurement of three-phase current at sending end side of the protected power transmission line. Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) is utilized for decomposing the fault current signal into different approximation and details coefficient. Summation of fourth level detail coefficient for all the three phases of current are used for fault detection process and further wavelet singular entropy calculations for each phase currents are used for classification of fault type of the power transmission line. A 500 kV three-machine four-bus transmission system equipped with UPFC has been considered to validate the performance of the proposed scheme using MATLAB software in the time domain.

The reliable supply is essential to satisfy the reliable operation of electricity. This paper presents the fuzzy logic based protection scheme for detection and classification of shunt faults in a three phase series compensated transmission line. A 735 kV, 60 Hz series compensated three phase single circuit transmission lines has been simulated using simulink and simpowersystems toolbox of MATLAB software. The proposed method is based on the fundamental component of voltage measurement of each phase which is provided as input to the fuzzy logic based fault detector and classifier. The proposed scheme has been tested with different symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault cases with variation in fault location, fault resistance and fault inception angle. Based on the simulation results it has been found that the proposed fuzzy logic based protection system detects and classifies both symmetrical and unsymmetrical shunt faults correctly.

A Novel Approach to Detect Fault during Power Swing Using Three Phase Active Power	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT ADVANCES AND INNOVATIONS IN ENGINEERING (ICRAIE)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances and Innovations in Engineering (ICRAIE)	DEC 23-25, 2016	Jaipur, INDIA	IEEE		Stable swing; unstable swing; symmetrical fault; unsymmetrical fault; distance relay; transmission system; high resistance fault	SCHEME	A novel, fast and reliable distance relay approach is proposed in this work to detect fault during power swing. First of all, the voltage and current at relay end is measured and then processed using phasor estimation technique. Next, average of three phase active power is estimated and based on the magnitude of the calculated value the swing and different fault cases can be discriminated. During power swing, the value is always less than the threshold and with the inception of fault the value is more than the threshold. The main advantage of the proposed technique is that within one power cycle time period symmetrical fault detection is possible. The system is simulated on EMTDC/PSCAD environment using and results are presented for 230-kV, 50 Hz two-area four machine system and New England 39 test bus system to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

However, the existing physics heuristics and neural networks based methods face difficulties to treat such two issues simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel Network of Extreme Learning Machines (N-ELM) framework, which is a hybrid model of classification and regression for multiple faults diagnosis and RUL predication. The N-ELM consists of a set of ELMs as the nodes of the learning network, which forms a "generalized" structure with fault detection and RUL forecasting functions. By exploiting the advantages of ELM superb efficiency in regression, the error statistics based robust AdaBoost. RT based ELM framework (RAE-ELM) with self-adaptive threshold mechanism is applied to improve the accuracy of RUL predication. The uniform network of multi-functioning ELMs enable classify fault types and predicate their corresponding RUL concurrently with outperformed accuracy and efficiency. The superior performance of the proposed hybrid framework and supporting techniques are validated using vibration monitoring dataset collected from rotating machinery in the field.

It is important to accurately identify them for fast remedial response and damage prevention. Recently, data mining techniques have been applied in power system research, usually from the perspective of the entire system. The analyzed data include measurements from transmission buses, substations, and other major components in the network. This big data analysis is useful and enables powerful insight but studies on small, local areas of the larger system needs to be explored further. By focusing on single components such as generators, we can provide concrete and detailed insights to individual operators. For instance, direct impact on the local area can be studied after an event - allowing for better understanding of its propagation effects throughout the entire system. This provides "zoomed-in" situational awareness on a single component and its local area, aiding in event detection and protection efforts. In this paper, we use localized data to classify generator control actions based on voltage dip information measured at generator terminals and at neighboring buses. We perform root cause analysis using the measurement data. By using single-level one dimensional wavelet decomposition and Support Vector Machine methodologies, we have developed an algorithm, Generator Control Action Classification (GCAC) that examines the voltage disturbances and classifies the cause as a certain control action at a particular bus. The method is tested on simulated data from power system simulation software, PowerWorld, and training and testing data is obtained using PowerWorld case studies. The impact of training data availability from different generators while classifying different generator control actions is also studied. Promising results of high accuracy are achieved and discussed.

CASE STORIES OF INDUCTION MOTORS FAULT DIAGNOSIS BASED ON CURRENT ANALYSIS	2016 PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY CONFERENCE EUROPE (PCIC EUROPE)	Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe		English	Proceedings Paper	Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference Europe (PCIC Europe)	JUN 14-16, 2016	Berlin, GERMANY			Fault diagnosis; induction motors; maintenance; current analysis	WAVELET TRANSFORM	This work presents several case studies related to condition monitoring of induction motors operating in a chemical plant. Analysis of the stator current is applied to diagnose several types of faults, especially rotor damages and mixed eccentricities. The considered current-based techniques include both the conventional method that relies on the analysis of the steady-state current (Motor Current Signature Analysis, MCSA, that will be employed as main tool), as well as recently developed methodologies based on the analysis of transient currents (Advanced Transient Current Signature Analysis, ATCSA, that will be used as complementary tool). The combination of both methods enables to reach a high reliability in the diagnostics, avoiding eventual false indications of a single method. The motors considered in the paper range from small-sized machines till large motors (rated up to several MW). Also, a diversity of operation conditions is considered, including diverse loading conditions as well as different operating options. The results show the powerfulness of current analysis for diagnosing a wide range of failures in asynchronous motors operating in petrochemical plants.

Advanced fault diagnosis methods are required to detect these faults in their incipient phase, even in the harsh, vibration-full environment of vehicles. In the paper the effectiveness of a complex bearing faults detection approach is analyzed. It uses the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique to enhance the ability of an autoregressive (AR) model based filtering technique, designed to detect single point defects in rolling bearings. The detection capabilities of the method were studied by means of processing the measured vibration signals for different bearing conditions of an electrical machine. The study included the analysis of the fault detection effectiveness also in the case when additional random noise was added to the measured signals.

Reliable Detection of Broken Rotor Bars in Induction Motors via MUSIC and ZSC Methods	2016 XXII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd IEEE International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 04-07, 2016	Lausanne, SWITZERLAND	Int Conf Elect Machines Assoc, Inst Engn & Technol, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE		Broken bar; Fault diagnosis; Induction motor; MUSIC; ZSC	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DEFECTS; MACHINE	Induction motors are used in a variety of industrial applications where frequent startups are required. In those cases, it is necessary to apply sophisticated signal processing analysis methods in order to reliably follow the time evolution of the fault-related harmonics in the signal. In this paper, the zero-sequence current (ZSC) is analysed using the high-resolution spectral method of multiple signal classification (MUSIC). The analysis of the ZSC signal has proved to have several advantages over the analysis of a single-phase current waveform. Experimentation is performed on a healthy motor, a motor with one broken rotor bar, and a motor with two broken rotor bars. The analysis results are satisfactory since the proposed methodology reliably detects the broken rotor bar fault and its severity, both during transient and steady state operation of the induction motor.

The information quality enhancements are aimed at improving the training of the data-driven classification techniques used for Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of the process. A simulation case study of a Continuous Stirred Tank-Reactor (CSTR) is used to produce training datasets containing noisy, outlier and missing values. Three metamodeling techniques namely; Ordinary Kriging (OK), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Polynomial Regression (PR) are used to smooth the noise and outliers, and to impute the missing values. Next, the FDD performance of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is compared when it trained with the recuperated datasets by the metamodels, while datasets have noisy, outlier and missing values. The results show high enhancement in the performance of the SVM when it trained with the recuperated data using the metamodels, especially when OK is exploited.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an autonomous orbit pattern recognition algorithm using the deep learning method on shaft orbit shape images. In details, the convolutional neural network is implemented to construct weights between neurons and to generate the entire structure of the neural network. Then, the created network enables us to classify fault modes of rotating machinery via orbit images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed framework through a rotating testbed.

Vibration signals are commonly used as the source for feature extraction during the prognosis process, especially the energy feature of fundamental frequency (which is written as 1X), 2X, 3X, 1/2X, etc. Yet this kind of feature shows insufficiency for identifying stages of performance degradation and classifying the type of early fault, therefore researchers focused mainly on improving the methods of feature extraction to solve this problem. However, features extracted from vibration signals always ignore some fault information such as kinematics information and phase information, thus other source of feature is needed to provide supplement or even substitute for higher efficiency and sharpness of separation in rotating machinery prognosis, which are strongly demanded by today's complex and advanced machines. This paper introduced one kind of classic feature source: shaft orbit, Which is widely used in traditional diagnosis for failure classification, into prognosis, and its effectiveness is verified in rotor early unbalance fault identification using features extracted from it, compared with energy features of frequency hand extracted from vibration signals. Result shows that shaft orbit feature can be used in identifying different early fault stages of rotor unbalance, which indicates that utilizing shaft orbit as source of feature extraction can provide a new approach of getting early fault features in rotating machinery prognosis.

The traditional diagnosis approach based on characteristic frequency was shown to be not consistent with experimental data in some cases. Furthermore, two data sets measured under the same circumstance gave different characteristic frequency results, and the harmonic frequency was not linearly proportional to the fundamental frequency. These indicate that existing fault diagnosis is inaccurate and not reliable. This work introduced a new method based on data-driven random fuzzy evidence acquisition and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which first compared fault sample data with fuzzy expert system, followed by the determination of random likelihood value and finally obtained diagnosis conclusion based on the data fusion rule. This method was proved to have high accuracy and reliability with a good agreement with experimental data, thus providing a new theoretical approach to fuzzy information processing in complicated numerically controlled equipments.

J	Yi, JH; Wang, J; Wang, GG				Yi, Jiao-Hong; Wang, Jian; Wang, Gai-Ge			Improved probabilistic neural networks with self-adaptive strategies for transformer fault diagnosis problem	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; self-adaptation; probabilistic neural network; back propagation; general regression neural network; extreme learning machine; fault diagnosis	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE	Probabilistic neural network has successfully solved all kinds of engineering problems in various fields since it is proposed. In probabilistic neural network, Spread has great influence on its performance, and probabilistic neural network will generate bad prediction results if it is improperly selected. It is difficult to select the optimal manually. In this article, a variant of probabilistic neural network with self-adaptive strategy, called self-adaptive probabilistic neural network, is proposed. In self-adaptive probabilistic neural network, Spread can be self-adaptively adjusted and selected and then the best selected Spread is used to guide the self-adaptive probabilistic neural network train and test. In addition, two simplified strategies are incorporated into the proposed self-adaptive probabilistic neural network with the aim of further improving its performance and then two versions of simplified self-adaptive probabilistic neural network (simplified self-adaptive probabilistic neural networks 1 and 2) are proposed. The variants of self-adaptive probabilistic neural networks are further applied to solve the transformer fault diagnosis problem. By comparing them with basic probabilistic neural network, and the traditional back propagation, extreme learning machine, general regression neural network, and self-adaptive extreme learning machine, the results have experimentally proven that self-adaptive probabilistic neural networks have a more accurate prediction and better generalization performance when addressing the transformer fault diagnosis problem.

It is also one of the important factors that enable companies to sustain their competitive advantage. The purpose of this study is to develop a basic model of customer service process automation, which will support the spare parts replacement procedure. The idea is to use sensors for identifying the condition of spare parts in real time and initiate an automated replacement process at the right time. A conceptual model of an integrated customer service process automation, derived from a case study, is illustrated, which emphasizes the significance of information exchange between business processes and communication between supply chain collaborators. The suggested changes for the model aim to improve the service level, machine and part life, design of the part and also to reduce human errors during ordering process, overall cost and inventory level.

Vibration signal analysis has been widely used for fault diagnosis, but it presents difficulty in identifying coupling faults, especially when the coupling faults have similar patterns. On the other hand, infrared image processing can simultaneously diagnose multiple faults with temperature variations, but it is not effective for temperature-insensitive faults. To better utilize multi-modality sensing and to address their limitations, an information fusion method by fusing infrared image and vibration signals is investigated for improved machinery- defect diagnosis in this study. An enhanced non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) method is investigated first for information enhancement and noise reduction of infrared image. Next, feature-extraction strategy on multi-source data is discussed in order to reduce the dimension and enhance fault-representative features for subsequent defect classification. A Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory-based classifier fusion is then performed to improve the defect diagnosis' accuracy. Experimental studies on a rotor testbed illustrate that the information fusion approach can effectively recognize the coupling faults and improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis in comparison to the methods with single-modality sensing signal.

The assessment of MSS involves the use of the Markov chain to estimate the transient and steady state probabilities given the transition rates between different states and a user-defined threshold demand from the system which defines reliability. In the case of systems which are not new and have been tested in the past (similar units operated before), the transition rates can be estimated from the historical records of the data. However, for new systems or those with minimal past data, the estimates of the state transition rates can be uncertain, which undermines the value of modeling systems from a multi-state perspective. This study proposes a particle filter (PF) based technique that capitalizes on real-time sensor-based degradation data of the system to estimate the future trend of wear-out and estimates the transition rates and their confidence bounds, which get updated every time a new data is measured. This study is aimed at bringing together the fields of MSS and prognostics and health management (PHM) to model and estimate the reliability of engineering systems more accurately and dynamically, moving away from the traditional practice of relying on historical failure data. The proposed technique would be handy for condition monitoring, lifetime estimation and maintenance scheduling of new systems or imperfect repair systems where prior knowledge of state transition rates is seldom available.

The implemented system was based on acoustic signals of three-phase induction motors. A feature extraction step was performed using SMOFS-20-EXPANDED (shortened method of frequencies selection-20-Expanded). A classification step was performed using 3 classifiers: LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), NBC (Naive Bayes Classifier), CT (Classification Tree). An analysis was carried out for incipient states of three-phase induction motors measured under laboratory conditions. The author measured and analysed the following states of motors: healthy motor, motor with one faulty rotor bar, motor with two faulty rotor bars, motor with faulty ring of squirrel-cage. Measured and analysed states were caused by natural degradation of parts of the machine. The efficiency of recognition of the analysed states was good.

Bio-inspired approach to invariant recognition and classification of fabric weave patterns and yarn color	ASSEMBLY AUTOMATION			English	Article						Computer vision; Fabric weave pattern; HMAX; Opponent color channel; RGB color descriptor; Support vector machine (SVM)	AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION; OBJECT; NORMALIZATION; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; CORTEX	Purpose - This paper aims to propose a biologically inspired processing architecture to recognize and classify fabrics with respect to the weave pattern (fabric texture) and yarn color (fabric color). Design/methodology/approach - By using the fabric weave patterns image identification system, this study analyzed the fabric image based on the Hierarchical-MAX (HMAX) model of computer vision, to extract feature values related to texture of fabric. Red Green Blue (RGB) color descriptor based on opponent color channels simulating the single opponent and double opponent neuronal function of the brain is incorporated in to the texture descriptor to extract yarn color feature values. Finally, support vector machine classifier is used to train and test the algorithm. Findings - This two-stage processing architecture can be used to construct a system based on computer vision to recognize fabric texture and to increase the system reliability and accuracy. Using this method, the stability and fault tolerance (invariance) was improved. Originality/value - Traditionally, fabric texture recognition is performed manually by visual inspection. Recent studies have proposed automatic fabric texture identification based on computer vision. In the identification process, the fabric weave patterns are recognized by the warp and weft floats. However, due to the optical environments and the appearance differences of fabric and yarn, the stability and fault tolerance (invariance) of the computer vision method are yet to be improved. By using our method, the stability and fault tolerance (invariance) was improved.

Induction motor inter-turn fault modeling and simulation using SSFR test for diagnosis purpose	AUTOMATIKA			English	Article						Diagnosis; Induction motor; Parameter identification; Short-turns; Spectrum; Standstill	ROTOR FAULTS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; MACHINES; STATOR; STANDSTILL	This paper presents a new idea to establish a simplified model of the short-circuit turns (SCT), in the stator winding of the squirrel-cage induction motor (IM) using standstill frequency response test (SSFR). This method may offer more precision in parameters estimation independent of variations in motor or load operating conditions since it is at standstill test. However, high-performance field-oriented control, or diagnosis purpose of the IM requires accurate knowledge of the electrical parameters. Furthermore, we propose to model the IM by a multiple cage equivalent circuit (EC) that enables us to take into account the deep bar effect with accuracy. The specific advantage of the proposed method that we can create a true SCT at several levels using fault simulator in order to estimate the EC model parameters in each case of fault severity, with a low probability of risk to the machine being tested, and a relatively modest expense. At the first time the healthy machine is identified and experimentally validated, then the models have been successfully used to study the transient and steady-state behavior of the IM with SCT fault, which a practically oriented scientific value.

Prevention of lung cancer recurrence using cisplatin-loaded superhydrophobic nanofiber meshes	BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						Drug delivery; Electrospinning; Nanofibers; Lung cancer; Surgery; Superhydrophobic	DRUG-DELIVERY; SMALL-CELL; IN-VIVO; PHASE-II; CHEMOTHERAPY; RELEASE; GEMCITABINE; DEGRADATION; POLYMERS; SURVIVAL	For early stage lung cancer patients, local cancer recurrence after surgical resection is a significant concern and stems from microscopic disease left behind after surgery. Here we apply a local drug delivery strategy to combat local lung cancer recurrence after resection using non-woven, biodegradable nanofiber meshes loaded with cisplatin. The meshes are fabricated using a scalable electrospinning process from two biocompatible polymers polycaprolactone and poly(glycerol monostearate-co-caprolactone) to afford favorable mechanical properties for use in a dynamic tissue such as the lung. Owing to their rough nanostructure and hydrophobic polymer composition, these meshes exhibit superhydrophobicity, and it is this non-wetting nature that sustains the release of cisplatin in a linear fashion over similar to 90 days, with anti-cancer efficacy demonstrated using an in vitro Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) cell assay. The in vivo evaluation of cisplatin-loaded superhydrophobic meshes in the prevention of local cancer recurrence in a murine model of LLC surgical resection demonstrated a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0006) in median recurrence-free survival to >23 days, compared to standard intraperitoneal cisplatin therapy of equivalent dose.

Among many machine techniques, k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is one of the most widely used for fault diagnosis due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and computational efficiency. However, the lack of a density-based affinity measure in the conventional k-NN algorithm can decrease the classification accuracy. To address this issue, a sequential k-NN classification methodology using distance- and density-based affinity measures in a sequential manner is introduced for classification.

Condition Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motor Using Support Vector Machine	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						conditioning monitoring; induction motor; support vector machine; total harmonic distortion; fault diagnosis	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; STATOR WINDINGS; CLASSIFICATION; LOCATION; SCHEME	This article deals with the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a three-phase induction motor using a support vector machine classifier. By acquiring the three line voltages and currents of the motor in real time (experimentally on a 3-HP motor in the laboratory environment), total harmonic distortion is calculated, which in turn is used for the training of the support vector machine. A laboratory prototype has been developed through which various data have been generated by conducting extensive experiments on a healthy motor as well on a motor having faulty bearing, shorting of stator turns, and broken rotor bars with varying load conditions. The performance of the projected support vector machine-based scheme has been assessed for two kernel functions on the basis of fault classification accuracy. It can be noted that the accuracy of the radial basis function kernel is higher than that of the polynomial kernel. The proposed support vector machine-based scheme gives satisfactorily results, as the fault discrimination accuracy is found to be more than 98%. Simultaneously, it also gives an accuracy of the order of 95% for different motor design specifications, which confirms robustness of the proposed scheme.

However, the fault feature is not obvious and is easily hidden in the main component, since the amplitudes of fault harmonic components are quiet small compared with the fundamental component. A new method to diagnose the mechanical unbalance fault effectively in permanent magnet synchronous machine drives is proposed in this article, where Park's vector is used to eliminate the fundamental component from the fast Fourier transform (FFT) results of motor current signature analysis; the fault feature is then analyzed by discrete wavelet transform. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulation and experimental results. It is shown that the proposed diagnosis method may work well under different control strategies.

Automatic bearing fault diagnosis using particle swarm clustering and Hidden Markov Model	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Fault detection and diagnosis; Rolling bearing defect diagnosis; Data clustering; Hidden Markov Model; Wavelet kurtogram; Cepstral analysis		Ball bearings are integral elements in most rotating manufacturing machineries. While detecting defective bearing is relatively straightforward, discovering the source of defect requires advanced signal processing techniques. This paper proposes an automatic bearing defect diagnosis method based on Swarm Rapid Centroid Estimation (SRCE) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Using the defect frequency signatures extracted with Wavelet Kurtogram and Cepstral Littering, SRCE+HMM achieved on average the sensitivity, specificity, and error rate of 98.02%, 96.03%, and 2.65%, respectively, on the bearing fault vibration data provided by Case School of Engineering of the Case Western Reserve University (CSE) which warrants further investigation.

In this paper, an approach based on vibration signals is proposed. By the proposed method, vibration signals are collected for different conditions through various high-precision wireless sensors mounted on the surface of the heat exchanger. Furthermore, by analyzing the characteristics of the vibration signals, a database of fault patterns is established, which therefore provides a scheme for conditional monitoring of the heat exchanger. An experimental platform is set up to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, and support vector machine based on dimensionless parameters is developed for fault classification. The results have shown that the proposed method is efficient and has achieved a high accuracy for benchmarking vibration signals under both normal and faulty conditions.

IoT-Based Prognostics and Systems Health Management for Industrial Applications	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Internet of things; maintenance; prognostics and systems health management; reliability; remaining useful life	FUSION PROGNOSTICS; MACHINERY; MODEL; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; LIFE; FRAMEWORK	Prognostics and systems health management (PHM) is an enabling discipline that uses sensors to assess the health of systems, diagnoses anomalous behavior, and predicts the remaining useful performance over the life of the asset. The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables PHM to be applied to all types of assets across all sectors, thereby creating a paradigm shift that is opening up significant new business opportunities. This paper introduces the concepts of PHM and discusses the opportunities provided by the IoT. Developments are illustrated with examples of innovations from manufacturing, consumer products, and infrastructure. From this review, a number of challenges that result from the rapid adoption of IoT-based PHM are identified. These include appropriate analytics, security, IoT platforms, sensor energy harvesting, IoT business models, and licensing approaches.

The proposed approach includes both the classical classification of multiple a priori known scenarios, and the innovative detection capability of new operating modes not previously available. The development of condition-based monitoring methodologies considering the isolation capabilities of unexpected scenarios represents, nowadays, a trending topic able to answer the demanding requirements of the future industrial processes monitoring systems. First, the method is based on the temporal segmentation of the available physical magnitudes, and the estimation of a set of time-based statistical features. Then, a double feature reduction stage based on principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis is applied in order to optimize the classification and novelty detection performances. The posterior combination of a feed-forward neural network and one-class support vector machine allows the proper interpretation of known and unknown operating conditions. The effectiveness of this novel condition monitoring scheme has been verified by experimental results obtained from an automotive industry machine.
