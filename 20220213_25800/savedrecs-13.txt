However, there are still some critical issues, such as aging of electrical insulation. In practice, most of the stress variables responsible for insulation degradation, e.g., electrical, thermal, mechanical factors are not available or measurable, especially during operation. Recently computational intelligence approaches are being applied for that class of problems. However, the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), due to their flexibility and lower data requirement and lower complexity, have gained attention. In this paper GAMs are applied to assess insulation state by mapping relationship between measurements, fault history and information from various sources with a varying degree of uncertainty. Results support that GAMs are promising candidates for online insulation assessment and fault diagnosis systems on account to their remarkable advantages.

Predicting Hypertensive Patients With Higher Risk of Developing Vascular Events Using Heart Rate Variability and Machine Learning	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Hypertension; cardiovascular events; cerebrovascular events; heart rate variability; ANOVA; machine learning; feature selection; RUSBOOST	BLOOD-PRESSURE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; DISEASE; STROKE; RHYTHM	The prognosis of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events for patients suffering from hypertension is considered of a high importance in preventing any further development of cardiac diseases. Despite of the ability of current gold standard techniques in predicting vascular events risks, they still lack the required clinical efficiency. In this vein, the study proposed herein provides an investigation on the feasibility of using heart rate variability (HRV) utilized through a machine learning approach to predict hypertensive patients at higher risk of developing vascular events. Initially, HRV features were extracted from all patient's data using time-domain, frequency-domain, non-linear, and fragmentation metrics. The extraction of features was based on a 24-hour cycle analysis segmented into four time periods; namely late-night, early-morning, afternoon, and evening. Analysis of all features was performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test on period by period basis. Furthermore, the selection of best features was performed following a Chi-squared test for demographic and HRV features. Then, a model based on decision trees and random under-sampling boosting (RUSBOOST) was trained using demographic features, HRV features, and a combination of both features. The performance of the trained model achieved a maximum accuracy of 97.08% using the combined set of features during the afternoon time period. In addition, the precision and F1-score in predicting high risk patients reached 81.25% and 86.67%, respectively. The overall area under the curve for the model was at 0.98, suggesting a high performance in the sensitivity and specificity measures. This study paves the way towards utilizing machine learning models and heart rate variability for the prognosis of vascular events in hypertensive patient. Furthermore, it assists clinicians in decision making by providing a simple, yet effective, and continuous prediction approach when compared to other available techniques.

However, it shows high variability in prognosis, and more precise stratification is required for personalized medicine. In this paper, we identify two prognostic subgroups of luminal-A breast cancer. We train a deep autoencoder with gene expression profiles of luminal-A breast cancer, and it automatically generates informative latent features that represent essential properties of gene expressions. We find that two subgroups (BPS-LumA and WPS-LumA) clustered using the latent features are significantly different in prognosis (p-value=1.23e-6; log-rank test). This prognostic difference is validated with other luminal-A breast cancer cohort. The results in our method suggest that the deep autoencoder is able to extract and compress complex properties of gene expressions patterns, and that it is usefully applicable to patient stratification for precision medicine of luminal-A breast cancer.

METHODS: Five machine learning methods were tested on the patient data set with previous preprocessing for dataset cleaning and feature selection: Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The models were applied in a cohort of 155 patients treated with MTX which was derived in a training (124 patients) and a test cohort (31 patients). Both clinical variables and genetic variations were included. The chosen outcome was the therapy response measured as a DAS 28 <3.2. The performance evaluation criterion was the area (AUC) under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The algorithms with the highest predictive power were SVM (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74 - 0.90) and ANN (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75 - 0.89). For the MTX cohort, the main selected variables were age, follow-up time, functional class, and genotypes of the rs9344, rs4148396, rs4673993, rs1801133 and rs7279445 variants. CONCLUSIONS: A prognostic model with high predictive power was developed in the cohort of patients treated with MTX, which is able to identify patients less likely not to respond to treatment.

Predictive maintenance has the potential of saving a lot of money by reducing and predicting machine breakdown. In this case study we work with generalized data to show how this scenario could look like with real production data. For this purpose, we created and evaluated a machine learning model based on a highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree in order to predict machine errors or tool failures. Although the case study is strictly experimental, we can conclude that explainable AI in form of focused analytic and reliable prediction model can reasonably contribute to prediction of maintenance tasks.

That prognosis is essential for German insurance companies, since a short illness or injury is covered by the health insurance, whereas a longer absenteeism (over six weeks) is covered by a special insurance. Insurance companies have to calculate the risk for that special case in order offer an appropriate insurance rate. Our model gives an assessment of the risk, and thus plays a vital role in the calculation of the insurance rate that can be offered to a professional football player.

However, due to the characteristics of the sensitive materials in the chemical gas sensor, the measurement quality of sensor array decreases in long-term practical application, which gradually affects the analytical results of the machine olfactory system as the time goes on. The self-validating sensor has fault detection and isolation module, fault diagnosis module, fault recovery module and uncertainty analysis module. These functions of self-validating sensor are suitable for monitoring the reliability of the chemical sensor array. In this paper, the self-validating sensor technology is introduced into chemical gas sensor array to improve the measurement quality, so as to improve the overall performance of machine olfactory system. A prototype of self-validating chemical sensor array is designed to illustrate the feasibility of its application in machine olfactory system.

As a result, malfunctions of these machines have devastating consequences. In this context, it is very important to diagnose faults before or during the start-up phase. In this paper, the vibration signals obtained from the computerized CNC machine drill bit whiledrilling the metal plate. For fault diagnosis, feature extraction was first performed. A total of 21 properties were extracted from the vibration data in the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain. The features that were taken at certain intervals from the dataset were doubled to get more accurate results. After the feature extraction process, the data was normalized. The normalization process was determined as min-max and z-score. After the normalization process, classification was carried out by Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbors (kNN) methods. As a result of these processes, %96,45 and %94,37 accuracy rates for SVM and kNN were obtained respectively.

Prognostics-aware systems for health analysis aim to integrate health information and knowledge about the future operating conditions into the process of selecting subsequent actions for the system. Developments in smart manufacturing as well as deep learning-based prognostics provide new opportunities for health analysis and degradation starting point forecasting. Rotating machines have many critical components like spinning, drilling, rotating, etc. and they need to be forecasted for failure or degradation starting times. Moreover, bearings are the most important sub-components of rotating machines. In this study, a convolutional neural network is used for forecasting of degradation starting point of bearings by experimenting with Nasa Bearing Dataset. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized widely for 2D images, 1-dimensional convolutional filters may also be embedded in processing temporal data, such as time-series. In this work, we developed one such autoencoder network which consists of stacked convolutional layers as a contribution to the community. Besides, in evaluation of test results, L-10 bearing life criteria is used for threshold of degradation starting point. Tests are conducted for all bearings and results are shown in different figures. In the test results, proposed method is found to be effective in forecasting bearing degradation starting points.

Traditional anomaly detection methods, based either on comparing the behavior of the real system with its model or on different signal processing methods, have been successfully applied for Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) in mechatronic systems. Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex in both structural and behavioral terms. They consist of numerous heterogeneous components that generate large volumes of data, exchange information and form extremely complex patterns of behaviour. This makes it almost impossible to effectively set up and apply classical reliability assessment methods. The article discusses the basic models of machine learning and the possibility of their application to solve the problem of CPS reliability. It is proposed to use neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) to detect anomalies in the CPS. The neural network architecture with 3 hidden, input and output layers was designed. The experiment with testing data (Tennessee Eastman Process dataset) was conducted and analysis of the results was carried out.

Condition monitoring (CM) of such machine can significantly reduce repair costs and unexpected break downs. In this paper, electrical signature analysis (ESA) approach is used to carry out condition monitoring of a centrifugal pump driven by a single phase induction motor. A multi-fault classification method based on support vector machines is developed and the parameters are optimized for fault diagnosis and classification. An experimental test rig is constructed to collect voltage and current signals under five different conditions including: healthy, vane tip fault, cracked impeller, leakage and cavitation. The data are then classified and the probability of belonging to each class is calculated using a trained sigmoid function. The proposed fault diagnosis scheme shows a good accuracy for the pump fault classification process.

A wider array of defects in comparison with other thermography surveys is investigated. While many fault conditions led to significant heat dissipation, a number of fault conditions result in even less heat dissipation than that of healthy equipment, implying a challenging segmentation. To overcome this problem, a pre-processing step is applied which divides data into two distinct categories according to the equipment's thermal state, namely 'cold' and 'hot' states. Afterwards, Random Forest and AdaBoost classifiers are utilized for segmentation using a sliding window approach, with regard to Interpretable Machine Learning. Moreover, a new dataset of infrared images of transformer and 3-phase induction motors is created. The proposed method has been evaluated on the very same dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.

The blades of the wind turbine play an important role since these are used for the conversion of kinetic energy into electrical energy. The blades of the wind turbine experience severe vibrations due to adverse environmental conditions, huge size, variation in wind speeds, and continuous operation throughout. These vibrations lead to serious damage to the turbine resulting in the reduction of its productivity and may lead to failure in the future. The faults must be recognized at the early stage so that energy conversion is not affected. Therefore, effective health monitoring and fault diagnosis are important for evading severe damage to the wind turbines. The identification of faults in any system requires physical knowledge of the parts which are not readily available every time. Hence data-driven models are used for classification and diagnosis of faults. The present work aims to diagnose the faults in a wind turbine blade using vibration signals as the measured signal which is acquired from the hardware setup and classify the faults using different machine learning techniques and then the performance of the classifiers are compared. The experimental work is carried out using a wind turbine set-up by introducing the different conditions of the blades i.e. healthy and defective blades. To find the suitability of the proposed method, the signal acquisition is done at three different speeds using a suitable instrumentation system. The required statistical parameters are extracted from the measured vibration signals. Then three different machine learning classifiers are applied for the classification of faults. The performances of the classifiers are evaluated in terms of the percentage of accuracy from the confusion matrix. The proposed work shows that the machine learning technique is a good approach for wind turbine fault classification and the vibration signal is a good choice as a measuring signal for the detection and diagnosis of the faults in wind turbine blades.

As applications have increasing performance requirements and datacenter networks get into ultra-low latency, we need submicrosecond-level bound on time-uncertainty to reduce transaction delay and enable new network management applications (e.g., measuring one-way delay for congestion control). The state-of-the-art clock synchronization solutions focus on improving clock precision but may incur significant time-uncertainty bound due to the presence of failures. This significantly affects applications because in large-scale datacenters, temperature-related, link, device, and domain failures are common We present Sundial, a fault-tolerant clock synchronization system for datacenters that achieves similar to 100ns time-uncertainty bound under various types of failures. Sundial provides fast failure detection based on frequent synchronization messages in hardware. Sundial enables fast failure recovery using a novel graph-based algorithm to precompute a backup plan that is generic to failures. Through experiments in a >500-machine testbed and large-scale simulations, we show that Sundial can achieve similar to 100ns time-uncertainty bound under different types of failures, which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the state-of-the-art solutions. We also demonstrate the benefit of Sundial on applications such as Spanner and Swift congestion control.

There are techniques that generate test sequences with guaranteed fault detection power using CSs. The number of inputs and input sequences in a CS directly impacts the cost of the test: the higher the number of elements, the longer it takes to generate the test. Despite the direct benefits of using CSs with fewer sequences, there has been no work focused on generating minimum sized characterizing sets. In this paper, we show that constructing CS with fewer elements is a PSPACE-Hard problem and that the corresponding decision problem is PSPACE-Complete. We then introduce a heuristic to construct CSs with fewer input sequences. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using randomly generated FSMs as well as some benchmark FSMs. The results are promising, and the proposed method reduces the number of test sequences by 37.3% and decreases the total length of the tests by 34.6% on the average.

Hence, the mathematical model analysis is fundamental to comprehend the behavior of the machine in order to implement a certain type of control. This article presents a comparison between the effects on the current, in steady-state, of electrical parameter variations of a three-phase induction motor model based on discrete-time with a continuous model by considering electrical parameters fixed in nominal values. Side by side comparisons between the application of pure sinusoidal waveforms and PWM waveforms generated by a voltage source inverter to the induction motor are presented. Simulation results are provided to show the parameter with the most significant impact over the machine when varying values.

Ratio-based DGA parameters are ranked using their skewness. Optimal sets of intrinsic mode function coefficients are obtained from the ranked DGA parameters. A Hierarchical classification scheme employing XGBoost is presented for classifying the features to identify six different categories of transformer faults. Performance of the Proposed Method is studied for publicly available DGA data of 377 transformers. It is shown that the proposed method can yield more than 90% sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of transformer faults, a superior performance as compared to conventional methods as well as several existing machine learning-based techniques.

One of the most critical challenges in IoT space is the preventive maintenance in industrial manufacturing processes to maximize equipment availability and durability. Traditionally, preventive management only follows less cost-effective strategies, say time or usage based management. With large amount sensor data harvested from IoT, we can develop much more intelligent predictive maintenance based on accurate machinery failure prediction. In this paper, we develop a framework named DoM (Doctor for Machines) to produce the best predictive model for several oil and gas industry engagements. Our framework is built in the form of pipeline that allows us to generate multiple models simultaneously with parallel computing. We configure the modeling process by assigned different machine learning tasks as such sampling, feature extraction, modeling, and post-processing into the pipeline. The pipeline forms a machine learning graph workflow. With the automation of execution all the tasks in the workflow, the client can easily choose a best predictive model fitting their failure tolerance. We have successfully applied DoM to six data sets, and identified valuables insights on the best practices of creating predictive model. Our clients have successfully achieved financial benefits by applying DoM to develop predictive maintenance schemes to their expensive equipment.

Their mechanical parts such as electrical engines, rotors, or bearings are the major components and any failure in them may result in their total shutdown. Anomaly detection in such critical systems is very important to monitor the system's health. As the requirement to obtain a dataset from rotating machines where all possible faults are explicitly labeled is difficult to satisfy, we propose a method that focuses on the normal behavior of the machine instead. We propose an autoencoder model-based method for condition monitoring of rotating machines by using an anomaly detection approach. The method learns the characteristics of a rotating machine using the normal vibration signals to model the healthy state of the machine. A threshold-based approach is then applied to the reconstruction error of unseen data, thus enabling the detection of unseen anomalies. The proposed method can directly extract the salient features from raw vibration signals and eliminate the need for manually engineered features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by employing two rotating machine datasets and the quality of the automatically learned features is compared with a set of handcrafted features by training an Isolation Forest model on either of these two sets. Experimental results on two real-world datasets indicate that our proposed solution gives promising results, achieving an average F1-score of 99.6%.

Several novel deep learning approaches have already been developed to forecast the failure of a particular system or element. Most of them focus only on the improvement of the accuracy and thus, very complex deep architectures are generated to solve the RUL prediction task. However, such complex models can hardly be implemented in an embedded system. Thus, they could not be suitable for applications such as the condition monitoring of vehicles or mobile robots. On the other hand, we propose a new architecture named Multipath Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN), which is based on residual networks. This novel architecture enables an accurate prediction of the time to failure (TTF) of a system and simultaneously reduces the computation complexity. Moreover, the hyperparameters of the network are optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA). We validate the efficiency of our approach by using the C-MAPSS database and perform a direct comparison with the state of the art approaches for failure prognosis. The experimental study validates the high performance of MTCNs to solve the RUL prediction task with a minimal computational complexity in comparison to other published approaches. This will enable the deployment of MTCN for on-board monitoring applications of mobile systems in future research.

An Autocorrelation-based LSTM-Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection on Time-Series Data	2020 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)	IEEE International Conference on Big Data		English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)	DEC 10-13, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IBM, Ankura		Anomaly detection; Autocorrelation; Data quality tests; Explainability; LSTM-Autoencoder; Time series		Data quality significantly impacts the results of data analytics. Researchers have proposed machine learning based anomaly detection techniques to identify incorrect data. Existing approaches fail to (1) identify the underlying domain constraints violated by the anomalous data, and (2) generate explanations of these violations in a form comprehensible to domain experts. We propose IDEAL, which is an LSTM-Autoencoder based approach that detects anomalies in multivariate time-series data, generates domain constraints, and reports subsequences that violate the constraints as anomalies. We propose an automated autocorrelation-based windowing approach to adjust the network input size, thereby improving the correctness and performance of constraint discovery over manual and brute-force approaches. The anomalies are visualized in a manner comprehensible to domain experts in the form of decision trees extracted from a random forest classifier. D omain e xperts c an t hen provide feedback to retrain the learning model and improve the accuracy of the process. We evaluate the effectiveness of IDEAL using datasets from Yahoo servers, NASA Shuttle, and Colorado State University Energy Institute. We demonstrate that IDEAL can detect previously known anomalies from these datasets. Using mutation analysis, we show that IDEAL can detect different types of injected faults. We also demonstrate that the accuracy improves after incorporating domain expert feedback.

However, implementing such systems addresses several challenges. First, all information related to the system description and failure definition must be collected and processed. In this regard, using an expert system (ES) seems interesting. The second challenge, when monitoring complex systems, is to deal with the high volume and velocity of the input data. To reduce them, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can be used to identify relevant events, based on predefined rules. These rules can be extracted from the ES knowledge base using model transformation. This process consists in transforming some concepts from a source to a target model using transformation rules. In this paper, we propose to transform a part of the knowledge from a condition-based maintenance (CBM) model into CEP rules. After further explaining the motivations behind this work and defining the principles behind model-driven architecture and model transformation, the transformation from a CBM model to a "generic rules" model will be proposed. This model will then be transformed into an Event Processing Language (EPL) model. Examples will be given as illustrations for each transformation.

Discrete event system methods such as finite state machines and Petri Nets have been useful for diagnosing known faults in such systems. However, existing methods do not scale as well for practical applications where faulty behavior is not fully known and event timing may vary. With the advent of big data, a new methodology is presented that strengthens fault diagnosis capabilities utilizing machine learning and Timed Petri Nets. The hybrid approach consists of building a Timed Petri Net model of the normal process to help select discriminating features based on timed event sequences. This work focuses on modeling Timed Petri Nets to serve as knowledge representations of the nominal process behavior to guide data-driven fault diagnosis of timed event systems. A methodology based on identification of observable events is introduced, consisting of three different and complementary heuristics including demarcating periods, modeling concurrencies, and imposing synchronizations. Then, using features selected by using the Timed Petri Net, a nonlinear SVM is implemented for multiclass fault classification. The proposed framework is applied to an existing semiconductor manufacturing process with events timed via binary programmable logic controller signals. With over 97% validation accuracy achieved for fault diagnosis, the hybrid modeling approach shows promise for smart manufacturing applications.

Recently, with the advancements in the micro-array technologies thousands of gene expression related data of glioma patients are acquired, leading for salient analysis in many aspects. Thus, genomics are been emerged into the field of prognosis analysis. In this work, we identify survival related 7 gene signature and explore two approaches for survival prediction and risk estimation. For survival prediction, we propose a novel probabilistic programming based approach, which outperforms the existing traditional machine learning algorithms. An average 4 fold accuracy of 74% is obtained with the proposed algorithm. Further, we construct a prognostic risk model for risk estimation of glioma patients. This model reflects the survival of glioma patients, with high risk for low survival patients.

It is identified as one of the main causes of pain leading even to disability. To exploit the continuous increase in medical data concerning KOA, various studies employ big data and Artificial Intelligence analytics for KOA prognosis or treatment. However, most of the studies are limited to either specific groups of patients or specific groups of features, such as MRI, X-ray images or questionnaires. In this study, a machine learning pipeline is proposed to predict knee joint space narrowing (JSN) in KOA patients. The proposed methodology, that is based on multidisciplinary data from the osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) database, employs: (i) a clustering process to identify groups of people with progressing and non-progressing JSN; (ii) a robust feature selection process consisting of filter, wrapper and embedded techniques that identifies the most informative risk factors that contribute to JSN prediction; and (iii) a decision making process based on the evaluation and comparison of various classification algorithms towards the selection and development of the final prediction model for JSN. The evaluation was conducted with respect to model's overall performance, robustness and highest achieved accuracy. A 78.3% and 77.7% accuracy were achieved in left and right leg by Logistic Regression on the group of the 164 risk factors and SVM on the group of the 88 and 90 risk factors, respectively.

Within this context this work presents a model predictive control (MPC) approach to deal with faults related to loss of actuators effectiveness. These undesired events occur when the associated degradation effects, whose evolution is assumed to be measurable and predictable, overcomes certain thresholds. The presented scheme consists of two modules: a prognostic device in charge of monitoring actuators health and a control reconfiguration unit whose action is based on actuators degradation information. The idea exploits a switching systems paradigm to formally model healthy and faulty plant configurations and to offline determine sequences of pre-computed inner approximations of one-step controllable sets. Such regions are then on-line selected by a switching logic to compute a proper control signal on the basis of the measured degradation level.

The mechanical spindle, which is often used in the processing of complex aeronautical structures such as titanium alloys, has the characteristics of large torque and impact resistance. However, its long drive chain and complex structure make it difficult to effectively forewarn and diagnose its faults. In this paper, a fault forewarning and diagnosis method is designed, which is based on the analysis of characteristics of vibration time-frequency domain of mechanical spindle. Firstly, a method for calculating the frequency characteristics of key components in the drive chain of mechanical spindle is proposed, and the signal characteristics of vibration are obtained. Secondly, according to the position and layout of each component in the spindle drive chain, the layout scheme of signal acquisition points is designed based on the principle of point-to-surface integration. This scheme ensures that the signals of each point can not only reflect the state of the spindle, but also reflect the vibration characteristics of different parts. Variable speed test is carried out on different equipment of the same type, and the signals processed by Fourier transform, and the frequency domain signals at different speeds are obtained. The time-frequency signal of the spindle is analyzed to find its vibration characteristics. Combining with the results of theoretical calculation, the working state of the spindle and the working performance of each component, as well as the specific fault parts and types of fault are obtained. Through experimental verification, the method proposed in this paper effectively improves the ability of working state monitoring and fault diagnosis of the spindle system.

S	Thall, PF	Thall, PF			Thall, Peter F.	Thall, PF		Getting Personal	STATISTICAL REMEDIES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCHERS	Springer Series in Pharmaceutical Statistics		English	Article; Book Chapter								In day-to-day practice, a physician uses each patient's individual characteristics, and possibly diagnostic test results, to make a diagnosis and choose a course of treatment. Because the best treatment choice often varies from patient to patient due to their differing characteristics, routine medical practice involves personalized treatment decisions. The advent of sophisticated machines that provide high-dimensional genetic, proteomic, or other biological data for use in this process has made it much more complex, and this often is called "precision" or "personalized" medicine. In this chapter, I will discuss the simple version of personalized medicine in which one or two patient covariates or subgroups may interact with treatment. Examples will include (1) a biomarker that interacts qualitatively with two treatments, (2) an illustration of why the routine practice of averaging over prognostic subgroups when comparing treatments can lead to erroneous conclusions within subgroups, (3) a randomized trial design that makes within-subgroup decisions, (4) a phase II-III select-and-test design that makes within-subgroup decisions, and (5) a Bayesian nonparametric regression survival analysis that identifies optimal dosing intervals defined in terms of the patient's age and disease status.										0	0	0	0	0	SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG	CHAM	GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND	2366-8695	2366-8709	978-3-030-43714-5; 978-3-030-43713-8	SPR SER PHARM STAT			2020							225	245		10.1007/978-3-030-43714-5_11	10.1007/978-3-030-29149-5		21	Medicine, Research & Experimental; Statistics & Probability	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Research & Experimental Medicine; Mathematics	BR7BX	WOS:000665510000012					2022-02-14

ADASs along with new safety standards are now essential to improve the safety of automated driving. These standards differ from the safety standards in other industries because an autonomous vehicle rides in a very intricate stochastic environment where many details should be considered to maintain the safety. From one point of view, autonomous car failures are divided into two categories: hardware and software failures. According to the literature, if the reason of fault belongs to hardware, the troubleshooting will relatively be easier than software failure. In other words, if the fault is the subset of software, that would be more challenging task to detect potential fault and recover from the failure. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect the software failures, which may be unpredictable using a typical safety protocol. A predictive machine learning method is developed to improve decision making process in order to avert the potential accidents occurred by software defects. The proposed method evaluates detected obstacle in the span of a specified number of frames to discern whether objects are detected correctly or not. Hence, it provides extra time to choose the suitable action before it reaches the danger, which includes lane changes, cut-in maneuvers, stopping the car, accelerating the car, slowing down, and allowing vehicles to pass. Results show that the new approach improve the safety by increasing the precision of failure detections.

Knowing the parameters that have impact on reliable network operation and their use in network performance analysis and evaluation are very important. Thus, in case of degradation, intervention is possible before the fault actually occurs and exactly on the faulty equipment. This brings an increase in efficiency with respect to the scenario in which the enhancement solutions are brought subsequent to network events. This paper proposes tracing a predictive behaviour for certain performance indicators of an LTE RAN network and in presenting optimisation solutions of the undesired behaviour. Also, we propose an analytics framework for the access network that can be applied to 5G and beyond 5G RANs. A set of APIs is used in order to extract all the parameters from the LTE RAN Network and store them into a database. After that, the data is exported for further processing and analytics. Results show that the Gradient Boosting algorithm is the most suitable to be used in such a framework.

It can reduce the dimension of modeling data and facilitate the final monitoring accuracy. However, almost all the existing monitoring models are trained based on normal data. In practice, not only a mass of normal data but also fault data are easily collected and stored by the advanced sensing and computer technology. Therefore, this paper deals with the problem of monitoring through the development of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) approach. The developed FDD technique uses feature extraction and selection, and fault classification tools under different operating conditions. This is addressed such that, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is used for extracting and selecting features and the machine learning (ML) classifiers are applied for faults diagnosis. Only the most relevant features are chosen to be fed to different ML classifiers. The classification performance is established via different metrics for various ML-based PCA classifiers using data extracted from different operating conditions of the grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) system.

Regardless of fault types, incipient faults are usually more difficult to detect and accurately isolate. As an alternative and effective method, the principal components analysis (PCA) is proposed to extract and select more relevant features and support vector machines (SVM) technique is applied to quickly detect the faults that occur in a GCPV system. The T-2 and squared weighted errors (SWE) statistics, generally used as fault detection indices, are appropriately extracted and selected within the PCA framework. Both of these features are fed to a SVM classifier handling the incipient fault detection. This task is carried out on a simulated GCPV operating under maximum power point trackers (MPPT) and matching realistic outdoor to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique.

Therefore, this paper deals with the problem of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in WTC systems. The developed FDD approach uses feature extraction and selection, and fault classification tools for monitoring WTC system under different operating conditions. The developed FDD approach is addressed such that, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is used for feature extraction purposes and the machine learning (ML) classifiers are applied for fault diagnosis. In the proposed FDD approach, an efficient features in PCA subspace that extract and select the most informative features from WTC data are provided. Besides, their statistical characteristics are also included. The ML classifiers are applied to the extracted and selected features to perform the fault diagnosis problem. The effectiveness and higher classification accuracy of the developed approach are demonstrated using simulated data extracted from different operating conditions of the wind turbine.

The proposed AFTC scheme is based on switching between a classical controller based on integral proportional (IP) controller under normal conditions and a robust fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in faulty case. In order to guarantee the continuity of the service and to overcome the problems caused by the sensor fault, a new FTC structure based on FLC is designed to improve PMSM drives speed controls during faulty mode. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate the PMSM rotor speed that generates a residual signal for the fault detection block (FD). Finally, a numerical simulation carried out to prove the efficiency of the proposed AFTC control strategy.

Thus, this paper introduces a novel structure multiscale reduced kernel principal component analysis (MS-RKPCA). The proposed FD method aims to address the problem of great computation time and significant storage memory space by using a data reduction structure based on the Euclidean distance metric. Additionally, to further enhance the RKPCA method, a multiscale representation of data will be used. The enhanced MS-RKPCA method uses the wavelet coefficients of the reduced data at each scale to enhance the fault detection results. The detection performance of the proposed MS-RKPCA method is evaluated using the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). The effectiveness of the enhanced method is evaluated in terms of the missed detection rates (MDR), false alarms rates (FAR) and computation time (CT). The results demonstrate that the developed technique is more effective for fault detection mostly in terms of computation time and memory storage space.

Hence, the diagnosis and the fault detection of the machinery has become considered essential in order to guarantee high performances of the plant operation. Since induction machines dominate all drives, their health management (HM) has received high attentions. Despite the persistent usage of double cage induction machines (DCIM), their HM suffers from a lack of research focus. The advances in signal processing tools inspire this work at the aim of diagnosing one of the most hardly detected defects of DCIM. In fact, the challenge in the diagnosis of the DCIM is the early detection of the breakage of the outer cage's bar. This work represents a new alternative using the Information Entropy of the Second Generation Wavelet Transform (SGWT). Based on the Current Analysis, numerous severity levels of broken rotor bar are analyzed including the incipient broken outer cage's bar under several load levels. The concluded results validate the competency of this approach.

The developed FDD technique is addressed such that, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is used for features extraction purposes and the machine learning (ML) classifiers are applied for fault diagnosis. In the proposed FDD approach the most efficient features are extracted and selected through PCA scheme using induction motor data. Besides, their statistical characteristics (mean and variance) are also included. The ML classifiers are applied using the extracted and selected features to perform the FDD problem. The obtained results indicate that the proposed techniques have a wide application area, fast fault detection and diagnosis, making them more reliable for induction motors monitoring.

Existed DNN based fault diagnosis does not transfer all the features to the classifier since only the most abstract feature is fed into the classifier. This will lead to an inaccurate fault diagnosis result. In order to overcome this problem, a deep multi-scale feature fusion mechanism is developed by designing an additional multi-scale feature fusion network to fuse feature extracted at different scales. Thus more comprehensive multi-scale feature can be fed into the fault classifier to achieve more accurate diagnostic results.

This study proposes a feature denoising-based fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery. In the proposed method, raw signals are firstly decomposed into several subsignals of different frequency bands using the empirical mode decomposition. Based on these subsignals, multiple fault features are extracted. Then, variational mode decomposition (VMD)-based feature denoising technique is used to process the obtained features. Finally, a random forest classifier is applied to identify different machinery faults. Experimental results show that the VMD-based feature denoising approach can effectively remove the noise data and largely improve the classification performance.

If the mine fan fails, it will cause inestimable losses and bring subsequent problems. Therefore, it is necessary to study the safe use and operation of mine ventilator. Aiming at the common bearing failures of mine ventilators, this paper innovates a fault diagnosis model based on rough set attribute reduction and cross entropy algorithm. Through the study of the model, the following conclusions are drawn: This paper combines rough set attribute reduction and cross entropy algorithm, which is very good for fault detection of mine fan bearings, and can be considered in actual production.

This method decreases the effect of the interference from the fault characteristic sensitivity and operating conditions through the dimensionless index's calculation. It can also find out the evidence needed for fusion basic probability assignment values by the two sample K-S test. Finally, it conducts evidence fusion using a modified D-S algorithm. The advantage of the proposed method that makes it superior to other methods is that it can deal with fuzzy, incomplete or accurate data. Therefore, the input signals of petrochemical rotary machinery equipment and sensor equipment can be processed directly. In this paper, experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, so the decision risk can be reduced.

Currently, the data collected by the mainstream monitoring technologies based on sampling is difficult to cover all anomalies, and the kernel's lack of observability also makes it difficult to monitor more detailed data in container environments such as the Kubernetes platform. In addition, most of the current technology solutions use tracing and application performance monitoring tools (APMs), but these technologies limit the language used by the application and need to be invasive into the application code, many scenarios require more general network performance detection diagnostic methods that do not invade the user application. In this paper, we propose to introduce network monitoring at the kernel level below the application for the Kubernetes cluster in Alibaba container service. By non-intrusive collection of user application L7/L4 layer network protocol interaction information based on eBPF, data collection of more than 10M throughputs per second can be achieved without modifying any kernel and application code, while the impact on the system application is less than 1%. It also uses machine learning methods to analyze and diagnose application network performance and problems, analyze network performance bottlenecks and locate specific instance information for different applications, and realize protocol-independent network performance problem location and analysis.

The ability of DL methods for automatic feature extraction can reduce the need for time-intensive feature construction and prior knowledge on complex signal processing. In this paper, we propose two models that are built on the Wide-Kernel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (WDCNN) framework to improve performance of classifying fault conditions using multivariate time series data, also with respect to limited and/or noisy training data. In our experiments, we use the renowned benchmark dataset from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing experiment [1] to assess our models' performance, and to investigate their usability towards large-scale applications by simulating noisy industrial environments. Here, the proposed models show an exceptionally good performance without any preprocessing or data augmentation and outperform traditional Machine Learning applications as well as state-of-the-art DL models considerably, even in such complex multi-class classification tasks. We show that both models are also able to adapt well to noisy input data, which makes them suitable for condition-based maintenance contexts. Furthermore, we investigate and demonstrate explainability and transparency of the models which is particularly important in large-scale industrial applications.	[van den Hoogen, J. O.

The status monitoring and fault diagnosis of traditional coal mining machinery mainly rely on threshold judgments. However, a single judgment condition and a long fault propagation chain can be found in the method of threshold judgments, which make it difficult to accurately seek the fault type. By using the data analysis of state parameters for coal mining machinery, fault parameters and propagation paths can be analyzed effectively. This paper takes the cutting unit of a certain type of bolter miners as an example, a static and dynamic numerical analysis method of the cutting unit of bolter miners are established by virtue of FTA-Petri net models and BP-Firefly neural networks, which can provide a new perspective for fault diagnosis of coal mining machinery.

Existing fault detection methods suffer problems such as low efficiency and low accuracy. In order to improve the reliability of the cloud data center, a fault detection algorithm based on weighted one-class support vector machine (WOCSVM) is proposed to detect and identify the host faults in the cloud data center. Specifically, first, we conduct correlation analysis among monitoring metrics and select key ones for reducing the complexity. Second, for imbalanced monitoring dataset, one-class support vector machine is used to detect and identify host faults, and a weight allocation strategy is proposed to assign weights to the samples, which describes the importance of different sample points in order to improve detection accuracy on potential faults. Finally, for the purpose of increasing the accuracy further, the parameters are set via a parameter optimization algorithm based on quantumbehaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). Furthermore, experiments by comprising with similar algorithms, demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm under different classification indicators.

A Method for Dissolved Gas Forecasting in Power Transformers Using LS-SVM	PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION FUSION (FUSION 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	23rd International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)	JUL 06-09, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK			Power transformers; machine learning; dissolved gas analysis; time series forecasting; predictive maintenance	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; REGRESSION; MODEL	Maintenance data from power transformers are typically in the form of dissolved gas analysis time series data. This research attempts consolidating industry knowledge on the maintenance of power transformers and time series forecasting techniques into a coherent system for the purpose of predictive maintenance of power transformers. The generalisability of forecasting models is investigated by measuring performance of single models across multiple transformers, and hence, multiple data sets. A novel method of data preprocessing is utilized; an exponential smoothing technique specifically designed for the type of raw data received (aperiodically sampled, noisy data). In addition, industry specified features for fault classification from the literature were added to the data set. These other features were examined to see if they improved forecasting. The forecasting techniques evaluated included Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) with hyper-parameters optimized using a Particle Swarm Optimisation; Support Vector Regressors; Naive forecasts; Mean forecasts; Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving average or ARIMA; and Exponential Smoothing. Two sets of experiments were run, which differed in how the Training, Validation, and Testing sets were chosen. These experiments were run for different input vectors; the original input vector and an input vector augmented with the industry specified features. Models trained in the second experiment outperformed all other models, when the distributions of the Testing errors were considered. When generalisability was considered, it was found that the models trained across all transformers outperformed the per-transformer models that treated the data as univariate time series.

The main goal of this study is to build a prognostic tool that will predict the progression of pain in KOA patients using data collected at baseline. In order to do that we leverage a feature importance voting system for identifying the most important risk factors and various machine learning algorithms to classify, whether a patient's pain with KOA, will stabilize, increase or decrease. These models have been implemented on different combinations of feature subsets, and results up to 84.3% have been achieved with only a small amount of features.

The IRES program engages faculty at the ASU SenSIP Center and at the University of Cyprus' (UCy) KIOS Center to address fault detection and other research problems in solar energy arrays. IRES participants are tasked with studying algorithms and software to monitor and control solar arrays. Research involves using data from programmable sensors embedded in smart monitoring devices (SMDs) that are attached to solar panels. The SMDs have sensors, actuators and radios that enable researchers to work with a solar array where every panel provides data. IRES participants are trained to use machine learning to assess the solar array condition. The program also trains the students to perform research and present results in international settings. In the first year of the project, four students travelled to the University of Cyprus and worked with UCy faculty on fault detection. The program included weekly research presentations by the students at UCy, presentations at a local workshop and continued engagement after the summer experience at ASU. Two of the students were able to present and publish their work in international conferences.

These devices, typically available as head-mounted displays, are enabling the move towards the complete transformation of how medical data is viewed, processed and analysed in clinical practice. There have been recent attempts on how XR gadgets can help in surgical planning and training of medics. However, the radiological front from a detection, diagnostics and prognosis remains unexplored. In this paper we propose a standard framework or architecture called Medical Imaging in Extended Reality (MIXR) for building medical image analysis applications in XR. MIXR consists of several components used in literature; however, tied together for reconstructing volume data in 3D space. Our focus here is on the reconstruction mechanism for CT and MRI data in XR; nevertheless, the framework we propose has applications beyond these modalities.

The most significant and the most used methods suitable for this vibrodiagnostic field have been selected, namely support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, Mahalanobis-Taguchi system and principal component analysis for reduction of a dimensionality of a features space. All the methods have been implemented in MATLAB and their performance has been analyzed using same input datasets. As the input for all the aforementioned methods, data from bearing shortened life-cycle test, done by Bearing Data Center at Case Western Reserve University, have been used. Intentionally, computationally intensive pre-processing procedures have been excluded from the computational chain, as only time domain features have been used for the classification process. Resulting from this study, a classification error rate, an execution time, an implementation difficulty and a robustness of the algorithm strongly differ among all the methods while using the same input data and the same number and type of the input extracted features.

The issue is focused on the design of a suitable neural network, its optimization and deployment in a 32-bit microcontroller with regards to the limiting factors of the chosen microcontroller. The introductory part of the article is a description of the used technology and hardware on which the solution will be implemented. Accelerometer motion recognition was chosen as a practical application. The proposed solution recognizes 6 basic movements, respectively movement in three axes. Tensorflow and Keras frameworks were used to design and implement a neural network. The created neural network model was after optimization implemented in the firmware of the STM32L4x microcontroller. The proposed solution implements automatic motion detection and its subsequent classification. The proposed principle can be applied to a group of sensors connected to the available interfaces of the microcontroller. Application with an accelerometer can be used to detect specific vibrations, application with MEMS microphones can be used to detect specific sound patterns that indicate a possible fault condition of the monitored device in industry.

However, there is no consensus on which of the various metrics are the most suitable for classifiers' performance evaluation. This paper examines the applicability of common evaluation metrics for predictive maintenance applications in production systems. It is intended to clarify (1) which metrics are well suited for this use case, and (2) whether they are sufficient as a sole decision criterion for algorithm selection. Further, (3) the significance of evaluation metrics concerning the practical impact on the production system's performance is investigated. Moreover, we analyze (4) how increasing the production system's complexity affects the correlation between algorithm evaluation metrics and performance. We conducted 960 simulation runs of a flexible flow shop production system to examine the impact of machine breakdowns and different failure distributions with varying confusion matrices. In addition, two different configurations of the production system, which differ in system complexity, were investigated. Eventually, we determined the product-moment correlation coefficient between common evaluation metrics and the production system's performance. The simulation results reveal that metrics that are sensitive to false negative values (FN), like the False Omission Rate (FOR), are very well suited. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis shows that even (FOR) can only provide reliable statements combined with other metrics. We found that as the system becomes more complex, the informative value of the metrics in terms of their impact on the production system's performance decreases. Finally, we propose parameters that could be relevant for developing new metrics considering the current system configuration.

Due to its importance, fault detection and diagnosis of rotating machinery is a major challenge in the industrial applications to maintain the productions a good quality. Having the merit of learning from data - the big data issue, the diagnosis takes a significant advance in its efficiency recently, and becomes a data-driven predictive task. In order to thoroughly recognize the advantage of the data-driven techniques in the effective diagnosis of rotating machinery faults, this study sought to have solutions of deep learning techniques for this kind of diagnostic task, and tested the capability the solution could reach. By gathering data, extracting features, and learning the task through the architectures of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), an experiment was conducted to know the capability. The outputs show the roughly fair predictive accuracies of 99.02% and 86.01% for both the CNN and RNN models. Although the close accuracies, there are still differences in both the models. Comparisons arise thereafter for the model selection in the future applications.

Though hospitals in urban areas are using advanced technology for diagnosis and prognosis, disease prediction is one of the hypercritical tasks. Providing sophisticated and accurate algorithms and techniques to overcome this issue will be revolutionary. In this paper, we present a machine learning technique using Decision Tree Algorithm (DTL) to interconnect the symptoms and rearrange them and retrieve the most probable diagnosis. This technique allows the system to self-learn without using programming. This paper presents a system for diagnosis of common diseases by entering the symptoms into the system.

Big number of people is passing their life or poor survival rate is because of this disease every year. Females are at high risk of BC, so it became quite essential and necessary for doctors to choose for an exact and suitable treatment for avoidance and remedy of cancer patients. So the basic motive is to find the cancer cells very correctly. Forecasting and categorization of BC using an effective and correct model of machine learning (ML) is essential for creation a new type of BC prognostic and diagnostic policies that really give a reduction push to the sufferer. Diversified technology, including Bayesian classifiers, Artificial Neural Networks and Decision Trees have been commonly applied in cancerous tumor. Undoubtedly methods used for Machine Learning may increase our understanding about breast cancer prediction and progression. It is important to consider these approaches in daily clinical practice. Neural networks are now a day's very key and popular field in computational biology, chiefly in the area of radiology, oncology, cardiology and urology. In this study, we had summarized numerous ML techniques which could be used as an important tool by surgeons for timely detection, and prediction of cancerous cells has been studied and introduced.

It allows autonomous devices with the possibility to use the Internet for communication and exchange of data. This paper focuses on monitoring the transformer in real-time fault detection and records distinct operating parameters of the transformer like voltage imbalance, load current, transformer oil levels, temperature, vibration. Based on these parameters, the transformers fail state (i.e. a state where transformer malfunctions or completely stops working) and health (i.e. voltage, current, oil levels, temperature and vibration) are predicted by making use of an artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. Use of this technology can minimize working efforts, thereby improving accuracy, stability, efficiency. Thus, remote monitoring and machine control are achieved, as well as ANNs help to determine the performance and yield appropriate measures accordingly. In this case, sensors are used to sense the important parameters of equipment such as current, voltage oil level in any operating transformer. By analyzing relevant data using ANNs, this system will be beneficial in many industries. Likewise, this system is generalized to be used in a wide array of industrial automated machines.

There were different approaches taken to detect these faults. But, there were very less number of approaches of detection of faults through RSSI. There can be many reasons for change in the measured value of a node. But, change in RSSI can only be limited to distance, disturbance or due to the health of the node. Due to this reason, we are motivated that detection of fault in WSN using RSSI can be reliable than other methods in suitable scenarios. Also, a suitable machine learning technique has been implemented to reduce human involvement in the detection process.	[Pradheepa, R.; Bhuvaneshwar, M.; Kumar, S. Ajay; Raj, B. Ajay; Anusha, K.

Exact recognition of voltage sag causes (VSCs) can help decrease the problems initiated due to voltage dip in electric power system. ST is a well-known time-frequency analysis technique. Initially, the extracted voltage signals are pre-processed through ST and several statistical features are extracted, which are later applied as inputs to ELM classifier for voltage sag cause detection. Here, three significant causes are simulated for voltage sag in MATLAB/Simulink, like (i) single-phase and three-phase fault, (ii) starting of induction motor and (iii) energization of transformer. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with other existing voltage sag cause classification techniques. The classification results indicate the ability of the proposed technique for detection and classification of VSCs more accurately.

Gears are important rotary devices for power and torque transmission. Study on gear teeth relationship is considered as one of the most complicated applications because the speed, load conditions, and application cause different failures, leading to non-stationary operating conditions. Hence, an appropriate signal processing technique to identify the gear fault diagnosis plays a vital role in condition monitoring system. This work attempts the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) to identify the effect of the new time-frequency distribution, which increases the performance of fault diagnosis in gear. Also, the method using HHT is compared with fast Fourier transform (FFT). As a novel approach, the statistical feature called energy was calculated for all intrinsic mode functions (IMF) obtained from the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) of the signal which is suitable for the selection of IMF for applying HHT. The fault diagnosis of gear is done clearly using the present approach.

The data used in this work is provided by the rotary machine fault simulator. These data include 14 different states, including 13 modes with unbalanced and bearings faults at different locations and a healthy mode, recorded by six acceleration sensors. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method is used for signal decomposition and feature extraction. Nine different features of the signals are extracted and the PCA method is used to reduce the dimensions of the data. Also, in the classification section, the performance of three types of classifiers RBF, MLP and FCM are evaluated. The results show that the best performance pertains to the RBF method using two Kurtosis and RMS features with the number of intrinsic mode functions (IMF) equals 9 and dimensions reduced to 25. In this case, accuracy in the test phase was obtained at 96.42%.

This analysis focused on assessing the value of PCA for improving the classification accuracy of failures within current-voltage (IV) traces. Our results show that combining PCA with random forests improves classification by only similar to 1% (bringing the accuracy to >99%), compared to a baseline of only random forests (without PCA) of >98%. The inclusion of PCA, however, does provide an opportunity to study an interesting representation of all of the features on a single, two-dimensional feature space. A visualization of the first two principal components (similar to IV profile but rotated) captures how the inclusion of a current differential feature causes a notable separation between failure modes due to their effect on the slope. This work continues the discussion of generating different ways of extracting information from the IV curve, which can help with failure classification - especially for failures that only exhibit marginal profile changes in IV curves.

Line-Line (LL) fault should be detected precisely because it is not scrutable easily by traditional protection devices under low mismatch level and high fault impedance. This paper proposes a novel method for Line-Line fault detection by extracting the main features from Current-Voltage (I-V) curves of PV arrays. In this paper grid search (GS) method used to obtain a reliable method for Line-Line (LL) fault detection by optimizing the parameters of the kernel for Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. The simulation results verify that this novel method precisely detects Line-Line (LL) faults in PV arrays with an accuracy of 100%.

Data-driven approaches can classify such losses however, the appropriate PV data features required for accurate classification remains unclear. To avoid misclassification, this study reviews the potential issues associated with inabilities to separate fault conditions that overlap using certain data features. Feature selection techniques that define each feature's importance and identify the set of features necessary for producing the most accurate results are also explored. The experiment quantified the amount of overlap using both maximum power point (MPP) and current and voltage (I-V) curve data sets. The I-V data provided an overall increase in classification accuracy of 8% points above the case where only MPP was available.	[Jones, C.

In order to facilitate the further fault prognosis of the PV module, in this paper, the model parameters of the single diode model for a glass-cracked PV module with cracked cells, which cannot be visually inspected, are extracted based on the outdoor measured current-voltage (I-V) curves. The cracks of the solar cells are also observed from the electroluminescence images. The comparison results of the I-V curves from a referenced normal PV module and the glass-cracked PV module indicate that the photocurrent and the equivalent shunt resistance of the cracked solar cells in the fault PV module decreases significantly. The extracted parameters can quantitatively describe the failure degree of the cracked solar cells. The extracted parameter can also be used to further predict the degradation trend of the fault PV module and realize fault prognosis of PV modules.

This paper is embedded in this project and addresses faults for which we have little data or which may occur in the future. For this we use different state of the art unsupervised anomaly detection approaches (e.g. LSCP, VAE or MOGAAL) and compare them in terms of their applicability to our problem. We combine the monitoring data of 70 PV plants with weather data and preprocess them for the usage in multiple models. Each model is elaborated with the same dataset and afterwards compared according to its accuracy. In our scenario we only want to detect new occurring faults and not long term existing faults like shadows. The models should be able to detect the actual behavior of the PV system.

However, the durability of on-board fuel cells is facing challenges. Aiming at improving system durability and reliability, prognostics and health management, as a smart manufacturing discipline, have been applied to monitor the system health state and protect the system integrity. This paper proposes to combine prognostics when developing energy management strategies for fuel cell electric vehicles, which is used to assess and predict the fuel cell perliwmance. This paper has also considered the uncertainties of the prognostics results and a prognostics-enabled decision making process is designed as the post-prognostics process to perform energy management in a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle.

The occurrence of catastrophic failure modes gives rise to abrupt unscheduled down time and maintenance, machine overheating (burn-out), as well as significant reliability and health and safety considerations for various mission critical end-applications. This paper proposes a robust method of remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify the wear states of the rolling element bearings. Different types of feature sets are derived from the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) as well as Envelope Analysis; which are compared for both linear and non-linear wear state models. The methods were optimised for different types of SVM kernelling functions and achieved classification accuracy of up to 67.6%. Medium and coarse Gaussian kernelling functions achieved the highest level of accuracy. This proposed method proves to be a valuable non-invasive predictive CbM approach for electric and rotating machines, using accelerometer based vibration signals mounted on the external races of rolling element bearings under test.

This method uses 1DCNN to extract features from the collected multiple sensor signals, and then uses RF algorithm for classification.

These developments have made the processing and interpretation of sensor data a new problem to be solved. In this study, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and WaveNet are used to produce solutions for predicting remaining useful life. Experimental studies were performed on jet engine sensor data containing degradation and failures using subsets FD001 and FD003 in C-MAPSS Turbofan engine dataset. The results obtained were analyzed using various evaluation metrics and graphs. Mean square error (MSE) values obtained from LSTM tests are 11.02 for FD001 and 26.89 for FD003. MSE values obtained from WaveNet tests are 10.85, 20.71 for FD001 and FD003 respectively. Finally, tests are also evaluated by using decision level fusion and applying weighted sum rule to LSTM and WaveNet models. The results obtained clearly showed that the decision level fusion system have promising results for predictive maintenance.

A number of advanced integrity sensors, including ultrasound thickness (UT) and acoustic emissions (AE) systems, are installed on vessels and pipe throughout the plant. They are able to detect in advance cracks and corrosion and gather continuous data, which feed a simple prognostic model and, in turn, is able to continuously update the information about the expected RUL, in order to support reasonable decisions about equipment life extension as well as inspection scheduling and stops planning. The software exploits an existing platform for communication, database and user interface.

We take into account uncertain information of the predicted equipment degradation adopting a stochastic programming formulation. To adjust the likelihood of the failure scenarios, we embed a prognosis model, the Cox model, into the optimization problem. We propose here a novel endogenous uncertainty formulation where the decisions at one point in time have an impact on the probability of the uncertainty. We provide computational results implementing a custom branching within the global solver BARON and decomposing the problem via the Benders algorithm.

The aerospace industry is particularly in need of this, for instance, the remaining life expectancy of aircraft engines is of great significance to guarantee the safety and reliability. However, it is hard to establish the physical model of aircraft engines with the complex degradation process, which motivates the data-driven solution to RUL prediction. In this paper, a data-driven RUL prognostic approach is proposed for aircraft engines. Key performance indicators are extracted from sensor variables through principal component analysis. The summation wavelet-extreme learning machine is used to predict the KPIs' degradation process by iterative method, and then KPIs' degradation states are determined by subtractive-maximum entropy fuzzy clustering to calculate the RUL of engines. To validate the prediction model, aircraft engine degradation data are used for model simulation. Compared with other algorithms, the proposed method delivers superior prediction performance.

As it is well known, vibrations vary with the sensor location on the transformer tank, which makes the number and the placement of sensors critical aspects for fault detection. In this paper, we investigate this issue by analyzing vibration spectra collected from various sensors installed on the tank of a typical oil filled power transformer operating under two limit cases, namely absence or presence of clamping looseness on windings. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are employed and an extensive analysis is performed to understand the informativeness of data corresponding to various sensors so as to figure out the appropriate number of sensors and their best location. This way fault detection is eventually achieved with a reduced and optimized number of sensors, resulting in a significant saving of time and costs. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, a priori knowledge of faults that may occur in the system is not required. The adaptive scheme combines online and offline learning of the on-policy control method to improve exploration and sample efficiency, while guaranteeing stable learning. The offline learning phase is performed using a data-driven model of the system, which is frequently updated to track the system's operating conditions. We conduct experiments on an aircraft fuel transfer system to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

This approach is based on applying a non-linear transformation to the residuals of the node pressures to increase the separability of the leak classes. The transformed features can be interpreted as the direction cosines in the subspace spanned by the residuals of the measured pressures. In order to illustrate the method, different tests were performed with MATLAB (R) applying four different classification algorithms on a synthetic dataset obtained from an EPANET model of the Hanoi network. Then, by considering the cosenoidal features, a significant improvement in the leak location error was achieved. In this way, the leak location error decreases by more than 97% compared to the use of residual features when accurate measurements are used, and about 50% when noisy measurements with 60 dB SNR are used.

Traditional detection techniques for software defect contain static and dynamic analysis, both of which require a great deal of workforce and time. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, software defect prediction has opened a new avenue to circumvent the drawbacks of traditional analysis approaches. Although various learning-based techniques in the prediction field have been developed, there is a lack of systematic summary and classification from the technical point of view. This paper studies the problem from the three aspects: traditional machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid learning. Moreover, the predicted performance is discussed in detail, especially in cross-project and just-in-time, to understand current research status thoroughly. This paper also provides a useful guide for further research, particularly for the potential usage of deep learning in semantic defect prediction.

Machine Learning Techniques for Fault Detection of Induction Motor Bearings	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FRONTIERS IN AUTOMOBILE AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (FAME 2020)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Frontiers in Automobile and Mechanical Engineering (FAME)	AUG 07-09, 2020	Chennai, INDIA	Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn		Fault detection; Bearing vibration; Machine learning; artificial neural networks	DIAGNOSIS	This paper gives an approach based on a fitting technique to detect faulty bearings by employing artificial neural networks (ANNs). At present, many companies follow very expensive, scheduled maintenance procedures for checking the bearing condition of the electric drives. Therefore, there is considerable demand to reduce the maintenance costs and to prevent unscheduled downtime of electrical drives in company. To overcome the above crisis, online monitoring of vibrations in electric motors at running condition can be implemented. Most of the vibration measuring equipment measure the total vibration of the electric motor. Deducing the bearing fault from the total vibration value of the motor is not accurate. Hence it is quintessential to split the total vibration value of the motor into its sub-components namely bearing vibration and the vibration due to loading. This splitting could visualize the exact occurrence of fault in the machine. For the known loading conditions of the motor, the total vibration, bearing vibration and the vibration due to loading are tabulated. Some tabulated data are used to train the ANNs for the known machine conditions. Once trained, the ANNs are examined using the remaining data. The final evaluated ANNs can readily split the total vibration value into its sub-components enabling the computation of component value. These sub-component vibration values are analyzed individually for abnormalities to find the bearing fault accurately.

Bearing Fault Diagnosis Using Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm Through Vibration Signals	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FRONTIERS IN AUTOMOBILE AND MECHANICAL ENGINEERING (FAME 2020)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Frontiers in Automobile and Mechanical Engineering (FAME)	AUG 07-09, 2020	Chennai, INDIA	Sathyabama Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Engn		Ball bearing; Vibrational Analysis; Fault Diagnosis; FURIA Classification	BALL-BEARINGS; DEFECTS	Bearing is a critical component in the condition monitoring of any rotary machines. In the rotating machines, the bearing is the most widely used rotating elements. Any fault on the surface of the ball bearing will cause surface fatigue and leads to the failure of the ball bearing. They are caused mainly by the cyclic loading of the shaft and it is an inevitable one, when the bearing is in running condition. By condition monitoring these bearings it will helps us to proliferate the performance of the machines and reduce the maintenance cost of the industries. This paper presents the uses of Fuzzy Unordered Rule Induction Algorithm (FURIA) classification for the features collected from the vibration signals of the fault bearings and the good ones. The features from the signal can be extracted by the J48 statistical feature extraction method. The analysis is achieved by comparing the feature extraction of signals obtained in both the conditions in LabVIEW. By applying the FURIA classification to the extracted features in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) classification software and the faults in the bearings are diagnosed. The results show that FURIA algorithm has a better classification accuracy of 95.83% for identifying the bearing conditions.

This advantage becomes many folds when regarding the future condition i.e. time to failure, named remaining useful life, is available in addition to that of the present condition. Thus, prognosis is one of the most useful tools to improve the working of a machine as many critical decisions can be made. Prognosis can be critical for applications that risk loss of life and property. In this paper, a hybrid method, utilizing bond graph and artificial intelligence, is proposed for system health estimation (SHE) and prognosis. The Bond Graph model is used to calculate Energy Activity, which is used as a common metric for both SHE and prognosis. The proposed method is checked by simulation on a spring mass damper system undergoing a fault. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Planetary Gear Faults Detection in Wind Turbine Gearbox Based on a Ten Years Historical Data From Three Wind Farms	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	21st IFAC World Congress on Automatic Control - Meeting Societal Challenges	JUL 11-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Federat Automat Control, Siemens, Bayer, ABB, MathWorks, Phoenix Contact, Ifak Technol, Berlin Heart, Elsevier, De Gruyter, Tele Medi GmbH		Wind turbine gearboxes; fault detection; feature extraction; dynamic principle component analysis; support vector machine	VIBRATION SEPARATION; DIAGNOSIS; BEARING	Gear faults contribute to a significant portion of failures in wind turbine system. As such, condition monitoring and fault detection of these components assist in maintenance scheduling; hence, preventing catastrophic failures of the gearbox. This paper introduces a new hybrid fault detection approach to detect gear faults in wind turbines. to accomplish this task, vibration signals are collected and used to extract various time-domain features. Next, a Dynamic Principle Component Analysis (DPCA) is adaptively employed to identify failure dynamics by reducing the time-domain feature dimension. Following that, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is implemented to detect and isolate gear faults. Experimental test studies with ten-year historical data of three wind farms in Canada are conducted. Test results indicate that the proposed hybrid approach performs superior compared to DPCA using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks (NNs). Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

During this process, a small deviation of a robot axis can lead to other axes drifts, and then significantly affects the product quality. Hence, this paper aims to present an effective approach to monitor and diagnose the origin position deviations of multi-axis robots. The proposed method uses the encoder measurements of each axis to extract features and build appropriate health indicators. These obtained health indicators are then injected into a Machine Learning classifier to localize the origin of the deviation, i.e which axis causes these drifts. Furthermore, the performance of this method is verified through a real industrial test bench, used for machining, that investigates various deviation severities in different axes of the robot.

However, in practice, the way in which a system operates significantly impacts the future evolution of its degradation. Therefore, this paper aims at evaluating the impact associated with the utilization of three different methods to characterize future operating conditions within the implementation of probability-based prognostic algorithms, namely Long-short term memory (LSTM), Markov Chain and Constant (or time-invariant) usage. These three methods are compared together in terms of both prognostic accuracy and essential update times when investigating the Time-of-Discharge (ToD) of an electric bicycle Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) battery.

The present work proposes a Model Predictive Control scheme that integrates remaining useful life predictions of the blade based on a stiffness degradation model embedded in a prognostics algorithm. The flapwise blade root bending loads are used as inputs to the damage model which describes the propagation of damage from a microscopical scale manifesting in a macroscopical scale as stiffness loss. The proposed control scheme integrates prognostics information in the MPC formulation in order to optimize the trade-off that exists between the conflictive objectives of producing power and extend the remaining useful life of the blades.

Firstly, comprehensive set of statistical features are extracted from in-field raw accelerometer data. Then, a seperability based feature selection metric is utilized to select relevant features in order to enhance accuracy of fault detection algorithm. Afterwards, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), which is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm, is trained using the selected features for fault detection. The comparative analysis on fault detection is also conducted in this study using different classifiers next to XGBoost. The approach is validated on different fault types of screen cleaners. The results show that the ensemble learning outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy and can be effectively used for NPP screen cleaners condition monitoring.

However, traditional data-driven methods rely on handcrafted feature selection from the whole range of time series data, which may not obtain the temporal information for complex systems. This study proposes a gated recurrent unit networks based approach to predict remaining useful life. First, time window approach is applied on sample preparation for multiple sensor data. In particular, unsupervised stacked sparse autoencoder is utilized to automatically extract nonlinear features, then the selected features are fed into gated recurrent unit based recurrent neural networks to predict remaining useful life. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on the commercial modular aero-propulsion system simulation data from NASA. Experimental results validate that the proposed approach achieves better prediction performance than other methods. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Knowledge-based maintenance strategies for optimal operation of industrial machines and physical assets reasonably require explaining and predicting long term economic impacts, based on exploring historical data. This paper examines how supervised machine learning (ML) techniques may enhance anticipating the economic impact of maintenance on profitability (IMP). Planning and monitoring of maintenance activities supported by various statistical learning and supervised ML algorithms have been investigated in the literature of production management. However, data-driven prediction of IMP has not been largely addressed. A novel data-driven framework is proposed comprising cause-and-effect dependencies between maintenance and profitability, which constructs a set of appropriate features as independent variables.

Data-driven methods to deliver this service are gaining momentum due to developments regarding information and communication technologies. Particularly, fault prediction may be interpreted as a supervised learning classification problem, in which algorithms trained by operational data gathered from the shop-floor are capable of informing managers whether a machine might enter in a failure state or not. Despite the relevance of this approach, implementations are hindered by several challenges. In this work, we review approaches aimed to deal with four of these challenges, namely: limited amount of training data, unbalanced training data sets, uncertainty regarding which variables should be monitored, and uncertainty regarding how exactly historical data should be employed in the algorithm's training. To deal with training sets with limited size, learning procedures observed to perform well with a lower volume of training data can be used, such as the Random Forests technique. Alternatively, transfer learning techniques can be utilized to adapt models trained in a virtual domain with abundant synthetic data to the real manufacturing system domain To deal with unbalance among classification classes, cost-sensitive learning methods can be employed to alter the penalties incurred when misclassifications occurs in the minority class. Alternatively, resampling methods can be applied before learning occurs. Lastly, both the decisions regarding which variables to track, and to what extent historical data should be included in the training process, can be addressed through the use of specific feature selection methods.

Intelligent control interfaces are useful for simulating robots vectors' capabilities in a safe and cost-effective way, but it is challenging to accurately emulate the behavior of the physical tools. When an unmanned autonomous vehicles breaks down or malfunctions, engineers can always go back to check the digital traces using the "digital-twins" VIPRO- Platform for diagnosis and prognosis. This paper presents an integration of Cyber Physical Systems using intelligent control interfaces and genetic algorithms into developing "digital-twins" VIPRO- Platform in 5G Digital Era to improve their accountability and capabilities for cyber-physical manufacturing. The intelligent control interfaces data are used to extract the machining characteristics profiles of a digital-twins machine tool, with which the tool can better reflect the actual status of its physical counterpart in its various applications. The modelling techniques and decision making in complex systems for controlling the position of a unmanned autonomous vehicles engaged in a mission are discussed, and analytical techniques of data and genetic algorithms are presented for modeling and developing "digital-twins "VIPRO- Platform.

Distribution independent threshold setting based on one-class support vector machine	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	21st IFAC World Congress on Automatic Control - Meeting Societal Challenges	JUL 11-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Int Federat Automat Control, Siemens, Bayer, ABB, MathWorks, Phoenix Contact, Ifak Technol, Berlin Heart, Elsevier, De Gruyter, Tele Medi GmbH		fault detection; one-class; support vector machine; convexity; parameter optimization; randomized evaluation; uncertainties; distribution independent; threshold setting	RANDOMIZED ALGORITHMS; FAULT-DETECTION; DESIGN	In this paper, threshold setting issues for data-driven fault detection are addressed. It is state of the art that multivariate analysis based threshold setting schemes are widely applied, which generally require detailed knowledge about the distribution of the process data. The often used Hotelling's T-2, SPE threshold setting is based on the assumption of Gaussian distributed process data. In industrial applications, the distribution of data sets is often unknown or non-Gaussian. Alternatively, the fault detection is formulated as classification or outlier detection (one-class) problem which can be solved e.g. by means of machine learning algorithms. The classifier parameter choice is normally done by expert knowledge or using iterative approaches like cross validation. Such a procedure has considerable influence on the fault detection performance. The availability of training and evaluation data collected under faulty conditions is mostly very limited or time and cost consuming and thus often problematic. This paper presents an iterative threshold setting algorithm, which only uses fault-free data for parameter optimization. For this purpose, a one-class support vector machine which is restricted to convex data sets (including non-Gaussian) is used. The effectiveness of the proposed threshold setting scheme is assessed based on false alarm rate, fault detection rate and randomized algorithm evaluation. Additionally, random uniform distributed uncertainties (scaling and rotation) and offset faults (inside an ellipse) are taken into account. Finally, a comparison study with principal component analysis and Hotelling's T-2, SPE threshold setting schemes is demonstrated. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

The identification of these oscillations by the encoders may help to determine the performance of the machine and the health conditions. In operations, the trend is usually several orders higher than the interested magnitude fluctuations, making it hard to identify feeble swings without signal deformity. Besides, the swings can be intricate, and the amplitude can be changed under a non-stationary operating condition. In order to overcome this problem, the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is suggested to detect the feeble position oscillations of the rotary encoder signal in this article. It allows the complex signal of the encoder to be reduced to a variety of explainable noise-containing components, a collection of periodic oscillations and a trend. The numerical emulation reveals the achievement of the technique; it demonstrates that the SSA is superior to the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in terms of accuracy and ability. In addition, rotary encoder signals from the robot arm are evaluated to identify the causes of oscillation at junctions during industrial robot movements. The proposed route for the robotic arm is proven, feasible and reliable.

Critical parameters, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and metabolite concentrations, are routinely measured and controlled in a cell culture process. While these extensive networks of sensors generate critical process information and insights, they are also prone to failures and malfunctions. In this paper, we propose a condition-based maintenance (CbM) framework for real-time sensor-health management, with a focus on fault detection, diagnosis, and prognostics. To this effect, a slow-feature analysis (SFA)-based platform is proposed for the detection and diagnosis of sensor-health. For health prognostics, a Gaussian process (GP) model is proposed for forecasting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the sensor along with the probability of failure. The efficacy of the proposed sensor-heath management strategy is demonstrated in a biomanufacturing process. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Instead of assuming exact knowledge of disturbance distribution, the uncertainty of distribution information is taken into account by considering an ambiguity set of disturbance distributions. The biased minimax probability machine scheme is exploited to formulate an integrated design of the parity vector/matrix and the detection threshold. It maximizes the worst-case fault detection rate (FDR) with respect to selected reference faults, while ensuring a predefined worst-case false alarm rate. Firstly, a scalar residual design is derived in an analytical form. The analysis of its FDR in the presence of an arbitrary fault shows its limitation due to using a single reference fault. This issue is further addressed by proposing a vector residual design with a systematic method to select multiple reference faults. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by a simulation example. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Latent projection (LP), a statistical method that extract features of data via dimensionality reduction, is an alternative approach to diagnosis as it can be formulated to not rely on process knowledge. However, LP methods may perform poorly at identifying abnormal process variables due a "fault smearing" effect variables unaffected by a fault are unintentionally characterized as being abnormal. The effect occurs because data compression permits faulty and non-faulty variables to interact. This paper presents an autoencoder (AE), a nonlinear LP method based on neural networks, as a monitoring method of a simulated nonlinear triple tank process (TTP). Simulated process data was used to train the AE to generate a monitoring statistic representing the condition of the TTP. Sparsity was introduced in the AE to reduce variable interactivity. The AE's ability to detect a fault was demonstrated. The individual contributions of process variables to the AE's monitoring statistic were analyzed to reveal the process variables that were no longer consistent with normal operating conditions. The key result in this study was that sparsity reduced fault smearing onto unaffected variables and increased the contributions of actual faulty variables. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

But only if the belt tension is properly adjusted, optimal working conditions are ensured. A loss of efficiency or even breakdowns might be the consequences otherwise. For this reason, tension monitoring reduces operation costs and may prevent failures. In order to meet industrial requirements, the monitoring is supposed to rely on standard sensor data. From this data, features are extracted in time and frequency domain which are passed on to a random forest. For further improvement, a segmentation of the frequency spectrum is performed beforehand. In this way, interval-based spectral features can be extracted to capture small distinctive parts in the frequency domain. For this purpose, two different segmentation procedures are compared in a random forest regression. A belt drive powered by a 1.9 kW synchronous servomotor is used to evaluate the proposed approaches in two different industrial scenarios. The experimental results show that both segmentation methods enhance the performance of a tree-based regression and offer a reliable tension prediction. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

The knowledge of the actual health state of such components permits to address maintenance policies which results in better exploitation of their actual operational life span and consequently in maintenance cost reduction. In this paper, we exploit the way electric cams are implemented on the vast majority of PLC/Motion controllers to develop a suitable condition monitoring procedure. This technique relies on computing the higher-order differences of the current absorbed by slave motors to get signals that do not depend on a priori knowledge of the cam trajectory and of the mechanism nominal model. Subsequently, we will use these data in the Model-of-Signals framework, to gather information on the mechanism's health condition, which in turn can be used to perform predictive maintenance policies. The differenced signal is modelled as an ARMA process and the model capabilities in condition monitoring are then shown in simulation and experimental application. Besides, this framework allows exploiting the edge-computing capabilities of the machinery controllers by implementing recursive estimation algorithms. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, some variables cannot be easily measured due to different causes, such as acquisition and/or maintenance costs and slow acquisition time. This situation leads to a lack of real-time information in the process, which could lead to lower quality in the final product. One of such processes is the debutanizer column, where butane content measurement is highly delayed. To enable online prediction of such variables, available information from the process can be used to estimate predictive models, known as soft sensors. To this end, data-driven techniques can be used, such as statistical and machine learning. However, such techniques usually take into account a single metric when estimating the models, and there are multiple factors that play an important role when designing a soft sensor, such as stability and accuracy. To cope with such a situation, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization design procedure, where feature selection and ensemble member combination are performed. Therefore, the multi-objective differential evolution algorithm with spherical pruning (spMODE-II) is initially employed for building a pool of non-dominated linear support vector regression (SVR) models. Subsequently, the same evolutionary algorithm is applied for selecting the weights of the previously generated models in a weighted combination ensemble. In a final multi-criteria decision making stage, a preferred ensemble is selected using the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE). Results indicate that the proposed approach is able to produce a highly stable and accurate butane content soft sensor for the debutanizer column. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Then the dataset is divided into the training set and the test set. Relying on the powerful machine learning library of Python language, the support vector machine model is constructed by programming. After selecting the appropriate kernel function and hyperparameters, the fault diagnosis accuracy of the support vector machine model on the test set reaches a high level.

Due to increasing trend of Internet of things (IoT), numerous sensors deployed around the world are developing at a rapid pace. In this paper, an IoT-based wireless control and monitoring system has been presented for determining the health of induction motor (IM). A module of sensors has been employed to monitor the different parameters, viz. current, voltage, temperature, and speed which were processed using microcontroller for analysis and display purposes. Further, the Ethernet module has been used for sending the information from the microcontroller to cloud (Cayenne) database for wireless remote monitoring and controlling of inductionmotor. The system has been implemented to monitor and control various parameters in real time, and also improving the detectability of different faults due to over limiting of the current, voltage, temperature, and speed values. The proposed system has significant potential in industrial environment with complex systems to economically monitor the condition of machine safely in real time.

These publications include a wide range of statistical approaches for model-based approaches. Uncertainty in prediction cannot be avoided; therefore, algorithms are working to help manage these uncertainties. Remaining useful lives (RUL) are regularly updated through adaptive degradation models identified by using the concept of sampling importance resampling (SIR) filter. The SIR filter algorithm has become a popular choice formodel-based progressive system. As a matter of study, we consider a hydraulic system and develop a detailed physics-based model and use extensive simulations to describe our prehistoric science approach and to evaluate its effectiveness and strength.

The degradation function of a fault in the system is determined using a two-phase diagnostic bond graph model (DBG). By intentionally imparting a time-varying fault in the pump displacement, the capability of the DBG model is exhibited. The analytical redundancy relations (ARRs) evaluated from the first DBG helps to discern the manifestation of fault. Making use of ARRs of the first phase, the second DBG delivers the degradation pattern of the fault enabling the determination of remaining useful life (RUL) of the system.

Nevertheless, many academic studies of machine learning-based malware detection consider and evaluate performance on datasets that do not evolve with time, although it is recognized in practice that malware detection models will necessarily deteriorate in performance over time due to the emergence of novel malware threats. In this study, we make use of a large dataset comprised of the features extracted from malware/goodware executable samples in the very common Portable Executable (PE) format, that are orderable by time of first appearance, to analyze the deterioration of machine learning-based malware detection models over time from training. Of the large number of models we trained and then evaluated on later occurring subsets of the dataset, we note the relative strength of Random Forest to maintain predictive performance into the future. We then consider in greater depth, Random Forest-based models for malware detection, considering Random Forest hyperparameter choices to achieve better maintenance of performance and discuss the significance of the findings for PE malware detection approaches.

However, it is vulnerable to faults due to the immature ReRAM fabrication process. We propose an efficient online fault-detection method for RCS; the proposed method monitors the dynamic power consumption of each ReRAM crossbar and determines the occurrence of faults when a changepoint is detected in the monitored power-consumption time series. In order to estimate the percentage of faulty cells in a faulty ReRAM crossbar, we compute statistical features before and after the changepoint and train a predictive model using machine-learning techniques. In this way, the computationally expensive fault localization and error-recovery steps are carried out only when a high fault rate is estimated. Simulation results show that, with the fault-detection method and the predictive model, the test time is significantly reduced while high classification accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using RCS can still be ensured.

This is particularly relevant in the event of on-board subsystem errors or failures. In this research, we show how encoded Extended Kalman Filter can be used to detect anomalous behaviors of critical components of nonlinear autonomous systems: sensors, actuators, state estimation algorithms and control software. As opposed to prior work that is limited to linear systems or requires the use of cumbersome machine learned checks with fixed detection thresholds, the proposed approach necessitates the use of time-varying checks with dynamically adaptive thresholds. The method is lightweight in comparison to existing methods (does not rely on machine learning paradigms) and achieves high coverage as well as low detection latency of errors. A quadcopter and an automotive steer-by-wire system are used as test vehicles for the research and simulation and hardware results indicate the overhead, coverage and error detection latency benefits of the proposed approach.

This paper presents a predictive analytics methodology using a continuing stream of anomaly data to tackle soft failure testing challenges. It is within a proposed silicon health prognosis framework. Multi-State Models (MSM) are applied to model soft failure progression with prognostic factors (e.g. interference) as time-varying covariates. The unique power of anomaly data can be unleashed with statistical machine learning techniques to infer potential interference effects on failure evolution and recovery rates. Failure prediction results can further be used for safety mitigation decision making. Several examples in context of 3-D mixed-signal SOC are analyzed to illustrate the proposed method. These predictive analytics methodology and prognosis framework are expected to pave an alternative way to improve dependability of safety critical systems.

In this study, a balanced induction motor is modelled in D-q reference frame and thereafter the model is modified by varying the rotor resistance to achieve the broken rotor bar fault. the broken rotor bar fault is incepted at a point where the induction motor has reached its steady-state to allow proper interpretation of machine behaviour under fault conditions. When comparing the effect of fault at varied load conditions, it is observed that there arc more oscillations or dips on the torque when the motor is loaded above 50%. The broken rotor bar fault also created an imbalance in the speed and magnetic flux curve. The fault simulations and analysis presented in this paper depicts detectable patterns on rotor quantities for different fault conditions.

Using clinical data, physiological measurements and vital signs during the first 48-hour after their admissions, the model specified the patients' death correlations therefrom identified high-risk patients and their survival probability. Cox Proportional Hazards model is used to classify the patients as dead or survival with the accuracy measured by Score 1-the minimum of sensitivity and positive predictivity-of 0.45, which is 1.5 times better than that of the baseline ICU scoring system. Meanwhile, Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) removes redundant variables and Regression analysis estimates the patients' death time. The model excels in clinical prediction in terms of good classification, hybrid usage of data analysis, machine learning and signal processing for more insightful extraction of clinical features. Furthermore, the fast response time and heterogeneous multivariate diagnosis in multidimensional dataspace, including temporal changes of time-variant physiological measurements proposed a effective solution for real-time ICU monitoring system. Ultimately, this work serves as a predictive indicator of patient status, helping physicians and clinicians get insight into each individual for the most optimal treatment and resources allocation.

In diabetic disease, the body does not properly respond to "insulin", an important hormone that converts sugar into energy needed for the proper functioning of regular life. The disease comes with severe complications on our body as it increases the risk of developing kidney disease, heart disease, eye retinal disease, nerve damage, and blood vessel damage. As per the World Health Organization, about 8.8% of the world was diabetic in the year 2017 and they have projected it to reach nearly 10% by 2045. This study develops a model for diabetic prediction based on data mining classifications techniques. Classification of imbalanced data especially in medical informatics is challenging and was the motivational factor for developing a classifier using a rebalancing algorithm. A two-phase classification model is employed in which the first step is preprocessing the data by use of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and the second one is feeding five classifiers (Bagging, SVM (Support Vector Machine), MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), Simple Logistic and Decision Tree) with the preprocessed data in order to select the best classifier for balanced dataset to predict diabetes. We have achieved an accuracy of 94.7013%, and 0.953 receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve with decision tree classifier. The validation was achieved via a 10-fold cross validation with an experiment that was conducted on clinical records of 734 patients.

In such circumstances, angle/time cyclo-stationary analysis of a machine signal is a fundamental procedure for condition monitoring of rotating machine operating at variable speed. Rolling element bearing is widely used in rotating machines starting from bicycle to more sophisticated machines like cryogenic engines. In the present paper, a hybrid diagnosis scheme based on computed order tracking and envelope analysis is used as diagnosis scheme for condition monitoring of rolling element bearing operating at a fluctuating speed of approximately 5-15 Hz. Experiments were conducted using Spectraquest machine faults simulator. Rolling element bearing with fault in the outer race is taken to show the effectiveness of the diagnosis scheme.

Acoustic Emission-Based Grinding Wheel Condition Monitoring Using Decision Tree Machine Learning Classifiers	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING, ICAMME 2019	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Advances in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (ICAMME)	MAR 15-17, 2019	KIIT Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Bhubaneswar, INDIA		KIIT Univ, Sch Mech Engn	Grinding; Condition monitoring; Acoustic emission; Decision tree		Condition monitoring has emerged as an important technique in manufacturing industries for predictive maintenance and on-line monitoring of the processes and equipments. Due to the availability of sensors and signal processing technology, implementing condition monitoring systems in a manufacturing environment has become easy. In this paper, grinding wheel conditions in a surface grinding process are predicted with a simple decision tree-based machine learning classifier using time-domain acoustic emission signature. A grinding wheel attachment is designed and fabricated for capturing acoustic emission (AE) signal from the grinding wheel. Grinding wheel conditions are established using grinding wheel life cycle plot by monitoring surface roughness produced by the silicon carbide grinding wheel for the entire grinding cycle. AE signals were captured using the experimental set-up established for this study and statistical features are extracted from transients of AE. Classification and regression trees (CART) are used for establishing a correlation between AE features and grinding wheel conditions. The performance of the CART algorithms is evaluated using Gini index, towing and maximum deviation split criterions. Results indicate CART algorithms are efficiently predicting the grinding wheel condition with good accuracy.	[Mouli, D. S.

There are several prognostics prediction methodologies and techniques available to determine the RUL of mechanical components. In this paper, we are applying a combination of analytical and model-based approaches to generate a tool life prediction equation for a two-flute end mill. We performed static and dynamic analysis on a two-flute end mill in ANSYS Workbench with and without crack.

In this research, we propose a novel RUL prediction method that uses a hierarchical Bayesian method to consider the individual difference of RUL, and uses an intermediate variable indicating the defect condition instead of predicting RUL directly from vibration features. The proposed method can perform a monotonous RUL prediction curve and improved prediction accuracy especially for early stage of defect progression.

Currently, condition monitoring has become a challenging process because of various reasons such as fluctuating external conditions, natural hazards. Pipelines are installed in severe conditions and are subjected to degradation mainly due to corrosion and metal loss. This study attempted to classify different types of metal loss faults using historical inspection data of oil and gas fields. For this purpose, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were employed to classify and predict various types of metal loss faults which were affecting the life condition of a crude oil pipeline. The historical inspection data was acquired from a crude oil pipeline located in Sudan. Different types of SVM models were trained and quadratic SVM type was selected for the present study due to its high prediction accuracy. The performance evaluation of the proposed SVM model was done using the confusion matrix. The developed SVM model provides promising results with a prediction accuracy of 93.0%. As a result, the fault detection rate (FDR) for all faults is found to be 90.4%, while the misclassification rate (MR) is 9.6%. The prediction of metal loss fault type may help in condition assessment and maintenance schedule to take prior actions for the better life of pipeline which reduces the degradation rate of a pipeline.

This is essential to detect this type of defect at an early stage because this one can produce damage to the machine. So, we must be able firstly to detect the fault and secondly to quantify its severity. Our study responds to this and necessities a few calculi. We present in this paper a low sample time (1kHz), and we offer theoretical analysis with a model of our DFIM without fault, and a model included this fault. An analysis of the representation on the D-Q basis is done. After, we confirm these results through the exploitation of a platform which comprises a DFIM and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system. The obtained results are rather hopeful.

However, the electric equipment and devices are confirmed prone to component failure and breakdown that may directly lead to the power outage. In this paper, a cost-effective solution based on the convolutional neural network is presented for the analysis of faults of electric rotating machines. To reinforce the robustness under a noisy environment, a linear discriminant criterion based metric learning technique is also employed to improve the loss function during the training process. The developed approach can automatically extract self-learned fault features and conduct fault diagnosis. The developed solution has been carefully evaluated through simulation and experiments to quantify the performance. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution for fault diagnosis.

However, this poses a major challenge for cloud IaaS providers who cannot control the software programs that users develop, install or download on their rented VMs. Those programs may not be well developed with various bugs or even downloaded/installed together with virus, which often make damages to the VMs or infect the cloud platform. To keep the health of a cloud IaaS platform, it is very important to implement the PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) technology for detecting those software problems and self-healing them in an intelligent and timely way. This paper realized a novel PHM technology inspired by biological autonomic nervous system to deal with the memory anomalies of those programs running on the cloud IaaS platform. We first present an innovative autonomic computing technology called Bionic Autonomic Nervous System (BANS) to endow the cloud system with distinctive capabilities of perception, detection, reflection, and learning. Then, we propose a BANS-based Prognostics and Health Management (BPHM) technology to enable the cloud system self-dealing with various memory anomalies. AI-based failure prognostics, immediate self-healing, self-learning ability and self-improvement functions are implemented. Experimental results illustrate that the designed BPHM can automatically and intelligently deal with complex memory anomalies in a real cloud system for IaaS, to keep the system much more reliable and healthier.

An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is synthesized to estimate the state variables in the induction machine in order to calculate the residual signals.

Under such conditions the motor operation can be seriously affected. Performance, control and monitoring are directly connected to the knowledge of the supply harmonics effects on the motor. Therefore there is a real need to derive a general mathematical formula predicting the harmonics growth in one hand, and to describe, through an analytical analysis in steady state operation the impact of unbalanced voltage supply on induction machine in the other hand. In this paper, an original analytical formula of harmonics components is developed to propose an accurate indicator of unbalanced supply voltage fault. The validity of this analytical study is confirmed by a comparison with simulation and experimental results.

Prognostic can be seen as the prediction of the system's remaining useful life with the purpose of minimizing catastrophic failure events. Such task could be performed on the basis of an accurate physical representation of the system behavior and/or by using available historical data that have been collected. In this paper, a novel prognostic approach is proposed, based on data-driven category techniques. This approach uses mainly historical data, regardless of the underlying physical process, and it can be divided into two steps. First, an original signal processing technique is used to develop life prediction models. In the second step, the system's current health state is predicted and the RUL is estimated based on a proposed formula. This approach is validated by using four different data sets generated from the NASA's turbofan engine simulator (C-MAPSS) and the obtained results are compared with relevant existing approaches tested using the same collected data. The main outputs of our study attest that the proposed approach is robust, applicable and effective even in the presence of various fault modes and operating conditions.

One way to mitigate those complaints and to ensure occupants' satisfaction with regards to building performance is through a well-performing facility management that is capable of planning for and addressing maintenance and repair (M&R) services. This paper proposes a data analytics and machine learning framework to predict and analyze occupants' complaint data as part of the facility management's predictive maintenance approach. The framework was tested for a period of one year on a highly unstructured and unsolicited occupants' complaints data recorded by facility management operators in a residential complex. Text mining results showed that air conditioner (AC) complaints are among the most frequent complaints in the dataset under study. Using the built nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) prediction model to forecast such complaints resulted in acceptable validation and test mean square errors of 0.822 and 0.188 respectively. Ongoing works aim at expanding this framework to include a larger data set and to develop a staffing plan used to handle those complaints thus enhancing occupant satisfaction and building performance.

Both in HPC systems and enterprise data centers, combating failures is becoming challenging with increasing hardware and software complexity. Several data mining solutions of logs have been investigated in the context of anomaly detection in such systems. However, with subsequent proactive failure mitigation, the existing log mining solutions are not sufficiently fast for realtime anomaly detection. Machine learning (ML)-based training can produce high accuracy but the inference scheme needs to be enhanced with rapid parsers to assess anomalies in real-time. This work tackles online anomaly prediction in computing systems by exploiting context free grammar-based rapid event analysis. We present our framework Aarohi(1), which describes an effective way to predict failures online. Aarohi is designed to be generic and scalable making it suitable as a real-time predictor. Aarohi obtains more than 3 minutes lead times to node failures with an average of 0.31 msecs prediction time for a chain length of 18. The overall improvement obtained w.r.t. the existing state-of-the-art is over a factor of 27.4x. Our compiler-based approach provides new research directions for lead time optimization with a significant prediction speedup required for the deployment of proactive fault tolerant solutions in practice.

It has many promising applications in the cloud environment, including fault tolerance, security analysis, and failure diagnosis. Existing studies in this area pay more effort in optimizing the record method, such as reducing performance penalty and storage costs. However, considering that many practical applications follow the record once, replay many mode, the optimization for the replay is more critical, especially for efficiency. In this paper, we propose pRnR, a novel parallel RnR framework, to support efficient replay. By combining the native RnR framework with an improved continuous snapshots mechanism, pRnR divides the full execution into many independent and complete slices, each of which supports arbitrary replay. In addition, it supports two replay modes to improve replay efficiency, i.e., multi-slice parallel replay and multi-dimension parallel replay. Moreover, we apply our pRnR framework to syscall-based diagnosis to demonstrate its usability. The experimental results show that pRnR is more efficient than existing RnR frameworks.

In this paper, we used the FLIM system based on time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) to acquire fluorescence lifetime images of skin tissues. In the cases of full sample data, three kinds of sample set partitioning methods, including bootstrapping method, hold-out method and K-fold cross-validation method, were used to divide the samples into calibration set and prediction set, respectively. Then the binary classification models for skin cancer were established based on random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) respectively. The results showed that FLIM combining with appropriate machine learning algorithms can achieve early and advanced canceration classification of skin cancer, which could provide reference for the multi-classification, clinical staging and diagnosis of skin cancer.

The framework consists of sensor monitor cluster, novel anomaly detector and actuator fault testing cluster. The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) are used for denoising and feature extracting when constructing the sensor monitor. The extreme learning machine based autoencoder (ELM_AE) are applied for novel anomaly detection. Further, system approximation using neural networks and actuator fault testing via fuzzy PID control are presented. Contributions are as follow: 1) An algorithm using DWT with slide window is proposed for fatal sensor fault detection, which considers the sequential arrival characteristic of the sensor data; 2) Combining the neural network and fuzzy PID control for actuator fault testing, which solves the problem of fault location from the perspective of control. Experiments on the real autonomous vehicle platform 'Xinda' and related simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in this fault diagnosis framework.

However, there are various factors that make it difficult to apply in reality, even though algorithms for detecting various faults have been studied. The class imbalance problem is considered one of the most serious problems with fault detection. In many areas of classification, the data collected is largely imbalanced. Thus, in order to actually apply data-based system monitoring, there is a need for a method that can effectively solve such class imbalances.

The data-driven methods aim at mining the relationship between monitoring data and fault and realizing automatic and accurate equipment fault diagnosis results. However, current fault diagnosis methods generally depend on prior knowledge and the experienced diagnosticians, unsuitable for a variety of conditions. The deficiencies limit the development of intelligent fault diagnosis technology of rotating machinery. In this research, an adaptive fault diagnosis method of rotating machinery based on firefly algorithm and deep sparse autoencoder (FA-DSAE) is proposed to ensure accurate and stable diagnosis result while greatly reduce the dependence on expert experience and prior knowledge. The method is applied for roll bearing and hob fault diagnosis and have a good performance.

Because, they are used to identify defect prone source code components and assist testing activities during the development life cycle. Prior research used supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning models for software defect prediction. Supervised defect prediction models require labeled data, however it might be time consuming and expensive to obtain labeled data that has the desired quality and volume. The unsupervised defect prediction models usually use clustering techniques to relax the labeled data requirement, however labeling detected clusters as defective is a challenging task. The Pareto principle states that a small number of modules contain most of the defects. Getting inspired from the Pareto principle, this work proposes a novel, unsupervised learning approach that is based on outlier detection. We hypothesize that defect prone software components have different characteristics when compared to others and can be considered as outliers, therefore outlier detection techniques can be used to identify them. The experiment results on 16 software projects from two publicly available datasets (PROMISE and GitHub) indicate that the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) outlier detection method can be used to identify the majority of software defects. It could detect 94% of expected defects at best case and more than 63% of the defects in 75% of the projects. We compare our approach with the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised defect prediction approaches. The results of rigorous empirical evaluations indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing unsupervised models and achieves comparable results with the leading supervised techniques that rely on complex training and tuning algorithms.

Generally, the PCVs are subjected to high failure frequency rate and consequently to the system downtime due to its structural complexity. Therefore, the main propose of this study is to develop an understanding prognostic approach dedicated to WES PCVs. The proposed method investigated the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) failure in PCVs. Therefore, it integrates the data-based methodology. Usually, data-based approaches based on a recorded data base. Therefore, in this paper, we use the collector-emitter voltage as a precursor signal. In this work, the prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the IGBT device is achieved through the Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) technique. Moreover, we used the time-domain analysis to extract useful information used as an input in the health indicator generation task. In this paper, the health indicator generation task is achieved using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. The advantages of the proposed prognostic method in term of RUL prediction are illustrated using a real IGBT accelerated ageing database provided from NASA Ames laboratory Prognostics Center of Excellence.

It is a time-consuming and expensive task if we depend exclusively on chemical analysis, particularly in a semi-arid irrigated zone and with intensive agricultural activities and a very fragmented landscape. It is the Sidi Bennour region, which is situated in Doukkala Irrigated Perimeter in Morocco. Data from satellites could be a good alternative to conventional methods and fill this void with low costs. There has been a great deal of interest in satellite image prediction models, especially with free and abundant availability of satellite data. This work intends to predict SOM using Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The soil samples (369 points) were collected at 0-30 cm of depth and the laboratory analysis was carried out. A multispectral Landsat-8 image was acquired and then calibrated. An image pansharpening processing was applied to produce a PAN image with 15m of resolution from 30m image resolution (MS). The obtained results indicate that the ANN model outperformed the other predictive models for both images (MS and PAN) with R-2 = 0.6553 and R-2 = 0.6985, respectively. The statistical RMSE of predictive models was 0.2153 and 0.2014, and MAE was 0.1682 and 0.1573 for both images, MS and PAN respectively. For this predictive model, the image pansharpening could increase the prediction accuracy of R-2 by 4.32% and reduce the RMSE by 1.39%.

Diabetes mellitus is thought of as one of the vital deadliest and persistent sicknesses which reasons an build up in blood sugar. Many occurrences of death and different health complications happen if diabetes mellitus stays untreated and unidentified. The research study is therefore focused in devising analytical predictive model that can guide decisions of healthcare people more effectively and provide insights into the illness. We have analyzed the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and further improved it by adding additional impacting factors and assessing the attributes. In conclusion, the developed machine learning model for the prediction and detection of diabetes is important as the condition continues to increase in prevalence worldwide while simultaneously increasing its economic burden.

Improving the reliability of hydraulic systems of technological machines	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODERN TRENDS IN MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND EQUIPMENT (ICMTMTE) 2020	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Modern Trends in Manufacturing Technologies and Equipment (ICMTMTE)	SEP 07-11, 2020	Sevastopol, CRIMEA	Sevastopol State Univ, Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Polzunov Altai State Tech Univ, Crimean Fed Univ, Inlink Ltd, Int Union Machine Builders				Modern technological machines have in their design hydraulic systems that are used to control the working body of the machine. Currently, hydraulic systems are complex systems that consist of a large number of subsystems and separately functioning elements. An analysis of the reasons leading to the failure of hydraulic systems shows that their reliability depends on a large number of factors, which are often interconnected. These factors include the external influence of the environment, the properties of materials and working hydraulic fluid, wear processes, the magnitude of the loads, the operating time, as well as regulations for the maintenance of the hydraulic system as a whole and its individual elements. As the statistics of hydraulic systems failure show, about sixty percent of failures are associated with contamination of the working fluid. It is possible to prevent contamination of the hydraulic system at the design stage or by changing the organization of maintenance. It is shown that the number of sensors registering the level of contamination of the hydraulic fluid and their placement on the machine body must be scientifically substantiated. The studies presented in the article allow us to make a conclusion about the possible formation of stagnant zones in remote nodes of the hydraulic system. An important result of this research is that dynamic data collected by the built-in particle detection sensors can give inaccurate information about the condition of the hydraulic fluid. Evaluation of modern methods of technical operation has made it possible to identify a priority condition that will allow the transition from diagnostic to predictive assessment of the state of elements of hydraulic systems of technological machines.

The existing traditional feature analysis methods are only the single-channel vibration signal measured by multi-sensors is processed, and the multi-channel data fusion is not performed at the later stage to achieve the multi-channel synchronization correlation analysis. A multi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition, MEMD)-1.5-dimensional Teager energy spectrum is proposed for the extraction of micro-fault features. Firstly, use the MEMD to adaptively decompose the multi-channel vibration signals on the collected multi-channel fault characteristic signals under the same state to obtain the Intrinsic Mode Functions(IMF) components of each channel, and then calculate the kurtosis value and correlation coefficient of each channel IMF component to select the best IMF component containing the main information of the fault. Finally, the 1.5-dimensional Teager energy spectrum is used to obtain the fault characteristic information of the signal to achieve the extraction of minor fault features. In order to verify the feasibility of the theory, simulation tests are carried out and the method is applied to the early failure of the outer ring of the bearing, and compared with EMD and envelope demodulation, it is verified that this method can effectively deal with early multi-channel failure information of rotating machinery. It has theoretical guidance significance for early diagnosis of small faults of nuclear main pump.

With this method, one-dimensional time domain signal can be transformed into two-dimensional images, which is more suitable for Convolutional Neural Network processing. Meanwhile, the traditional machine learning method has the disadvantage of low robustness and low recognition rate with noise interference. Therefore, based on the feature extraction of Convolution Neural Network, in this paper we proposed an improved LeNet-5 Convolution Neural Network model, that is, adding a convolution layer and a pooling layer to the classic LeNet-5 model. The hidden layer features are extracted by using the trainable convolution kernel, while the extracted implicit features are reduced by the pooling layer, the Softmax classifier is used for classification and recognition of rolling bearing faults. In this paper we verified the effectiveness of the improved LeNet-5 model for fault diagnosis of rolling bearing by using the rolling bearing data to train the classic LeNet-5 model and the improved model.

Researchers keep pursuing more convenient and practical methods for fault diagnosis. As data collection becoming more convenient, data-driven methods develops rapidly for their excellent performance, especially the deep learning methods have been a popularity way to fault diagnosis. This paper tries to use two data-driven methods (ResNet-50 and SE-ResNet-50) on fault diagnosis without transfer learning. More uniquely, training data and testing data are collected under different conditions. SE-ResNet-50 achieves the highest accuracy 99.1%, which is better than ResNet-50 obviously. This experiment shows that SE-ResNet-50 achieves good performance without large training samples in fault diagnosis.

To predict precisely the RUL, a three-stage strategy is proposed. Firstly, twenty-four basic characteristics are extracted from vibration signal, which are reconstructed by combining those basic characteristics with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (BC-CEEMDAN), and then the trend curves are extracted to reduce the fluctuation. Next, the most sensitive features are selected by employing a linear combination of monotonicity and correlation criteria. Finally, by input the selected features into the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network, we achieve the efficient health indicator with BC-CEEMDAN-GRU. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, experiment on PRONOSTIA bearing datasets is carried out, and the advantage is emphasized by comparison with the six existing methods.

Firstly, by using the meta-heuristic Cuckoo Search (CS) technique, the optimal solutions which c and g of the target kernel function are extracted. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) uses the radial basis kernel function of RBF and the obtained optimization parameters c and g to map the data to a high-dimensional space to make it as linearly separable as possible. Finally, a model is established to classify and judge each category.

Considering the traditional compound fault diagnosis methods usually utilize the manual fault features extraction, which are mainly dependent on engineering experience, we propose a compound fault diagnosis method named multi-sensor based convolutional neural network (MCNN). For vibration signals of compound faults, the different transmission paths and the positions of the sensors means one part of the embedded single faults may have higher energy. The vibration signals collected from three sensors at different positions can help guarantee the completeness of the characteristics of the compound fault. Then, the multi-sensor signals are combined together and fused by the convolutional operation of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The CNN model, which can automatically extract features from the vibration signals and achieve classification, is used for fault extraction and fault recognition. The experiments are presented on the physical platform of power transmission, and the proposed fault diagnosis method can be verified with the satisfied performance.

AdaBoost algorithm is an effective fault detection method. It can generate a large number of weak classifiers in iterations and combine many of these weak classifiers into the strong classifier to solve the classification problem for fault detection. For the traditional AdaBoost, several of these poor weak classifiers are often ignored and not fully used. However, the weak classifiers with poor performance may store the significant information and pay more attention to the difficult samples. To solve these problems, we propose a local selective ensemble-based AdaBoost (AdaBoost-LSE) in this article. Firstly, error feedback ELM (EFELM) is introduced to establish the basic weak classifier. Through the iteration of AdaBoost, these weak classifiers based on EFELM are generated. Secondly, these weak classifiers are divided into good weak classifiers and bad weak classifiers based on the classification accuracy. The poor weak classifiers with good performance are selected by calculating the classification accuracy for the targeted samples. Thirdly, the strong classifier of AdaBoost-LSE is constructed by integrating the original good weak classifiers and some of these poor weak classifiers with good performance. To verify the efficiency of AdaBoost-LSE, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) simulation process is used. The experimental results reveal that the proposed AdaBoost-LSE can greatly improve the accuracy of fault detection.

Comparison of harmonic removal techniques for computing envelope spectra from rolling element bearing vibrations	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			DIAGNOSTICS	Fault detection and diagnostics of rolling element bearings are important and relatively mature techniques used in current vibration-based condition monitoring. Despite this, since for many machines the bearing is often one of the most critical parts, improving the techniques are still interesting. The squared envelope spectrum is one of the most important tools for diagnosing roller element bearings. For a precise and correct estimation of the squared envelope spectrum, it is often important to remove harmonics not related to the bearing, as part of the signal processing prior to computing the envelope spectrum. In real-life measurements, harmonics can be caused by many kinds of sources, motors, gear boxes, and pumps are some examples of that. In the present paper, a recently proposed method for automated harmonic removal based on frequency editing is examined. The results from this method are compared with the established method for harmonic removal, the automated cepstral editing procedure. Differences between the methods and what effects they have on the computed squared envelope spectra are examined.

Towards prognostics for gearboxes operating under time-varying operating conditions: a frequency band identification approach	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			REMAINING-USEFUL-LIFE; DIAGNOSTICS; METHODOLOGY; BEARINGS; DESIGN	Reliable prognosis algorithms are important to ensure that the correct maintenance decisions are made. Reliable condition indicators can be used to infer the condition of the component and used as an integral step of prognosis. It is therefore important to have condition indicators that are sensitive to changes in the different components of the machine, while being robust to time-varying operating conditions. In this work, we investigate the suitability of different frequency band identification methods and different condition indicators for rotating machines operating under time-varying operating conditions. Two experimental datasets are considered with damaged gears. The results indicate that using both the IFBI(alpha)gram and an indicator-of-cyclostationarity have much potential for prognosis under time-varying operating conditions.	[Schmidt, S.; Heyns, P.

Multiband modulation energy tracking for bearing fault diagnosis	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			FREQUENCY	The failure of rolling element bearings may result to unexpected machine breakdown. In classical method, fault detection is performed using envelope analysis in a single frequency band for which Signal to Noise Ratio is high. The selection of the filtering band is based on engineering expertise or on the criterion such as the Spectral Kurtosis. In this paper the concept of the Multiband Demodulation Analysis, based on the application of a bank of bandpass Gabor filters and the application of the Energy Separation Algorithm, is presented. The demodulation takes place in multiple frequency bands, following a multiband analysis scheme, to isolate the strongest modulation components in each band. Finally, a maximum average energy tracking process over the various bands is used to yield short-time measurements of multiband signal modulation energy and demodulated instant amplitude and frequency. The method is applied on different signals and compared with classical approaches.

Prognostics of rotating machinery based on the multi-steps estimation approach	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			PREDICTION; BEARING	Various types of machineries are used into different industry areas, such as, automotive, wind farms and production lines. In order to avoid an abrupt breakdown and reduce the economic cost, prognostics offers a competitive advantage in the framework of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). The estimated Remaining Useful Life (RUL) indicates the remaining lifetime from now on, which is able to facilitate the optimization of the maintenance strategy. Among the state of art approaches, statistical model based prognostics methodologies have been proposed in different applications due to the high transparency of results and the low computation cost, based on Kalman filters, Particle filters and Hidden Markov Models. Recently in addition to the aforementioned single step estimation techniques multi-steps based estimation techniques have been proposed, exploiting the previous several measurements within a short time horizon. In this paper a multi steps based methodology is used in order to estimate the RUL of rolling element bearings, as it could better represent the bearings' stochastic degradation process. The methodology is applied and evaluated on an experimental dataset.

Fleet-based health monitoring for end-of-production-line and operational testing	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn				Applications of machine learning for end-of-production-line and operational health monitoring avoid time-consuming manual data analysis and design of handcrafted features. However, many of these approaches require a large historical data set and analyze only a single unit which is a machine or a component. In practice, this data set can be difficult and expensive to collect. However, some industrial applications involve a fleet of similar operating units. It is often safe to assume that the condition of the majority of the units in a fleet is healthy. In this work, we demonstrate a fleet-based, unsupervised, and generic anomaly detection framework that detects unit faults by identifying deviating behavior. It allows incorporating domain expertise by user-defined comparison measures. Moreover, contrary to most black-box artificial intelligence techniques, easy interpretability allows a domain expert to validate the predictions made by the framework. Finally, we demonstrate its applicability in both end-of-production-line and operational testing.	[Hendrickx, K.; Da Cruz Patricio, J.

Low speed lifting cable fault detection using instantaneous angular speed	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn				Rotating machinery faces various problems throughout their lifetime and steel cables defects are one of the most common one. Steel cables are complex flexible structures used in many elevating systems such as cranes or lifts. There are various control techniques ensuring cables safety based on acoustics or electromagnetic. However, these methods are either quite expensive or unable to work with low speeds (< 60 rpm). This paper thus proposes an alternative monitoring method already tested by our laboratory on rotating mechanical components. A complete detection procedure based on IAS measurements was successfully tested in our laboratory test rig for no fault and surface fault conditions. These tests were performed under different conditions of speed and loading and the results are very satisfying. Indeed, the fault signature is clearly visible for low speeds (down to 10 rpm) and high loading (from 150 daN) which is the first step for a cheap diagnosis of low speed moving cable.

Robust Bayesian approach of instantaneous speed estimation in non-stationary operating conditions	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; GENERALIZED DEMODULATION; HILBERT TRANSFORM; PLANETARY GEARBOX; ENERGY OPERATOR; FREQUENCY; SIGNAL; ORDER; DECOMPOSITION	In the field of condition monitoring of rotating machines, the information provided by the instantaneous speed (IS) of rotation is crucial to fault monitoring. This information can be measured with a transducer like an angular encoder or estimated from other physical signals such as vibration or acoustic signals - the so called tacholess method. Regarding the latter, several attempts have been carried out to obtain the best estimator of the actual IS. They differ from each other regarding the domain where the estimation method is applied, whether time or time-frequency domain. Besides, they depend as well on the complexity of the signal model, whether it is mono-component or multi-component, and in the latter case whether components overlap or not. The aim of this paper is to propose a tacholess method robust to noise assumptions. It is based on a Bayesian approach and considers short time frames of the signal to better handle non-stationarity. In order to verify its efficiency, it is applied to synthetic and experimental signals.

Virtual training of machine learning algorithm using a multibody model for bearing diagnostics on independent cart system	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn			ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FAULT DIAGNOSTICS	Independent cart conveyor system is a new technology recently proposed in the field of automatic machines. This technology uses advance linear motors for moving several carts on a close-loop path. In this paper, a multibody model of the Independent cart conveyor system is used to train a machine learning algorithm for the diagnostics of ball bearings which support the carts. The multibody model provides several simulations both of healthy and faulted bearings, which are used to create the training dataset. The input features of the machine learning algorithm are statistical parameters that proved to be effective in the analysis of real vibration data. The final tests were carried out on experimental data recorded on a test rig and the fault detection algorithm was validated both in faulted and healthy cases in an industrial environment. The aim of this activity is to virtualize the training of a machine learning system for fault detection and to test its accuracy in a real environment.	[Molano, J.

Farm-wide dynamic event classification as load input for wind turbine drivetrain lifetime prognosis	PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NOISE AND VIBRATION ENGINEERING (ISMA2020) / INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS (USD2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering (ISMA) / International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics (USD)	SEP 07-09, 2020	Leuven, BELGIUM	KU Leuven, Dept Mech Engn				One of the advantages of the current industrial digitalization trend, the so-called Industry 4.0, is that machines are becoming increasingly sensorized and connected to the internet. This is similar in the wind industry. Detailed measurements from hundreds of sensors embedded in the wind turbine are being sent continuously to cloud computing data-centers. Condition monitoring techniques can leverage these huge volumes of available data to increase detection potential and insights in system behavior by long-term trending. In addition to condition monitoring, these embedded sensors offer information for failure prognosis and lifetime insights. In this paper, a framework to automatically obtain the load history of different turbines within a farm is presented using high frequency SCADA. Special attention is paid to the effects of wake. The fact that data of similar machines of a fleet is collected in a central cloud environment allows for exploiting system similarity in a monitoring and root cause analysis context.

Taking the developed digital signal processing technologies into consideration, a novel fault diagnosis method for subway plug doors based on Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) optimized by Cuckoo Search (CS) is proposed. First, fault features are extracted from the original data, and then the dimension of features is reduced by KPCA. Later, CS-LSSVM is used as the classification model for subway plug door faults. Experimental results indicate that the diagnosis model can quickly and accurately identify different fault status. In addition, CS provides faster convergence speed than Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and CS-LSSVM has higher accuracy in fault diagnosis than BP Neural Network and traditional Support Vector Machine.

The energy efficiency of district heating systems is of great interest to energy stakeholders. However, it is not uncommon that district heating systems fail to achieve the expected performance due to various faults. Identification of such rare observations that are different significantly from the majority of the meter readings data plays a vital role in system diagnose. In this study, a new hybrid approach is proposed for anomaly detection of a district heating substation, which consists of a simplified physical model and a Long Short Term Memory based Variational Autoencoder (LSTM VAE). A dataset of an anonymous substation in Sweden is used as a case study. The performance of two state of art models, LSTM and long short term memory based autoencoder (LSTM AE) are evaluated and compared with the LSTM VAE. Experimental results show that LSTM VAE outperforms the baseline models in terms of Area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and F1 score when an optimal threshold is applied.

Second, ML models are often learned offline and unable to capture the machine dynamism and adapt to changes over the time. In this paper, we propose a framework based on the concept of cognitive analytics with unsupervised learning for machine health monitoring, anomaly detection and predictive maintenance. The experimental results on an industrial robot demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework in the identified use case.

Once an explosion occurs, people's lives and property will be damaged seriously. In order to strengthen the safety of lithium batteries, it is necessary to fluster the maintenance of lithium batteries technology. Accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium batteries is beneficial to the maintenance of the battery, so that its safety can be improved. The traditional unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) method has been used in MI, prediction of lithium batteries, but there are still some problems such as low prediction accuracy because of the system's high non-linearity. In this paper, an improved unscented Kalman filtering method for predicting the RUL of lithium batteries is used. The formula for calculating the weights by particle filter (PF) is used to change the weights in the UKF, and then in order to get the state and covariance at the next moment, the changed weights are additionally used in the measurement mechanism. The new method is verified more accurately by the open source battery capacity decay data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering.

Predictive maintenance models aim to provide greater insight into future component and system behaviour. In the state of the art, a variety of statistical models and machine learning techniques, amongst others, are used to estimate component remaining useful life. These approaches commonly leverage technical information, such as sensor data. However, the use of data and techniques from other domains is not prevalent. One such example is the application of natural language processing to incorporate textual information, e.g. derived from pilot complaint data. In other words, does the presence and specific content of pilot complaints have potential to improve the predictability of component removals? In this research, data integration and processing from multiple disciplines are combined to address this question. Relevant words from pilot complaints are identified using a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) numerical analysis, after which the most relevant words are used as covariates in a proportional hazards model. Left truncation and right censoring is applied to limit the time-invariant nature of these covariates.

In this paper, a fault diagnosis method is proposed based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and variational modal decomposition (VMD). Firstly, wavelet packet threshold is denoised on the signal, VMD is decomposed on the reconstructed signal, and PSO is optimized on the inherent mode function (IMF) obtained from decomposition so as to determine the best IMF function. Then Hilbert transform and envelope spectrum analysis are carried out on the IMF function, and the envelope spectrum analysis result is compared with theoretical calculation frequency to finally determine the fault type. The results indicate that this method can effectively reduce noise components in signals, extract weak fault information and realize fault diagnosis.

The proposed method is based on the mixed logical dynamic (MLD) model of the PMSM drive system to simulate three-phase currents under different faulty conditions, and the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) are used to measure the similarity between the simulated fault types and the actual one, then the fault detection and isolation can be achieved according to the characteristics of PCCs under different faulty conditions. The proposed method only needs to use the current sensors existing in the closed-loop system to measure the currents for fault diagnosis, and can detect the fault within one current fundamental wave period. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The feasibility of real-time fault prediction has been shown in real flight conditions experiencing noisy measurements, communication limitations, and wrapped wing structure that breaks the geometric symmetry. A total of eleven flight logs have been recorded and shared publicly for future potential use by other researchers on fault and anomaly detection. Our proposed method uses a data driven algorithm, SVM, in order to classify the behavior of the vehicle in nominal flight phase and faulty phase. Feasibility of a basic binary classification is shown, despite the well-known over-fitting problem caused by limited data. We have shown that geometrical imperfections that are common in small UAVs can cause particular effects on the prediction performance, and we used it in our advantage to improve the detection on multi-class classification. The SVM algorithm with proposed feature trajectories was capable to detect variation of loss of control effectiveness faults up to an accuracy of 95% in real flights.

The existence of faults during the manufacturing processes is strongly correlated with the performance of the manufacturing processes and in this article the main challenge that is approached is the accurate classification of the cases in which the manufacturing processes pass or fail the in line testing considering the information collected during the execution of the operations that are involved in the manufacturing processes. This article approaches the classification of the in line testing of the manufacturing processes using a method that is based on an ensemble of deep learning models in which the weights of the models are determined using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The method is tested and validated on the open source SECOM dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Rapid technological progress has opened new business potentials and opportunities forcing companies to constantly introduce more and more advanced solutions to remain competitive. However, the potential of such technologies to support the implementation of Lean Manufacturing is not completely perceived yet. After defining Lean 4.0 which aims to provide useful insight for the integration of lean and Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing companies, AI is then briefly introduced, as a key enabler. This paper focuses on the integration and support of AI to Lean 4.0, mainly investigating the process and control issues through better use of data and knowledge.

In this work, ANNs were used to predict the diagnosis for breast cancer in a women population with overweight or obese and possible diabetes, coupled with a pre or postmenopausal stage and compared against other machine learning techniques reported in literature. The algorithms used to train the ANNs models were Scaled Conjugate Gradient, Resilient Backpropagation and Conjugate Gradient Backpropagation with Powell Beale Restarts. The algorithms results were compared with the original dataset creator's work, as well as other authors using the same dataset for classification task, a better classification was accomplished using this work ANNs. With four predictors the next values were obtained, AUC = 0.96, sensitivity = 0.96, specificity = 0.96 and Youden index = 0.92. With nine predictors the next values were obtained, AUC = 0.96, sensitivity = 0.95, specificity = 0.97 and Youden index = 0.92. Different strategies are suggested to improve the results, exploring more hidden layers and a different validation method.

Unsupervised learning techniques are responsible for detecting patterns linking together medical parameters which result in a common outcome, and our paper details three such approaches: clustering (GMM, hierarchical), outlier detection (KDE, KNN density, KNN-ARD) and association mining. At the same time, supervised learning classifiers will help in understanding the prediction possibilities of such a medical condition, and this has been done by applying and statistically evaluating the performance of logistic regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) against a predictive baseline model. The results of our analysis show that predicting coronary heart disease is a well-suited task for machine learning detection, with small error ranges being achieved even from low-dimension datasets of only a dozen features, provided that the features are relevant and the patient data is well-recorded.

The detection criterion is based on a combination of multiscale analysis technique with Renyi entropy on each scale, followed by a cumulative sum evaluation to estimate the point of change. Two case studies are considered. One considers a synthetized mixed signal, by mixing a deterministic signal with one having random components. The other one uses real vibration signals generated by some faults in the bearings of rotating machines. The method generates different values of the entropy for different structures of the time series and allows change detection of the incipient faults in bearings, i.e. small amplitude of the vibration signals, and changes in the structure and complexity of these signals. From fault detection point of view, the results are at the same level of qualitative performance with other approaches based on multiscale analysis and other type of entropies, e.g. Multi Scale Entropy (MSE). From change detection in the structure of the signals, the proposed method is superior, being more sensitive to random components and smoother. The proposed method could be adapted to other categories of difficult signals or processes, as those from medical area.

Several existing techniques such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and the Vold-Kalman filter (VKF) can be used for time-frequency analysis under both stationary and non-stationary operating conditions. However, the problems of frequency components overlapping and interference from other frequencies are still not solved well.

The health of motors plays key role in ensuring the safety of these fields, however, the online health monitoring of motors is not well studied. On the other hand, the combination of health science and artificial intelligence technology is playing an increasingly important role in replacing the traditional health monitoring of machines and has been proved its ability in serial data processing and other aspects. In this paper, a bi-directional cyclic neural network based algorithm is proposed for the intelligent remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of motors. Compared with the traditional one-way neural network, bi-directional cyclic neural network can predict the current state based on the past and future information at the same time, which obtains higher accuracy. This paper is organized in two stages: first, a health index is developed to fit the life cycle data of motors; Secondly, a bi-directional cyclic neural network based model is trained based on the health index for the online RUL prediction of motors. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Therefore, the effective fault diagnosis of rotating machinery has become a widely concerned topic. Numerous publications about fault diagnosis methods of rotating machinery have been proposed to technical reports, conference proceedings and academic journals. This paper attempts to review fault diagnosis approaches for rotating machinery. First, these methods of fault diagnosis could be divided into four categories, i.e., statistical analysis-based approach, signal processing-based approach, information fusion-based approach, and pattern recognition-based approach. Then, the basic idea of these ways and their disadvantage are briefly described. Finally, this article summarizes the trends developed in the future of fault diagnosis techniques and gives some new research direction. It is expected that this summary can offer a valuable references for boffins and provide the necessary foundation for the subsequent study of the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery.

As a generator it is particularly attractive to be used in offshore wind turbines where reliability improvement and maintenance cost reduction are the key factors in market growth. As a motor it may be utilized for adjustable speed drives. In this study, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) technique using a wavelet-based adoptive filter has been proposed for the BDFM fault detection as a generator operating in a wind turbine. Three different generator-typed faults namely rotor torque perturbation, rotor broken bar and grid overvoltage faults have been considered to assess the practicality of the proposed technique. The study has been performed on a D400 250kW BDFM.

Machine current signature analysis has been widely investigated in conventional machinery as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for shaft misalignment, via spectrum analysis of the stator current signal. This paper reports a practical case study of misalignment fault signature manifestation in the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) controller signals spectra, with a view to assessing the feasibility of low cost and non-invasive controller signal analysis based misalignment diagnosis. The study employs a laboratory test rig to undertake a series of tests to analyze the sensitivity of controller signals to a specific angular misalignment condition, and hence evaluate and characterize the manifestation of its spectral signatures.

In this regard, Synchronous Generators (SG) are capital components in Power Generation plants and their eventual outages may have very negative repercussions. Despite these machines are extremely monitored, one of the most important problems still faced by SG relies on the proper determination of the insulation condition. Although there are several methods that are commonly used for diagnosing the health of such element, some critical aspects remain unsolved. This paper reviews the different methods and techniques that are nowadays employed in the field to determine the condition of the insulation system in SG. This review comes together with several practical measurements and real cases referred to Medium Voltage SG operating in real plants. The paper provides a critical insight on the state of art in the field, remarking the open research lines related to this important part of the machine.	[Verginadis, D.; Karlis, A.; Danikas, M.

Thus, the influence of static and dynamic eccentricities on the harmonics of the frequency spectra of the unbalanced magnetic pull is analyzed. In this study, dimensional tolerances of the rotor and the stator are also considered. All parts have dimensional tolerances in their designs and their real magnitudes vary to some extent from the theoretical values after the manufacturing process. Thanks to the finite element simulations, verified with experimental results, it is observed that the deviations originated by the manufacturing tolerances produce changes in the amplitudes of some harmonics and also additional and characteristic harmonics in the frequency spectra of the unbalanced magnetic pull. These are not negligible and must be taken into account when robust eccentricity detection procedures are defined. Otherwise, harmonics originated by tolerances and by eccentricities can be misidentified.

Investigation of the combined eccentricity and demagnetization fault in an AFPMSG	2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	24th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	AUG 23-26, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Axial Flux; Combined Faults; Eccentricity; Fault Diagnosis; Generator; Partial demagnetization; Permanent Magnet; Synchronous Machine	PERMANENT-MAGNET MACHINES	This paper investigates the partial demagnetization fault and the combined partial demagnetization and eccentricity fault in an Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (AFPMSG) that can be used for wind power applications. The study has been done using 3D-FEM due to machine 3D inherent nature. The machine has one stator and two rotors, while the single-sided machine is studied also for comparison purposes. The EMF spectrum is used as fault identification mean. Two different cases of combined faults are studied. In the first case the combined static angular eccentricity and partial demagnetization fault is studied, while in the second case the combined static axis eccentricity and partial demagnetization fault is investigated. Both combined faults are critical in AFPMSGs and for that reason should be early diagnosed in order to prevent further failures in the machine.	[Barmpatza, A. C.; Kappatou, J.

First, a number of time-domain and frequency-domain features are extracted from vibration and current signals in different operating conditions of IM. Then, these features are combined and considered as the input of SVM-based classification model. To avoid overfitting, RF is utilized to determine the most dominant features contributing to accurate classification. It is proved that the proposed method is capable of achieving highly accurate fault diagnosis results for broken rotor bar and eccentricity faults and it can appropriately handle the high dimensionality of the combined data.

In this type of generator which comprises one exciter as exciter and the main machine, rotating parts such as rectifier bridge, exciter armature, and their connections are more likely to defect. Therefore, considering the relevant literature, the exciter armature open-circuit fault is taken into account for the investigation. Consequently, the brushless generator model is developed for two states, including healthy and exciter armature open-phase fault under no-load condition. Then, an analytical approach is proposed for the terminal voltage harmonic analysis which is utilized for the two states. Thus, the harmonic spectrum can be achieved for these states. These harmonic components are compared for healthy and faulty states, and the major distinctive components are determined. Hence, the occurred exciter fault can be detected using these components. In order to evaluate the model and its efficiency, finite element analysis, and experimental results are utilized.

Improved Quadratic Time-frequency Distributions for Detecting Inter-turn Short Circuits of PMSMs in Transient States	2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	AUG 23-26, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Condition monitoring; permanent magnet synchronous motors; quadratic time-frequency distribution; short-circuit fault; transient state	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	This paper aims to improve quadratic time-frequency distributions to adapt condition monitoring of electrical machines in transient states. Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT) has been a baseline signal processing technique for detecting fault characteristic frequencies. However, limits of window sizes due to loss of frequency- or time-resolution, make it hard to capture rapid changes in frequencies. Within this study, Choi-Williams and Wigner-Ville distributions are proposed to effectively detect peaks at characteristic frequencies while still maintaining low computation time. The improved quadratic time-frequency distributions allow for generating spectrograms of a longer lasting data signal and capturing multi-component signals with a better separation of the components than STFT. Further, the time resolution of the spectrograms generated by the proposed method is not affected by the window size. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is numerically verified from the data of an in-house test setup.

These machines are typically employed in high power applications and their possible outages may imply huge costs for the industries or plants where they operate. The damper cage is a critical part of these machines and a potential source of catastrophic failures. However, few research works have provided feasible alternatives to monitor the condition of such element. This work analyses the viability of analyzing the electromotive force signals induced by the stray-flux in external coil sensors as well as current signals under starting to diagnose damper faults. The results obtained both with laboratory machines show that the analyses of those signals can provide very useful information for determining how the damper degrades over time. These results are valuable for field engineers since, nowadays, there are few available solutions that allow monitoring the condition of such element without motor disassembly.

The fault diagnostics under a steady stage regime has been a topic of interest since the past few decades. The main aim has been focused on the detection of fault-based frequencies which are the function of slip. Those frequencies become very less legible under low load conditions and totally disappear under no-load conditions. Moreover, the stator and rotor slot skews have a potential attenuation impact on them. To avoid these problems, the time-frequency analysis of motor startup current is investigated in this paper using a wavelet approach. To improve the legibility of the spectrum, the transient time is extended by reducing the supply voltage of the machine under no external load. By reducing the supply voltage, the inertia of the rotor acts as a load to increase the transient time which is essential for better resolution. The results are based on the practical measurements taken from the laboratory setup under healthy and faulty conditions.

The static eccentricity (SE) fault is one of the prevalent types of failure in the wound rotor synchronous generator that leads to the outage of the power unit. Many different solutions have been proposed for SE fault detection. The techniques are normally based on an offline approach which is not an industry favorite. In this paper, a novel statistical approach is applied to the air gap magnetic field that can detect the fault in its early stage. Furthermore, the severity of the failure on the proposed index in different loading conditions is studied. A polar diagram of the air gap magnetic field is used to detect the location of SE. Finally, the ability of the statistical indices to detect the SE fault in under load variation are verified by experimental results.

Analytical Method to Diagnose Large Salient Poles Through Frequency Response Analysis	2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	AUG 23-26, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Frequency Response Analysis (FRA); Impedance measurement; Fault diagnosis; Fault detection; Rotating machines; Generators; Alternators; Field analysis	WINDING DEFORMATION; FRA	This paper aims to present a mathematical approach to diagnosis large salient poles through Frequency Response Analysis (FRA). FRA is a tool which provides an accurate state of the machine throughout a Bode diagram. Interpreting FRA test is not a simple task. However, this type of test shows how a system changes from the healthy conditions. The FRA test response in healthy conditions is a unique solution and it is considered as reference test. This paper presents a method to assess the FRA tests based on an equivalent RLC circuit. The parameters of the equivalent circuit indicate if the machine is in healthy or faulty state. The proposed method has been testing in a pole of a 40 MVA synchronous generator.	[Mugarra, A.; Platero, C.

Pattern Recognition of Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault in Wound Field Synchronous Generator via Stray Flux Monitoring	2020 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	AUG 23-26, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Ind Elect Soc		Condition monitoring; fault detection; feature extraction; finite element modeling; pattern recognition; synchronous enerator; stray magnetic field; spectrum analysis		This paper provides a novel approach to discriminate the Inter-Turn Short Circuit fault (ITSC) in salient pole synchronous generator based on the use of non-invasive sensors. A stray magnetic field is used as a non-invasive signal that could provide valuable data regarding the condition of the synchronous machine. The captured signal under different severity of the ITSC fault is examined by using a classical signal processing tool based on Fast Fourier Transform. A unique feature based on extracted sub harmonics from the stray magnetic field is used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the signal to fault severity increment. It has been shown that the nominated feature do not have any sensitivity to the load variation. The theoretical hypothesis which is supported by using finite element method analysis is tested and verified by experimental results.

Methods to Determine the Stator Inter-turn Short Circuit in an Induction Motor with Installed Rotor	2020 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION (ECCE)	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	12th Annual IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (IEEE ECCE)	OCT 10-15, 2020	Detroit, MI	IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, MathWorks, ROHM Semiconductor		diagnosis; induction motor; turn-to-turn insulation failure; stator winding	INSULATION; VOLTAGE; MACHINES	Most of the insulation failure on induction motor stator windings occurs because of a short circuit between turns (turn-to-turn), which leads to total breakdown. Surge test on stator windings is one of the most common tests to detect symptoms of the fault. Usually, a surge test is applied to a stator winding without the rotor. This paper proposes an evaluation method for surge tests with the condition that the rotor remains attached. Two parameters are defined to identify the fault's existence inside the rotor winding; those are Error Area Ratio (EAR) and Zero Crossing Point (ZCP). The rotors are rotated gradually, and the surge test is applied. EAR and ZCP values are calculated for each rotor position. Following that, all EAR and ZCP values of all rotor positions are added to become Sigma EAR and Sigma ZCP. These two parameters are used to detect any damage to the windings. The result shows that by using these two parameters, the short circuit on the stator can be identified very sensitively, including as small as a half-percent (0.5%) short circuit of the total winding.

MOSFETs is still a major concern, particularly in applications where the devices are exposed to harsh thermal and electrical cycles. This paper discusses a methodology to monitor health status of SiC MOSFETs to enable aging prognostics and remaining useful life estimation. The methodology is based on measurements of ohmic resistance between source and drain terminals. In order to desensitize the method from the well-known temperature dependency of the Rd,,,.; it is proposed to measure the resistance of the MOSFET's body -diode. It will be shown that body -diode presents a much lower dependency to changes in temperature. The measurements can be obtained in real-time, without interrupting the converter normal operation, a highly appreciated feature in next generation of power electronics converters. By proper management of failure precursor data, it will be possible to forecast converter failures so that necessary actions can be taken before a catastrophic failure occurs. The methodology is applicable for SiC MOSFETs of any voltage class from 650 V to 15 kV.

Variation in temperature, load, field weakening, and mechanical stresses are the main reasons that can permanently demagnetize the PMs during steady-state operation. In this paper, a prognostic approach for the prediction of the IDF is presented. A machine learning method is used to monitor the variation in the operating point of the machine and predict the remaining margin of temperature that a machine can endure before the occurrence of IDF. The operating point of the machine is achieved by monitoring the average magnetic flux density at the edges (weak points) of PMs for the instantaneous operating point and estimate the remaining temperature margin that can initiate the IDF in real-time. The temperature margin information obtained using the proposed method helps the user to adjust the operation of the machine before the IDF occurs.

A method to overcome these disadvantages should be needed in wide and various applications, especially for brushless DC (BLDC) motors. A novel IDF detection technique for a permanent magnet (PM) type BLDC motor is proposed. The main idea of this technique is to utilize three features of the voltage drop/back-EMF at the non-excited phase of a BLDC motor operated by 120-degree conduction control with pulse width modulation. Since the IDF precisely reduces the backEMF of the machine, the suggested method is easy to implement and subject to detecting IDF by using back-EMF of the machine. The proposed technique is also appropriate for sensorless BLDC motor drive system without additional hardware. The suggested algorithm for IDF detection is verified based on simulation and experiment with a 400-watt BLDC motor.

Detection of bearing generalized roughness is realized in this paper via external flux-based monitoring. To increase the fault signature signal to noise ratio (SNR), the Wiener filter-based noise cancellation technique previously proved valid for current-based monitoring is refined and applied. A process is added to optimize the timing of prediction for lower randomness of prediction error. A series of experiments are conducted on a 7.5-horsepower induction motor with incipient bearing fault generated via the electrolytic corrosion method. Both axial and radial flux are tested with the noise cancellation technique and compared with stator current and vibration signals. The experimental results show that it is possible to detect the incipient bearing fault with noise-cancelled stray flux signal.

With the introduction of specific HF current regulator, HF current can be injected into two phases of the stator windings. And the corresponding HF component of the line control voltage between the two phases is extracted to determine whether there is an inter-turn short-circuit fault. After monitoring different winding pairs alternately, inter-turn short fault can be detected and the faulty phase can be located. The proposed method has high sensitivity to the inter-turn short fault and is able to eliminate the effect of working conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulations.

However, the increased switching frequency and much faster switching transients (high dv/ dt) of Silicon Carbide (SiC) compared to their IGBT counterparts, can result in increased stress in electrical machines. To quantify these detrimental effects on machine insulation lifetime, a series of tests are conducted on electrical stators representative of typical low voltage machines used in traction and industrial applications. A Design of Experiment (DoE) methodology is employed to identify the test sequence using three stressors. In particular, three values of DC link voltage level, rise time or slew rate of the voltage waveform, and switching frequency, respectively are considered. The paper describes the planned tests and conditions, the insulation health monitoring method employed, and preliminary results.

It is not only difficult to identify the fault, but the diagnosis and decision-making time are crucial since the severity of this fault increases very fast, leading to a catastrophic breakdown. The monitoring of the symmetrical current components is a method that has received a lot of attention among other popular methods. However, it has been lately shown that classical methods may be insensitive to early faults leading to false positive diagnostic conclusions. The symmetrical components of the current has been one of the most trustworthy method. However, it is shown in the paper that even this method may lead to a false conclusion. The authors suggest for the first time, the symmetrical components of the stray flux as a reliable method to detect early inter-turn faults in induction motors. The work is supported by finite element analysis and experimental testing.

The battery pack uses many cells, and a degradation of each cell leads to cell-to-cell imbalance and accelerates degradation of the battery pack's performance. It is necessary to reflect the degradation of cell and battery pack. In this paper, a technique for diagnosing battery packs is proposed to reflect both the degradation effects of cells and battery packs. To reflect the effect of degradation, a health indicator is needed to determine the degradation effects of unit cells and the battery pack. In this paper, a cycle life test is performed to analyze the degradation effects using 24S1P battery pack, and health indicators are defined.

For this propose, two methods are evaluated. Firstly, a reduced-range incremental capacity analysis (ICA) applied during the last phase of the charging period (above 60-100% approximated) is analyzed, and also, an implementation strategy is proposed. This method has been successfully tested using data gathered during the degradation process of six LFP battery cells of 180 Ah and 100 Ah. However, it requires the energy storage system to be operated up to full charge. For overcoming that limitation, a second method based on adaptive filtering techniques to estimate the impedance evolution at different operating points is also studied. The proposed impedance-based method is analyzed using the data gathered from a cycling test.

The proposed method detects the ISC fault using a current observer capable of detecting a specific disturbance related to the ISC. Once the ISC is detected, the possibility of compensating for an ISC is evaluated. With a 2-level VSI, the options for fault compensation are somewhat limited; however, a significant reduction in the fault current can be achieved by adequately injecting d-axis current to cancel out the magnetic flux from the permanent magnet. In this paper, proof of concept of ISC detection and failure path current reduction with d-axis current injection is shown through experimental measurements. Then, the feasibility of post-fault operation is analyzed using an ISC model validated through FEA.

In these methods, the online common-mode impedance spectrum method can monitor the condition of the ground-to-wall insulation accurately based on switching harmonics and no additional signal injection equipment is needed. In this paper, the effect of the insulation ageing position on the CM impedance spectrum is studied and this effect can be used to locate the ageing position along the winding. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method monitors the parallel capacitance in the frequency range both below and above the resonance frequency point. Using multi-frequency information, the proposed method can distinguish the ageing position and detect the local insulation degradation sensitively, which improves the performance of this monitoring method. The offline and online experimental results both validate the proposed method.

This knowledge is of critical importance nowadays, especially in industrial applications in which unexpected outages can lead to severe repercussions. This paper presents a new intelligent sensor that combines, in a single unit, the information obtained from the analysis of different quantities. In its current version the diagnostic provided by the sensor is obtained from the analysis of stray fluxes (both axial and radial) and currents. Unlike other solutions, the sensor is based on the application of advanced signal processing tools that are adapted to the analysis of these quantities under transient conditions. The combination of these new tools with the classical steady-state analysis of such quantities enables to obtain a more reliable conclusion on the motor health. The experiments included in the paper demonstrate the reliability provided by the sensor, which is being prepared to incorporate a third input based on infrared data.

These include the possibility of inserting external rheostats in series with the rotor winding to enhance the torque characteristics under starting and to decrease the high inrush currents. However, the more complex structure of the rotor winding, compared to cage induction motors, is a source for potential maintenance problems. In this regard, several anomalies can lead to the occurrence of asymmetries in the rotor winding that may yield terrible repercussions for the machine's integrity. Therefore, monitoring the levels of asymmetry in the rotor winding is of paramount importance to ensure the motor's correct operation. This paper proposes the analysis of stray flux signals under starting as a way to reliably detect an occasional rotor winding asymmetry and determine its level. The paper makes use of a novel approach relying on the bispectrum of the transient stray flux signals. This approach has two main advantages: the suitability of its results for the failure's automatic identification and feasibility for the introduction of fault severity indicators based on the bispectrum value of flux signals. The results prove the potential of the method for its future incorporation in autonomous condition monitoring systems that can be satisfactorily applied to determine the health of these machines.

Energy storage can be implemented both at grid level or at user level and nowadays different technologies are available for this purpose. Chemical batteries represent the de facto standard of storage systems for performance and maturity, however, chemical batteries feature a quite large environmental footprint and use precious raw materials. Mechanical storage technologies could be a viable alternative, because of their reduced impacts on the environment and on the exploitation of raw materials. Mechanical storage technologies require a motor/generator as an interface between the flywheel, the grid and a renewable energy source. In this paper a custom machine based on an ironless surface permanent-magnet structure is compared with iron core structures, with special reference to fault tolerance. In fact, the electrical machine shall work either as a motor or as a generator and it is the enabler for some critical specifications: high-discharge duration and compatible size/dimension. For this application, high rejection of faults is an important option, that requires an efficient fault detection system and a fault tolerant configuration. The proposed solution is based on the ironless dual-rotor surface permanent-magnet machine that is perfectly suited for these specifications. The ironless dual-rotor configuration features two main advantages: (1) the phases are magnetically and electrically isolated; (2) reactive components are much lower than resistive components. In addition, the ironless machine topology is less sensitive to unbalanced air gap radial forces that arise during fault operations due to a non symmetrical air gap magnetic field. These forces would strongly affect magnetic or air bearings, that are a mandatory option to reduce mechanical losses and to increase discharge duration. Hence, the proposed ironless structure is the best suited for the energy storage application. In this paper three synchronous electrical machines are modeled and compared via finite element analysis and a prototype of the dual-rotor ironless machines was realized and tested.

The fault-tolerant system uses a fourth inverter leg connected to the motor neutral point, allowing for post-fault two-phase operation. Since the control is sensorless and fault detection is performed by the controller, no additional sensors are required beyond three phase current sensors. Hence, the fault-tolerant system is particularly suitable for highly integrated or compact drive systems. Whilst fault detection and sensorless two-phase control are well documented in existing literature, often little attention is given to the transitional behavior between a fault occurring and post-fault operation. Hence we focus on experimentally testing the fault-tolerant system in its entirety. An open-circuit fault is created during sensorless three-phase operation, causing a transient in the motor torque and speed. The controller rapidly detects the fault, and switches to post-fault control with the faulty leg disabled and the 4th leg connected to the motor neutral. In the test system the fault caused only a 5% dip in motor speed before the speed was smoothly regulated back to the commanded pre-fault speed under the post-fault two-phase control scheme. This fast recovery from a fault condition is particularly beneficial to aviation applications, where even a brief loss of the motor drive may be unacceptable.

This work presents a saliency-tracking technique for zero and low speed based on square wave signal injection that is used in combination with a slowly sampled current control and a modified pulse pattern to simplify the necessary signal processing and increase injection frequency. Improvements in reducing the computational load, shifting the injection frequency out of the audible range and providing high bandwidth advocate the proposed method for a position-sensorless control system. The proposed method is enhanced with a back electromotive force (BEMF) based position estimator for intermediate and high operating speeds for being applied to an electric power steering (EPS) drive application as a software-based redundancy concept.

Automatic fault detection and diagnosis of SRS is desired by manufacturers and customers as performance is improved, and energy consumption and cost is lowered. In this work, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are applied for fault detection and diagnosis of SRS. The network is found to be able to classify the fault with 99% accuracy. The sensitivity of the designed model to data quality is also assessed. The results show that the model can classify faults at low sample rates if the training set is large enough. Moreover, the model displays low sensitivity to data quality such as noisy and perturbed validation data, and the frequency of false positives is satisfactorily low as well.

The detection problem is divided into two parts. First, a model-based observer is used to incorporate the knowledge of the system into the fault detection. Next, a data driven classification algorithm based on kalman filter performance metrics is used. This machine learning algorithm is trained using real vehicle data and, therefore, able to handle model uncertainties and disturbances inherently. Due to the usage of a nonlinear observer, the fault detection is suitable up to the limits of handling. The presented structure offers the possibility to use the same classification algorithm for different vehicles as the vehicles' behavior is abstracted in the observer. Therefore, the need of extensive training data is reduced. This paper focuses on the development of features and gives a first proof of concept. The developed fault detection is validated with real car measurements.

Interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) drives offer the required physical properties for effective online motion state estimation. At low speed range including standstill, high frequency signal injection (HFSI)-based saliency-tracking methods estimate the rotor position solely utilizing terminal machine properties. However, implementation of HFSI is challenging and highly reliant on the given machine design. Load dependent non-linear phenomena can have detrimental effects on estimation accuracy and hence the required robustness, limiting the use in fail-operational safety-relevant applications. This paper proposes a modified implementation strategy for using HFSI as part of a position sensor redundancy concept for highly utilized IPMSM drives. A simple identification procedure is presented, isolating static position estimation errors. Experimental results confirm effective compensation of satuartion-induced errors, maximizing the fault-detection and fault-compensation capabilities of the proposed strategy even under heavy load conditions.

But like any other machines, it can be affected by several faults such as broken rotor bars, stator inter-turn short-circuit, bearing faults, etc. On the one hand, mechanical faults produce vibration, eccentricity and torque oscillations which influence the stator current and the distribution of the magnetic field. Therefore, early detection of mechanical faults leads to avoid damage or sudden stop of the induction machine. In this context, this paper studies the performances of three fault detection and diagnostic techniques for rolling bearing failures. The first technique is based on the stator current analysis, the second one uses the vibration signal analysis and the last technique is devoted to the stray flux signature. The aim of the study is to highlight the performances of stray-flux technique in the detection of inner raceway fault comparatively to current and vibration. For this study, experimental tests are realized on a laboratory test bench allowing creation of artificial bearing damage. The analysis is focused on specific harmonics related to the electrical and mechanical frequencies.

Efficient, reliable fault identification and management has become a critical factor in the design of these increasingly sophisticated and complex devices. Teams of co-operating software agents are one way to coordinate the flow of diagnostic information gathered during fault-finding. By wielding domain knowledge of the software architecture used to construct the system, agents build and refine their beliefs about the location and root cause of faults. This paper examines how agents constructed within the GORITE Multi-Agent Framework create and refine their beliefs. We demonstrate three different belief structures implemented within our Fault Diagnostic Engine, showing how each supports a distinct aspect of the agent's reasoning. Using domain knowledge of the IEC 61499 Function Block architecture, agents are able to examine and rigorously evaluate both individual components and entire sub-systems.

Moreover, this technique is non-intrusive, affordable and very sensitive due to the substantial technical progress in the design and development of new thermal cameras. However, data interpretation and decision making from the resulting infrared images is one of the major limitations of this technique, because it is directly dependent on the operator's experience. Several automated expert systems have been developed using machine learning and, to a lesser extent, with deep learning algorithms. The objective of this paper is to develop a diagnosis tool, based on infrared imaging and deep learning algorithms, applicable to induction motors working in transient conditions. The developed classifier, after training, presents high accuracy levels, classifying the images into one of the five considered scenarios and even at the early stages of the transient state. This methodology can be applied in a broad variety of scenarios with substantial cost saving and offering high-safety standards.

Several approaches for RUL prediction using multiple sensory data assume the system's degradation in a specific form, which may not be applicable to the diversity of practical engineering systems. In this paper, a two-phase data driven framework is proposed. The first phase is an offline process of constructing the health index (HI) library from run-to-failure data using fuzzy similarity based data fusion, which enables to create the HIs without any assumptions. In the second phase, the HI of online is mapped onto the library created offline to find the best matching position using time series similarity search. This simultaneously enables the current condition of the system being informed as well as estimating its time left. The degradation simulation dataset of turbofan engine from NASA Prognostics Center is used to evaluate the potential application of the proposed framework.

Acquiring the vibration data of a machine with suitably placed accelerometers is a non-invasive and widely adopted approach for obtaining information regarding the health condition of the mechanical bearings. This paper presents a robust condition monitoring method for wear state classification and remaining useful life estimation of the mechanical rolling element bearings using orthogonal vibration signals. This proposed method uses non-linear signal processing techniques in the frequency domain for feature subset selection of short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectra and non-linear temporal class boundaries for classification using Coarse and Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour. This method has been tested and validated using the IEEE PHM PRONOSTIA challenge dataset. The signal processing and ML based approach presented here has performed extremely well with correct classification results of up to 75.6% being achieved. This work is of significant merit and will be highly valuable for the electric machines community allowing for the implementation of a robust condition monitoring system for many industrial applications using vibration sensors.

Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) could supervise the State of Health (SoH) and make the right action at the right time to extend the lifetime of PEMFC. In the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, the Health Indicators (HIs) are able to reflect the degradation state and an efficient Health Indicator (HI) could make sure the prediction accuracy. In general, the voltage and power are the most commonly used HIs because they are easy to measure or calculate. Besides, the current and voltage sensors are convenient to be installed and the voltage and power are always supervised for the control purpose. Nevertheless, these two HIs are more suitable for static operating conditions and assume that their deviation is only influenced by the ageing phenomenon. In the dynamic or time-varying operating conditions, the voltage and power are synthetically influenced by the operating parameters and deterioration factors. So some novel HIs (e.g., virtual stack voltage, average resistance) should be used for the dynamic working conditions.

Many factors cause the degradation of PEMFCs, and these factors are often difficult to measure accurately. The prognostic method based on long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) has better memory ability for time series and has been demonstrated able to describe the degradation trend of PEMFCs. However, the traditional LSTM prediction algorithm seems to easily fall into the local optimal solution in long-term prediction cases. Overfitting like errors may result in an imprecise or even unstable prognostic. This paper proposes a novel method, named navigation sequence driven LSTMs (NSD-LSTMs), to enhance the accuracy of PEMFCs degradation trend prediction. Two types of PEMFCs aging test data under different load conditions were used to verify the performance of NSD-LSTMs. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional LSTMs, NSD-LSTMs can improve the accuracy of trend prediction. Accurate degradation prognostic can be used to predict RUL and provide guidance for the commercial application of PEMFCs.

In order to further enhance the fault-tolerant performance, many study efforts have been devoted to different postfault control strategies. In most of the strategies, knowledge of the fault type and location is required prior to the fault-tolerant operation. Therefore, fault detection is an indispensable procedure. Making use of the zero-sequence current constraints, this paper proposes a generalized method to detect and locate the open-phase faults in symmetrical multiphase machines. This method is simple and can be applied to symmetrical multiphase machines with any phase numbers. Experimental results prove the fast detection speed and robustness of the proposed method even in machine transients (such as speed and torque steps) and multiple-open-phase faults.

Edge computing involves the deployment of computing devices close to sensor locations in order to process sensor data and derive useful information quickly and efficiently near the source. This improves the quality of the collected data and reduces the strain on the underlying communication networks. The obtained data can be used for a number of inference tasks using machine learning. The majority of machine learning research efforts assume that the collected data is untainted by various effects in the data collection or transmission process. The data-driven models generated with this assumption and the inferences drawn are frequently unusable in practical scenarios. Predictive maintenance is the process of utilizing sensor data obtained from equipment to determine and predict the optimal time for maintenance of the equipment. Using predictive maintenance, the time and money spent on maintaining equipment can be greatly reduced. In this paper, we perform distributed modeling using edge computing to determine the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of machines used in a manufacturing plant. We analyze the effects of wireless network degradation on the accuracy of the distributed models and propose active learning algorithms to mitigate these effects, thereby improving the usefulness and robustness of predictive maintenance in realistic settings.

Open-Phase Fault Diagnosis in Six-Phase PMSM Drives Based on the Harmonics of the Measured Secondary Subspace Currents	IECON 2020: THE 46TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	46th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 19-21, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Nangyang Technol Univ, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Smart Grid Power Elect Consortium Singapore		Fault diagnosis; multiphase machines; open-phase faults; permanent magnet synchronous machines; six-phase machines	INDUCTION-MOTOR DRIVES	Multiphase machines are ideal candidates for application in electric drives for critical applications. Since they can operate with open-phase faults (OPFs) without requiring extra hardware, the fault detection is important to reconfigure the control strategy. Hence, this paper proposes a new signal-based diagnosis method to detect OPFs in six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives based on the measured currents mapped into the secondary subspace, which do not contribute to the production of flux or torque. The proposed OPF diagnosis method measures both the mean value and the amplitude of the second harmonic of the secondary currents in the rotor reference frame to detect and identify an OPF. Moreover, the proposed method is unaffected by current harmonics due to non-sinusoidal back-EMF and due to dead-time effects in the power converters, which map as a sixth harmonic of the secondary currents in the rotor reference frame. The simulation results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to correctly detect and identify OPFs independently of the drive operating conditions.	[Goncalves, Pedro F.

One of such principles is visual attention, a smart human concept which focuses processing on a part of a scene. In this contribution, we utilize attention to improve the automatic detection of defect patterns for wafers within the domain of semiconductor manufacturing. Previous works in the domain have often utilized classical machine learning approaches such as KNNs, SVMs, or MLPs, while a few have already used modern approaches like deep neural networks (DNNs). However, one problem in the domain is that the faults are often very small and have to be detected within a larger size of the chip or even the wafer. Therefore, small structures in the size of pixels have to be detected in a vast amount of image data. One interesting principle of the human brain for solving this problem is visual attention. Hence, we employ here a biologically plausible model of visual attention for automatic visual inspection. On this basis, we propose a hybrid system of visual attention and a deep neural network. As demonstrated, our system achieves, among other decisive advantages, an improvement in accuracy from 81% to 92 %, and an increase in accuracy for detecting faults from 67% to 88 %. Therefore, the error rates are reduced from 19% to 8 %, and notably from 33% to 12% for detecting a faulty chip. Hence, these results show that attention can greatly improve the performance of visual inspection systems. Additionally, we conduct a broad evaluation, which identifies specific advantages of the biological attention model in this application, and benchmarks standard deep learning approaches as an alternative with and without attention.

In our approach, multiple sensor signals are converted into two dimensional representations using the proposed conversion methods to optimize the classification performance. Many studies on the prediction of manufacturing results using sensor signals have been conducted in the field of fault detection and classification for display and semiconductor manufacturing processes. It is challenging to apply machine learning to real-life manufacturing problems due to practical limitations, class imbalance and data insufficiency, which also make it difficult to produce a generalized model. To overcome these challenges, we propose using omni-supervised learning but with a new approach to knowledge distillation that ensembles predictions from multiple instantiations of a CNN model of synthetically generated data samples from a deep generative model. Our experiment results show that the fault classification accuracy improves substantially by applying trace data analytics to manufacturing data from display fabrication lines. The results also show that the quality of trained CNN models using the proposed knowledge distillation is maintained steadily and stably.

The rotor is one of the most important equipment parts and is one of the most common failure points. To assess the degradation life of rotating machines, this paper proposes a data-driven prognostic technique that utilizes an unsupervised trend extraction and an exponential degradation model to obtain an accurate RUL prediction of rotor failures. The main steps of the proposed prognostic technique are condition monitoring data acquisition, feature extraction using signal processing techniques, feature selection based on the monotonicity technique to quantify the merit of the best representative features for prognosis purposes. The selected features are then combined using the principal component analysis technique to get the most appropriate component health indicator. Finally, an exponential degradation model is used to estimate the RUL using this health indicator. The suitability of the proposed approach in component monitoring is demonstrated on a degradation dataset of a faulty rotor acquired from a Simulink model of an induction motor.

The risk of unplanned equipment downtime can be minimized through Predictive Maintenance of revenue generating assets to ensure optimal performance and safe operation of equipment. However, the increased sensorization of the equipment generates a data deluge, and existing machine-learning based predictive model alone becomes inadequate for timely equipment condition predictions. In this paper, a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed for predictive equipment maintenance from an equipment-based sensor network context. Within each equipment, a sensor device aggregates raw sensor data, and the equipment health status is analyzed for anomalous events. Unlike traditional black-box regression models, the proposed algorithm self-learns an optimal maintenance policy and provides actionable recommendation for each equipment. Our experimental results demonstrate the potential for broader range of equipment maintenance applications as an automatic learning framework.

A diversity of technologies has been developed to optimize agricultural activities and maximize the productivity of sugarcane crops. In this sense, our primary goal is to contribute to this research area by detecting planting lines and measuring their faults, including the evaluation of curved lines that substantially limit numerous solutions in practical applications. An automatic method that identifies and measures sugarcane planting lines through digital image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms is presented. The proposal is evaluated using a database of real scene images, which were classified by K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and prepared with the support of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Experimental tests show a low relative error of approximately 1:65% compared to manual mapping in the planting regions. It means that our proposal can identify and measure planting lines accurately, which enables automated inspections with high precision measurements.

A 0.25 HP induction motor under healthy, single- and multi-fault conditions is tested in the lab. Three-phase stator currents and three-dimensional vibration signals of the motor are recorded simultaneously under steady-state operation in each test. Features for machine learning are extracted from the raw experimental stator current and vibration data using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Three GSSL algorithms, local and global consistency (LGC), Gaussian field and harmonic function (GFHF), and greedy-gradient max cut (GGMC), are used in the paper. It is found that both stator current and vibration signals perform well for one individual fault diagnosis using GSSL algorithms, but for classification of a combination of five different faults, the stator current outperforms the vibration signal significantly. Among the three GSSL algorithms, GGMC shows better classification results over LGC and GFHF for both stator current and vibration signals.

Each new use case requires developing its own machine learning (ML) solution. A ML solution integrates different software components to read, process, and analyze all use case data, as well as to finally generate the output that domain experts need for their decision-making. The process to design a system specification for a ML solution is not straight-forward. It entails two types of complexity: (1) The technical complexity of selecting combinations of ML algorithms and software components that suit a use case; (2) the organizational complexity of integrating different requirements from a multidisciplinary team of, e. g., domain experts, data scientists, and IT specialists. In this paper, we propose several adaptations to Axiomatic Design in order to design ML solution specifications that handle these complexities. We call this Axiomatic Design for Machine Learning (AD4ML). We apply AD4ML to specify a ML solution for a fault detection use case and discuss to what extent our approach conquers the above-mentioned complexities. We also discuss how AD4ML facilitates the agile design of ML solutions.

J	Bardakis, I; Niculita, O; Wallace, P				Bardakis, Ioannis; Niculita, Octavian; Wallace, Peter			Requirements and Data Integrity Considerations for Diagnostics Testbeds	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								The process of generating high quality data for the test and evaluation of diagnostic and prognostic algorithms is still of high importance to the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) research community. To support these efforts a testbed has been designed, manufactured and commissioned. It has specifically been designed in order to replicate several component degradation faults with high accuracy and high repeatability. This paper documents the design, requirements and the data integrity elements of this benchmark hydraulic system. This document consolidates the process of designing diagnostics testbeds as at present there is a lack of literature on how diagnostics testbeds should be built and is intended to serve as a starting point and quick reference guide for engineers and researchers intending to design and develop a testbed to test and validate PHM applications. The first part of this paper highlights design requirements for all the design aspects for such testbeds with great consideration for industry standards and best practices covering the achievement of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and noise mitigation, as well as operators' safety and equipment protection. The second part of the paper put great emphasis on data integrity elements of the data generated by this testbed (describing the system under healthy and faulty conditions) before it is actually used for system characterization or by diagnostics and prognostics algorithms.

This paper reviews in the literature about the different aspects of decision-making in the context of PHM. The selected papers are subject to content assessment and grouped according to the decision type. Additionally, this paper presents a synthesis of the previous works that helps identify new trends and deficiencies in the decision-making process. The synthesis can guide efforts for future work.

Coronavirus was flown in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei region in China. Currently, the situation is enlarged by the infection in more than 200 countries all over the world. In this situation it was rising into huge forms in Bangladesh too. Modulated with a public dataset delivered by the IEDCR health authority, we have produced a sustainable prognostic method of COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh using a deep learning model. Throughout the research, we forecasted up to 30 days in which per day actual prediction was confirmed, death and recoveries number of people. Furthermore, we illustrated that long short-term memory (LSTM) demands the actual output trends among time series data analysis with a controversial study that exceeds random forest (RF) regression and support vector regression (SVR), which both are machine learning (ML) models. The current COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh has been considered in this paper. Here, a well-known recurrent neural network (RNN) model in order to referred by the LSTM network that has forecasted COVID-19 cases on per day infected scenario of Bangladesh from May 15th of 2020 till June 15th of 2020. Added with a comparative study that drives into the LSTM, SVR, RF regression which is processed by the RMSE transmission rate. In all respects, in Bangladesh the gravity of COVID-19 has become excessive nowadays so that depending on this situation public health sectors and common people need to be aware of this situation and also be able to get knowledge of how long self-lockdown will be maintained. So far, to the best of our knowledge LSTM based time series analysis forecasting infectious diseases is a well-done formula. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, it is difficult to generate an edge application only by deploying the model, because of the variety of data collection and preprocessing methods. To solve this problem, a framework for developing edge applications semi-automatically from inference models is proposed. An actual edge application is prototyped, which proves that the proposed framework concept is feasible.

RAS should provide high quality services, with four key properties that make them trustworthy: they must be (i) robust with regards to any system health related issues, (ii) safe for any matters in their surrounding environments, (iii) secure against any threats from cyber spaces, and (iv) trusted for human- machine interaction. This article thoroughly analyses the challenges in implementing the trustworthy RAS in respects of the four properties, and addresses the power of AI in improving the trustworthiness of RAS. While we focus on the benefits that AI brings to human, we should realize the potential risks that could be caused by AI. This article introduces for the first time the set of key aspects of human-centered AI for RAS, which can serve as a cornerstone for implementing trustworthy RAS by design in the future.

The relevance vector machine (RVM) is one of substantially used methods for RUL prognostics of rolling bearing. However, the accuracy generated by RVM drops rapidly in the long-term prognostics. To remedy this shortcoming of RVM, a novel hybrid method combining grey model (GM), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and RVM is put forward. In the hybrid prognostics framework, the GM is applied to gain a 'raw' prediction result and produce an original error sequence. Subsequently, a new smoother error sequence reconstructed by CEEMD method is used to train RVM model, by which the future prediction error applied to correct the raw prediction results of GM is projected. The experimental results demonstrate the satisfactory prognostics performance.

In the United States, estimates of prevalence range from 3% to 7% of the general population and the number increases significantly in the rural US areas due to lack of availability of highly trained medical professionals and access to specialty voice care centers. Untreated, the voice disorders cost billions of dollars in lost productivity and much of the cost is paid by the tax payers. Early identification, prognosis, is a game changer as it provides a clinical pathway to reduce the impact of the disease. The goal of this paper is to develop artificial intelligent diagnostic tool that can detect voice disorders in clinical and outpatient settings through the application of advanced machine learning and neural networks techniques. Our innovation is to democratize diagnostic tool so that the disparity of access in rural areas can be reduced by bridging the gap between access and availability of specialty care through data science and machine learning.

Soft and hard sciences meet in the regime of decisions. Depending on data available and the specific process knowledge, the most important is the complexity content, leading to interdependent decisions. With respect to AIA it makes practical sense to reduce information and use time series analysis, whereas more complex systems are more advantageously using advanced AI methods as machine learning (ML) as well as by means of data availability. The main challenge for the technical systems investigated is that damage shall be predicted and hence normal operation remains uncertain or determined by limited AI implementation.

Although traditional intelligent fault diagnosis technologies such as support vector machines, extreme learning machines and artificial neural networks can achieve satisfactory accuracy, they still rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual intervention in the process of feature extraction and selection. This paper proposes a new method for fault diagnosis of rolling bearings based on CNN deep learning based on attention mechanism. First, in order to make full use of the convolutional network to obtain a larger receptive field, a one-dimensional time series is transformed into a two-dimensional matrix as the input of the CNN network by mapping. The neural network is used to extract the advanced features of the input signal. The high-level features of the output are scored, and the results are finally output through a fully connected classifier. Finally, the model was verified by an experiment. The results show that the improved Att-CNN2D network with the attention mechanism has greatly improved the model generalization ability and obtained higher accuracy than the traditional CNN network.

The fact that little attention has been paid to the nature of signals as to whether the combination of preprocessing can help to achieve better diagnosis performance motivated this investigation. A fault diagnosis method based on wavelet packet coefficients and 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the signal features involved in both low- and high-frequency components are extracted based on wavelet packet decomposition, and combined without changing their output sequence directly for the sake of retaining all the characteristics. Secondly, the combined features are taken as input of a 1D-CNN, which consists of several convolutional layers, to further learn the abstract features and improve classification performance. Finally, testing data were fed into the trained model to recognize the machine running state.

Unfortunately, there is still a constraint to achieve a high success rate because a huge volume of training data is required. These faults were represented on its frequency content throughout the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm to observe the individual frequency characteristics. At that point, these failure induced faults studies were improved using a new statistical signal-based analysis named Z-freq to improve the investigation. During the experiment, the misfire was created by cutting voltage supplied to spark plug. The obtained result and analysis showed a significant pattern in the coefficient value and distribution of Z-freq data scattered for misfire. Finally, the simulation and experimental output were verified and validated in a series of performance metrics tests using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for prediction purposes.

To support the implementation of such use cases, various ML models have been proposed and validated in the research literature. This paper introduces a novel set of machine learning algorithms for Industry4.0 use cases, namely the QARMA algorithms, which are capable of mining of quantitative rules. QARMA models present several advantages when compared to conventional ML and Deep Learning mechanisms, including computational performance, predictive accuracy and "explainability". In the scope of this paper, we discuss these advantages based on practical experiences from the field deployment and validation of QARMA models in two different production lines. The deployment has been supported by a state-of-the-art Industrial Internet of Things platform, which is also presented in the paper.

An Agnostic Data-Driven Approach to Predict Stoppages of Industrial Packing Machine in Near Future	16TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (DCOSS 2020)	IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	16th Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)	JUN 15-17, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE Comp Soc		Industry 4.0; Time Series Forecasting; Industrial machinery data		As data awareness in manufacturing companies increases with the deployment of sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, data-driven maintenance and prediction have become quite popular in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. Machine Learning (ML) has been recognised as a promising, efficient and reliable tool for fault detection use cases, as it allows to export important knowledge from monitored assets. Scientists deal with issues such as the small amount of data that indicate potential problems, or the imbalance which exists between the standard process data and the data inadequacy of the systems to make a high precision forecast. Currently, in this context, even large industries are not able to effectively predict abnormal behaviors in their tools, processes and equipment, when adopting strategies to anticipate crucial events. In this paper, we propose a methodology to enable prediction of a packing machine's stoppages in manufacturing process of a large industry, by using forecasting techniques based on univariate time series data. There are more than 100 reasons that cause the machine to stop, in a quite big production line length. However, we use a single signal, concerning the machines operational status to make our prediction, without considering other fault or warning signals, hence its characterization as "agnostic". A workflow is presented for cleaning and preprocessing the data, and for training and evaluating a predictive model. Two predictive models, namely ARIMA and Prophet, are applied and evaluated on real data from an advanced machining process used for packing. Training and evaluation tests indicate that the results of the applied methods perform well on a daily basis. Our work can be further extended and act as reference for future research activities that could lead to more robust and accurate prediction frameworks.

By considering the high management costs in the modern and complex railways fleets as a primary requirement, the key goal of the proposed approach consists in efficiently integrating maintenance actions with the capability to satisfactorily keep railway services. Here, this is achieved by means of multi-layer approach that combine into a single framework the following ingredients: interpolation procedures, machine learning algorithms and prediction arguments that take advantage of an accurate model description of the rolling stock dynamics. Experiments on a PV7 EVO - Matisa, owned by the Italian Railways Network, have been conducted with the aim to show the effectiveness of the proposed maintenance architecture.

Collecting these training data is time-consuming and prohibitively expensive in practical applications. To overcome this challenge, we develop a classification framework using imperfectly labeled data. First, a statistical model is proposed to derive a set of probabilistic labels with consideration of labeling errors. Next, an accurate classifier is trained from these inaccurate labels.

Operation diagnosis can have multiple applications from a learning point of view (e.g. staff training) or in terms of process assessment. This work proposes a methodology for implementing an Intelligent System by means of any interactive system connected through OPC UA standard. A digital twin of the process supports configuration and validation, prior to commissioning. Activity is interpreted and diagnosed according to the context in which it occurs. Step order in sequence, step duration and sequence duration are analyzed in a use case based on a PLC-controlled robotic cell in which it is operated both in automatic and manual mode for adjusting a linear table's positioning.

However, restrictions regarding the centralized accumulation of data necessary for such automatic adaption call for a distributed approach to training these algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, a continual learning based algorithm for fault prediction is presented, allowing for distributed, cooperative learning by elastic weight consolidation. This algorithm is then evaluated on a large NASA turbofan engine dataset and shows promising results regarding the performant training on decentral sub-datasets for industrial automation scenarios.

In the study presented here, a custom pressure sensor is integrated into an injection tool to monitor the different pressure levels along the process cycle, together with a commercial off-the-shelf accelerometer, coupled at the surface of the tool. Both sensors recorded the events over regular productive cycles, being this information, in the long-term, paramount for a smart predictive maintenance. The runtime information can also give valuable insights about the tool condition in real-time.

Currently, the massive digitalization of industrial assets allows the investigation towards multiple monitoring strategies capable of emphasize deviations over the nominal system operation. However, the most prominent techniques, such as Machine Learning, present great challenges in complex systems. In this regard, the proposed study presents the analysis of the diagnostic capabilities resulting from the classical approaches based on machine learning facing to complex electromechanical systems that implies a working environment subject to different operation condition, configurations with multiple components and the presence of faults of different nature (mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic), under isolated or combined scenarios. Discriminative feature extraction capabilities and classification accuracy will be analyzed as performance measures.

However, the status of machinery in production line deteriorates during production, subsequently, their condition can affect the quality of products, and also leads to unexpected failure and consequent disturbance to the production. In order to address this problem, smart remanufacturing and maintenance should be carried out for machinery. Current remanufacturing and maintenance are largely carried out by inefficient manual process and also lack smart tools to understand the impact of remanufacturing and maintenance to the current production. To go towards smart remanufacturing and maintenance in the era of Industry 4.0, automated inspection, condition monitoring and integrated optimisation of production and maintenance planning is necessary. In this article, the prior research on these topics was reviewed. Articles from peer-reviewed academic journals with high impact factors were found by using the related keywords and studied according to their research topics. It is found that the automated product inspection and tool condition monitoring have been studied, but they were not much integrated for the optimisation of production and maintenance planning. The integration of automated product inspection, tool condition monitoring, and optimisation of production and maintenance planning is a potential future research direction. This potential research can not only help to improve performance, but also reduce cost and waste of production, remanufacturing and maintenance.

Fault detection technologies are now indispensable for energy efficiency and performance improvement. In this paper, a methodology for the robust and reliable fault detection and diagnosis is presented as a two-stage framework composed by an offline stage where the models are built and an online stage that is constantly receiving new samples. The system includes a novelty detection scheme developed using one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) and a classifier built using SVM. The proposed strategy is applied to a dataset for a single-zone constant air volume air handling unit. The experimental results show that the novelty detection stage adds robustness layer to the typical classification scheme.

In this scenario, the prediction of future machineries health status is necessary in order to plan maintenance cycles and to optimize the production. The proposed approach relies on the use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) techniques mapped from the electronic domain to the production line domain. This paper proposes a general framework based on the EDA approach that allows to set-up a maintenance strategy by analyzing data retrieved from sensors. An MSM, is associated to each observable measurement, while a Supervisor monitors the current state of each Monitoring State Machine (MSM) by raising alerts when the monitored equipment is deviating from its normal behavior. This framework is the Digital-Twin of the plant devoted to its monitoring. It has some execution modalities ranging from online monitoring to predictive maintenance. The methodology has been applied to a mechanical transmission system showing its effectiveness.

These devices have the goal of executing simple tasks, automatically, usually with strict requirements in terms of space and cost. Typically, these devices have to rely on batteries or by harvesting energy devices (e.g., solar panels), in order to operate. On the other hand, IoT devices may be equipped with powerful multi-core CPUs to achieve performance goals, making the management of the energy budget a challenging task. This requires the development of an effective management system, that takes into account current and future energy budget availability, to dynamically bound the actual allocation of processing resources. Specifically, when exploiting solar panels for power supply, we can leverage on the weather forecast, to estimate the availability of energy in the near future. This paper introduces a predictive energy budget management system, targeting multi-core based embedded platforms. Thanks to both local and large-scale weather information, our solution aims at predicting the future incoming power and, accordingly, tuning the exploitable performance level to keep the system running under any environmental condition.

In this context, the various manufacturing processes, machines, and product variants make it necessary to create and use lots of different machine learning models. This calls for a software system that is able to manage all these diverse machine learning models and associated metadata. However, current model management systems do not associate models with business and domain context to provide non-expert users with tailored functions for model search and discovery. Moreover, none of the existing systems provides a comprehensive overview of all models within an organization. In our demonstration, we present the MMP, our model management platform that addresses these issues. The MMP provides a model metadata extractor, a model registry, and a context manager to store model metadata in a central metadata store. On top of this, the MMP provides frontend components that offer the above-mentioned functionalities. In our demonstration, we show two scenarios for model management in Industry 4.0 environments that illustrate the novel functionalities of the MMP. We demonstrate to the audience how the platform and its metadata, linking models to their business and domain context, help non-expert users to search and discover models. Furthermore, we show how to use MMP's powerful visualizations for model reporting, such as a dashboard and a model landscape view.

Many contributing losses occur due to an unexpected breakdown of the gears. Recently, in many researches fault diagonsis has been the most contributing content in the gears. Vibration analysis has been used as a deciding tool for several machinery maintenance decisions. The most efficient form of indication is by the increment in the vibration level. By measuring and analysing the machine's vibration, it is possible to determine both the nature and severity of the defect, and hence predict the machine's failure. The vibration signal of a gearbox carries the signature of the fault in the gears and early fault detection of the gearbox is possible by analysing the vibration signal using different signal processing techniques. The present work depicts about the predictive maintenance program implementation based on the experimental data set of the gear box assembly in wind turbines by using the Artificial neural network and comprises of the prediction of variation in the accuracy of the experimental data set. The code values are generated using python 3.7 version software. The accuracy of the Model was found to be 61.86%. This accuracy indicates the functioning of the gears and can also be used for predictions in real time scenario.	[Abishekraj, N.; Prashanna, G. R. Jeeva; Suriyaa, M.

IoT is about connecting machines and making use of the data generated from those machines. AI is about simulating intelligent behaviour in machines of all kinds As IoT devices will generate vast amounts of data, then AI will be functionally necessary to deal with these huge volumes if we're to have any chance of making sense of the data. AI is beneficial for both real-time and post event processing: Post event processing - identifying patterns in data sets and running predictive analytics, e.g. the correlation between traffic congestion, air pollution and chronic respiratory illnesses within a city centre. Real-time processing - responding quickly to conditions and building up knowledge of decisions about those events, e.g. remote video camera reading license plates for parking payments.

However, disparate datasets and metrics have been used to experimentally evaluate these models, so a direct comparison between them cannot readily be made. In this paper, we provide an improvement to the Recurrent Neural Network model, which experimentally achieves a 98.06% migration rate and a 0.0% mismigration rate, outperforming the state-of-the-art Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree model, and achieves 100.0% failure detection rate at a 0.02% false alarm rate, outperforming the unmodified Recurrent Neural Network model in terms of prediction accuracy. We also experimentally compare five families of prediction models (nine models in total), and simulate the practical use.

Data mining techniques offer potential solutions to address this concern. In this paper, anomaly detection techniques using machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RI) have been applied to vibration sensor data for early fault detection of industrial electric motors. The models relied on vibration data collected from sensors mounted on four bearings. Initial results suggest that the RF model outperformed SVR and KNN for the data set analysed, and can be a candidate data mining technology to implement for condition monitoring of electromechanical systems.

This is the case of many industrial scenarios such as industrial machineries or automotive engines, to enable remote monitoring, predictive maintenance and components diagnosis. A co-designing method was used to obtain a system of independent RF sources embedded in the complex environment, with the aim of being at the same time miniaturized for easy integration into the environment, and of having the ability for providing energy wirelessly in a pervasive way. The validation of the project shows that even wireless sensors located in critical and NLOS (Non-line-of-sight) positions, placed in key points of the engine compartment and in contact with parts that need to be monitored, can be successfully energized by the proposed approach. This enables battery-less sensors to be powered and to simultaneously communicate with a gateway in order to monitor vital engine parameters. A communication among the gateway and a number of battery-less sensor nodes is demonstrated exploiting low-power LoRa (Long Range) nodes working in the same frequency band of the RF powering system.

Analysis of operation feature and electromagnetic field of salient pole synchronous machine has become an important research topic. In this study, a 500kW salient pole synchronous machine was adopted as the research object, and the characteristic curve of such motor during excitation process and loading process was calculated using equivalent circuit method and field circuit coupling method. The calculation results were validated through comparing the simulation waveforms of electromagnetic torque, rotor speed and excitation current. Then, the magnetic field distribution and magnetic flux density distribution of feature parts under steady-state load were calculated. Simulation results showed that the steady-state speed and torque after excitation remained unchanged so did the steady-state excitation current and speed after loading. The rotor kept constant speed after loading, with steady-state power angle of 47 degrees. The flux density amplitude of stator teeth was higher than that of intertooth part; normal flux density amplitude was significantly larger than tangential flux density amplitude. The maximum and minimum flux density amplitude were associated with stator slot number. 7th-harmonic exerted great influence on the main flux density of magnetic field, which provides reference for fault diagnosis and operating characteristic analysis of various motors.

In this paper, a new model mismatch detection approach with parity space-based methods is proposed for linear discrete time-invariant (LDTI) systems. This paper establishes a parity space-based residual evaluation function for the detection of model mismatch. The problem of parity space-based model mismatch is formulated on a state space model of a LDTI system. A standard evaluation function and its thresholds for the detection of model mismatch are proposed by providing the parity model based residuals.

It is easy to trap in the local minimum and is sensitive to the selection of the learning rate. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a method for fault diagnosis of rotating hearings based on an improved VMD algorithm combined with extreme learning machine (ELM). First, the vibration signal is decomposed by using VMD according to the number of different modes, and the information entropy of each mode obtained after each decomposition. At the same time, the minimum value of each information entropy is selected, and Compared with the minimum values of the information entropy under different modes, the minimum information entropy is selected, the modal number corresponding to the minimum information entropy is selected as the best modal number, and the information of each intrinsic mode function (IMF) corresponding to the optimal modal number is finally selected. Information entropy is sent to ELM as a feature for modal recognition. Experimental results show that this method can classify more than 93% of faults in rotating hearings.

This paper use the autoencoder to extract features for fault diagnosis on account of its good performance in feature extraction. In order to improve the accuracy of the extracted features, this paper use a sparse representation which is a constraint during the encoding process. The multi-layer structure of autoencoder has an internal covariate shift problem and the generalization ability of the network is critical, batch normalization is employed before the activation function in each layer of the autoencoder network. And a stacked method is utilized to optimize network structure and reduce training difficulty. So the features of the original signal are extracted by the network based on the above method and the extracted features are placed in the classifier to identify different health states. For the purpose of fault diagnosis, this paper uses the proposed method to experiment with the bearing data set provided by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU). The experiment proves that the proposed method has a better fault diagnosis performance compared with other traditional methods.

A fault diagnosis method based on average value of the three-phase ac current to extract fault characteristics, then an intelligent optimization algorithm for fault detection and location of support vector machine(SVM) is proposed. When a fault occurs, the average value of three-phase ac current is no longer zero, which can detect the occurrence of the faulty SM. When the open-circuit fault occurs in the SMs of different bridge aims, the average value of three-phase ac current produces different de bias components. According to the change rule of average value in three-phase current, the fault characteristic is extracted, and then the fault is classified and located by the SVM classifier optimized by genetic algorithm. Finally, Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can not only detect the fault block module quickly, but also improve the accuracy of fault classification.

The performance of the health indicator (HI) models of bearings directly affects the accuracy of data-driven RUL methods. Most current researches ignore the influence of the degradation state of the bearings in the HI model construction. To improve the RUL estimation accuracy, this paper proposes a degradation-state-based RUL estimation approach. Firstly. signal processing methods are used to extract and select the sensitive features from raw vibration data. Then, to find the degradation starting point, we propose an effective anomaly detection method based on the first-order difference and Gaussian distribution test. Next. based on the degradation starting point, the normalized lifetime of bearings is calculated and taken as the label of the HI model. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed to construct the HI model. The obtained HIs are then used to fit the double exponential curve in order to estimate the RUL of hearings. Finally, the proposed method is validated by using the data set from the accelerated degradation testing on rolling hearings.

The random forest algorithm used in this paper is based on classification regression tree (CART). And bootstrap sampling method was used to generate multiple training sets from the original training set, and random attributes were introduced in the training process to generate multiple CART trees. When troubleshooting, the final troubleshooting results are determined by voting according to the diagnosis results of each CART tree. By building a photovoltaic array model in Matlab/Simulink simulation module, use it to summarize the output characteristics of photovoltaic array in the common fault states (partial shading, abnormal component aging, open circuit, short circuit). And considering the main natural factors that affect the output of photovoltaic array, the open circuit voltage, short circuit current, maximum power point voltage, maximum power point current, environmental temperature and light irradiance were selected as the input parameters of the random forest algorithm. Then, a 2X2 small photovoltaic array experiment platform and a field data acquisition system were designed and built to collect data in order to further verify the feasibility of the random forest algorithm. The test results of random forest were compared with those of single CART decision tree, K nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. The results showed that random forest could complete the fault diagnosis task of photovoltaic array better.

For a utility transmission grid system, these failures could manifest in the form of short circuit faults and open circuit faults. Due to the advent of the digital age, the traditional grid has also undergone a massive transition to digital equipment and modern sensors which are capable of generating large volumes of data. The challenge is to preprocess this data such that it can be utilized for the detection of transients and grid failures. This paper presents the incorporation of artificial intelligence techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to detect and comprehensively classify the most common fault transients within a reasonable range of accuracy. For gauging the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a thorough evaluation study is conducted on a modified IEEE-39 bus system. Bus voltage and line current measurements are taken for a range of fault scenarios which result in high-frequency transient signals. These signals are analyzed using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The measured signals are afterward preprocessed using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) employing Daubechies four (Db4) mother wavelet in order to decompose the high-frequency components of the faulty signals. DWT results in a range of high and low-frequency detail and approximate coefficients, from which a range of statistical features are extracted and used as inputs for training and testing the classification algorithms. The results demonstrate that the trained models can be successfully employed to detect and classify faults on the transmission system with acceptable accuracy.

However, the requirements engineering (RE) community has yet to adapt to such sweeping changes caused exclusively by data. One reason is that the traditional requirements quality like unambiguity becomes less applicable to data, and so do requirements fault detection techniques like inspections. In this paper, we view deep learning as a class of machines whose effects must be evaluated with direct consideration of inherent data quality attributes: accuracy, consistency, currentness, etc. We substantiate this view by altering stationarity of the multivariate time-series data, and by further analyzing how the stationarity changes affect the behavior of a recurrent neural network in the context of predicting combined sewer overflow. Our work sheds light on the active role RE plays in deep learning.

Several predictive models using machine learning on the Semiconductor Manufacturing process dataset (SECOM) will be applied in this paper. The dataset contains the information related to semiconductor manufacturing process, with the attributes corresponding to signals collected from semiconductor devices. Due to the high-dimensionality of the data and class imbalance problem in the SECOM dataset, it poses several challenges related to data pre-processing, which is an essential step incorporated in this work while applying various machine learning models. Comparison and analysis of various predictive machine learning classification models were carried out based on the performance metrics like, accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is commonly employed as a method to predict the fault in an oil-filled transformer. There are numerous DGA interpretation methods in practice. This paper conducts a study of various interpretation methods with the aim of developing a diagnostic tool to execute the preferred methods of interpretation. A simple and low-cost spreadsheet-based diagnostic tool is proposed that will be benefit users by alleviating the difficulty of using high-end software such as MATLAB, Artificial Intelligence platforms, or expert systems based on machine learning.

Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to have important traffic exchange in future wireless networks. It is a generic term for technologies that allow devices to communicate with each other. These are wired and wireless sensing systems that send information from one device to another. The network traffic prediction problem includes the prediction of future network traffic characteristics from observations of past traffic. Network traffic forecasting has many applications including network monitoring, resource management, and fault detection. Machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction. ML technologies have proven capable of capturing nonlinear patterns in data, making them a good candidate for traffic prediction. In this paper, we perform the delay prediction in IoT communication using a multistep ahead prediction (MSP) and single-step ahead prediction (SSP) with Time Series NARX Recurrent Neural Networks. The prediction accuracy has been evaluated using three neural network training algorithms: Trainlm, Traincgf, Trainrp, with MSE as performance function in terms of using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (NAPE) as prediction accuracy measure.

First, a migration deep self-coding network model is constructed, and a combined sample of negative sequence current and electromagnetic torque is used to extract common features in different domains Then, the online detection model of abnormal timing is established. Finally, the permutation entropy value of the normal state of the motor is used to construct an alarm threshold to improve the matching speed of abnormal sequences in the online data. Experimental results show that the method in this paperhas better detection practicality.

Being able to predict the survival time for patients will provide valuable information for the choice of their treatment plans and benefit patient management. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing, many high-throughput sequencing data for DNA and RNA becomes available for cancer patients. Here we present the results for using multiple machine learning algorithms in predicting the survivorship of patients with Lung cancer adenocarcinoma. Using the publicly available datasets in TCGA with the overall survival length, and transcriptomic information, we evaluated our ability to predict prognosis. We found that using the expression level of a few candidate genes alone generates significant statistical power from a very limited number of patients, suggesting more future studies to be conducted on collecting such data to facilitate personalized medicine.

Reliability and sustained uptime of these APMs are paramount for efficient operation. Traditional maintenance strategies which employ routine maintenance can result in unnecessary, unwanted system downtime, as well as wasted labour and material resources. Preventative maintenance, in the form of condition-based maintenance (CBM), is an alternative maintenance strategy that circumvents the pitfalls of traditional strategies. CBM works by continuously monitoring the APM system for any signs of an incipient fault, and promptly notifying maintenance personnel when a fault is detected. In other words, maintenance is only performed on an as-needed basis, maximizing both system uptime, and distribution of resources. However, current CBM approaches are not without their own drawbacks. These approaches often focus on monitoring the system as a whole, rather than monitoring individual components. Furthermore, the accuracy of these approaches is heavily dependent on the availability of historical data. In this paper, a robust, blind CBM framework for monitoring of the LINK APM gearbox is presented. The proposed framework utilizes vibration measurements coupled with a novel signal pre-processing algorithm to detect incipient faults and build degradation models of the monitored system. Contrary to the current body of CBM approaches, the proposed approach is capable of monitoring and modeling the degradation of different families of components (i.e., gears and bearings) separately, allowing for increased detection and life-cycle prediction accuracy. Additionally, the proposed framework requires no historical data or prior knowledge of the system: detection accuracy and confidence in the degradation model parameters gradually increases as new sensor data becomes available. The underlying pre-processing algorithm has been validated using data collected from a number of real industrial systems and was shown to perform well under a wide variety of operating conditions. The blind, computationally efficient nature of the pre-processing algorithm, coupled with its minimal hardware requirements, allows the proposed CBM framework to be easily implementable on any APM system or rotating machinery asset.

Hence, to overcome the low performance of fault diagnosis traditional methods for different data distributions, a fault diagnosis approach based on transfer learning is proposed in this paper. And the main idea of our approach is to combine joint distribution adaptation and support vector machine to diagnose bearing faults under variable working conditions. In this research, kernel-JDA is used to reduce the difference between distributions of datasets taking both the marginal and conditional distributions into consideration, while the parameters of kernel-JDA are optimized to improve the performance. Besides, multi-features including time domain features and the relative wavelet packet energy are constructed at first to prepare for fault diagnosis. After mapping the multi-features through kernel-JDA, SVM is utilized to diagnose faults of rolling bearing under different working conditions. In addition, comparison experiments on vibration signal datasets of rolling bearings are carried out to verify the effectiveness and applicability of this approach for both the normal and small sizes of the sample sets.

Being able to detect in advance that a disk is going to fail may enable maintenance actions that can avoid severe data losses. For that reason, many researchers had devoted attention to this research topic. Recently, several authors have reported promising results by using attributes collected by the SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) system along with machine learning methods. Although the best results were obtained by supervised machine learning methods, it is important to notice that data from degraded HDDs is scarce. Hence, anomaly detection methods arise a promising solution. Among such methods, recent works reported that reconstruction based anomaly detection algorithms had the best performance on HDDs fault detection. In line with such results, in this paper we aim to further investigate the performance of such methods. We conducted tests with classical PCA based methods and neural autoencoder based methods. In addition to testing with the popular reconstruction based autoencoder method we also evaluated a method that analyzes the distribution of the latent space. Additionally we propose a simple formulation to combine both methods. On the basis of our experiments, we verified that autoencoder based methods had the best performances according to the two evaluation metrics. Among such methods, the combination approach had the best overall performance.

Predictive Maintenance; Aerospace Maintenance Repair and Overhaul		Asymmetric loss functions have been successfully applied to deep learning for image analysis and imbalanced classification. In this paper, we extend the use of particular types of weighted loss functions, namely asymmetric loss functions, to investigate how predictions of engine remaining useful life (RUL) in aerospace are affected. Within prognostics and health management, the main metric used to evaluate deep learning RUL predictions is the scoring function. Our hypothesis is that by using asymmetric loss functions we will improve results for this metric. In order to investigate our hypothesis, we test 4 different asymmetric loss functions, i.e, Mean Square Logarithmic Error-Mean Square Error, Linear-Mean Square Error, Linear-Linear, and Quadratic-Quadratic and evaluate whether and how much they affect different deep learning architectures performance. Results show that the use of asymmetric loss functions improve RUL predictions for the case study investigated.

In this paper, a deep learning approach is combined with traditional machine learning classifiers in order to circumvent the need of a specialist for extracting relevant features from one dimensional frequency-domain vibration signals. Our approach relies on a convolutional architecture trained with a triplet loss function for extracting relevant features directly from the raw data. A previously hand-crafted feature set, created by a specialist over the course of many years of research, is compared with the newly extracted feature set. Six conventional classifiers models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Naive Bayes) are trained in both features set separately and compared in terms of macro F-measure. Results shows statistical evidence towards to the acceptance that the extracted feature set is as good as or better than the hand-crafted feature set, for classification purposes.

Over 100,000 people each year in the UK suffer from an MI according to the report by British Heart Foundation. Following an MI, there is irreversible heart muscle damage that will become scar. The amount of scar following larger heart attacks, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, drives enlargement of the heart and is associated with worse prognosis (increased risk of death and subsequent heart failure). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) has become the "gold standard" for the visualization of MI. However, to date, no "gold standard" fully automated methods exist for the quantification of MI from MRI. In this work, we propose an approach to construct such methods using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, in particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Uncertainties, variability, and a possibility of bias inherent to any data imply that data-driven systems which are intended for use in clinical research and practice must be capable of learning from mistakes on-the-job. Here we develop and test a first deep learning CNN system with error correction capabilities (CNNEC) for the detection and quantification of MI. The system could be viewed as a proof-of-principle for the technology.

Recently, deep learning based prognostics methods have been emerging as an effective method to improve RUL prediction results. However, these methods, e.g. recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), only capture temporal information of the sensory data while ignoring intrinsic spatial relations between sensors. To solve this problem, in this work, we propose a framework, namely, adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolutional neural network (ASTGCNN). The proposed framework consists of two parts. In the spatial domain, since the intrinsic graph structure of sensors is not provided in most situations, a dynamic graph neural network is proposed to learn the sensors' spatial relation. In the temporal domain, a stacked dilated ID CNN is utilized to capture long range dependency of input sensor signals. These two parts are integrated in a unified framework and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. The performance of ASTGCNN is investigated on the turbofan engine dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can improve the RUL prediction performance of the current deep learning methods, and learn the intrinsic spatial information of sensors.

Firstly, WMM is used to detect the degenerate point by decomposing the original signal in high dimension space and reconstructing it in low dimension space. In the next stage, wavelet packet transform is employed to process the original signal, extract the feature vectors with strong monotony and small volatility. After optimizing the hyper-parameters of SVR with genetic algorithm, a direct relation between feature vectors and degenerate trend is established. Consequently, the RUL can be predicted with above two-stage strategy. Especially, recur to the Turbofan engine data set which is widely considered in existed literatures, the effectiveness of RUL prediction is verified with the proposed method.

The crusher plays an important role in the production of the mine, which not only directly affects the entire production line, but also causes major economic losses and even accidents caused by machine damage. To ensure the safe operation of the equipment, reduce equipment maintenance costs and increase equipment utilization, this paper proposed an ASO-BP neural network optimization model. By improving the BP neural network model with atom search algorithm, through the analysis of the six failure tests of the crusher, the proposed ASO-BP neural network can improve the accuracy of crusher fault diagnosis.

With the arrival of the era of big data, those methods more and more can not meet the needs of practical problems and deep learning plays an increasingly important role in the field of fault diagnosis. In this study, a method of rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network(2DCNN) is proposed, 2DCNN architecture model is established, the network parameters are optimized, the experimental scheme is designed, and the classification accuracy of 2DCNN for rolling bearing fault is explored. The experimental results show that in the process of identifying the fault mode of rolling bearing, the 2DCNN can distinguish the fault and normal state of rolling bearing accurately and classify the fault accurately.

The generalized frequency response functions of the nonlinear circuit are directly estimated through the time domain input and output, and the input signal is sinusoidal signal. Therefore, the Fourier transform of time-domain signal is avoided and the calculation amount for estimation is reduced. Using the amplitudes of generalized frequency response functions of analog circuit as feature data, a least square support vector machine classifier with hybrid kernel is constructed to diagnose the faults. A fault diagnosis simulation for a nonlinear analog circuit is carried out.

This paper proposes an intelligent pipeline fault diagnosis method based on smooth pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (SPWVD) time frequency image features. Firstly, a noise reduction method based on Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) combined with Dispersion Entropy (DE) was applied to acoustical signals which were collected from the pipe. Then the SPWVD time-frequency analysis method was adopted to proceed further signal transformation and the time-frequency distribution images of pipeline under 6 working conditions were obtained. The segments of blockages and pipe components were derived from the time-frequency images through Otsu threshold segmentation method according to the time frequency energy arrogation points. Finally, the histogram and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix of the segmented grayscale image were calculated to form a 20-dimensional feature vector, A parameter-optimized support vector machine classifier was trained and tested by the feature sets. The experimental results have shown that the multi-dimensional features extracted from the time-frequency images can fully interpret the characteristics of blockages and pipe components, therefore are capable of providing sufficient information for effective identification of buried pipe conditions.

Toward this end, this paper concentrates on how to make optimal maintenance decision policy for degraded equipment subjected to random shocks under imperfect maintenance. Firstly, we propose a multi-stage degradation model based on the Wiener process and incorporate the influence of shocks and maintenance into the degradation model. The remaining useful life(RUL) is predicted under the concept of the first hitting time (FHT). Secondly, we establish a condition-based maintenance decision model on the basis of the prognostic information and determine the monitoring interval and the preventive maintenance (PM) threshold. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to substantiate the condition-based maintenance decision model proposed in the paper.

When a fault occurs, the mean value of three-phase ac current is no longer zero, which can detect the occurrence of the fault. When the open-circuit fault occurs in the SMs of different bridge arms, the mean value of three-phase ac current produces different dc bias components. According to the change rule of the mean value of three-phase current, the fault characteristics are extracted, and then faults are classified with SVM classifier. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed method can detect the fault quickly and classify the faults accurately.

Once it breaks down, it will affect the safety of the whole mechanical equipment. Therefore, the real-time monitoring and diagnosis of rolling bearing is of great significance to the whole industrial safety. Aiming at the problem of rolling bearing fault diagnosis, this paper presents a method of rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on multi-dimensional entropy space distance. First, empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to decompose the original vibration signal of the rolling bearing into multiple components of intrinsic mode function (IMF). The first five IMF components are taken and the improved information entropy (IIE), improved energy entropy (IEE) and improved permutation entropy (IPE) after linear transformation are calculated for each IMF component signal. Three kinds of entropy are used as coordinate axes to construct three-dimensional space, and then the space distance between the three-dimensional space composed of three kinds of entropy of test data and the three-dimensional space of sample data is calculated. The space distance between the three-dimensional space and a certain working condition is the smallest, and the bearing is such working condition.

It suggests moving from conventional maintenance practices to predictive strategy. Owing to the complexity of aircraft systems, Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) provides a set of capabilities that enable diagnostic, prognostic and health management for effective and efficient maintenance. A functional PHM system is required to optimize condition-based maintenance (CBM), mitigate unscheduled maintenance and reduce costs inflicted thereupon. However, a comprehensive review that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM filed is lacking. To fill the gaps, this paper presents the literature review of prognostic health management techniques and the framework of PHM in order to predictive of aircraft maintenance. Moreover, this paper summarizes the challenges in existing research and highlights the opportunities in future research of the PHM framework.

Combined with the bearing signal one-dimensional characteristics, this paper proposes a one-dimension deep convolutional neural network(1D-DCNN). First of all, the original bearing vibration signal is directly input the 1D-DCNN frame structure, then 1D-DCNN frame structure is used to automatic feature extraction. Next, we use softmax regression to classified fault samples and normal samples, the confusion matrix shows that the accuracy of the 1D-DCNN model for fault diagnosis. Finally, T-SNE algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of extracted features and visualize data features, which proves that the 1D-DCNN model has a good feature extraction ability. We use bearing data sets from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to verify the model of 1D-DCNN. According to the result, we can see that the 1D-DCNN frame structure not only effectively extracts and diagnoses the original signal, but also has high fault identification accuracy. It shows the advantages of the 1D-DCNN model in extracting data features and fault diagnosis. The model of 1D-DCNN is better than the mainstream fault diagnosis method of support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic neural networks (PNN).

The necessity for proper offset correction is highlighted in this paper along with an effective strategy to quantify the static position sensor offset error in the event of such fault. This proposed strategy utilizes a current estimation-based fault detection strategy, reusing signals that are already available on an FOC machine drive system.

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid machine learning model that combines a shallow learning model, relevance vector machine (RVM), and a deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN). RVM is employed to generate artificial cells with high cycle lives, expanding the original training dataset (i.e., data augmentation). The expanded training dataset then serves as the input-output pairs used to train the CNN model. CNN first learns the locally-invariant features from the input data and then makes full use of these features to predict the cycle life of a Li-ion battery cell. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid machine learning (RVM+CNN) model on two test datasets consisting of 83 cells with widely varying cycle lives ranging from 150 to 2300 cycles. The RVM+CNN model produces higher cycle life prediction accuracy on both datasets than three other machine learning and deep learning methods.

The discipline of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) provides an efficient solution to improve the system durability and extend its lifespan. As a promising data-driven method of prognostic, the computational efficiency of Echo State Network (ESN) is much improved compared with traditional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The ESN has been used in the literature to realize the degradation prediction of PEMFC systems. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy and the practical application need to be further stressed. Compared with the fixed output weight matrix structure of ESN, the advanced structure of the moving weight matrix is used to improve the prediction accuracy. In addition, the iterative structure with predicted data is used to improve the practical application. The prediction performance of these prediction structures of ESN is compared and verified based on the data of the 2014 IEEE PHM Data Challenge.

The variations of the magnetomotive force (MMF) due to an ISC can lead to considerable changes in the inductances, which could lead to errors when modeling motors with ISC. A dynamic model is introduced, which uses rotor reference frame variables and parameters as inputs. Saturation is included by incorporating a look-up table, thus accounting for the MMF variations due to an ISC. Finally, the proposed model is compared with finite element analysis showing good agreement.

Wavelet Spectral Deep-training of Convolutional Neural Networks for Accurate Identification of High-Frequency Micro-Scale Spike Transients in the Post-Hypoxic-Ischemic EEG of Preterm Sheep	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Early diagnosis and prognosis of babies with signs of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is currently limited and requires reliable prognostic biomarkers to identify at risk infants. Using our pre-clinical fetal sheep models, we have demonstrated that micro-scale patterns evolve over a profoundly suppressed EEG background within the first 6 hours of recovery, post HI insult. In particular, we have shown that high-frequency micro-scale spike transients (in the gamma frequency band, 80-120Hz) emerge immediately after an HI event, with much higher numbers around 2-2.5 h of the insult, with numbers gradually declining thereafter. We have also shown that the automatically quantified sharp waves in this phase are predictive of neural outcome. Initiation of some neuroprotective treatments within this limited window of opportunity, such as therapeutic hypothermia, optimally reduces neural injury. In clinical practice, it is hard to determine the exact timing of the injury, therefore, reliable automatic identification of EEG transients could be beneficial to help specify the phases of injury. Our team has previously developed successful machine- and deep-learning strategies for the identification of post-HI EEG patterns in an HI preterm fetal sheep model. This paper introduces, for the first time, a novel online fusion approach to train an 11-layers deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier using Wavelet-Fourier (WF) spectral features of EEG segments for accurate identification of high-frequency micro-scale spike transients in 1024Hz EEG recordings in our preterm fetal sheep. Sets of robust features were extracted using reverse biorthogonal wavelet (rbio2.8 at scale 7) and considering an 80-120Hz spectral frequency range. The WF-CNN classifier was able to accurately identify spike transients with a reliable high-performance of 99.03 +/- 0.86%.

Using pre-clinical data from our fetal sheep models, we have shown that micro-scale EEG patterns, such as high-frequency spikes and sharp waves, evolve superimposed on a significantly suppressed background during the early hours of recovery (0-6 h), after an HI insult. In particular, we have demonstrated that the number of micro-scale gamma spike transients peaks within the first 2-2.5 hours of the insult and automatically quantified sharp waves in this period are predictive of neural outcome. This period of time is optimal for the initiation of neuroprotection treatments such as therapeutic hypothermia, which has a limited window of opportunity for implementation of 6 h or less after an HI insult. Clinically, it is hard to determine when an insult has started and thus the window of opportunity for treatment. Thus, reliable automatic algorithms that could accurately identify EEG patterns that denote the phase of injury is a valuable clinical tool. We have previously developed successful machine-learning strategies for the identification of HI micro- scale EEG patterns in a preterm fetal sheep model of HI. This paper employs, for the first time, reverse biorthogonal Wavelet-Scalograms (WS) as the inputs to a 17-layer deep-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for the precise identification of high-frequency micro-scale spike transients that occur in the 80-120Hz gamma band during first 2 h period of an HI insult.

Some neuroprotection treatments are only effective for specific, short windows of time during this evolution of injury. Clinically, we often do not know when an insult may have started, and thus which phase of injury the brain may be experiencing. To improve diagnosis, prognosis and treatment efficacy, we need to establish biomarkers which denote phases of injury. Our pre-clinical research, using preterm fetal sheep, show that micro-scale EEG patterns (e.g. spikes and sharp waves), superimposed on suppressed EEG background, primarily occur during the early recovery from an HI insult (0-6 h), and that numbers of events within the first 2 h are strongly predictive of neural survival. Thus, real-time automated algorithms that could reliably identify EEG patterns in this phase will help clinicians to determine the phases of injury, to help guide treatment options. We have previously developed successful automated machine learning approaches for accurate identification and quantification of HI micro-scale EEG patterns in preterm fetal sheep post-HI. This paper introduces, for the first time, a novel online fusion strategy that employs a high-level wavelet-Fourier (WF) spectral feature extraction method in conjunction with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier for accurate identification of micro-scale preterm fetal sheep post-HI sharp waves in 1024Hz EEG recordings, along with 256Hz down-sampled data. The classifier was trained and tested over 4120 EEG segments within the first 2 hours latent phase recordings. The WF-CNN classifier can robustly identify sharp waves with considerable high-performance of 99.86% in 1024Hz and 99.5% in 256Hz data. The method is an alternative deep-structure approach with competitive high-accuracy compared to our computationally-intensive WS-CNN sharp wave classifier.

The median survival is limited to months even for patients undergoing treatment. Radiation therapy is a main component of treatment for brain metastasis. However, radiotherapy cannot control local progression in up to 20% of the metastatic brain tumours. An early prediction of radiotherapy outcome for individual patients could facilitate therapy adjustments to improve its efficacy. This study investigated the potential of quantitative CT biomarkers in conjunction with machine learning methods to predict local failure after radiotherapy in brain metastasis. Volumetric CT images were acquired for radiation treatment planning from 120 patients undergoing stereotactic radiotherapy. Quantitative features characterizing the morphology and texture were extracted from different regions of each lesion. A feature reduction/selection framework was adapted to define a quantitative CT biomarker of radiotherapy outcome. Different machine learning methods were applied and evaluated to predict the local failure outcome at pre-treatment. The optimum biomarker consisting of two features in conjunction with an AdaBoost with decision tree could predict the local failure outcome with 71% accuracy on an independent test set (20 patients, 31 lesions). This study is a step forward towards prediction of radiotherapy outcome in brain metastasis using quantitative imaging and machine learning.

Given the subtle, mixed, and sparsely distributed brain atrophy patterns of schizophrenia, the capability of automatic feature learning makes CNN a powerful tool for classifying schizophrenia from controls as it removes the subjectivity in selecting relevant spatial features. To examine the feasibility of applying CNN to classification of schizophrenia and controls based on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we built 3D CNN models with different architectures and compared their performance with a handcrafted feature-based machine learning approach. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as classifier and Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) was used as feature for handcrafted feature-based machine learning. 3D CNN models with sequential architecture, inception module and residual module were trained from scratch. CNN models achieved higher cross-validation accuracy than handcrafted feature-based machine learning. Moreover, testing on an independent dataset, 3D CNN models greatly outperformed handcrafted feature-based machine learning. This study underscored the potential of CNN for identifying patients with schizophrenia using 3D brain MR images and paved the way for imaging-based individual-level diagnosis and prognosis in psychiatric disorders.

Thousands of medical images are produced in daily clinical activity. The diagnosis of medical doctors on these images represents a source of knowledge to train machine learning algorithms for scientific research or computer-aided diagnosis. However, the requirement of manual data annotations and the heterogeneity of images and annotations make it difficult to develop algorithms that are effective on images from different centers or sources (scanner manufacturers, protocols, etc.). The objective of this article is to explore the opportunities and the limits of highly heterogeneous biomedical data, since many medical data sets are small and entail a challenge for machine learning techniques. Particularly, we focus on a small data set targeting meningioma grading. Meningioma grading is crucial for patient treatment and prognosis. It is normally performed by histological examination but recent articles showed that it is possible to do it also on magnetic resonance images (MRI), so non-invasive. Our data set consists of 174 T1-weighted MRI images of patients with meningioma, divided into 126 benign and 48 atypical/anaplastic cases, acquired using 26 different MRI scanners and 125 acquisition protocols, which shows the enormous variability in the data set. The performed preprocessing steps include tumor segmentation, spatial image normalization and data augmentation based on color and affine transformations. The preprocessed cases are passed to a carefully trained 2D convolutional neural network. Accuracy above 74% was obtained, with the high-grade tumor recall above 74%. The results are encouraging considering the limited size and high heterogeneity of the data set. The proposed methodology can be useful for other problems involving classification of small and highly heterogeneous data sets.

In the U.S., there are about 50,000 deaths annually related to TBI, and many others are permanently disabled. However, it is currently unknown which individuals will develop persistent disability following TBI and what brain mechanisms underlie these distinct populations. The pathophysiologic causes for those are most likely multifactorial. Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been used as a promising quantitative measure for TBI diagnosis and prognosis. The recent rise of advanced data science approaches such as machine learning and deep learning holds promise to further analyze EEG data, looking for EEG biomarkers of neurological disease, including TBI. In this work, we investigated various machine learning approaches on our unique 24-hour recording dataset of a mouse TBI model, in order to look for an optimal scheme in classification of TBI and control subjects. The epoch lengths were 1 and 2 minutes. The results were promising with accuracy of similar to 80-90% when appropriate features and parameters were used using a small number of subjects (5 shams and 4 TBIs). We are thus confident that, with more data and studies, we would be able to detect TBI accurately, not only via long-term recordings but also in practical scenarios, with EEG data obtained from simple wearables in the daily life.

The efficacy of support vector machines in modelling deviations from the Beer-Lambert law for optical measurement of lactate	42ND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY: ENABLING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR GLOBAL HEALTHCARE EMBC'20	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	42nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 20-24, 2020	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc				Lactate is an important biomarker with a significant diagnostic and prognostic ability in relation to life-threatening conditions and diseases such as sepsis, diabetes, cancer, pulmonary and kidney diseases, to name a few. The gold standard method for the measurement of lactate relies on blood sampling, which due to its invasive nature, limits the ability of clinicians in frequent monitoring of patients' lactate levels. Evidence suggests that the optical measurement of lactate holds promise as an alternative to blood sampling. However, achieving this aim requires better understanding of the optical behavior of lactate. The present study investigates the potential deviations of absorbance from the Beer-Lambert law in high concentrations of lactate. To this end, a number of nonlinear models namely support vector machines with quadratic, cubic and quartic kernels and radial basis function kernel are compared with the linear principal component regression and linear support vector machine. Interestingly, it is shown that even in extremely high concentrations of lactate (600 mmol/L) in a phosphate buffer solution, the linear models surpass the performance of the other models.

The implementation of measurable residual disease (MRD) using flow cytometry (FC) is highly effective but the interpretation is time-consuming and suffers from physician idiosyncrasy. Recent machine learning algorithms have been proposed to automatically classify acute leukemia samples with and without MRD to address this clinical need. However, most prior works either validate only on a small data cohort or focus on one specific type of leukemia which lacks generalization. In this work, we propose a transfer learning approach in performing automatic MRD classification that takes advantage of a large scale acute myeloid leukemia (AML) database to facilitate better learning on a small cohort of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Specifically, we develop a knowledge-reserved distilled AML pre-trained network with ALL complementary learning to enhance the ALL MRD classification. Our framework achieves 84.5% averaged AUC which shows its transferability across acute leukemia, and our further analysis reveals that younger and elder ALL patient samples benefit more from using the pre-trained AML model.

But these new programmability abilities of networks also come with new management challenges: it is critical to quickly detect performance degradation, before they impact Quality of Service (QoS) or produce outages and alarms, as this takes part in the closed loop that adapts resources to services. This paper addresses the early detection, localization and identification of faults, before alarms are produced. We rely on the abundance of metrics available on virtualized networks, and explore various data preprocessing and classification techniques. As all Machine Learning approaches must be fed with large datasets, we turn to our advantage the softwarization of networks: one can easily deploy in a cloud the very same software that is used in production, and analyze its behaviour under stress, by fault injection.

Traditional statistical methods are significantly affected by model and parameter selection. Deep Learning has powerful data processing capabilities and does not require exact physical models and expert prior knowledge. Therefore, Deep Learning has shown a broad application prospect in the field of remaining life prediction. This paper proposes a data-driven method based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM) and Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN) for RUL estimation. Data are generated by sliding time window (TW) to the form of short-term sequences, then the data are filled into two base models in the same batch. Piecewise RUL functions are applied for label setting instead of traditional linear degradation functions. Proposed method is validated on the C-MAPSS dataset provided by NASA. Compared with similar methods, this proposed RUL prediction method has a better prediction capability.

Meanwhile, there is an emerging trend that adopts ML methods into network optimization problems, such as flow classification, traffic engineering, routing, and etc. Conventional ML methods need careful training for a specific application of a given network structure, and the trained model normally cannot be applied to other applications and network structures. In this paper, we aim to design adaptive ML methods for network optimization problems, with the trained models having the ability of being deployed to any similar problems. In particular, we consider the virtualized network function (VNF) provisioning problem as our target optimization problem. We first propose a deep Q-learning-based optimization framework for VNF provisioning in a mobile edge network with network capacity constraints, by devising an adaptive graph feature embedding method. We then propose a series of deep Q-learning based learning algorithms for the problems of service chaining and the throughput maximization, based on the proposed learning-based optimization framework. We also propose a novel design of master-slave dual neural network that enables the decisions on both cloudlet selections and routing path finding. To stabilize and accelerate the convergence of the proposed methods, we devise a novel environment generation and termination strategy and a new structure for the replay buffer. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and algorithms by extensive simulations. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods by around 12%, and the trained model in a network can be directly adapted to other network structures and settings.

Autonomous Systems in safety-critical applications require resilient operation of the intended functionality throughout the mission. Especially they must be safe and highly available. However, it is not possible to fully anticipate evolving threats, vulnerabilities and faults during the lifetime of those systems. This requires a resilient systems architecture of the autonomous system. Therefore, a thorough testing and evaluation of such systems is mandatory. In this paper, we present a monkey testing framework for evaluating resilience capabilities of autonomous systems. The framework contains a set of agents with specific role concepts and strategy sets. The framework can be applied to virtual, physical and hybrid testbeds. Due to its modularity the framework is extensible, scalable and also adaptable to different autonomous systems (e.g. mobile robot, manipulator). The monkey testing framework is able to work pseudo-randomized and thus reproducible on a connected system. A logging mechanism annotates the data so that the data can be used for machine learning (e.g. anomaly detection algorithm, self-healing). We applied the framework on a mobile robotic system in virtual scenarios.

The measurements are converted to amplitude modulated Fast Fourier Transforms that can be evaluated for power, machine and powertrain conditions. Electrical and mechanical conditions are determined through their effects on the airgap magnetic field. One of these effects includes the detection of winding shorts. It has been found in variable frequency drive and wind generation applications that stator and rotor interturn stresses can be detected prior to insulation breakdown. The application of the technology in determining these conditions allows for mitigation of the conditions surrounding the winding stress and potential breakdown.

Traditional accelerated aging experiments are performed to evaluate base dielectric materials for properties such as thermal class and the ability to withstand voltage over time. Physical models for dielectric aging have also been developed. Emulators (aka predictive models) are statistical models trained using advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to capture the input/output relationships of an underlying system or data set. Once trained, the emulator can be used in lieu of the process that generated the training data to rapidly predict outputs for arbitrary input combinations. Emulators can be created of both deterministic physics- based simulation codes and physical or experimental processes. Using a simple physical motor model, the process of building an emulator will be illustrated. This process begins with a design of experiments to select input combinations for the experimental collection of training data from the physical model. The emulator's predictive accuracy can be iteratively improved through an adaptive design process that combines knowledge of the previously conducted experiments with the emulator's ability to assess areas of greatest uncertainty in its predictions. The final validated emulator can be used for sensitivity analyses of inputs on the output(s) of interest, uncertainty propagation, and optimization. Applications of emulators include virtual sensors, predictive maintenance, calibration of physics-based simulation models, and digital twins. Avenues of application for an emulator of a motor model include predictions of motor life and dielectric failure probabilities based on dielectric and insulation material properties.

In order to ensure the high reliability and stability of the engine, accurate and effective fault diagnosis is essential. The traditional model-based fault diagnosis method is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. The emergence of neural network intelligent algorithm provides a new idea. In order to obtain a fault diagnosis system with strong robustness and high detection rate, we design a the Autoassociative Neural Network (AANN) group to complete the detection and isolation of engine sensor faults and component faults, as well as the reconstruction of sensor faults. Firstly, the signal of the sensor of the aeroengine control system was preprocessed, and then a group of AANN network was designed according to the fault parameters for multiple fault detection and isolation of aeroengine. Finally, it was verified based on the MATLAB/Simulink platform. It is worth mentioning that this method does not require a model. It can be seen from simulation results that the proposed method can effectively reduce the noise of measurement data. Moreover, it has the advantages of fast diagnosis speed, strong robustness and synchronous detection and isolation. And it can effectively detect, isolate and reconstruct the faults of aeroengine.

Based on the successful application of deep learning algorithms in the mapping of complex nonlinear systems, this paper proposes an aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis method that combines convolutional neural networks and support vector machine. Firstly, the Short-time Fourier transform is used to perform time-frequency analysis on time series signals (including nine faults and one normal) to obtain corresponding time-frequency images. Then, the convolutional neural network is used to extract the feature of the obtained time-frequency images. Furthermore, the support vector machine is used to classify and diagnose the faults from the extracted feature. Finally, based on the data set of Case Western Reserve University, the feasibility is validated. The results show that the proposed method has achieved a bearing fault recognition rate of more than 99%, which can effectively complete the fault diagnosis task.

In this scenario, the prediction of change-prone classes can be very useful in guiding the development team since it can focus its efforts on these pieces of software to improve their quality and make them more flexible for future changes. A considerable number of related works uses machine learning techniques to predict change-prone classes based on different kinds of metrics. However, the related works use a standard data structure, in which each instance contains the metric values for a particular class in a specific release as independent variables. Thus, these works are ignoring the temporal dependencies between the instances. In this context, we propose two novel approaches, called Concatenated and Recurrent, using time-series in order to keep the temporal dependence between the instances to improve the performance of the predictive models. The Recurrent Approach works for imbalanced datasets without the need for resampling. Our results show that the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of both proposed approaches has improved in all evaluated datasets, and they can be up to 23.6% more effective than the standard approach in state-of-art.

These EIs can help to provide self-awareness, and their feedback can be used in different applications, e.g. end-of-lifetime (EOL) predictions. However, inaccuracies present in data from these EIs, due to their resolution limitations, self-aging and quantization errors during digitization, can lead to an inaccurate EOL assessment. To address this challenge, a machine learning-based system-level approach for determining the EOL of a many-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) is discussed. It is based on the synchronous data capture of different IJTAG compatible EIs. To this end, two different data fusion techniques have been used for enhancing the accuracy of lifetime prognostics of multiple EIs; use is made of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the auto-encoder (AE). Different combinations of fused EIs (based on ICA and AE) along with standalone EIs for four different critical paths (CPs) have been investigated. For lifetime prediction based on different EIs/fused EIs, a data-driven degradation model was derived, and nonlinear regression has been employed for parameter estimation. Results show that data fusion of different EIs helps in obtaining better estimation of the EOL as compared to using a standalone EI.

The strategy is simple and requires only a limited number of hardware components available on most common hardware platforms for power electronics. The method is based on the computation of cross-correlation between each phase current and is simple and robust enough to be used in real-time automotive applications. The algorithm is tested with recorded data acquired from a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM) motor-load test bench used for high power Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (HEV). The experimental results sustain the applicability of the algorithm to HEVs open phase fault detection.

Although Kalman filtering techniques have proved their estimation ability with Gaussian noises, an interval approach with zonotopic sets technique has been integrated for optimal estimation of parameters with unknown-but-bounded noises. Moreover, the proposed model-based prognostics technique has been applied to a DC-DC converter described as a nonlinear dynamical system affected by degradation behaviors. Thus, the estimated degraded parameters are adopted in the RUL prediction technique that propagates the zonotopic sets until the Endof-Life (EoL) of the system. In general, the technique is split into estimation and prediction phases using Zonotopic Extended Kalman Filter (ZEKF) to deal with the nonlinearities of the system and compute the optimal observer gain. A DCDC converter case study in simulation is used to illustrate the utilized techniques and the simulation results prove the effectiveness.

Improving the efficiency of maintenance is performed by changing the work organization principle in favor of preventive maintenance according to the actual condition of equipment. This change is based on upgrading the system of diagnostic of components and mechanisms. To diagnose the condition of equipment, they implement a strategy of permanent monitoring of the actual state of components and mechanisms throughout the entire operational lifetime of equipment. The article describes the method and the order of activities that provide early warning of potential failures or emergencies of work equipment. The proposed approach significantly extenuates disadvantages of traditional maintenance methods, increasing the efficiency, reducing the costs of crashes and unplanned downtime, providing in real time non-destructive control over the state of the equipment without stopping the machines. The implementation of the method increases the productivity of service personnel and provides optimization of production asset management.

After this disastrous event, clearly far beyond our control, we were however forced to reconsider completely the physical site robustness of our building in addition to the current monitoring and alarm system capabilities. It was clear that in some specific cases, alerts should be triggered hours or days before the actual main problem arises in order to allow efficient human intervention and proper escalation process. This paradigm could be easily applied to almost all the infrastructure components in our site, mainly the electric power distribution and continuity systems as well as the whole cooling devices. For this reason, in parallel to a consistent increase in the sensor widespread distribution of our BMS data collector system, a study of a predictive maintenance approach applicability to our site has been started. Predictive maintenance techniques aims at prevent unexpected infrastructure components failures or major events with the study of the whole monitoring data collection and the creation of appropriate statistical models with the help of big data analysis and machine learning techniques. An improvement in the Power Distribution Units (PDUs) monitoring in our site and the introduction of a dedicated network of water leak sensors were the first steps for increasing the data collection information at our disposal. With sufficient monitoring statistical information stored in our BMS system a preliminary and exploratory predictive data analysis proof of concept could be constructed. This could lead to the model building phase and the creation of a prototype with the aim of forecasting future infrastructure main failure events and forthcoming error conditions. The general idea is, conceivably, an approach to the predictive maintenance model where it would be possible to introduce scheduled corrective actions for the purpose of preventing potential failures in the next future and increasing the site overall reliability.

To suppress the unbalance vibration and avoid the complicated and dangerous process of taking trial weights during the balancing process, a model-based balancing method of rotors is proposed in this paper. The rotor model is built to analyse the dynamic characteristics of the unbalance rotor, an unbalance identification method is presented and the optimization objective function of the unbalance vectors is given, then the differential evolution algorithm is employed to acquire the optimization solution. Finally, the accuracy of the rotor model is verified by modal tests, and the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in balancing experiment, results reflect its effectiveness.

The dynamics modelling of feed drives and servo system design using pole placement technique were established to support the propose method. Three conditions of linear bearings which included healthy, 50 % of lubrication oil and starved lubrication were set up. Feature extraction of the data was analyzed by statistical approach. The results explains clearly that the control system design has a performance for tracking response and the ANN model can achieved 99.7 % accuracy by using the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm.

Temperature, shear, and differential stress time-series data acquired through piezo-resistive silicon-based stress sensors on multiple electronic packages inside a thermal shock chamber were monitored, recorded, and subsequently analyzed by various neural network models to create a better understanding and prediction of the delamination progress. Monitoring stress changes via continuous observation of material stiffness and interface integrity as factors influencing the local boundary conditions on chip cells, conveys pivotal information concerning the degradation progression. Deep neural networks empowered by backpropagation were trained to predict the stress distributions and ultimately monitor the degradation based on time-series data and were subsequently assessed for their performance to reliably predict in-plane stress developments and distributions on chips. In this study, long-short-term-memory- and gated-recurrent-unit-based networks could accurately predict the behavior of a single chip with smallest error.

The data is provided by a variety of sensors that monitor the equipment, but the same data is used by the controllers that control the equipment. The deterministic functioning of the controllers which are typically run on multicore platforms is critical for certification purposes. The problem is then that the collection of the PHM data should interfere the least with the controllers operation. In this work, we implement a testbed using a quad-core ARM-based multi-core platform and report experimental results on the impact of the PHM data handling on the communication delay and execution delay of the critical controller tasks. We also provide insights about the system behavior.

A prominent example is condition-based monitoring and especially its subdomain fault diagnosis. The integration of advanced machine and deep learning-based signal processing into sensor systems enables new intelligent condition monitoring solutions. However, the data-based nature of machine and deep learning methods still impedes their applicability in many cases, due to a severe lack of data. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid physics- and data-based framework aiming to solve the issue of small datasets for vibration-based fault diagnosis applied to rolling-element bearings. The framework combines a vibration simulation model and a neural network with embedded physics-based knowledge into a physics-guided neural network. Our approach aims to generate physically consistent data for the training of fault classifiers without extensive data acquisition.

Firstly, the wavelet packet energy entropy of the three-phase voltage and current at the grid coupling point is obtained by wavelet packet decomposition. Use the wavelet packet energy entropy as the original feature parameter. Then use dynamic principal component analysis to obtain sensitive feature parameters and reduce the complexity of data processing. Finally, the improved support vector machine is used to train sensitive feature parameters to obtain a classification model and construct a microgrid fault diagnosis system. A microgrid model was established in PSCAD to test the method. The results show that the method can effectively improve the accuracy of microgrid line fault diagnosis.

Inspired by the fact that experienced inspectors can detect the failure of GIS only by sound, this paper proposes a novel framework for mechanical fault diagnosis based on sound classification. We extract the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) features from the input sound signal and make an improvement to adapt to the underlying features of the GIS's sounds. Using machine learning, we classify the extracted features with a support vector machine (SVM) to obtain a model of mechanical fault diagnosis of GIS based on sound signals. We outperform the traditional MFCC features by a significant margin, especially when the input sound signal is disturbed by noises. The F1-score can be increased by 2.47% to 21.59% with the change of the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.

However, the diagnosis methods have limitations in learning from imbalanced fault dataset, especially in the case of a severe uneven distribution. The research interests, how to establish a suitable model for the imbalanced fault diagnosis, are drawing a great deal of attention. In this paper, a novel one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D CNN) model based on cost sensitive learning is proposed to be employed for transformer fault classification. Firstly, the structure of 1D CNN is designed with three hidden layers and two fully connected layers. Then, a class-dependent cost matrix is introduced into the soft-max function, which can modify the training process of the posed cost sensitive 1D CNN (CS-1D CNN), so as to pay more attention on the minority classes. Moreover, the PSO algorithm is adopted to optimize cost matrix for the CS-1D CNN. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by case studies on a real-world fault dataset. The results reveal that the CS-1D CNN model has improved the accuracies of the minority fault classes and thus the overall accuracy of the whole dataset.

Nevertheless, transforming large volumes of high-resolution PMU measurements into actionable insights remains challenging. A central challenge is creating flexible and scalable online anomaly detection in PMU data streams. PMU data can hold multiple types of anomalies arising in the physical system or the cyber system (measurements and communication networks). Increasing the grid situational awareness for noisy measurement data and Bad Data (BD) anomalies has become more and more significant. Number of machine learning, data analytics and physics based algorithms have been developed for anomaly detection, but need to be validated with realistic synchophasor data. Access to field data is very challenging due to confidentiality and security reasons. This paper presents a method for generating realistic synchrophasor data for the given synthetic network as well as event and bad data detection and classification algorithms. The developed algorithms include Bayesian and change-point techniques to identify anomalies, a statistical approach for event localization and multi-step clustering approach for event classification. Developed algorithms have been validated with satisfactory results for multiple examples of power system events including faults and load/generator/capacitor variations/switching for an IEEE test system. Set of synchrophasor data will be available publicly for other researchers.	[Sajan, K.

Safety standards emphasize the use of formal analysis in CPS development processes. Performance degradation assessment and estimation of lifetime of energy storage (electric batteries) are vital in supporting maintenance decisions and guaranteeing CPS reliability. Existing formal analysis techniques mainly focus on specifying energy constraints in simplified manners and checking whether systems operate within given energy bounds. Leading to overlooked energy features that impede development of trustworthy CPS. Prognostics and health management (PHM) estimate energy uncertainty and predict remaining life of systems.

New Enabling Technologies, Big Data, Sensor Networks, Embedded Computing, Machine Learning are changing industries, company processes and people. For companies it is important to be flexible to perceive these changes and be ready to upgrade their structure and process. In this paper we propose a retrofitting methodology based on Design Thinking in a steel mill plant, and highlight how the retrofitting activity is important to allow even more companies to migrate to Industry 4.0, reducing the gap between SMEs and Large Industries for participation in the 4th Industrial Revolution. The solutions implemented will be described mostly in regard to machinery interfacing by OPC for data acquisition, image processing for anomaly detection, and information visualization for human-machine interaction. This paper stresses the need for cooperation between the operators in the design process and the synergy between machineries-things-people inside the production plant. The main contribution of this work makes evident how a XX century production machinery can be upgraded by solving specific problems, how this can be done with a viable financial investment and with an improvement in the experience and involvement of workers. The final upgrade will allow the plant to increase efficiency and decrease machinery fault, which was causing a loss in terms of human experience and financials costs.

One effective method is to introduce diagnostics instruments providing detection and isolation of faulty components in real-time operating mode. It is clear that synthesizing diagnostic devices for complex systems consisting of a large number of functional nodes requires more analytical and hardware redundancy. In this paper, model-based fault detection and isolation method for digital electronic systems is considered. A mathematical model of these systems is described as a network of digital machines.

Yet the lack of labeled data, such as normal versus faulty operational status, has slowed the application of machine learning to HVAC systems. In addition, for any particular building, there may be an insufficient number of observed faults over a reasonable amount of time for training. To overcome these challenges, we present a transfer methodology for a novel Bayesian classifier designed to distinguish between normal operations and faulty operations. The key is to train this classifier on a building with a large amount of sensor and fault data (for example, via simulation or standard test data) then transfer the classifier to a new building using a small amount of normal operations data from the new building. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept for transferring a classifier between architecturally similar buildings in different climates and show few samples are required to maintain classification precision and recall.

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques.

Data are becoming a valuable asset for aircraft operators. Sensors measure and record thousands of parameters in increased sampling rates. However, data do not serve any purpose per se. It is the analysis that unleashes their value. Data analytics methods can be simple, making use of visualizations, or more complex, with the use of sophisticated statistics and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. Every problem needs to be approached with the most suitable and less complex method. In MRO operations, two major categories of on-wing data analytics problems can be identified. The first one requires the identification of patterns, which enable the classification and optimization of different maintenance and overhaul processes. The second category of problems requires the identification of rare events, such as the unexpected failure of parts. This cluster of problems relies on the detection of meaningful outliers in large data sets. Different Machine Learning methods can be suggested here, such as Isolation Forest and Logistic Regression. In general, the use of data analytics for maintenance or failure prediction is a scientific field with a great potentiality. Due to its complex nature, the opportunities for aviation Data Analytics in MRO operations are numerous. As MRO services focus increasingly in long term contracts, maintenance organizations with the right forecasting methods will have an advantage. Data accessibility and data quality are two key-factors. At the same time, numerous technical developments related to data transfer and data processing can be promising for the future.

In particular one type is called 1/f noise and is not fully understood. In the time domain, the signal has a random noise appearance. However, in the frequency domain, the spectrum goes as 1/f in intensity at low frequencies. Noise issues, of course occur at all frequencies. In reviewing the literature, we note that 1/f noise in particular seems to be strongly related to aspects in materials that can be interpreted in terms of degradation in materials (i.e. disorder). In this paper we describe some key aspects of 1/f noise found in the literature and discuss how observations relate to generated entropy. We conclude from the literature the 1/f noise region is of paramount importance to observing subtle degradation occurring in materials. In fact, we find that active degradation is the root cause of 1/f noise in materials. We then use a thermodynamic frame work to help interpret our view. We model the 1/f spectral region using an entropy model. We suggest two models. Results help to provide a broader understanding of 1/f noise, identify the region of the spectrum related to the onset of degradation, and show how it can be used to do prognostics. Experiments are suggested to demonstrate how 1/f noise measurements can be used as a prognostic tool for reliability testing to identify and predict degradation over time.

The malfunction of batteries may cause failure in operations of the entire system. Thus, the health management of the batteries, such as the determination of the operating conditions and replacement intervals, is essential in order to ensure the normal functioning and operations of the entire system. The battery health indicators built on effective health monitoring can be integrated into a prognostic model such that the batteries will be operating within the design limits to meet expected performance and safety requirements. Entropy, which originated as a concept in physics and thermodynamics, has been widely used to measure the regularities and uncover the uncertainties of stochastic processes. Different entropy measures have been introduced since Shannon presented the first definition of entropy, including Permutation entropy, Renyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, Approximate entropy, and Sample entropy. In this study, we assess various entropy measures of short voltage sequences of multiple lithium-ion batteries under different testing conditions. Then a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is employed to model the relationship between the battery capacities and various entropy measures of battery voltages. Numerical results reveal that the entropy measures are effective estimators of battery capacity loss and the proposed SVM-Entropy-based model is capable of predicting the battery capacity fade with high accuracies.

We aim to optimize simultaneously the jobs sequence and maintenance actions to minimize the total cost of the considered production system. Since the machine parts are subject to several failures during the production, the maintenance actions are either to imperfect repair or replacement, taking into considerations that parts' imperfect repair do not make these parts as good as new. The manufacturing system's cost includes the machine's parts repair or replacement cost, and the penalty if the jobs completion time exceeds a predefined threshold. We assume that the lifetime of the machine's parts has a Weibull distribution. We study a machine cutting tool and engine among others. We consider that the failure of the cutting tool decreases the product's (job) quality, and this product (job) needs to be restarted processing after the imperfect repair or replacement of the tool. For this part, we consider an age-based threshold; if the tool has failed before the threshold, the maintenance action is imperfect repair; otherwise, the tool is replaced by the new one. One of the model objectives is to find the optimal value of this threshold. If the engine fails during the processing of the job, the maintenance action is imperfect repair. The failures of the engine have no effect on the product quality; thus, the product process resumes after engine imperfect repair. The tool and engine imperfect repairs affect the life distribution parameter (scale parameter of Weibull distribution, theta), but tool replacement makes the tool as good as new and presents a mathematical model with the aim of minimizing the total production cost when the system is subject to these two-failure modes. Since the lifetime of the machine's parts follows a Weibull distribution, we use a Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the jobs' completion time and the system's total cost. Job scheduling and maintenance planning problems are NP-hard problems, so we use a Genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the presented model.

The approach produces a more accurate time-to-failure and system reliability, including better applications to prognosis and health management. A MATLAB simulation was designed to model the PoF of a particular multi-component system, where the underlying degradation failure mechanisms served as the coupling common cause failure mechanisms (CCCFM). The simulator developed to test this Common Cause Physics of Failure (CCPoF) model was demonstrated using a two-component system. The simulator required identification of failure mechanisms, where the temperature-based failures CCCFM Arrhenius life-stress model served as an example. The simulator randomly generated realizations of CCCFM component failure times and the time of failure of the system itself. Finally, the traditional timebased beta factor common cause failure (CCF) model and system failure probability were obtained for comparison to the CCPoF approach. This simulation procedure was repeated for several levels of ambient temperature to determine any relevant trends and findings. A comparison of the CCPoF-based simulation of this system's reliability with the various forms of the beta factor parametric CCF models shows that the PoF-based common cause failure has many advantages. The parametric CCF model has broad applications and is comparatively simple to use but it is time-independent (i.e., CCF probability is the same throughout life). By contrast, the CCPoF model is more complex but can account for the time dependency of the CCF beta factor when considering aging and degradation in components. However, the CCPoF model is limited to use with specific failure mechanisms that cause aging and degradation. The CCPoF model simulation itself was able to extract several relevant results, including inferred trends from the relationships between mission time, the CCCFM temperature, the CCF beta factor, and system failure probability. (1) The CCF beta factor demonstrated power correlation to the CCCFM defined in the CCPoF approach, (2) at lower CCCFM temperatures significant differences between CCPoF and parametric system failure probability were more noticeable at early mission life than later in life, but (3) at high CCCFM temperatures, this difference was more significant later in mission life. The CCPoF model simulation provided an outline on how to apply a PoF approach to system reliability analysis with CCF consideration. This approach may be applied to other more complex systems and PoF models, such as three-component systems under fatigue and other CCF methods.

In a manufacturing system, machine is the key component. The dynamic and precise identification of the healthy state of the machine can support the decision making of production operation. In this paper, since the propagation of unqualified products will lead to the deterioration of machine's processing accuracy, quality of imported products is considered to be an important factor affecting machine's performance. Considering this practical scenario, a non-homogeneous Poisson process is applied to model the number of quality failures in a manufacturing system, and the log-normal distribution is used to depict the impact strength of unqualified products to a machine.

As part of an ongoing research project, we investigate the ability of Machine Learning to contribute to error prediction in noisy measurements using various preprocessing methods. We focus our efforts on drift-based error patterns and chose several well-established approaches from quality-assurance literature as potential preprocessors for three different Machine Learning methods. We compare the performance of these methods in predicting machine failures, using data based on realistic measurements taken from a supply line in an automotive factory. We further expose the tested methods to different levels of noise and evaluate the performance in detail for drift patterns of varying severity.

As a generator it is particularly attractive to be used in offshore wind turbines where reliability improvement and maintenance cost reduction are the key factors in wind power market growth. As a motor it can be utilized in application requiring adjustable speed operation. Inter-turn short circuit fault is one of the most frequent electrical faults in electric machines, which can also be the cause of other stator winding faults in the machine, hence its early detection can significantly reduce the maintenance cost and improve reliability. In this paper a novel fault detection method for inter-turn short circuit fault is proposed for the BDFIM based on the discrete wavelet transform of the stator winding currents. The analytical winding function method as well as the finite element analysis of an experimental D180 BDFIM is used in order to verify the proposed fault detection method.

In this context, the use of emergent ICT technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning and augmented reality, allows to develop smart and predictive maintenance systems, contributing for the reduction of unplanned machines' downtime by predicting possible failures and recovering faster when they occur. This paper describes the deployment of a smart and predictive maintenance system in an industrial case study, that considers IoT and machine learning technologies to support the online and real-time data collection and analysis for the earlier detection of machine failures, allowing the visualization, monitoring and schedule of maintenance interventions to mitigate the occurrence of such failures. The deployed system also integrates machine learning and augmented reality technologies to support the technicians during the execution of maintenance interventions.

Predictive analysis is commonly implemented with data analytics and machine learning techniques. Usually, the usage of such tools requires knowledge of the machine learning theory and the subject to be studied, e.g. a pumping process. This paper presents a case study on modeling of a pumping process using stored automation data. The model is trained to predict the performance percentage of the process with minimal background knowledge of the process and data analytics. The proposed model is built with IBM SPSS Modeler, a data analysis tool not usually used in real-time industrial predictive analysis as it is not often considered the best tool when working with time series data. The model is deployed in a cloud service to implement a real-time, visualized predictive analysis system. The case study shows that Modeler can be used for data analysis, modeling, and production purposes. Depending on the case, Modeler can provide an alternative tool compared with typical machine learning tools, as models built with Modeler can be deployed into a cloud service for production use. The findings indicate that industrial automation data are a valuable resource, and data analysis can be conducted on various platforms and tools.

Since the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) strengthens the industries with a wide range of advanced applications such as digital twin and predictive maintenance, a large number of devices and systems are deployed densely near machines in a factory floor. Such new devices and systems, along with the existing systems, are networked by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) wirelessly for their functioning. Devices closer to machines have a greater probability of interference from the operation of the machine. Since the operation of machines in a factory are often scheduled, their impact on wireless communication can be learnt and predicted. The first step towards it is, to estimate the effect of various processes in a factory schedule on wireless communication. This research empirically investigates the extent and nature of the impact of factory schedules and presents its findings. The obtained results indicate that the machines influence the packet reception rate (16% on an average), positively for certain nodes while negatively for others. Furthermore, based on these findings, this paper categorizes the factory schedules into two broad categories ('Macro' and 'Micro' processes) and discusses the challenges in developing a mechanism to detect and classify them. The interference detection and identification can have applications such as scheduling delay-tolerant traffic and adjusting power levels while transmitting a packet apart from increasing reliability of IIoT.

The traction system of high-speed train is complex and the operating conditions are variable, resulting in different fault severity and fault type, which is difficult to detect. And, most of the fault detection methods are based on the time series of traction motor, and few are based on the symbol sequence. This paper presents a probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA)-based fault detection method for traction motor of high-speed trains. Three-phase current of traction motor is first converted into a symbol sequence via symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX). PFSA model is constructed to represent the symbol sequence, and state transitions in the model are described through D-Markov machine. The state transition counting matrix of PFSA model is used to detect the occurrence of faults. The proposed method is tested on a benchmark of the traction motor of a high-speed train. Through the simulation results, it is verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To diagnose simultaneous faults of gearbox and bearing in rotating machinery under different working conditions, an improved algorithm based on cohesion-based feature selection and improved back-propagation multi-label learning (BP-MLL) is proposed in this paper. Cohesion evaluation technique is applied to construct a low-dimensional feature vector by selecting high sensitivity parameters in a high-dimensional vector from time and frequency domain. Improved BP-MLL neural network algorithm considers correlation between labels and adopts ReLU as activation function. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, hardware experiments are conducted on wind turbine drivetrain diagnostics simulator (WTDDS) for simultaneous fault diagnosis. The experiment reveals that the proposed method can achieve better results than conventional methods under six performance evaluation metrics.

PD has no cure, and an impediment to developing a treatment is the lack of any accepted method to predict disease progression rate. The primary aim of this study was to develop a model using clinical measures and biomechanical measures of gait and postural stability to predict an individual's PD progression over two years. Data from 160 PD subjects were utilized. Machine learning models, including XGBoost and Feed Forward Neural Networks, were developed using extensive model optimization and cross-validation. The highest performing model was a neural network that used a group of clinical measures, achieved a PPV of 71% in identifying fast progressors, and explained a large portion (37%) of the variance in an individual's progression rate on held-out test data. This demonstrates the potential to predict individual PD progression rate and enrich trials by analyzing clinical and biomechanical measures with machine learning.

In a context where the product complexity becomes ever greater and the product life-cycle is always shorter, the use of intelligent tools for supporting all phases of the product life-cycle is very important. One of the aspects that is taking interest is to support the consumer in fault management. This analysis are well-known practices in the industrial, automotive fields, etc. but less used for consumer electronics. This paper analizes a Cloud service based on a Machine Learning (ML) approach used to provide fault detection capabilities to household appliances equipped with electric motors and compare the results with on premise ML algorithms provided research tools. The purpose of this paper is to perform a preliminary comparison of ML algorithm performances provided by two software, namely Microsoft Azure (cloud solution) and MATLAB (on premise solution), on a study case. In detail, the vibration data of an asynchronous motor installed in an oven extractor hood for commercial restaurant kitchen have been analyzed. To this end, two classification algorithms have been selected to implement fault diagnosis techniques.

With respect to this aim, this paper adopts shared-leg fault tolerant operation for a 5-channel three level neutral point clamped back-to-back power converters (3L-NPC) serving to a typical 250 MW doubly-fed induction machine (DFIM) unit. Under open switch fault condition, faulty leg is identified and isolated with the help of normalized phase current average fault diagnosis method. Thereafter, grid side converter (GSC) and rotor side converter (RSC) share a common leg to deliver the required power to the rotor circuit of DFIM. For this effective operation, double zero-sequence signal is computed and injected into vector control strategy for independent control of GSC and RSC. Furthermore, shared-leg current capability, converter output voltage capability, dc-link voltage oscillations and its thermal performance are analyzed during fault tolerant operation. From the observed test results, two operating conditions are proposed: (i) reduced real power delivery by adjusting speed of hydraulic turbine and (ii) rated real power delivery by absorbing reactive power from the grid. To examine and demonstrate the proposed methodology MATLAB/Simulink2014A tool is used for a 250 MW DFIM unit. An experimental demonstration is performed with 2.2 kW DFIM unit.

Condition monitoring of SiC devices in SiC-based power converters addresses the reliability issues by providing an early sign of potential failure. One of the most consistent failure precursors of degraded SiC MOSFETs is an increase of gate leakage current. This paper presents a method of condition monitoring the SiC MOSFETs with an external circuit that indirectly estimates the gate leakage current during operation. Experimental results obtained with a prototype circuit validate the analysis and method. Reliable information can be obtained for condition monitoring at various duty ratios, dc-link voltages, and load currents in the test setup. With proper calibration, this method opens opportunities to perform prognostic and health monitoring of SiC devices using the estimated on-state gate leakage current.

In order to improve the accuracy in estimating the SOH of a battery, a new method based on empirical mode decomposition sample entropy (EMDSE) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed in this paper. Compared with the tradition SE-based method, EMD is used to filter the noise of the original signal. Then the EMDSE as a new feature is used for the SVM training, and the potential relationship between the SOH and the EMDSE is established. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.

In order to improve tolerance to common cause fault, heterogeneous redundant design, where different implementation approaches are taken for realizing the same logic functionality, is crucial. However, manual redundant design tends to place a burden on designers, reducing productivity of system development. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a systematic heterogeneous redundant design approach for finite state machines on FPGAs, focusing on the diversity of state encoding methods. With this approach, designers can easily combine the state machines with different encoding to form heterogeneous redundancy, by inserting simple directives into RTL source code. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, timing analysis of post-layout netlists is performed under an overclock situation as an example of common cause fault. The evaluation results demonstrate the proposed approach improves the error detection rate compared to conventional homogeneous redundant designs. It is also discussed how the choice of state encoding methods impacts the error detection rate.

As an effect, the data-driven-based fault diagnosis methods are designed by integrating signal processing techniques along with artificial intelligence methods. Various signal processing approaches have been proposed for feature extraction from vibration signals to construct the fault feature space, and thus, over the years, the feature space has increased rapidly. Also, the challenge is to identify the promising features from the space for improving diagnosis performance. Therefore, in this paper, wavelet energy is presented as an input feature set to the fault diagnosis system. In this paper, wavelet energy is utilized to represent the multiple faults for reducing the requirement of number features, and therefore, the complex task of feature extraction becomes simple. Further, the convolutional autoencoder has assisted in finding more distinguishing fault feature from wavelet energy to improve the diagnosis task using extreme learning machine. The proposed method testified using two vibration datasets, and decent results are achieved.

The key to achieving it is to effectively predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the core components of the device. With the development of integrated circuit and sensor technique, data-driven approaches show good potential on RUL prediction. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach with CNN-BiLSTM network for RUL prediction, Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract local features and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to make full use of the sensor date sequence in bidirection. After that, the attention layer is used to focus our attention on the most critical features. The comparison experiments on public data sets show that the model proposed in this paper effectively improves the accuracy of life prediction.

The reasons lay in several motivations, among which the product/process data availability. This is paramount in supporting product tracking and tracing, feeding optimization applications, enabling sophisticated maintenance approaches and in monitoring resources and energy consumption in a sustainability perspective. While the setup of "green field" implementations is usually easier and well defined, problems arise when there is an existing system with physical shop-floor devices, applications and on-going production processes that cannot be disturbed or interrupted, and need to be interfaced. This paper is aiming to define an implementation strategy and a system architecture able to upgrade an existing production system to "Industry 4.0 compliant" status, keeping into account features and characteristics of said system, and applications without direct intervention (software or hardware) on the system and without perturbations of any on-going business. The proposed AI40A (Additive I40 Architecture) is structured on three basic components of: Data collection, Data transfer and Condition detection and trend forecasting. Each component and submodule can be relocated individually on physical servers, cloud or edge computing virtual machines, based on availability or resources, computational needs or security reasons. As proof of concept, a prototype of the Additive Industry 4.0 Architecture that is implemented in Industry 4.0 Lab (I4.0Lab) of the School of Management of Politecnico di Milano in Bovisa (Milano) Campus will be shown. Two industrial applications are currently deployed on top of it: Production Rescheduling on Condition and Prognostic Maintenance based on Condition Regression with AR (Augmented Reality) support.

In view of this problem, text mining technology is used to extract fault problems and causes from fault cases to form the causal relationship of faults, so as to provide necessary conditions for the next step of fault text mining. This system uses the method of text clustering for fault location and auxiliary research. First of all,do the segmentation of fault information and processing scheme, in this step, the Chinese word segmentation is carried out by using the Jieba word segmentation tool. Secondly, it is necessary to clean the segmentation results and build a corpus. Thirdly, in order to represent the corpus as the type that the computer can calculate the similarity, we need to transform the corpus into frequency matrix. And then instead of using traditional k-means clustering algorithm to cluster, we use the calinski_harabaz score to evaluate the best value of K. Finally, we put this model into application in actual production, build the fault information and solution mapping table.

Despite recent advances in important domains such as device health maintenance and manufacturing process, the conventional architecture does not offer a satisfactory solution for rapidly providing data models, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge. In this work, we employ ideas from distributed network based on digital twins and from recent advances that augment artificial intelligent with big data. Our architecture provides a paradigm that uses a distributed network makes computer programming, software, and data spread out across more than one terminal, but communicate complex messages through terminal nodes, and are dependent upon each other, obviating the pressure from master station. We demonstrate the usefulness of digital twins that are used to track the performance of devices such as transformer during normal operation to detect possible defects and fix them before they result in failure. We also conclude that using digital twin technology will understand, predict, and optimize performance in order to achieve improved business outcomes, and apply machine learning and knowledge to predict the future.

Degradation processes of long-lifetime equipment generally possess slow time-varying characteristics, leading to difficulties in analyzing memory effects among the entire life-cycle. Under the influence of multisource stochastic factors including external environments, internal conductions, and information transmissions, there may exist certain time delay in the condition monitoring data. To overcome these limitations of traditional data-driven prognostic methods, we construct a hybrid degradation model by introducing two layers of state dependencies as well as finite time delay. An additive combination of Markovian and non-Markovian diffusions is also applied to extend the scope of applications in complex processes. The unknown parameters are estimated by a wavelet estimator and a maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, and then the distribution of remaining useful life (RUL) can be derived analytically on the basis of a mild transformation. A simulation study fully examines the advantages of the proposed theoretical scheme.

Management of an individual or groups of structures requires a systematic approach such that reliability and condition could be maintained within both budget and resource availability. This means maintenance and inspection activities should be planned optimally to ensure operation of structures is safe and economical. Hence, methodologies surrounding the modelling and analysis of data representing the time until the occurrence of an event become crucial to asset managers. This study uses the Explicit Hazard Model (EHM) to demonstrate the modelling of hazard, reliability and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of naval structures using a quasi-experiment. Amongst the existing covariate-based hazard models, EHM is selected as this model jointly utilises three available asset health data including failure event data, condition data and operating environment data in the modelling effort which provides effective outcomes. The hazard and reliability estimate of these structures using EHM are compared to the traditional Weibull model. Results show that the individual's hazard and reliability closely follow the population's hazard and reliability. The predicted RUL of these structures using EHM is compared to the actual RUL. Results validate the performance and accuracy of this model in reliability and RUL calculation of engineering assets.

However, there is a lack of research in the identification of causal relationships among data. These associations of cause-effect are important since they allow root causes to be analysed, they highlight the most influential process variables and they embed a typical human reasoning model that is largely applied in manufacturing. Compared to knowledge-based approach, data driven causal discovery (DCD) enables causal modeling without overloading expert operators and scales faster. However, DCD is challenging to be applied especially in small-medium enterprises where machines raw data are stored without the support of specialized data analyst team. In this work, we aim to automatically reconstruct the causal interaction model of the production flow from raw data. We use PCMCI, a constraint-based causal discovery algorithm, that handles both linear and nonlinear relationships in time series. We validate our method on a synthetic realization that emulates manufacturing features and on real data with domain expert support. The obtained results confirm that PCMCI is able to recognize more than 50% of causal relationships without any false positives. The application of the PCMCI method in an ultra-processed food manufacturer allows to propose a novel causal interaction model integrating data-driven and expert's knowledge.

Most of these methods focus on the diagnosis of fault data with the same distribution in a single domain, but pay poor attention to the diagnosis of cross-domain fault data with different distributions. To address this problem, this paper firstly integrates the fault datasets from eight universities into a cross-domain dataset. A new model named one-dimensional improved LeNet-5 (1D ILeNet-5) is proposed for cross-domain fault diagnosis. One-dimensional convolutional operation is used for feature extraction and batch normalization technique is introduced to accelerate the network convergence in this model. The effectiveness and generalization performance of this method are verified using the aforementioned cross-domain dataset. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art transfer learning model with fewer parameters and shorter training time.

In recent years, the deep learning techniques greatly improve the fault detection accuracy, but there still remain some problems. If one fault is absent in the training data or the fault signal is disturbed by severe noise interference, the fault classifier may misjudge the health state. This problem limits the reliability of the fault diagnosis in real applications. In this paper, we enhance the fault diagnosis method by using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN). A Shannon entropy-based method is presented to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The BCNN turns the deterministic predictions to probabilistic distributions and enhances the robustness of the fault diagnosis. The uncertainty quantification method helps to indicate the wrong predictions, detect unknown faults, and discover the strong disturbances. Then, a fine-tuning strategy is applied to enhance the model performance further. The potential usability of the proposed method in monitoring the motors of 3D printers is studied. And the experiment is conducted on a motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The proposed BCNN achieves 99.82% fault classification accuracy over nine health conditions. Its robustness is verified by comparing the testing accuracy with three other methods on the noisy datasets. And the uncertainty quantification method successfully detects the outlier inputs.

System condition monitoring through Bayesian change point detection using pump vibrations	2020 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (CASE)	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	AUG 20-21, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE				This paper presents a method for vibration analysis and a simple test bench analogue for the solder pumping system in an industrial wave-soldering machine at a Siemens factory. A common machine fault is caused by solder build-up within the pipes of the machine. This leads to a pressure drop in the system, which is replicated in the test bench by restricting the flow of water through the use of a gate valve. The pump's vibrational response is recorded using an accelerometer. The captured data is passed through a Bayesian Change point Detection algorithm, to detect the point at which the change in flow rate affects the pump, and thus the machine output. This information can be used to isolate the vibrational response indicative of the machine fault, which can then inform maintenance procedures.

The proposed method combines simplified human auditory functionalities with machine learning, aiming to model in a more biologically plausible way. It includes primarily using cochleagram to extract useful time-frequency information in sound signals -representing the cochlea filtering properties in human hearing. Then, a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory layers is constructed to learn and classify the cochleagrams for fault diagnosis - this is to incorporate memory elements in temporal information processing. The proposed method is validated with an experimental study on bearing fault diagnosis using acoustic measurements, while the developed machine hearing scheme could be beneficial to many industrial fault diagnosis applications, e.g., for aeronautical, automotive, marine, railway and manufacturing industry.

The reducer in the robot arm is one of its important components but with the highest failure rate. The reducer is a complex system including input shaft, output shaft, gears and bearings, etc. When the reducer starts to be damaged, performance of the robotic arm will be affected, and even worse the system shut down and the production efficiency might be induced, to name only a few. Therefore, how to extend the useful life of the reducer has become an important issue. In general, the clamping jaws (grippers) are installed on the 6th axis in charge of the loading and unloading, which will inevitably higher the reducer failure rate than that of the other 5 axes. Therefore, this research aims at the useful life optimization of the 6th axis reducer. The machine learning algorithms were adopted to establish methodologies to find the key factors. In addition, since the movement path of the robot arm determines the life of the reducer, multiple paths with the same starting and ending position will be generated through the forward and reverse processing, and then the RMSF (Root Mean Squares of Features) values of various paths are calculated. The optimal path with the optimum useful life of the reducer will be the one with the minimum RMSF value. This study has successfully shown that significant differences exist among the various movement paths based on the healthy and abnormal data from the cooperated reducer manufacturing company. This means the developed methodology could be used as an helpful index to extend the useful life of the reducer and also to serve as the basis in futuristic predictive maintenance system.

However, most wafermaps have no special spatial patterns and are full of noises, which make pattern recognition difficult. Specially, recognizing scratch and line types of defect patterns is a challenging problem for process and test engineers and it takes a lot of manpower to identify such patterns, as potential defective dies may exist on the scratch contour and become discontinuity points. However, such potential defective dies may suffer from latent and leakage faults, which usually deteriorate quickly and need to be screened by burn-in test to improve quality. A possible solution is to locate the obscure defective dies in potential scratch patterns and mark them as faulty. As a result, the quality and reliability of products can be significantly improved and cost of final test can be reduced. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology to search for potential scratch/line defect types in wafers. A five-phase method is developed to enhance wafermaps such that automatic defect pattern recognition can be carried with high accuracy. Experimental results show the proposed method can achieve more than 89% prediction accuracy for scratch/line types, and higher than 94% for all common wafer defect types.

However, labeling recorded data is expensive and challenging, while unlabeled samples are available abundantly and contain significant information about motor conditions. In this paper, a graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) approach using both labeled and unlabeled data is proposed. Experimental data for two 0.25 HP induction motors under healthy and faulty conditions are used. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is employed to extract features from recorded stator current signals. Three GSSL algorithms (local and global consistency (LGC), Gaussian field and harmonic function (GFHF), and greedy-gradient max cut (GGMC)) are evaluated in this study, and GGMC shows superior performance over other two. They are also compared with a supervised learning algorithm, support vector machine (SVM). As induction motors often operate under variable loadings, curve fitting equations are developed based on experimental data to generate training data for untested motor loadings.

A significant portion of that budget is spent on resolving faults diagnosed in the system that disrupt or degrade cellular services. Historically, the operations to detect, diagnose and resolve issues were carried out by human experts. However, with diversifying cell types, increased complexity and growing cell density, this methodology is becoming less viable, both technically and financially. To cope with this problem, in recent years, research on self-healing solutions has gained significant momentum. One of the most desirable features of the self-healing paradigm is automated fault diagnosis. While several fault detection and diagnosis machine learning models have been proposed recently, these schemes have one common tenancy of relying on human expert contribution for fault diagnosis and prediction in one way or another. In this paper, we propose an AI-based fault diagnosis solution that offers a key step towards a completely automated self-healing system without requiring human expert input. The proposed solution leverages Random Forests classifier, Convolutional Neural Network and neuromorphic based deep learning model which uses RSRP map images of faults generated. We compare the performance of the proposed solution against state-of-the-art solution in literature that mostly use Naive Bayes models, while considering seven different fault types. Results show that neuromorphic computing model achieves high classification accuracy as compared to the other models even with relatively small training data.

Generally, to make this process automatic, state-of-theart methods use machine learning techniques to analyze data collected from either Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) or from devices in Access Network. In contrast to the existing methods, this paper utilizes network traffic data collected from multiple static Broadband Network Gateways (BNGs) which are core network devices at Network Service Provider (NSP). To automatically detect anomalies in BNG traffic data, a new framework is proposed which consists of three steps: data acquisition, feature extraction, and modeling anomalies using a random forest-based framework. The proposed method is compared with state-of-theart methods and the results show the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

An essential function to achieve self healing is the ability to determine when a network is operating outside of normal state, and perhaps identify potential causes. This paper focuses on applying the supervised machine learning approach to detect fault symptoms and identify the cause. Our method utilizes referenced signal received power (RSRP) reported by users over a certain period of time to detect operational anomaly in a base station. We notice that certain faults at a base station create noticeable change in the RSRP readings and recognizable electromagnetic radiation pattern around the base station. To achieve fault analysis, we develop a framework that differentiates normal and abnormal operations under changing environment to avoid unnecessary fault alarms. Once abnormal operation is detected, the framework uses a supervised machine learning system to classify the detected fault. We develop convolutional neural network and random forest to test the fault classification. We show that both machine learning systems offer high accuracy.

Additional relevant silicon-based sensors require additional software, test cases, and product costs. In this paper we argue that the cost/benefit balance has shifted towards having more sensors with the advent of telemetry mechanisms to carry the sensor readings and machine learning facilities to low-overhead anomaly detection models and resources. The choice of the sensors to use and their association to high-level function-related sensors has demonstrated that silicon-based sensors in system components add important value on top of high-level function-related sensors, such as root cause analysis; early failure prediction, and system reliability prediction.

Firstly, the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is adopted to decompose the original multi-component signals into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMF). Secondly, the envelop energy entropies of these IMF components are calculated as signal features. Finally, establishing the optimal support vector machine (SVM) classifier by particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Using this EWT-PSO-SVM model to identify the unknown samples, the results show that the EWT method can effectively reduce modal aliasing problem, and the recognition rate of EWT-PSO-SVM model is higher than EMD-PSO-SVM model, these results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed EWT-PSO-SVM fault diagnosis method.

In medical field, machine learning algorithms are being used for prediction, early detection and prognosis of various diseases. These algorithms suffer a certain threshold due to their inability to handle large amount of data. Deep learning based techniques are emerging as efficient tools and can easily overcome the above difficulties in processing data related to medical imaging that includes mammographs, CT scans, MRIs and histopathology slide images. Deep learning has already achieved greater accuracy in early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases especially in cancer. Dysplasia is considered to be a pathway that leads to cancer. So, in order to diagnose oral cancer at its early stage, it is highly recommended to firstly detect dysplastic cells in the oral epithelial squamous layer. In our research work, we have proposed a deep learning based framework (convolutional neural network) to classify images of dysplastic cells from oral squamous epithelium layer. The proposed framework has classified the images of dysplastic cells into four different classes, namely normal cells, mild dysplastic cells, moderate dysplastic cells and severe dysplastic cells. The dataset undertaken for analysis consists of 2557 images of epithelial squamous cells of the oral cavity taken from 52 patients. Results show that on training the proposed framework gave an accuracy of 94.6% whereas, in testing it gave an accuracy of 90.22%. The results produced by our framework has also been tested and validated by comparing the manual results recorded by the medical experts working in this area.

Data from these EIs can be used in applications like end-of-lifetime (EOL) predictions. However, inaccuracies present in the data from these EIs, due to their self-aging and resolution limitations during digitization, can lead to an inaccurate EOL assessment. In this paper, it is presented that in the presence of such inaccuracies from EIs as well as correlation between EIs, principal component analysis (PCA) based data-fusion approach for determining the EOL of selected critical paths provided overall better EOL predictions as compared to EOL predictions based on standalone EIs. Verification was performed with a commercial software-based EOL predictor tool ARULE running on a personal computer. Moreover, the presented results on the computational requirements for the presented data-fusion approach showed little overhead in terms of memory, execution time and energy requirements.

To combat this shortcoming, features from time, frequency, wavelet and statistical domain have been fused to construct ultimate fault features of the circuit. Data fusion has been performed in two steps, data whitening and Principal component analysis (PCA). The fused features are used to train SVM classifier for fault diagnosis of analog circuits. The proposed method is illustrated with the example of Sallen-Key band pass filter circuit and four OpAmp biquad high pass filter circuit. The accuracy of fault classification of the proposed method with fused features is found considerably higher than that with individual domain features.

Indeed, the degradation of IGBT can be caused by several factors (electrical, thermal and mechanical stresses,aging, ... ). This degradation can be assessed in relation to the variation of the internal resistance of the IGBT. Likewise, we determined the remaining useful life (RUL) of the IGBT compared to the variation of its internal resistance and the duty cycle of the IGBT control signal, which are both estimated in this paper.

For an ideal operational rotating system, bearing assumes an indispensable part. Once a catastrophe happens, it will cause gigantic budgetary incidents and even safety hazards. Therefore, it is required to execute a performance assessment and state prediction adequately. Roused from the ongoing works and progress outline, we propose a one-step-ahead prediction strategy in light of the support vector regression analysis over a degradation indicator. From the obtained signal, time-domain feature was computed with the usage of ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) strategy and further categorized through k-means. The categorization procedure creates the clusters and healthy data cluster has been taken as the reference for degradation indicator calculation. The same has been anticipated utilizing support vector regression (SVR) with one-step-ahead strategy. The outcomes showed the proficiency is at standard and impressively higher than existing strategies.

It is therefore necessary to diagnose bearing faults at early stage. Vibration signals are contaminated with noise. To minimize the effect of noise, Walsh-Hadamard transform is used for feature extraction. Statistical features from coefficients are calculated to form feature vector. Mutual information a type of feature ranking method is used to select most informative feature and subsequently to reduce size of feature vector. Coefficients from healthy and faulty bearings at different rotational speeds were calculated from signals. Statistical features are calculated from the acquired signals with different speeds. Two different classifiers like support vector machine and artificial neural network have been used for finding the accuracy.

For the perfect operational rotating system, bearing assumes a key responsibility. Once a calamity happens, it will cause huge budgetary episodes and even security threats. Proper fault diagnosis of the rolling element bearings will put a check on all such issues. In the past, several fault diagnosis strategies have been implemented and found effective due to the involvement of signal decomposition. A proper choice of decomposed modes may extract vital information and evidence on fault type, location, and condition. Inspired by the same fact, the work proposes statistical criteria for mode selection in the vibrational mode decomposition method utilizing entropy and covariance parameters. The criteria have been validated on a test signal sample gathered over bearing with inner race failure. The illustration proves the promising nature of the method which makes the method superior till date.

In the mining industry, Load Haul Dumper (LHD) is one of the major production equipments generally utilized as an intermediate level technology-based transportation system. LHDs are prone to uneven modes of multiple failures/breakdowns due to harsh operating environmental conditions. This leads to a decrease in the performance of the equipment and increases the maintenance cost, the number of unplanned outages (downtime), as well as loss of production levels. This can be controlled by adequate prediction of machine failures through root cause analysis (RCA). In the present investigation, a well-known fault prediction technique, i.e., failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) was utilized to identify the modes of potential failure, causative factors and recognize the effects of these failures on performance and safety. The risk-based numerical assessment was made by prioritizing the failure modes through the risk priority number (RPN) model. The criticality of failure was estimated using RPN values. They are calculated by the product of risk indexed/ruled parameters [severity (S), occurrence (O) and detection (D)]. Further, an attempt has been made to suggest suitable remedial actions to reduce or eliminate the various potential failures.	[Balaraju, J.; Raj, M. Govinda; Murthy, Ch S.

Fault Pattern Recognition in Power Distribution Integrated Network with Renewable Energy Source	2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RENEWABLE ENERGIES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (REDEC)	International Conference on Renewable Energies for Developing Countries		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Renewable Energy for Developing Countries (REDEC)	JUN 29-30, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK			Fault Classification; Local polynomial approximation; Renewable energy sources; Support vector machine		The challenge with most developing countries is to maintain a reliable and sustainable electricity supply. This has a depleting effect on the economic development of most states. In order to reduce the impact of energy shortages, there has been an extensive attempt to use renewable energy sources to generate electricity. There are however technical challenges of integrating the existing power system grid with the renewable external sources. These challenges include adequate power system protection, energy security, and reliability of external sources. In this paper, we investigate the fault pattern recognition and detection in a power distribution grid integrated with the wind energy source. A reduced Eskom 22kV and wind power energy source integrated is modeled using MATLAB/Simulink. From the integrated model, various types of power systems faults are generated. We further investigated the use of local polynomial approximation (LPA) for signal decomposition and support vector machine (SVM) for fault classification and detection. We also tested the performance of the naive Bayes classifier. In this paper, a hybrid technique based on LPA and SVM is proposed for fault pattern recognition and detection in a power distribution integrated system with the wind energy source. The proposed method was further tested using machine learning platforms WEKA and Orange. The results of the classifiers gave the accuracy of between 98 and 99 %.	[Moloi, K.; Hamam, Y.; Jordaan, J.

By exploiting observability data, AIOps enable detection of faults and issues of services. The focus of this work is on detecting anomalies based on distributed tracing records that contain detailed information of the services of the distributed system. Timely and accurately detecting trace anomalies is very challenging due to the large number of underlying microservices and the complex call relationships between them. We addresses the problem anomaly detection from distributed traces with a novel self-supervised method and a new learning task formulation.

C	Chen, KC; Gao, ZJ			IEEE	Chen, Kun-Chih (Jimmy); Gao, Zi-Jie			Integrated Group-based Valuable Sensor Selection Approach for Remaining Machinery Life Estimation in the Future Industry 4.0 Era	2020 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON VLSI DESIGN, AUTOMATION AND TEST (VLSI-DAT)	International Symposium on VLSI Design Automation and Test		English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)	AUG 10-13, 2020	Hsinchu, TAIWAN					Industry 4.0 is the evolution trend for current manufacturing technology. By analyzing the real-time sensing data, the health status of each machinery is usually monitored to reduce the risk of suddenly machine failure. Although massive sensors allocation can leverage the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation for each machinery, the cost for the sensor network construction will become expensive. Hence, it is necessary to have an approach to remove the redundant sensors under a certain constraint of RUL estimation. On the other hand, due to the attractive performance on the object classification, many researches apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to decide which allocated sensor should be removed during the training process. However, the current researches aim to remove the redundant sensors based on the sensing data at a specific time, which lacks the intrinsic feature of time-series sensing data. Therefore, the current researches suffer from the problem of sensor under-killing due to the worst-case consideration. In this paper, we consider the information of time-series sensing data to propose an integrated group-based valuable sensor selection algorithm. Because the proposed approach considers the historical data during the redundant sensor removing process, we can reduce the number of involved allocated sensors precisely and significantly. In order to verify the proposed method, we use the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset and adopt Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) score to evaluate the RUL estimation performance. Compared with the conventional approach, the proposed approach can reduce 86% average PHM score and employ fewer sensors to fit the strict constraint of PHM score with less computing overhead.

While autonomous vehicles may not be totally ready now, ADAS has been applied to many vehicles. The implementation of ADAS partly relies on detection of vehicles via edge computing. However, the edge computing hardware may age and incur functional errors. Soft errors may also be caused due to cosmic charged particles. These errors may invalidate the vehicle detection result, thereby incurring serious safety threats. In this paper we investigate on designing a cost-effective reliable edge computing circuit. A case study on vehicle detection is considered where a support vector machine is implemented for illustration purpose. We find that in edge computing hardware, several multiplier-accumulator (MAC) units can be removed without sacrificing detection accuracy. A simple yet effective procedure is also proposed to identify such MAC units. The saved hardware can then be utilized to protect the remaining hardware, reducing the required hardware cost. Numeric fault simulations are first performed to identify which circuit lines need to be protected such that there is no loss on the vehicle detection accuracy due to faults. Then, for these lines, proper protection methods are investigated based on evaluation of their required hardware cost and fault-induced accuracy loss. Accordingly a hybrid protection scheme is developed, which achieves up to 153% hardware cost reduction when compared to the typical TMR-based protection method.

This is the case of the ball bearing diagnostics in direct-drive motors. Direct-drive motors are brushless motors fully controlled by the drive system. Thanks to an encoder or a resolver mounted on the shaft, they can perform complex motion profiles, such as polynomials or splines, including reverse rotation of the shaft. The main advantage of direct-drive motors is the removal of cams or gearboxes afterwards motor with a consequent strong reduction of economic and maintaining costs. Indeed, their main drawback is the difficulty to make diagnostics on the bearings. Regarding bearing diagnostics, most of the techniques present in literature are based on the search of fault-characteristic frequencies in the vibration spectrum of the motor. These fault frequencies are linearly dependent on the rotational frequency of the shaft if it is supposed constant. However, in direct-drive motors the rotational speed changes continuously and consequently the fault frequencies are meaningless. The paper reports a brief overview of some techniques for the condition monitoring of ball bearings in non-stationary conditions used by the Authors in the case of a packaging machine working under variable speed. The techniques adopted include an improved version of the computed order tracking, the cross-correlation function and three supervised learning approaches: artificial neural networks, artificial immune systems and support vector machines.

The system is based on the real time sub-cycle time (mini-term) monitorization and how the mini-term variability can be used as a fault detection indicator. Mini-terms and micro-terms were introduced in our previous work as a machine subdivision. A mini-term subdivision can be selected by the expert team for several reasons, the replacement of a machine part or simply to analyze the machine more adequately. (A micro-term is a component from a mini-term and it can be as small as the user wishes. Mini-terms are able to detect the same physical deterioration phenomenon than common sensor but with an important advantage, it is easy and cheap to install. It is cheap because do not require any additional hardware installation to measure the sub-cycle time, just use the PLC and sensors installed for the automated production process, and easy because only requires to code extra timers into the PLC. Mini-terms are nowadays implanted at Ford factories around the world where a learning process is established to enrich the knowledge of the system. The system detects change points and sends an e-mail to the maintenance workers. They repair the machine and report the pathology detected to the system. Real cases are shown at the end of the paper.

Wind turbines are complicated and expensive systems whose operating signals are converted into high dimensional data for health management. This signal-to-data conversion involves a variety of constraints that produces an imperfect dataset as an output. In recent years, many semi-supervised learning approaches were developed to detect faults in a wind turbine preemptively. In this paper, we propose a workflow to detect faults based on two hot research topics in data science: (a) automatic feature selection; and (b) semi-supervised classification for fault detection. The multi-objective optimization framework Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was adopted to select a subset of features and hyperparameters to perform the semi-supervised fault detection using both a Soft-Label and a Binary support vector machine (SVM). Our experiments were carried out using a dataset containing unlabelled records of 5 2.0MW wind turbines. We discuss the results from NSGA-II based on the trade-off between the number of selected features and the detection performance. We also select the algorithm configuration that achieved the best savings by predicting a faulty system before its collapse.	[de Sa, Fernando P.

A High-Accuracy of Transmission Line Faults (TLFs) Classification Based on Convolutional Neural Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						fault detection; fault classification; transmission lines; convolutional neural network; machine learning		To improve power system reliability, a protection mechanism is highly needed. Early detection can be used to prevent failures in the power transmission line (TL). A classification system method is widely used to protect against false detection as well as assist the decision analysis. Each TL signal has a continuous pattern in which it can be detected and classified by the conventional methods, i.e., wavelet feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN). However, the accuracy resulting from these mentioned models is relatively low. To overcome this issue, we propose a machine learning-based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the transmission line faults (TLFs) application. CNN is more suitable for pattern recognition compared to conventional ANN and ANN with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) feature extraction. In this work, we first simulate our proposed model by using Simulink (R) and Matlab (R). This simulation generates a fault signal dataset, which is divided into 45.738 data training and 4.752 data tests. Later, we design the number of machine learning classifiers. Each model classifier is trained by exposing it to the same dataset. The CNN design, with raw input, is determined as an optimal output model from the training process with 100% accuracy.

In order to establish an efficient thalassemia prognosis process, the practitioners suggest using complete blood count (CBC) report. Based on CBC report, practitioners often use professional experience and domain knowledge to discover the cause and relevant risk factors. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this research is the first that uses machine learning techniques to accurately classify and predict thalassemia patients using the parameters of CBC report. WBC, RBC, HB, HCT, Platelets and an additional parameter Ferritin (Iron) are the selected parameters for the experimentations. The experimental analysis of the results show that RBC, HB, and Ferritin (Iron) plays a vital role in the establishment of an efficient thalassemia prognosis process.

Real-time monitoring of machine health condition not only improves machine throughput by reducing unplanned downtime caused by machine failure but also saves cost for unnecessary routine maintenance. This paper presents a systematic approach for real-time or near real-time machine performance monitoring solution development from data collection, feature extraction, data analytics to real-time machine fault and machine status classification. Three data-driven machine-learning approaches using one vibration sensor data are proposed to detect two common machine failure modes during machine turning process. To evaluate the the performance of each approach, three machine-learning algorithms (Random Forest, K Nearest Neighborhood, and Support Vector Machine) are implemented and tested. Evaluation results on the actual machine data shows that a two-layered classification structure with random forest algorithm as the base has high classification accuracy on the machine status including machine fault detection. The developed data-driven machine health monitoring solution is deployed in the IoT device for real-time data collection and processing and results are sent data server for data visualization.

In this paper, local support vector machine (LSVM) is used as an attitude monitoring method for condition recognition of delta 3D printers. To reduce the cost of the experiment, a cheap nine-channel attitude sensor was installed on the printer's mobile platform to monitor the printer's working status. The attitude data of 13 fault types and 1 normal condition under different working conditions were collected to analyze its diagnosis of health conditions. To improve the fault classification performance, locality preserving projections (LPP) was adopted for dimensionality reduction and to obtain a feature space by using all the channels dataset from attitude sensor. To this end, the support vector machine was adopted for fault-diagnosis modeling. For comparison, the attitude monitoring data of each channel is adopted for model training and testing. Furthermore, peer methods such as KLPP and NPE were used for fault diagnosis with the same data. The results indicated that multi-information attitude monitoring with LSVM was effective for condition recognition of delta 3D printers.

In faulty cases, the stator current presents amplitude and phase modulation (AM - PM) leading to sideband frequency components in the current spectrum. The characteristics of these modulations depends on the electrical and mechanical parameters of the drive, on the fault frequency and on the operating point. The knowledge of these properties mean helpful information for the definition of a detection scheme. A full analytic approach is then proposed to predict the faulty stator current behavior. This theoretical analysis is based on the state space representation of the induction machine and allows expressing the frequency variation law of the sideband components for a given drive.

Usually, the original condition monitoring data will be transformed into representative features that are of lower dimensionality, followed by the application of a classifier. However, most time-domain and frequency-domain features cannot provide good representations of non-stationary signals that are very common in machine faults. This research solves this problem by applying a Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract the time frequency features. Subsequently, a feed-forward artificial neural network is used as a method for fault diagnosis and classification. A railway switch system is used as a specific application in this research to validate the method using data from a field switch system. Features of the scale coefficients are then extracted using DWT for the 'Haar' wavelet type at decomposition level 9. Subsequently, the feature data are split into training, validation and testing sets, with each set containing one input feature and one corresponding desired output fault severity. After training and testing using a two-layer neural network, it is shown that in this case the switch overdriving fault with different severities could be diagnosed with 100% accuracy.

The aim of this survey is to provide a comprehensive review of published articles in the field of machine health monitoring performed with the machinery fault simulator (MFS). This survey will offer directions and recommendations for researchers who have MFS machines in their laboratories; moreover, it will also serve as a motivation for those who are thinking to obtain it. We have classified the literature into different topics and listed all papers with experimental results obtained from using the MFS machines. Misalignment, vibration, unbalance, shaft cracks, bearing faults, gearbox faults, Motor and variable frequency drive faults are some examples of elements studied in literature.

Firstly, a roughly classifying method for the health stage of rotating units based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree is performed. The Peak-Difference-Vectors of multi-sensor vibration signals in time and frequency domain are extracted as fault features. Secondly, for the failure development processes, which signals have similar features, the fault severity index is built to quantify the trend of failure and distinguish different stages on fine-scale. The validity of the proposed method is verified with 5 processes for each of 9 large rotating units in real industrial scenarios. The best model achieves 99.5% accuracy for rough classifying health stages. Besides, the fine-scale prognosis achieves 100% accuracy for the determination of malfunctioning machinery and the division of health stages. This work highlights the promise of capturing the early symptom of rotor faults and predicting the failure of the rotor component in terms of few fault cases, changeable working conditions and interference of other unknown faults.

Therefore, the ability to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of solenoid valves is highly desirable. In this paper, a novel data-driven RUL prediction methodology for solenoid valves is proposed, by training deep neural networks on images constructed from raw current signatures. The performance is compared to shallow machine learning algorithms, trained on features which are obtained using domain expertise on the valves. We show that an ensemble of CNN subnetworks (constructed by the AdaNet algorithm) achieves a predictive performance comparable to the feature -based approaches (p = 0.584 for linear regression, p = 0.321 for Gradient Boosted Regression Trees). By focusing on reducing the modeling effort required for constructing features and fixing neural network architectures, this study offers a new and promising approach for solenoid valve prognostics, and thus even more complex systems in the future.

However, durability and cost are two principle barriers to take PEM fuel cell into wide commercial use. The discipline of prognostics and health management (PHM) tends to help against this problem. PHM aims at deploying predictive maintenance and anticipating degradation mitigation strategies for PEM fuel cell. This paper focuses on the prognostics of PHM and an adapted data-driven fuel cell prognostics approach based on multiplicative feature decomposition and echo state network is proposed to predict the fuel cell degradation behaviour under dynamic operation conditions. Experimental data is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The physical signals measured can be of various kinds. In the particular case of rotating machines, vibration monitoring based on accelerometer readings undeniably dominates the market. However, other physical measurements may reveal faulty behavior. This paper is interested in obtaining monitoring indicators based on the measurement of the instantaneous speed of a machine. Just like the monitoring of electric current, acoustic, thermal and sound emissions, the analysis of the instantaneous speed offers a new angle of view on the behavior of the machine and has already proven itself in the first cases. The sensor used to obtain this signal is most often an incremental encoder. There are various technologies available, from the robust and inexpensive phonic wheel, to high-resolution optical encoders, or else zebra tape glued on a shaft... The aim of this paper is to study the influence of the quality of an encoder on the ability of the monitoring indicators that will be deduced from it to detect defects of all kinds.

The prediction of RUL is influenced by many sources of uncertainty, and it is required to quantify their combined impact by incorporating the RUL uncertainty in the optimization process to minimize the total maintenance cost. In this work, predictive maintenance of a multi-functional single machine problem is adopted to study the impact of RUL uncertainty on maintenance planning. Therefore, the PSO algorithm is integrated with a random sampling-based strategy to select a sequence that performs better for different values of RUL associated with different jobs. Through a numerical example, results show the importance of optimizing maintenance actions under the consideration of RUL randomness.	[Benaggoune, Khaled; Mouss, L.

Therefore, bearing fault diagnosis and prognosis become difficult since the purpose is to extract robust features able to detect the appearance of faults, monitoring the degradation of health state and to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearing. The aim of this paper, is to propose a method for bearing faults feature-extraction using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and autogram analysis. First, times domain features are applied for the raw vibration signal. Then, the selected features are computed to will be analyzed as one of the characteristics that describes the degradation of state system. After that, the curve fitting (smoothing) is applied to normalize the amplitude of the irregular values relatively to others feature values. The calculated value of acquired signal cannot be smoothed or calculated three or more times, hence ANFIS intervenes for modeling the transfer from an indeterminate input to a more relevant value for monitoring the fault evolution. Then, the output of ANFIS estimates the days of acquisition and predict the RUL of bearing. Finally, the autogram analysis is used to identify the degraded element in the bearing.

Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA), as a classic type of deep learning method, has been successfully used to learn effective representations for machine fault diagnosis. However, those previous studies always encounter with the inherent limitations of SDA: high computational cost, time-consuming training, and lack of scalability to high-dimensional data. Unfortunately, those limitations can restrict the applicability of those studies in real-world applications, which require timely model upgrade and fast real-time diagnosis. Besides, most previous studies concentrate on the vibration signal, and thus lack the attention towards other kinds of sensor data like acoustical signal. Therefore, to address the two problems above, inspired by the marginalized Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (mSDA), we adopt a variant of SDA for fast fault diagnosis on sound signal. In this way, the required stochastic gradient descent based on back propagation in traditional deep learning methods is replaced by a forward closed-form solution. Opposite to the time-consuming works which demand training thousands of parameters during optimization, this deep architecture only needs to determine a few hyper parameters in advance. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal on sound signal, extensive empirical evaluation on a publicly available sound signal dataset of gear fault is carried on. Thorough comparisons with some state-of-the-art faulty diagnosis approaches, confirm the superiority of the proposal in high diagnostic accuracy and lower computational cost.

They need to be paid a particular attention for diagnosis and maintenance to avoid mechanical system failures which in turn leads to severe equipment damage, economic losses and human life annoyance. According to the literature, the ball bearings remains a sensitive and critical component. To efficiently diagnose the related defects, it requires the development of particularly accurate and sensitive methods contrarily to Inner Race, Outer Race or Cage faults which can be evaluated more easily. From this point of view, this work will be devoted to first the detection of Ball Faults (BF) with different severities. For this purpose, a database provided by the Case Reserve Western University (CWRU) is used. The proposed methodology is based on a particularly tuned EMD-KLD solution to create the features to be used in the fault classification. An Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) procedure decomposes the original vibration signals into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Using a statistical analysis evaluation, the most relevant ones are selected and then the Kullback-Libeler Divergence (KLD) is computed for creating the features. The most appropriate learning system is finally studied as a comparative classification study using three prevalent techniques namely: Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAG SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT).

Conversely, the increased occurrences of natural disasters and epidemics necessitate the provision of contingency equipment, to readily surge for responsive support. Long term storage presents a more cost-effective approach to own, maintain and operate such military or civil equipment. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning have fueled interest in equipment prognosis and proactive predictive maintenance to enable prognostics and health management (PHM). However, this is not prevalent in the domain for equipment under long term storage. This could he attributed to slower, and possibly different degradation modes, coupled with lack of large data sets for prognosis in the storage scenario. In this paper, we explore the use of multi-output Gaussian Process (MOGP) regression, on lithium ion battery units in storage, under various state-of-charge and temperature conditions, and discuss empirical effects of training data selection and test data parameters on the accuracy of the residual storage life (RSL) prediction. This will pave way for the development of RSL prediction methods for equipment fleet under storage, considering the scenario of limited or no knowhow of the degradation model.

Vibration Analysis Methods for Misalignment and Tolerance Problems in Machine Systems: A Review	ADVANCES IN MATERIAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING	Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Mechanical, Manufacturing and Plant Engineering (ICMMPE)	NOV 14-15, 2018	Melaka, MALAYSIA			Vibration analysis; Misalignment; Tolerance	NONLINEAR VIBRATION; FAULT; BEARING; DIMENSION; DESIGN	Misalignment and tolerance are the most common causes of vibrations in machines. An optimum value of tolerance and alignment are desired for a smooth and clear machine process, but difficult to achieve due to manufacturing, assembly and working constraints of the mechanism. Vibration analysis is a study of repetitive motion, in a certain time interval, which involves mathematical modelling, formulation of governing equations and interpretation of vibration response. Misalignment and tolerance incompliance can result in numbers of failures and safety issues, especially formanually operated machines. These problems need to be diagnosed by using vibration analysis for different purposes such as fault detection, vibration response, research and early prevention. This paper provides an insight into the different available methods and fundamentals of vibration analysis that were used to study these issues in a different situation.

It holds and guides moving parts of the machine and reduces friction and wear. As they are one of the riskiest components in the rotating machinery, it puts challenges on the bearing health condition monitoring. The defects found in the bearings can lead to malfunctioning of the machinery and impact the level of production. This paper presents detection technique and diagnosis of bearing defects using a novel hybrid approach (continuous wavelet transform, Abbott-Firestone parameter, and artificial neural network). The vibration signals were obtained from Case Western Reserve University. MATLAB is used to analyse the vibration signals, test, and train the required models according to the chosen model structure. Various statistical features are extracted from the time domain namely kurtosis, skewness, root mean square, standard deviation, crest factor, and Abbott parameters to analyse and identify the bearing fault. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in identifying the bearing faults.

This precludes obtaining evert art approximate real-time view of sensed information across LP-WAN devices over a large area, say in the event of a disaster, fault or simply for diagnostics. This paper presents QuAiL(1), a system that provides a coarse aggregate view of sensed data across LP-WAN devices over a wide area within a time span of just, one LP-WAN packet. QuAiL achieves this by coordinating multiple LP-WAN radios to transmit their information synchronously in time and frequency despite their power constraints. We design each client's transmission so that the base station can retrieve an approximate heatmap of sensed data, by exploiting the spatial correlation of this data across clients. We further show how our system can be optimized for statistical and machine learning queries, all while maintaining the security and privacy of sensed data from individual clients. Our deployment over a 3 sq. km. LP-WAN deployment around CMU campus in Pittsburgh demonstrates a 4x faster information retrieval versus the state-of-the-art statistical methods to retrieve the spatial sensor heatmap at a desired resolution.

Industrial process automation with autonomous fault detection and prediction, optimised operations and proactive control can be considered as one of the key verticals of 5G and beyond. Such applications enable equipping industrial plants with a reasoning sixth sense for optimised operations and fault avoidance. In this direction, we introduce an inter-disciplinary approach integrating wireless sensor networks with machine learning-enabled industrial plants to build a step towards developing this sixth sense technology, i.e., the reasoning ability. We develop a modular-based system that can be adapted to the vertical-specific elements. Without loss of generalisation, exemplary use cases are developed and presented including a fault detection/prediction scheme in a wireless communication network with sensors and actuators to enable the sixth sense technology with guaranteed service load requirements. The proposed schemes and modelling approach are implemented in a real chemical plant for testing purposes, and a high fault detection and prediction accuracy is achieved coupled with optimised sensor density analysis.

The bearings are important and often damaged part of different rotor equipment. But the diagnostics of bearings is usually rather difficult. In the paper various methods of diagnostics of bearings are observed. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. The authors have invented a diagnostics method using strain gauge analysis with spectral analysis of forces in supports of equipment. This method creates an alternative option for a classical method of vibration diagnostics. The experimental study of a proposed method applied to the bearings diagnostics was made. Defected and defect-free bearings were tested. The spectral analysis of forces for both cases was made and a defected bearing was identified.

The method can extract the feature by using the nonlinear high-dimensional mapping of the kernel function, and can deal with the nonlinear data. The method of feature extraction and fault diagnosis based on kernel nonnegative matrix factorization is given. The results of nonnegative matrix factorization, principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis and kernel nonnegative matrix factorization are compared by UCI data. The application of rolling bearing in practice shows that the method is suitable for the extraction of fault features for equipment, and effectively overcomes the shortcomings of nonnegative matrix factorization and principal component analysis, and can improve the fault diagnosis performance.

This paper studies the extraction method of fault sample features and the optimization method of SVM parameters, and proposes a new intelligent fault diagnosis method based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize SVM. Firstly, KPCA is used to extract the nonlinear features between the sample data, reduce the data complexity, extract the high-dimensional information of the sample data, and extract the non-linear principal component as the input sample of SVM. Secondly, PSO optimization algorithm is used to optimize the penalty factor and the kernel function parameters of SVM. Finally, the optimized SVM model is used to identify the reconstructed samples.

J	Khan, S; Farnsworth, M; McWilliam, R; Erkoyuncu, J				Khan, Samir; Farnsworth, Michael; McWilliam, Richard; Erkoyuncu, John			On the requirements of digital twin-driven autonomous maintenance	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL			English	Review						Digital twin; Autonomous systems; Maintenance; Fault detection and isolation; Reinforcement learning	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; PERSPECTIVES; TECHNOLOGIES; PROGNOSTICS; AUTOMATION; CHALLENGES	Autonomy has become a focal point for research and development in many industries. Whilst this was traditionally achieved by modelling self-engineering behaviours at the component-level, efforts are now being focused on the sub-system and system-level through advancements in artificial intelligence. Exploiting its benefits requires some innovative thinking to integrate overarching concepts from big data analysis, digitisation, sensing, optimisation, information technology, and systems engineering. With recent developments in Industry 4.0, machine learning and digital twin, there has been a growing interest in adapting these concepts to achieve autonomous maintenance; the automation of predictive maintenance scheduling directly from operational data and for in-built repair at the systems-level. However, there is still ambiguity whether state-of-the-art developments are truly autonomous or they simply automate a process. In light of this, it is important to present the current perspectives about where the technology stands today and indicate possible routes for the future. As a result, this effort focuses on recent trends in autonomous maintenance before moving on to discuss digital twin as a vehicle for decision making from the viewpoint of requirements, whilst the role of AI in assisting with this process is also explored. A suggested framework for integrating digital twin strategies within maintenance models is also discussed. Finally, the article looks towards future directions on the likely evolution and implications for its development as a sustainable technology.

Collinearity is inevitable in industrial operation data. Therefore, we focus on latent variable methods that achieve dimension reduction and collinearity removal. We present a new dimension reduction expression of state space framework to unify dynamic latent variable analytics for process data, dynamic factor models for econometrics, subspace identification of multivariate dynamic systems, and machine learning algorithms for dynamic feature analysis. We unify or differentiate them in terms of model structure, objectives with constraints, and parsimony of parameterization. The Kalman filter theory in the latent space is used to give a system theory foundation to some empirical treatments in data analytics. We provide a unifying review of the connections among the dynamic latent variable methods, dynamic factor models, subspace identification methods, dynamic feature extractions, and their uses for prediction and process monitoring. Both unsupervised dynamic latent variable analytics and the supervised counterparts are reviewed. Illustrative examples are presented to show the similarities and differences among the analytics in extracting features for prediction and monitoring.	[Qin, S.

Vibration-based techniques have been successfully applied in reciprocating engines to assess the condition of the machines and detect faults. Dealing with turbocharged engines, methodologies based on the employment of accelerometer signals to obtain an estimation of the turbocharger rotation have been proposed with the aim of using the instantaneous turbocharger speed for the engine function monitoring. The present article focuses on the analysis in time and frequency domains of the vibration signals from the compressor housing of a medium- duty, four-cylinder, turbocharged common rail diesel engine aimed at indirectly evaluating the turbocharger speed in terms of its mean component and fluctuation. Data have been acquired during experimental tests at different values of engine speed and torque. The comparison between the estimations and the direct turbocharger speed measurements demonstrated the ability of the developed methodology to track the speed fluctuation due to the exhaust process for each cylinder. This allows the methodology to be used in combustion control algorithms to detect any variation of the combustion process as regards the regular running and to detect if cylinder-by-cylinder inhomogeneity arises in the engine real-time operation.

Turner syndrome, also known as congenital ovarian hypoplasia syndrome, is a common clinical chromosomal disorder. Without the aid of cytogenetic diagnostic results, the accuracy of diagnosis made by the paediatrician is unsatisfactory. Early diagnosis of the Turner syndrome requires the expertise of well-trained medical professionals, which may hinder early intervention due to a high potential cost. So far, most of the studies have reported the use of clinical chromosome detection to diagnose Turner syndrome. In this research, we are the first to use facial recognition technology to diagnose Turner syndrome using ensemble learning techniques. First, the features from each of the facial image are extracted by principal component analysis, kernel-based principal component analysis, and others. Second, we randomly selected samples and features to establish a basic learning model. Finally, we developed a combination of multiple basic learning models using majority voting and stacking for the facial image classification task. Experimental results show that the correct classification rate of the Turner syndrome detection was elevated up to 88.1%. The proposed method can be implemented to automatically diagnosis Turner syndrome patients that can facilitate clinicians during the prognosis process.

J	Dong, LC; Liu, Y; Tang, H; Du, Y				Dong, Liangcai; Liu, Ying; Tang, Hong; Du, Yi			Bearing Data Model of Correlation Probability Box Based on New G-Copula Function	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Correlation; Random variables; Data models; Vibrations; Fault diagnosis; Probability distribution; Measurement uncertainty; Bearing failure; copula function; correlation probability box; support vector machine; classification	FAULT-DETECTION; UNCERTAINTY; DIAGNOSIS; DEPENDENCE; FAILURE; RISK	Bearing failure often occurs in rotating machinery. Fault diagnosis method based on vibration signals has been studied for many years. Considering complementary information of the vibration signals from different directions, this article proposed an applied model of a correlation probability box based on G-Copula function for diagnosing bearing faults. First, to avoid constructing binary Copula function directly from the definition of binary Copula function, a new function is defined, and a construction method of binary G-Copula function is proposed based on the new function. Then, the correlation probability box model is established based on a joint cumulative distribution of the G-Copula function to increase the independent of the input data in the support vector machine (SVM) model, and the aggregated widths of the correlation probability box model can be used to monitor a development of the bearing failure. Finally, the experimental results showed that the proposed method obtain the better classification accuracy than other data processing study.

Remaining serviceable life indicator of bearing	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on NanoTechnology - Ideas, Innovation and Industries	DEC 12-14, 2019	Anna Univ, Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Anna Univ, Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Artificial intelligence; Data driven method; Bearing fault diagnosis; Neural network; Predictive maintenance; Machine learning		Bearings are an indispensible component of motor driven system used in industries. Most of the problems arising in motor driven system are due to bearing faults. Hence, motor driven system is generally diagnosed by diagnosing bearing faults. Planned maintenance approaches are used in most of the industries which increases maintenance cost and machine down time. Whereas Predictive maintenance approaches are used in recent days in industries to decrease maintenance cost and machine down time. Predictive maintenance approaches have the ability to maximizing remaining serviceable life (RSL) of the industrial components. In this work a novel method of combining machine learning (ML) algorithm and recurrent neural network (RNN) is proposed for prediction of bearing RSL Firstly, bandpass filter with Envelope Spectrum method is used to extract important features to identify faults in bearing. Finally, from the important features a new derived feature is applied into RNN to predict bearing RSL. Two bearing data sets which include experimental dataset and industrial dataset are applied to verify performance of the proposed work. The result shows that the proposed work which combines ML algorithm and RNN produces satisfactory prediction of bearing RSL. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Ravi, V.

Detection and prognosis of diabetes based on data science techniques	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on NanoTechnology - Ideas, Innovation and Industries	DEC 12-14, 2019	Anna Univ, Syed Ammal Engn Coll, Ramanathapuram, INDIA		Anna Univ, Syed Ammal Engn Coll	Diabetes prognosis; K-nearest neighbours; Support vector machine; Decision tree; Gradient boost; Random forest	MELLITUS; POPULATION	Diabetes is such a complicated disease that it is not just chronic but damages the blood glucose processing system of human body also. This requires a regular medication. As per International Diabetes Federation, there were about 463 million patients diagnosed with diabetes in 2019 and the figure may reach 700 million by 2045 approximately. If diabetes is not noticed in time, it will result in fatal effect in a person by damaging the eyes, blood vessels, kidneys, nerves, and heart. To stop progress this illness to the said complication level, it must be timely detected. In this task, a neural network algorithm is developed combined with machine learning applications to detect the diabetes timely. A data sample was used for training the neural network based on the various classification algorithms which are K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, Linear Regression, and Random Forest, and various implicit layers to detect the disease possibility in advance. Python programming language was used for developing the model. Different sets of test data were used to check the accuracy of different algorithms. Error percentages were reported for all the algorithms with different hidden layers, to choose the best algorithm with optimality of hidden layers which can be used for diabetic prognosis with less possible error.

Motivated by the fact that a practical multi-phase degradation procedure may probably involve both linear phases and nonlinear phases, a multi-phase degradation model is constructed that can consider the phase-varying nonlinear property. The unit-to-unit variability is incorporated. Meanwhile, the reliability function based on the first passage time (FPT) conception is derived, where the solution for the two-phase situation is first obtained, and the one for the multi-phase circumstance is constructed via a reclusive scheme. To verify the reasonability of the proposed reliability function, a simulation study has been complemented. Then two real applications are given to demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The possibility of simultaneously having systems with greater interconnection, more information and greater flexibility, allows companies to have a clearer view of their processes and consequently improve their effectiveness and efficiency. The digital transformation can no longer be based simply on making the processes more efficient, but on creating more sustainable and profitable customer relationships, continuously aligning the value of the product with the changing customer requirements. Even though managing assets over the Internet is increasingly common, much effort is needed to identify the functionality that should be provided by these platforms to enhance existing asset management practices. The effort of IT vendors is focused on the development of IoT platforms, which allow, among other functions, to create a connection between machinery and digital systems, protect all devices and data against hacking or attacks, control operations and maintenance of equipment or perform different analyses of assets or systems. The aim of this paper is to understand the functionalities of the existing IAMP platforms, providing a system that evaluates these functionalities based on the business objectives from the point of view of asset management. This methodology allows maintenance managers guiding the evolution of the life cycle of their assets according to the business value conception. This makes this methodology especially suitable for supporting new challenging scenarios of maintenance management. In this paper we first talk about the structure of an IAMP, then how they integrate the asset management model and a summary of the features and modules that have the most known IAMP platforms. Finally, an evaluation system of IAMP platforms and a case study is presented based on their content for asset management. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

To make up for the aforementioned shortcoming, this paper proposes an algorithm recommendation system suitable for PHM. Specifically, according to the PHM architecture, a PHM database is designed to assist in the mining of recommended knowledge and the execution of recommended strategies. Subsequently, a recommendation system is developed that mainly includes hybrid data processing, similarity measurement, and recommendation decision making. Therein, two recommendation strategies, based on Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) method and weighted information fusion, are designed to cope with two kinds of actual requirements. Finally, the recommendation of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction associated with the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) data set is employed as an application case to verify the effectiveness of the proposed recommendation system.

The vibration signal is firstly decomposed into several components that contain different frequency adaptively by EWT. After extracting features from the decomposed signals, the dimension of the feature vector is reduced by PCA. Finally, the dimensionally-reduced feature vectors that retain key fault characteristics are fed into ELM, which is a classifier with high learning speed and high generalization ability, to obtain the fault modes classification result. Experiments show that the proposed method can capture fault patterns of the hydraulic pump well and achieve high-accuracy fault diagnosis results. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Many researches have been conducted on RUL prediction for aircraft turbine engines, however, few of them are based on ensemble learning method. The ensemble learning is a combination of several machine learning algorithms, which is capable of outperforming any of its member algorithms. This paper introduces an ensemble learning based RUL prognostic method with Euclidean distance weight for aircraft turbine engine. Three different deep learning algorithms, i.e. stacked autoencoder (SAE), convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-terra memory (LSTM), are included in the proposed ensemble prognostic method. The weight of each member algorithm is assigned based on the Euclidean distance between the predicted RUL from each member algorithm and the real RUL calculated from the training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on an aircraft engine dataset generated from an aero-propulsion system simulator, C-MAPSS.

However, the time-consuming test brings a high and unbearable cost to battery enterprise specifically focusing on cost and efficiency. For this practical problem, a prediction-based test optimization method is proposed to estimate the battery remaining useful life to replace its test life, and to shorten the test cycles for saving the test-cost. The prediction accuracy and robustness to the variation on battery formula and test temperature are guaranteed by an instance-based transfer learning method combined with a highly robust deep learning method named stacked denoising autoencoder. An average Euclidean distance-based transferability measurement method selects the most similar historical test data of batteries with other different formulas. It helps to compensate for the lost trend information of the predicted battery caused by cycles reduction and to augment the data for effectively training the prediction model. The actual test data from a battery company verify the accurate prediction and significant cost saving. Nearly more than 30% of the test cycles are optimized for different formula batteries on average. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

These include employing expensive sensors, acquisition systems; and attending geometric limitations. Additionally, these solutions call for a specialist to take on feature engineering, machine learning algorithm selection, etc. Presented in this paper is a low-cost digital solution (intelligently integrate cost-cutting off-the-shelf technologies) for SMEs via product quality driven auto-prognostics. First, we develop upon existing solutions by addressing their drawbacks viz. cost, geometric limitations via a new product quality-centered condition monitoring strategy. Every SME must investigate the quality of their products, and therefore the authors believe this to be a low-cost solution. Next, the proposed solution integrates automated machine learning via Auto-WEKA, an off-the shelf open-source technology. Lastly, the practical advantages of the proposed solution over the existing sensor-based solution were investigated via a case study. Results depict that this low-cost prognostics solution is vital for maintenance planning in SMEs. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

The architecture provides a remote connection with distance students and a test rig, which permits them to be able to perform condition monitoring, diagnostic, prognostics, etc. on the equipment. The ICT architecture follows standards, such as the MIMOSA CRIS and the OSA-CBM. The remote laboratory environment supports lifelong learning as well as relevant training for the modern engineer and highlights the specific requirements of a maintenance engineer. As an example, the objectives and expected learning outcomes for a course in Maintenance 4.0 fundamentals are displayed. The expected results are, among others, increased maintenance competences in the industry, and the improvements of the different maintenance services following a predictive, condition-based maintenance strategy.

There is very limited relative research reported on the fault diagnosis of a complex system with multi-component degradation. The Complex Systems (CS) problem, which features multiple components simultaneously and nonlinearly interacting with each other and corresponding environment on multiple levels, has become an essential challenge in system engineering. In CS, even a single component degradation could cause misidentification of the fault severity level and lead to serious consequences. This paper introduces a new test rig to simulate multi-component degradations of the aircraft fuel system. A data analysis approach based on machine learning classification of both the time and frequency domain features is then proposed to detect and identify the fault severity level of CS with multi-component degradation. Results show that a) the fault can be sensitively detected with an accuracy > 99%; b) the severity of fault can be identified with an accuracy of 100%. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

The proposed solution tries to address the problem of pump failure during operation, this failure makes the pump unavailable, with a high cost of corrective maintenance. It must be taken into account that the condition monitoring may be insufficient because they are cryogenic and inaccessible equipment once the tanks have been started up. The use of machine learning techniques allows us to anticipate the response time by detecting anomalies in the operation, and to be able to do the maintenance before the failure occurs. In our experiments, we predict the power consumption based on the parameters captured in real time during operation. For the composition of the dataset, data was collected between 2007 and 2017, resulting in a dataset of over 15,000 lines for training and validation. First, all models were applied and evaluated on a dataset collected from a real case study. In the second phase, the performance improvement offered by boosting was studied. In order to determine the most efficient parameter combinations we compare Root Mean Squared Error, Absolute Error, Relative Error, Squared Error, Correlation, Training Time and Scoring Time. Our results demonstrate clear superiority of the boosted versions of the models against the plain (non-boosted) versions. The fastest scoring and total time was the Decision Tree and the best overall was Gradient Boosted Trees. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.	[De la Fuente, A.; Marquez A, Crespo; Candon, E.; Gomez, J.

Many industrial assets have multiple sensors for monitoring their condition, which allows for the collection of large amounts of data for failure analysis. However, there is a particular challenge for highly reliable assets as very few failure cases will be contained in their datasets. Such an unbalanced dataset makes it difficult to apply standard machine learning algorithms for failure prediction since such algorithms often depend on large number of failure cases for training the model parameters. This paper presents a solution to this problem using a Monte Carlo modified neural network, and applying this auxiliary lube oil pumps in industrial gas turbines. The results show that the model is able to predict the failures with an overall precision and recall values of 96.1% and 99.2% respectively. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Tremendous researches of DL techniques have been applied in machine health monitoring, but still very limited works focus on the application of DL on the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Precise RUL prediction can significantly improve the reliability and operational safety of industrial components or systems, avoid fatal breakdown and reduce the maintenance costs. This paper reviews and compares the state-of-the-art DL approaches for RUL prediction focusing on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and its variants. It has been observed from the results for a publicly available dataset that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks outperform the basic RNNs, and the number of the network layers affects the performance of the prediction.

In this context, an increasing number of information and communication technologies is incorporated towards facilitating management, production, and control processes. The introduction of advanced embedded systems with enhanced connectivity produces a vast amount of data, posing a challenge in terms of data analytics. However, the in-time collection and analysis of acquired data can create insight into the manufacturing process as well as its assets. One aspect of major importance for every production system is preserving its equipment in operational condition, and within those limits that could minimize unplanned breakdowns and production stoppages. This paper details the predictive analytics methodology integrated into the SERENA platform able to: (i) streamline the prognostics of the industrial components, (ii) characterize the health status of the monitored equipment, (iii) generate an early warning related to the condition of the equipment, and (iv) forecast the future evolution of the monitored equipment's degradation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, different use cases are discussed with results obtained on real-data collected in real-time from the industrial environments.

In this work, we integrate maintenance with planning problems, aiming to take full advantage of the production capacity providing immediate delivery of products to customers and avoiding failures. We propose a hybrid approach for solving a maintenance problem integrated with the lot-sizing and scheduling problems. The approach is based on the concepts of robustness and simheuristics, considering preventive, predictive and corrective maintenances in a parallel machine environment. Simulations are performed to consider machine failures. Results indicate that as we increase the robustness parameter at the lot -sizing problem, we obtain lower deviations related to the initial objective function of the lot-sizing problem and lower probabilities of infeasibility after the occurrence of failures. The approach makes it possible to find an average expected result for each of the scenarios analyzed taking into account historical data on the behavior of the failures.

Meanwhile, the advent of Industry 4.0 leads the maintenance paradigm shift facilitated by the efficient monitoring of physical assets and forecasting of the potential risks. As the advanced maintenance policies benefit in terms of cost-efficiency, inventory management and reliability management, most of the manufacturing companies are trying to make their own advanced maintenance strategies and to elaborate on the development of an innovative platform for it. However, since advanced enabling technologies collect a huge amount of data from different data sources such as machine, component, document, process and so on, data federation should necessarily be achieved for further discussion, but manufacturing companies are immature to address this issue. H2020 EU project Z-BRE4K, i.e., Strategies and predictive maintenance models wrapped around physical systems for zero unexpected-breakdowns and increased operating life of factories, deploys semantic technologies to address this issue. This paper deals with the debate on how to efficiently federate various data formats with the support of the semantic technologies in the context of maintenance.

Over time, faulting behaviour may grow in magnitude eroding the electrical capability of these lines causing degradation of broadband service. Developing effective data-driven models for broadband line prognostics remains a challenge due to the limited failure data availability in the telecommunications industry. In order to address this problem, we present a technique for generating failure data that realistically reflect the behaviour of degrading broadband lines. To this end, we use the conditional generative adversarial network and more importantly, we control and direct the failure data generation process using expert knowledge on the water ingress failure cause. The proposed technique is evaluated using a real-world case study involving the time-to-failure prediction of two types of broadband lines in a south-west city in England. The prognostics performance is measured using the Kappa statistic and F-score. Benchmark performance is obtained using Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Oversampling and Adaptive Synthesis which can be used to oversample failure data by duplicating existing failure data or randomly generating data. Among these techniques, Random Oversampling achieved the best prognostics performance. It is shown that the proposed technique outperforms Random Oversampling technique by a large margin. More specifically, it increased the prognostics performance by 33% (Kappa statistic) and 25% (F-score) for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines, and 17% (Kappa statistic) and 13% (F-score) for Very High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Lines compared to the Random Oversampling technique.

Through sensors/actuators data acquisition, the algorithm predicts the causal links between various monitored parameters of the system and offers a diagnosis of the health state of the system. A safety and operational robustness regime determines the acceptable thresholds of the operational boundaries of the electro-mechanical components of the machines. The proposed model takes into account the possibilities of sensor values being a piecewise-linear models or a pair of exponential functions with restricted model parameters, which can predict the runs-to-failure or remaining useful life until a safety threshold. The events caused by sensors passing through sub levels of safety threshold are used as a re-enforcement learning for the models. Each remaining useful life estimation diagnosis and prognosis analysis can be conducted on individual or an interconnected network of components within a machine. The overall health indicator based on individual useful life estimation is calculated by deriving the weights from event-clustering algorithm. The work can be extended to a network of machines representing a process. The outcome of the continuously learning real-time condition monitoring modus-operandi is to accurately measure the remaining useful life of the network of critical components of a machine.

This paper considers a problem of rare failure prediction in the context of aircraft predictive maintenance. It presents a novel approach of predicting extremely rare failures, based on combining two deep learning techniques, auto-encoder (AE) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) network. AE is modified and trained to detect rare failure, and the result from AE is fed into the BGRU to predict the next occurrence of failure. The applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated using real-world test cases of log-based warning and failure messages obtained from the aircraft central maintenance system fleet database and the records of maintenance history. The proposed AE-BGRU model is compared with other similar deep learning methods, the proposed approach is 25% better in precision, 14% in the recall, and 3% in G-mean. The result also shows robustness in predicting failure within a defined useful period. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Reliable predictive maintenance operations warrant accurately identifying the operating conditions causing wear. In this paper a novel study is conducted using a test rig undergoing wear at two locations with different conditions of contact pressure and lubrication between asperities. A single microphone is used for data acquisition. The blended single channel acoustic signal is first disintegrated into two separate source signals using empirical mode decomposition and principal component analysis. Statistical features of fixed segments of the two disintegrated signals are then computed. The wear volume was also measured in both wear zones, at the end of the corresponding time span. Machine learning algorithms are then trained to predict the degree and type of wear in each wear zone. A novel scheme is proposed after validation, that can be used to predict the wear conditions occurring simultaneously at multiple locations in a machine, using a single cheap acoustic sensor.

Customer satisfaction depends on products and parts quality, as well as possible customizations. To reach these objectives, productivity is key, meaning machines availability needs to be maxed and not impacted by unplanned breakdowns, which cost a lot of money and time, and possibly quality issues on parts produced during the deteriorating phase of the machine. Industry 4.0 will play an essential role, as it comes with new digital tools to improve productivity through real-time interactions from the digital world to the physical world. It is especially true with the maintenance policies, which are changing from corrective to planned ones from predictions of machine failures. We use the terms Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) or Predictive Maintenance (PdM) in these cases; they are based on data analysis to propose a health assessment of critical components, to predict future issues. The Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) framework proposes methodologies to deal with such problems. In the recent years, many researches focused on these topics; however, few of them deal with the full scope of implementing practically this strategy in the industry, particularly in the automotive sector.

This paper describes the methodologies and the mechanisms which are developed and evaluated for the RUL prediction in PROGRAMS EU project. More specifically, the extend utilization of physics-based models is the main pillar for the prediction of machines' components degradation profiles. An advanced methodology for physics-based modelling was designed in PROGRAMS EU project. The digital models were created while a synchronous tuning mechanism was designed and developed to enable the Digital Twin (DT) concept and eventually to ensure the high accuracy prediction of machines' components future failures. The simulation of the physics-based tuned model provides all the required data for the RUL calculation via the correlation of the expected (nominal) and the predicted (real) behaviour and functionality of machines' components in the long-term future. All the aforementioned activities are integrated in a common framework called "Machines' Behaviour Prediction Tool (BPT) for maintenance applications". Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

We are particularly interested in modeling one of the main attributes of complexity that is interaction; indeed, interactions between systems in a network or components in a system have the effect of propagating and perhaps even amplifying local inoperabilities. Two types of interactions are considered: influence that can be described by an acyclic hierarchical relationships graph of the interacting systems or components and interdependence for which the graphical representation of relationships allows loops. Hierarchy is mainly functional or structural and is analyzed and established in this communication using fault tree analysis (FTA) as the underlying mathematical tools whereas interdependence is apprehended through dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) by considering that effects are delayed. The ultimate DBN model (obtained in two steps: (1) a static Bayesian network (BN) isomorphic to the FTA model and then (2) DBN model by introducing delayed interdependence effects) of a complex system can serve as a decision support system for many risk related scenarios analysis and/or activities such as predictive maintenance.

Structural failures of bridges may lead to disastrous consequences on users and society at large. Bridge predictive deterioration models are extremely important for effective maintenance decision-making. However, the lack of enough inspection data between maintenance activities of a bridge complicates the development of accurate predictive models. Presented herein is a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based collaborative model for predicting the condition of bridge elements with limited available inspection data per bridge. This model has been applied in 137 bridge decks, showing that collaborative prognosis has the potential to predict the condition of different types of bridge elements, composing different types of bridges.

In this paper, a novel distributed yet integrated approach for diagnostics and prognostics is presented. An experimental study is conducted to validate the performance. Results showed that distributed prognostics give better performance in leaser computational time. Also, the proposed approach helps in making the results of the machine learning techniques comprehensible and more accurate. These results will be handy in arriving at predictive maintenance schedule considering the criticality of the system, the dependency of the components, available maintenance resources and confidence level in the results of the prognostic.

However, often a single asset does not fail so frequently to have enough training data in the form of historical failures. This problem can be addressed by learning from failures across a cluster of similar other assets, but often working in different environments. The algorithm therefore must learn from a distributed dataset which might be heterogenous but with underlying similarities. Federated Learning is an emerging technique that has recently also been proposed as a fitting solution for prognosis of industrial assets. However, even the most commonly used Federated Learning algorithms lack theoretical convergence guarantees, and therefore their convergence must be analysed empirically. This paper empirically analyses the convergence of the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm for a fleet of simulated turbofan engines. Results demonstrate that while FedAvg is applicable for prognosis, it cannot acknowledge the differences in asset failure mechanisms. As a result, the prognosis framework needs to be modified such that similar failures are clustered together before FedAvg can be implemented. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.

Intelligent fault diagnosis algorithm of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) combing with Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an effective way to deal with FOCT failures. According to the characteristics of LSTM, a signal prediction model in FOCT based on LSTM is proposed by analyzing the historical data. The residual signal can be obtained by the prediction signal and the observed signal. Set the residual threshold to determine whether the FOCT has fault. With the residual signal characteristics, a fault diagnosis model based on SVM is established. By analyzing the residual signal and extracting features, the diagnostic network can realize the pattern recognition and system fault diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that the drift deviation fault, the ratio deviation fault and the fixed deviation fault can be diagnosed with an accuracy of 94.5%.

The aim of the work is to improve the reliability and fast operation in diagnosis of the states of electrical motors of under conditions of an a priori uncertainty. The a priori uncertainty results from an insufficient study of the processes, which occur in the objects of diagnosis due to the operation in a wide range of external conditions and the presence of a great amount of disturbing effects along with environmental interferences. This aim is achieved by the development of the technical diagnosis method based on the information models of the nonlinear dynamic objects of diagnosis, which are obtained using the nonparametric identification procedure. As the information models of diagnostic objects, the integral nonparametric dynamic models based on multidimensional weight functions are considered. The most significant results consist in obtaining the method with a further development in construction of a space of diagnostic features of the nonlinear dynamic objects based on the correlation analysis as a stage of the features' filtration. The latter ensures the maximum diagnostic reliability. Significance of the obtained results: the application of the proposed method allows both high reliability of the object diagnosis under the priory uncertainty, and improvement of the diagnostic procedure fast operation owing to the feature filtration. The proposed method was tested using the data of the diagnosis of the switched reluctance motors.	[Fomin, O. O.; Ruban, O.

To this day, there are no cost-efficient, automatic methods that detect faults of the building HVAC systems to a satisfactory degree. This study induces a new method for fault detection that can replace a graphical, user-subjective evaluation of a building data measured on site with an automatic, data-based approach. This method can be a step towards cost-effective monitoring. For this research, the data from a detailed simulation of a residential case study house was used to compare a faultless operation of a building with a faulty operation. We argue that one can detect faults by analysing the properties of residuals of the prediction to the actual data. A machine learning model and an ARX model predict the building operation, and the method employs various statistical tests such as the Sign Test, the Turning Point Test, the Box-Pierce Test and the Bartels-Rank Test. The results show that the amount of data, the type and density of system faults significantly affect the accuracy of the prediction of faults. It became apparent that the challenge is to find a decision rule for the best combination of statistical tests on residuals to predict a fault.

In this article, we review widely the surrogate modeling concept and its applications in the electrical machine context. We present comprehensively a workflow for developing data-driven surrogate models including data generation with physics-based simulation and design of experiments, preprocessing of training data, and training and testing of the surrogates. We compare neural networks and gradient boosting decision trees in modeling and simulation of torque behavior of a permanent magnet synchronous machine together with selected design of experiments approaches with respect to surrogate accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, an approach to utilizing domain knowledge to create a hybrid surrogate model in order to improve the surrogate accuracy is shown. The accuracy of the selected hybrid neural network was better than with the gradient boosting approach and was close to the finite element simulation, whereas its run-time efficiency was significantly better compared to the finite element simulation with a speed-up factor of over 2,000. In addition, combining the sampling methods provided better results than the selected methods alone.

Fault detection and diagnosis accurately have an extreme impact on the maintenance and reliability of photovoltaic array. Moreover, for detecting the different faults, selecting the proper indicators for monitoring the system improves the fault diagnosis techniques performance and avoids the complexity of the system. In this paper, an efficient detection and diagnosis model for different fault types is proposed. This model has sequential steps. Firstly, the performance of seven indicators is initially analyzed to predict accurately the nonlinear output behavior of the photovoltaic system under changing environmental conditions, hence select the minimum indicators to detect the typical faults. Secondly, ten fault cases, considering single-fault types and another three faults considering multi-fault types, are investigated. At the same time, the impact of these faults on the selected indicators is deeply analyzed. Finally, the typical fault types are classified and detected effectively depending on three sequential probabilistic neural network models, which give a precise classification of the data inputs. Both theoretical and experimental tests are operated to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed model.

J	Ding, F; Zhang, XR; Wu, WF; Wang, YH				Ding, Feng; Zhang, Xinrui; Wu, Wenfeng; Wang, Yihua			A Fault Feature Extraction Method of Motor Bearing Using Improved LCD	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Kernel local characteristic-scale decomposition; fault; feature extraction; intrinsic scale components	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT; TRANSFORM; DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL; EMD	Local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD) is an adaptive decomposition method for non-stationary and nonlinear time-varying signals. In this paper, kernel mapping is used to replace random mapping in LCD, and a fault feature extraction method based on kernel local characteristic-scale decomposition-Hilbert envelope spectrum (KLCD-Hilbert) is proposed. This method first performs wavelet noise reduction on the bearing fault signal, and then uses the KLCD method to adaptively decompose the motor bearing vibration signal into several intrinsic scale components (ISC), the kernel function determines the number of ISCs. Finally, create the Hilbert envelope spectrum of each state vibration signal in turn, and input the extracted characteristic data into the structure of the extreme learning machine (ELM) to realize the fault identification of the motor bearing. The experimental results show that the KLCD-Hilbert envelope spectrum can better reflect the fault characteristics of the motor bearing than the time domain or frequency domain amplitude in the process of identifying the state of the motor bearing. Moreover, the KLCD method has a higher recognition rate than the local mean decomposition (LMD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) methods.

A technique for the camera-less remote surveillance on the heavy equipment is presented. It uses the sensor data about the pressure and position of the hydraulic actuators transmitted in IoT environment to a digital twin that reproduces the motion of the machine using its dynamic model. The forces acting in the machine calculated by the digital twin give an ability to calculate the stress levels in the mechanical structure of the machine. These data can be used to estimate the fatigue life of the machine as part of the predictive maintenance practice. The problems associated with the implementation of the proposed approach are discussed and the proof of concept system and experimental results are presented.

J	Piltan, F; Prosvirin, AE; Kim, JM				Piltan, Farzin; Prosvirin, Alexander E.; Kim, Jong-Myon			Robot manipulator active fault-tolerant control using a machine learning-based automated robust hybrid observer	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Robot manipulator; sliding mode algorithm; observation technique; fuzzy logic technique; high-order sliding mode observer; adaptive technique; fault estimation; fault detection; fault identification; fault-tolerant control	SLIDING MODE CONTROL; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Robotic manipulators represent a class of nonlinear and multiple-degrees-of-freedom robots that have pronounced coupling effects and can be used in various applications. The challenge of understanding complexity in a system's dynamic behavior, coupling effects, and sources of uncertainty presents substantial challenges regarding fault estimation, detection, identification, and tolerant-control (FEDIT) in a robot manipulator. Thus, a proposed active fault-tolerant control algorithm, based on an adaptive modern sliding mode observer, is represented. Due to the effect of the system's complexities and uncertainties for fault estimation, detection, and identification (FEDI), a sliding mode observer (SMO) is proposed. To address the sliding mode observer drawbacks for FEDI such as high-frequency oscillation (chattering) and fault estimation accuracy, the modern (T-S fuzzy higher order) technique is represented. In addition, the adaptive technique is applied to the modern sliding mode observer (MSMO) to self-tune the coefficients of the fault estimation observer to increase the reliability and robustness of decision-making for diagnosis of the fault. Next, the residual delivered by the adaptive MSMO (AMSMO) is split into windows, and each window is characterized by a numerical parameter. Finally, the machine learning technique known as a decision tree adaptively derives the threshold values that are used for problems of fault detection and fault identification in this work. Due to control of the effective fault, a surface automated new sliding mode controller (SANSMC) is presented in this work. To address the challenge of chattering and unlimited uncertainties (faults), the AMSMO is applied to the sliding mode controller (SMC). In addition, the surface-automated technique is used to fine-tune the surface coefficient to reduce the chattering and faults in the robot manipulator. The results show that the machine learning-based automated robust hybrid observer significantly improves the robustness, reliability, and accuracy of FEDIT in unknown conditions.

The proposed method uses the wavelet transform and genetic algorithm (GA) ensemble for an optimal feature extraction procedure. Optimal features, which are dominated through this method, can remarkably represent the mechanical faults in the damaged machine. For the aim of condition monitoring, we considered five common types of malfunctions such as casing distortion, cavitation, looseness, misalignment, and unbalanced mass that occur during the machine operation. The proposed technique can determine optimal wavelet parameters and suitable statistical functions to exploit excellent features via an appropriate distance criterion function. Moreover, our optimization algorithm chooses the most appropriate feature submatrix to improve the final accuracy in an iterative method. As a case study, the proposed algorithms are applied to experimental data gathered from an industrial heavy-duty oil pump installed in Arak Oil Refinery Company. The experimental results are very promising.yyyy	[Ranjbar, Amin; Suratgar, Amir Abolzafl] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Distributed & Intelligent Optimizat Res Lab, Tehran 1591634311, Iran; [Ghidary, Saeed Shiry] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran 1591634311, Iran; [Milimonfared, Jafar] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Tehran 1591634311, Iran		Suratgar, AA (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Distributed & Intelligent Optimizat Res Lab, Tehran 1591634311, Iran.	a-suratgar@aut.ac.ir	Ghidary, Saeed Shiry/AAH-7276-2021	Ghidary, Saeed Shiry/0000-0002-9019-3947			Cao HR, 2016, MEASUREMENT, V82, P439, DOI 10.1016/j.measurement.2016.01.023; Chai W, 2014, ENG APPL ARTIF INTEL, V28, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.engappai.2013.10.005; De Ridder D., 2017, CLASSIFICATION PARAM, V2nd; Ece DG, 2011, EXPERT SYST APPL, V38, P8079, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2010.12.149; He SL, 2016, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V76-77, P742, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2016.02.061; He W, 2015, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V64-65, P149, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2015.04.002; Jardine AKS, 2006, MECH SYST SIGNAL PR, V20, P1483, DOI 10.1016/j.ymssp.2005.09.012; Jiang F, 2018, APPL SCI-BASEL, V8, DOI 10.3390/app8091621; Mallat S.

The stator current signal was obtained experimentally from a healthy motor and a faulty motor with ITSC faults. The statistical time domain features was extracted from stator current signal, these features are used to train and test an ANN in order to diagnose ITSC faults. A complete study is performed by considering various diagnosis methods from ANN and machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for diagnosis ITSC faults. The performance of the proposed method was compared with machine learning algorithms, the proposed method has a higher accuracy than the other algorithms. Trained neural networks are able to classify different states of the ITSC faults with satisfied accuracy. The efficiency of this approach has been proven using experimental tests to diagnose ITCS faults in a 1.5Hp squirrel cage induction motor.

This paper discusses in details the various causes of bearing faults. To diagnose these faults diverse techniques have already been developed. Comprehensive literature review on detection techniques of bearing faults in induction motor has been furnished in this paper. These are sorted into specific areas as per their approaches. An important focus of this paper is on modeling of induction motor under the bearing fault condition. This paper suggests that the model-based techniques are more advantageous compared to different experiment-based techniques. Any localized fault in bearing can be thought-about as eccentric fault that creates non-uniformity in the air-gap. This non-uniform air-gap affects the stator inductance and thereby stator currents. In a few research works the later approach has been tried.

The analysis and processing of power big data can realize fault diagnosis. This study mainly analyzed the application of association rules in power big data processing. Firstly, the association rules and the Apriori algorithm were introduced. Then, aiming at the shortage of the Apriori algorithm, an IM-Apriori algorithm was designed, and a simulation experiment was carried out. The results showed that the IM-Apriori algorithm had a significant advantage over the Apriori algorithm in the running time. When the number of transactions was 100 000, the running of the IM-Apriori algorithm was 38.42% faster than that of the Apriori algorithm. The IM-Apriori algorithm was little affected by the value of supportmin. Compared with the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), the IM-Apriori algorithm had better accuracy. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the IM-Apriori algorithm in fault diagnosis, and it can be further promoted and applied in power grid equipment.

Open-circuit fault diagnosis in three-phase induction motor using model-based technique	ARCHIVES OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						induction motor; model-based diagnosis; number of turns; open-circuit fault		The presence of an open-circuit fault subjects a three-phase induction motor to severely unbalanced voltages that may damage the stator windings consecutively causing total shutdown of systems. Unplanned downtime is very costly. Therefore, fault diagnosis is essential for making a predictive plan for maintenance and saving the required time and cost. This paper presents a model-based diagnosis technique for diagnosing an open-circuit fault in any phase of a three-phase induction motor. The proposed strategy requires only current signals from the faulty machine to compare them with the healthy currents from an induction motor model. Then the errors of comparison are used as an objective function for a genetic algorithm that estimates the parameters of a healthy model, which they employed to identify and localize the fault. The simulation results illustrate the behaviours of basic parameters (stator and rotor resistances, self-inductances, and mutual inductance) and the number of stator winding turn parameters with respect to the location of an open-circuit fault. The results confirm that the number of stator winding turns are the useful parameters and can be utilized as an identifier for an open-circuit fault. The originality of this work is in extracting fault diagnosis features from the variations of the number of stator winding turns.	[Aswad, Raya A. K.; Jassim, Bassim M.

Prognosis may vary among patients depending on their seizure semiology, age of onset, seizure onset location, and features of electroencephalogram (EEG). Several researchers have focused on EEG patterns and demonstrated that EEG patterns of individuals with epilepsy can be used to predict prognosis and treatment responses. However, accurate EEG analysis requires an experienced epileptologist with several years of training, who are often unavailable in small or medium sized hospitals. In this paper, a novel machine learning (ML) model that accurately distinguishes Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS) from Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is proposed. BECTS and TLE show different seizure types and age of onset, but differential diagnosis can be challenging due to the similar location and patterns of the EEG spikes. The proposed hybrid machine learning (HML) model processes the diagnosis in the order of (1) creating feature matrices using statistical indexes after signal decomposition, (2) processing feature selection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) technology, and (3) classifying the results through ensemble learning based on decision trees. Simulation was performed using real patient data of 112 BECTS and 112 TLE EEG signals, where training was performed using 80% of the data and 20% of the data was used in the performance analysis comparison with the actual labeled data based on the diagnosis of medical doctors. The performance of the hybrid classification model is compared with other representative ML algorithms, which include logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and ensemble learning based decision tree. The model proposed in this paper shows an accuracy performance exceeding 99%, which is higher than the performance obtainable from the other ML classification models. The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel EEG diagnostic system that shows maximum efficiency to support clinical real-time diagnosis that can accurately distinguish epilepsy types. Future research will focus on expanding this ML model to categorize other types of epilepsies beyond BECTS and TLE and implement the HML diagnostic blockchain database into the hospital system.

The study of maintenance based on the reliability requires prior modeling of the degradation of the considered system. This is a difficult task when the system becomes complex. The first step consists in exploiting the Return EXperience (REX) databases and the experts knowledge and advice to estimate the parameters of the model of degradation of the chosen system. The model of degradation is then, enriched taking into account maintenance operations. Once the system and its maintenance are properly formalized, a utility function is established in order to evaluate a given maintenance strategy according to one or more given criteria.

An understanding of failure modes within inverters requires evaluation of a dataset that captures insights from multiple characterization techniques (including field diagnostics, production data analysis, and current-voltage curves). One readily available dataset that can be leveraged to support such an evaluation are maintenance records, which are used to log all site-related technician activities, but vary in structuring of information. Using machine learning, this analysis evaluated a database of 55,000 maintenance records across 800+ sites to identify inverter-related records and consistently categorize them to gain insight into common failure modes within this critical asset. Communications, ground faults, heat management systems, and insulated gate bipolar transistors emerge as the most frequently discussed inverter subsystems. Further evaluation of these failure modes identified distinct variations in failure frequencies over time and across inverter types, with communication failures occurring more frequently in early years. Increased understanding of these failure patterns can inform ongoing PV system reliability activities, including simulation analyses, spare parts inventory management, cost estimates for operations and maintenance, and development of standards for inverter testing. Advanced implementations of machine learning techniques coupled with standardization of asset labels and descriptions can extend these insights into actionable information that can support development of algorithms for condition-based maintenance, which could further reduce failures and associated energy losses at PV sites.

This system can realize the online fault diagnosis and signal reconstruction without a system model. And while considering the traditional PID control robustness and poor anti-interference ability and other shortcomings, an improved global fast non-singular terminal sliding mode control method is used to obtain better control effects, effectively solve the uncertainty problem in aero-engine, and give full play to aero-engine performance. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this system based on the above method, a turbofan engine is taken as the research object and semi-physical simulation experiments on fault-tolerant control are conducted on a semi-physical simulation test platform. Results show that the controller of this system can safely and reliably control the aero-engine without losing its control performance under the circumstance that there are faults in engine sensors.
