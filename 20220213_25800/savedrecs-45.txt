Structural materials challenges for advanced reactor systems	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Symposium on Nuclear Materials held at the EMRS 2008 Spring Meeting	MAY 26-30, 2008	Strasbourg, FRANCE	European Mat Res Soc			CREEP-PROPERTIES; CARBIDE	Key technologies for advanced nuclear systems encompass high temperature structural materials, fast neutron resistant core materials, and specific reactor and power conversion technologies (intermediate heat exchanger, turbo-machinery, high temperature electrolytic or thermo-chemical water splitting processes, etc.). The main requirements for the materials to be used in these reactor systems are dimensional stability under irradiation, whether under stress (irradiation creep or relaxation) or without stress (swelling, growth), an acceptable evolution under ageing of the mechanical properties (tensile strength, ductility, creep resistance, fracture toughness, resilience) and a good behavior in corrosive environments (reactor coolant or process fluid). Other criteria for the materials are their cost to fabricate and to assemble, and their composition could be optimized in order for instance to present low-activation (or rapid desactivation) features which facilitate maintenance and disposal. These requirements have to be met under normal operating conditions, as well as in incidental and accidental conditions. These challenging requirements imply that in most cases, the use of conventional nuclear materials is excluded, even after optimization and a new range of materials has to be developed and qualified for nuclear use. This paper gives a brief overview of various materials that are essential to establish advanced systems feasibility and performance for in pile and out of pile applications, such as ferritic/martensitic steels (9-12% Cr), nickel based alloys (Haynes 230, Inconel 617, etc.), oxide dispersion strengthened ferritic/martensitic steels, and ceramics (SiC, TiC, etc.). This article gives also an insight into the various natures of R&D needed on advanced materials, including fundamental research to investigate basic physical and chemical phenomena occurring in normal and accidental operating conditions, lab-scale tests to characterize candidate materials mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, as well as component mock-up tests on technology loops to validate potential applications while accounting for mechanical design rules and manufacturing processes. The selection, assessment and validation of materials necessitate a large number of experiments, involving rare and expensive facilities such as research reactors, hot laboratories or corrosion loops. The modelling and the codification of the behaviour of materials will always involve the use of such technological experiments, but it is of utmost importance to develop also a predictive material science. Finally, the paper stresses the benefit of prospects of multilateral collaboration to join skills and share efforts of R&D to achieve in the nuclear field breakthroughs on materials that have already been achieved over the past decades in other industry sectors (aeronautics, metallurgy, chemistry, etc.).

In inverter-fed motor drives, unlike line-driven motor drives, the stator currents are rich in harmonies; therefore fault diagnosis using stator Current is not trivial. The current signals for rotor fault diagnosis need precise and high resolution information, which means the diagnosis system demands additional hardware such as a low pass filter, high resolution ADC, and encoder, etc. The proposed axis-transformation method with encoder and without encoder is expected to contribute to a low cost fault diagnosis system in inverter-fed motor drives without the need for any additional hardware. In order to confirm the validity of the developed algorithms, various experiments for rotor faults are tested and the line Current spectrum of each faulty situation using Park transformation is compared with the results obtained from fast Fourier transforms.

Application of size-exclusion chromatography in the investigation of the in vitro stability of proinsulin and its cleaved metabolites in human serum and plasma	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Proinsulin; Insulin; Protease; Metabolism; Peptide; Size-exclusion chromatography; Immunoassay; Radioimmunoassay; Diabetes; Stability	IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE; C-PEPTIDE; INTACT PROINSULIN; DIABETES-MELLITUS; HUMAN INSULIN; DIRECT ASSAY; SEPARATION; RADIOIMMUNOASSAY; HYPOGLYCEMIA; CONVERSION	To help ensure reliability of proinsulin measurements and define the optimal matrix for conducting routine bioanalysis of this prognostic biomarker, we undertook a systematic evaluation of its in vitro stability. For this Study, we subjected mono-radioiodinated forms of hPI and its cleaved metabolites to size-exclusion chromatography (FPLC (TM)-SEC employing a Superdex-75 10/30 HR column) to characterize their elution profiles following incubation in human serum and plasma. We determined that intact hPI is a Substrate for serine-like protease(s) that are present in human serum. Furthermore, RIA analysis of the elution profile Of unlabeled peptide demonstrated that the B-C junction is cleaved preferentially. Thus, in vitro degradation of hPI represents a potential pathway for the formation of cleaved metabolites. Our findings confirmed that EDTA plasma is the. preferred matrix for quantitative determination of intact hPI and its cleaved metabolites. We concluded the SEC strategy employed in this study is broadly applicable to evaluating the in vitro stability of other peptides/proteins of diagnostic or therapeutic interest.

J	Hao, RJ; Chu, FL				Hao, Rujiang; Chu, Fulei			Morphological undecimated wavelet decomposition for fault diagnostics of rolling element bearings	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							VIBRATION; DEFECTS; SIGNALS; FILTER; EEG	This paper presents a novel morphological undecimated wavelet (MUDW) decomposition scheme for fault diagnostics of rolling element bearings. The MUDW scheme is developed based on the morphological wavelet (MW) theory for both the extraction of impulse features and noise smoothing in signal processing. The analysis operators and the synthesis operator of MUDW strictly satisfy the pyramid condition. The MUDW scheme is used to extract impulse features from rolling element bearing defect signals imposed with noise. The efficiency of the MUDW scheme used for noise smoothing and the extraction of impulse components is evaluated using the simulated data and measured signals from the bearing test rig. Compared with enveloping demodulation analysis, the MW transform and the traditional wavelet transform (WT), the MUDW decomposition scheme is more effective and suitable for the on-line diagnostics of bearings in rotating machines.

J	Condon, A; Deshpande, A; Hellerstein, L; Wu, N				Condon, Anne; Deshpande, Amol; Hellerstein, Lisa; Wu, Ning			Algorithms for Distributional and Adversarial Pipelined Filter Ordering Problems	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ALGORITHMS			English	Article						Pipelined filter ordering; selection ordering; query optimization; flow algorithms	APPROXIMATION SCHEMES	Pipelined filter ordering is a central problem in database query optimization. The problem is to determine the optimal order in which to apply a given set of commutative filters (predicates) to a set of elements (the tuples of a relation), so as to find, as efficiently as possible, the tuples that satisfy all of the filters. Optimization of pipelined filter ordering has recently received renewed attention in the context of environments such as the Web, continuous high-speed data streams, and sensor networks. Pipelined filter ordering problems are also studied in areas such as fault detection and machine learning under names such as learning with attribute costs, minimum-sum set cover, and satisficing search. We present algorithms for two natural extensions of the classical pipelined filter ordering problem: (1) a distributional-type problem where the filters run in parallel and the goal is to maximize throughput, and (2) an adversarial-type problem where the goal is to minimize the expected value of multiplicative regret. We present two related algorithms for solving (1), both running in time O(n(2)), which improve on the O(n(3) log n) algorithm of Kodialam. We use techniques from our algorithms for (1) to obtain an algorithm for (2).

J	Zhang, YW				Zhang, Yingwei			Enhanced statistical analysis of nonlinear processes using KPCA, KICA and SVM	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA); Kernel independent component analysis (KICA); Support vector machine (SVM); Nonlinear process monitoring; Fault detection and diagnosis	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT-DETECTION; PRINCIPAL-COMPONENTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; KERNEL PCA; DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION	In this paper, some drawbacks of original kernel independent component analysis (KICA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are analyzed for the purpose of multivariate statistical process monitoring (MSPM). When the measured variables follow non-Gaussian distribution, KICA provides more meaningful knowledge by extracting higher-order statistics compared with PCA and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). However. in real industrial processes, process variables are complex and are not absolutely Gaussian or non-Gaussian distributed. Any single technique is not sufficient to extract the hidden information. Hence. both KICA (non-Gaussion part) and KPCA (Gaussion part) are used for fault detection in this paper, which combine the advantages of KPCA and KICA to develop a nonlinear dynamic approach to detect fault online compared to other nonlinear approaches. Because SVM is available for classifying faults, it is used to diagnose fault in this paper. For above mentioned kernel methods, the calculation of eigenvectors and support vectors will be time consuming when the sample number becomes large. Hence, some dissimilar data are analyzed in the input and feature space. The proposed approach is applied to the fault detection and diagnosis in the Tennessee Eastman process. Application of the proposed approach indicates that proposed method effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics in the process variables. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, an approach is developed for fault detection based on a distributed system. Firstly, identifying of sensor instrumentation system is responsible for the signal processing and the system fault information. Secondly, the sensor wireless networks are used to transmit the data (lower layer) to or receive the commands from the computer center (top layer). Thirdly. the computer center at the top layer will monitor the overall system and generate the alarm signals or the commands when the faults occur. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The performance of two CI based classifiers, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) are compared. The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to the classifiers for detection of machine condition. The classifier parameters, e.g., the number of nodes in the hidden layer for ANNs and the kernel parameters for SVMs are selected along with input features using PSO algorithms. The classifiers are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions and are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a rotating machine. The roles of the number of features, PSO parameters and CI classifiers on the detection success are investigated. Results are compared with other techniques such as genetic algorithm (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The PSO based approach gave a test classification success rate of 98.6-100% which were comparable with CA and much better than with PCA. The results show the effectiveness of the selected features and the classifiers in the detection of the machine condition. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The work is motivated by the need for more efficient use of expensive assets and for enhanced combat readiness of critical vehicles. The prognosis system will be founded on a collaboration between sensor systems, advanced reasoning methods for data fusion and signal interpretation, and modeling and simulation systems. The modeling technology being developed for this program is based on a fundamental understanding of the fatigue process, and traces the structural degradation caused by fatigue back to its physical origins in the microstructure of the metallic component. Sensor systems designed to detect the earliest stages of fatigue damage provide needed input for the models, and the data from the models and the sensors are combined by the reasoning and prediction (RAP) system.

Support vector machine for fault detection in transmission line	ENGINEERING INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Transmission line protection; fault detection; digital fault recorder; support vector machine	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISTANCE PROTECTION; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a new approach for fault detection in power transmission line using support vector machine (SVM) technique. This method uses fault current samples for half cycle from the inception of fault. The line currents are applied as inputs to SVM for fault detection. The SVM is trained with linear, polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel. The feasibility of the proposed method has been tested on a 110-kV, 21.687-km transmission line for all the ten types of fault using MATLAB Simulink. Upon testing on 640 fault cases with varying fault resistance, fault inception angle and fault distance the performance of the proposed method is quite promising. The proposed method is also tested with real time data recorded by digital fault recorder (DFR). The results encourage the use of this proposed method for detection of various faults in transmission line accurately.

J	Cho, HW				Cho, Hyun-Woo			A data mining-based subset selection for enhanced discrimination using iterative elimination of redundancy	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Variable selection; Support vector machine; Backward elimination; Kernel principal component analysis; Discriminant analysis	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; KERNEL; SYSTEMS	The presence of redundant or irrelevant features in data mining may result in it mask Of underlying patterns. Thus one often reduces the number of features by applying it feature selection technique. The objective of feature selection is to get a feature subset that has the best performance. This work proposes it new feature selection method using orthogonal filtering and nonlinear representation of data for an enhanced discrimination performance. An orthogonal filtering is implemented to remove unwanted variation of data. The proposed method adopts kernel principal component analysis, one of nonlinear kernel methods, to extract nonlinear characteristics of data and to reduce the dimensionality of data. The proposed feature selection method is based on the selection criterion of linear discriminant analysis in an environment of iterative backward feature elimination. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of three different methods. The results showed that it outperforms the three methods. The use of filtering and a kernel method wits shown to be a promising tool for an efficient feature selection. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Geng, ZQ; Zhu, QX				Geng, Zhiqiang; Zhu, Qunxiong			Rough set-based heuristic hybrid recognizer and its application in fault diagnosis	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Rough set; Knowledge discovery; ANN; Feature selection; Pattern recognition; Fault diagnosis	FEATURE-SELECTION	Rough set theory (RS) has been a topic of general interest in the field of knowledge discovery and pattern recognition. Machine learning algorithms arc known to degrade in performance when faced with many features (sometimes attributes) that are not necessary for rule discovery. Many methods for selecting a subset of features have been proposed. However, only one method cannot handle the complex system with many attributes or features, so a hybrid mechanism is proposed based oil rough set integrating artificial neural network (Rough-ANN) for feature selection in pattern recognition. RS-based attributes reduction as the preprocessor can decrease the inputs of the NN and improve the speed of training. So the sensitivity of rough set to noise can be avoided and the system's robustness is to be improved. A RS-based heuristic algorithm is proposed for feature selection. The approach can select ail optimal subset of features quickly and effectively from a large database with a lot of features. Moreover, the validity of the proposed hybrid recognizer and solution is verified by the application of practical experiments and fault diagnosis in industrial process.

Vibration-based fault diagnosis of spur bevel gear box using fuzzy technique	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Feature selection; Statistical features; Decision tree; Gear box; Fuzzy; Fault detection		To determine the condition of an inaccessible gear in an operating machine the vibration signal of the machine can be continuously monitored by placing a sensor close to the source of the vibrations. These signals can be further processed to extract the features and identify the status of the machine. The vibration signal acquired from the operating machine has been used to effectively diagnose the condition of inaccessible moving components inside the machine. Suitable sensors are kept at various locations to pick up the signals produced by machinery and these signals are very meaningful in condition diagnosis surveillance. To determine the important characteristics and to unravel the significance of these signals, further analysis or processing is required. This paper presents the use of decision tree for selecting best statistical features that will discriminate the fault conditions of the gear box from the signals extracted. These features are extracted from vibration signals. A rule set is formed from the extracted features and fed to a fuzzy classifier. The rule set necessary for building the fuzzy classifier is obtained largely by intuition and domain knowledge. This paper also presents the usage of decision tree to generate the rules automatically from the feature set. The vibration signal from a piezo-electric transducer is captured for the following conditions - good bevel gear, bevel gear with tooth breakage (GTB), bevel gear with crack at root of the tooth (GTC), and bevel gear with face wear of the teeth (TFW) for various loading and lubrication conditions. The statistical features were extracted and good features that discriminate the different fault conditions of the gearbox were selected using decision tree. The rule set for fuzzy classifier is obtained by once using the decision tree again. A fuzzy classifier is built and tested with representative data. The results are found to be encouraging.

J	Wu, JD; Hsu, CC				Wu, Jian-Da; Hsu, Chuang-Chin			Fault gear identification using vibration signal with discrete wavelet transform technique and fuzzy-logic inference	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis system; Discrete wavelet transform; Fuzzy-logic interference; Vibration signal	DAMAGE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEM	This paper described a development of the fault gear identification system using the vibration signal with discrete wavelet transform and fuzzy-logic inference for a gear-set experimental platform. The proposed system consisted of a combination of signal feature extraction using discrete wavelet transform technique and fault identification using fuzzy-logic inference. Traditionally, the technique for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery depends on the experience of the technician. However, the rotating machinery may be operated in a complex and noisy environment. The conventional diagnosis technique has difficulty detecting the fault features, such as in a noisy environment. In the present study, a discrete wavelet transform technique using vibration signals in a gear-set experimental platform is studied. The extraction method of feature vector is based on discrete wavelet transform with energy spectrum. Further, the fuzzy-logic inference is proposed to develop the diagnostic rules of the data base in the present fault identification system. The experimental works are performed to evaluate the effect of fault diagnosis in a gear-set platform under various operation conditions.

J	Feng, ZG; Wang, Q; Shida, K				Feng, Zhigang; Wang, Qi; Shida, Katsunori			Design and Implementation of a Self-Validating Pressure Sensor	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						Consistency checking; double DSPs system; fault detection and diagnosis; self-validating pressure sensor; support vector machine (SVM) multiclassification; wavelet packet decomposition	FUSION; SYSTEM	A new prototype of self-validating pressure sensor is described, including structure design of the transducer, fault detection and diagnosis method and signal transmitter based on double digital signal processors (DSPs) system. The elastic body of the transducer is based on circular-flat diaphragm structure. Eight groups of strain gauges are distributed on the diaphragm. One group of metal strain gauge with little temperature drift is used as primary pressure sensor, the other seven groups of semiconductor strain gauges with high sensitivity are used as calibration references. Consistency checking of the measured data is used to detect sensor fault. The outputs of self-validating pressure sensor including validated measurement value (VMV) of pressure, validated uncertainty (W) of pressure, and measurement value status (MVS) of pressure are calculated using the high consistency data. A new fault diagnosis method based on wavelet packet decomposition feature extraction and support vector machine multiclassification is used to identify six sensor fault status. A double DSPs system is implemented using TMS320F2812 and TMS320C6713 to acquire the output signal and complete fault detection, diagnosis, and self-validating parameters calculating. The experiment results show that the designed pressure sensor prototype implements the self-validating function. It can detect fault in real-time and identify sensor status with high accuracy.

Improved Resolution of the MCSA Method Via Hilbert Transform, Enabling the Diagnosis of Rotor Asymmetries at Very Low Slip	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						Discrete Hilbert transforms; fault diagnosis; induction motors; signal analysis	3-PHASE INDUCTION-MOTORS; FAULT-DETECTION; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; BAR DETECTION; BROKEN BARS; STATOR; MACHINES; FAILURES	This paper proposes an online/offline induction motor current signature analysis (MCSA) with advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms, based on the Hilbert transform. MCSA is a method for motor diagnosis with stator-current signals. Although it is one of the most powerful online methods for diagnosing motor faults, it has some drawbacks that can degrade the performance and accuracy of a motor-diagnosis system. In particular, it is very difficult to detect broken rotor bars when the motor is operating at low slip or under no load, due to fast Fourier transform (FFT) frequency leakage and the small amplitude of the current components related to the fault. Therefore, advanced signal-and-data-processing algorithms are proposed. They consist of a proper sample selection algorithm, a Hilbert transformation of the stator-sampled current, and spectral analysis via FFT of the modulus of the resultant time-dependent vector modulus for achieving MCSA efficiently. Experimental results obtained on a 1.1-kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor are discussed.

A number of TF detection techniques have been proposed; however, there is currently no method available for distinguishing TFs from high-resistance (R) connections (HRCs), which also result in three-phase system asymmetry. It is important to distinguish the two faults, since an HRC does not necessarily require immediate motor shutdown. In this paper, new sensorless online monitoring techniques for detecting and classifying stator TFs and high-R electrical connections in induction machines based on the zero-sequence voltage or negative-sequence current measurements are proposed. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction motor performed under simulated TFs and high-R circuit conditions verifies that the two faults can be reliably detected and classified. The proposed technique helps improve the reliability, efficiency, and safety of the motor system and industrial plant and also allows maintenance to be performed in a more efficient manner, since the course of action can be determined based on the type and severity of the fault.

Therefore, it is important to monitor and correct high-R connections for a reliable, efficient, and safe operation of the industrial facility. This paper focuses on the development of an online technique for detecting poor connections based on monitoring the asymmetry in the voltage and current measurement. The development of the technique begins with the derivation of the dynamic model of an induction motor with high-R connections. Based on the analysis of the model, two approaches for detecting poor contacts using the negative-sequence current and zero-sequence voltage are proposed. In addition to detecting the existence of faults, the location and severity of the fault can also be determined using the proposed method. An experimental study on a 10-hp induction machine under simulated and realistic high-R conditions shows that the proposed techniques provide a simple low-cost solution for reliably detecting poor contact problems at an early stage. It is also shown that the severity and location of the high-R contact fault can be assessed with high accuracy.

However, it features some drawbacks, as it is bound to steady-state conditions, and fault signatures may be created by different overlapping phenomena. This paper presents a full-time domain-based method for the quantitative evaluation of electrical faults in induction machines. It relies on stator current measurements; thus, it is compliant with switching power converter drives, provided that a proper current measurement technique is available. Moreover, it allows an accurate quantification of faults without requiring spectrum analysis; hence, it achieves high resolution even with a low time acquisition period. A fault index is computed as the energy of the signal in a suitable "fault bandwidth," thus reducing the effects of frequency variations. The aforementioned advantages are perfectly suited to time varying signals and to embedded drive diagnostic systems.

Therefore, intelligent vehicle health-monitoring schemes are needed for effective fault diagnosis in automotive systems. Previously, we developed a (data-driven approach using a data-reduction technique, coupled with a variety of classifiers, for fault diagnosis in automotive systems. In this paper, we consider the problem of fusing classifier decisions to reduce diagnostic errors. Specifically, we develop three novel classifier fusion approaches: 1) class-specific Bayesian fusion; 2) joint optimization of the fusion center and individual classifiers; and 3) dynamic fusion. We evaluate the efficacies of these fusion approaches on an automotive engine data. The results demonstrate that the proposed fusion techniques outperform traditional fusion approaches. We also show that learning the parameter's of individual classifiers as part of the fusion architecture can provide better classification performance.

The proposed model allows taking into account the local magnetic saturation of the magnetic circuit due to heavy stator fault currents and remains moderately time consuming compared to the finite elements method. Firstly, the system of algebraic equations describing the developed permeance network is written. Then, this magnetic model is coupled to the electrical differential equations describing the induction machine in presence of inter-turn stator faults. Finally, simulation results are successfully compared to the experimental results. The impact of saturation on inter-turn fault signature clearly confirms the interest of a nonlinear model based diagnostic for this fault.

J	Gebraeel, N; Elwany, A; Pan, J				Gebraeel, Nagi; Elwany, Alaa; Pan, Jing			Residual Life Predictions in the Absence of Prior Degradation Knowledge	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Bernstein distribution; degradation modeling; prognostics; random coefficients models	RELIABILITY MODEL; DISTRIBUTIONS	Recent developments in degradation modeling have been targeted towards utilizing degradation-based sensory signals to predict residual life distributions. Typically, these models consist of stochastic parameters that are estimated with the aid of an historical database of degradation signals. In many applications, building a degradation database, where components are run-to-failure, may be very expensive and time consuming, as in the case of generators or jet engines. The degradation modeling framework presented herein addresses this challenge by utilizing failure time data, which are easier to obtain, and readily available (relative to sensor-based degradation signals) from historical maintenance/repair records. Failure time values are first fitted to a Bernstein distribution whose parameters are then used to estimate the prior distributions of the stochastic parameters of an initial degradation model. Once a complete realization of a degradation signal is observed, the assumptions of the initial degradation model are revised and improved for future predictions. This approach is validated using real world vibration-based degradation information from a rotating machinery application.

Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a wind turbine synchronous generator drive train	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION			English	Article							MACHINES; POWER	Some large grid connected wind turbines use a low-speed synchronous generator, directly coupled to the turbine, and a fully rated converter to transform power from the turbine to mains electricity. The condition monitoring and diagnosis of mechanical and electrical faults in such a machine are considered, bearing in mind that it has a slow variable speed and is subject to the stochastic, aerodynamic effects of the wind. The application of wavelet transforms is investigated in the light of the disadvantages of spectral analysis in processing signals subject to such stochastic effects. The technique can be used to monitor generator electrical and drive train mechanical faults. It is validated experimentally on a wind turbine condition monitoring test rig using a three-phase, permanent-magnet, slow-speed, synchronous generator, driven by a motor controlled by a model representing the aerodynamic forces from a wind turbine.

In light load condition, distinguishing between safe and faulty rotors is difficult, because the characterisitic frequencies is rotor with broken barsare very close to the fundamental component and their amplitudes are small in comparison. To overcome this problem, an advanced technique based on the wavelet transform and artificial neural network is suggested for processing the starting current of induction motors. In order to increase the efficiency of the proposed method, the results of the wavelet analysis, before applying to the neural networks are processed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then the outcome results are supposed as neural network's training and testing data set. The trained neural networks undertake of determining the number of broken rotor bars. The given statistical results, announce the proposed method's high ability to determine the number of broken rotor bars. The proposed method is independent from loading conditions of machine and it is useable even when the motor is unloaded.

Minimum spanning tree based one-class classifier	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						One-class classification; Novelty detection; Minimum spanning tree; Recognition; Class oriented description	OUTLIERS	In the problem of one-class classification one of the classes, called the target class, has to be distinguished from all other possible objects. These are considered as non-targets. The need for solving such a task arises in many practical applications, e.g. in machine fault detection, face recognition, authorship verification, fraud recognition or person identification based on biometric data. This paper proposes a new one-class classifier, the minimum spanning tree class descriptor (MST_CD). This classifier builds on the structure of the minimum spanning tree constructed on the target training set only. The classification of test objects relies on their distances to the closest edge of that tree, hence the proposed method is an example of a distance-based one-class classifier. Our experiments show that the MST-CD performs especially well in case of small sample size problems and in high-dimensional spaces. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Model-based fault diagnosis of induction motor eccentricity using particle swarm optimization	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						induction machine modelling; winding function; mixed eccentricity; fault detection; particle swarm optimization	AIR-GAP ECCENTRICITY; DYNAMIC SIMULATION; ALGORITHMS; MACHINE	Much research works address model-free or signal processing and spectral analysis-based fault detection schemes for rotor eccentricity fault in induction motors. Nevertheless, despite existing reliable fault-embedded eccentricity mathematical models such as the winding function method an integrated model-based fault detection algorithm for detecting this fault yet has not been fully explored. This article presents model-based mixed-eccentricity fault detection and diagnosis for induction motors. The proposed algorithm can successfully detect faults and their severity using stator currents. To determine the values of the fault-related parameters, an adaptive synchronization-based parameter estimation algorithm is introduced using particle swarm optimization. Simulation and experiments demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to detect and diagnose these faults. The proposed algorithm can be employed to estimate the parameters, in addition to slowly time varying and abruptly changing parameters.

J	Fan, JJ; Nunn, ME; Su, XG				Fan, Juanjuan; Nunn, Martha E.; Su, Xiaogang			Multivariate exponential survival trees and their application to tooth prognosis	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							CLINICAL-PARAMETERS; REGRESSION; MODEL	This paper is concerned with developing rules for assignment of tooth prognosis based on actual tooth loss in the VA Dental Longitudinal Study. It is also of interest to rank the relative importance of various clinical factors for tooth loss. A multivariate survival tree procedure is proposed. The procedure is built on a parametric exponential frailty model, which leads to greater computational efficiency. We adopted the goodness-of-split pruning algorithm of [LeBlanc, M., Crowley, J., 1993. Survival trees by goodness of split. journal of the American Statistical Association 88, 457-467] to determine the best tree size. In addition, the variable importance method is extended to trees grown by goodness-of-fit using an algorithm similar to the random forest procedure in [Breiman, L, 2001. Random forests. Machine Learning 45, 5-32]. Simulation studies for assessing the proposed tree and variable importance methods are presented. To limit the final number of meaningful prognostic groups, an amalgamation algorithm is employed to merge terminal nodes that are homogeneous in tooth survival. The resulting prognosis rules and variable importance rankings seem to offer simple yet clear and insightful interpretations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper we propose a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based classifier in comparison with Bayesian classifiers and Artificial Neural Networks for the prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer disease. The paper provides the implementation details along with the corresponding results for all the assessed classifiers. Several comparative studies have been carried out concerning both the prognosis and diagnosis problem demonstrating the superiority of the proposed SVM algorithm in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

Distributional Smoothing in Bayesian Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Bayesian classifier; diagnosis (fault); machine learning; smoothing	PROBABILITIES	Previously, we demonstrated the potential value of constructing asset-specific models for fault diagnosis. We also examined the effects of using split probabilities, where prior probabilities come from asset-specific statistics and likelihoods from fleet-wide statistics. In this paper, we build upon that work to examine the efficacy of smoothing probability distributions between asset-specific and fleet-wide distributions to further improve diagnostic accuracy. In the current experiments, we also add environmental differentiation to asset differentiation under the assumption that data are acquired in the context of online health monitoring. We hypothesize that the overall diagnostic accuracy will be increased with the smoothing approach relative to a fleet-wide model or a set of asset-specific models. The hypothesis is largely supported by the results. Future work will concentrate on improving the smoothing mechanism and in the context of small data sets.	[Butcher, Stephyn G.

We apply the framework to sparse physics data sets, although the method can easily be extended to other domains. Experiments in applied fields, such as experimental physics, are often complicated and expensive. As a result, experimentalists are unable to conduct as many experiments as they would like, leading to very unbalanced data sets that can be dense in one dimension and very sparse in others. Our method predicts the data values along the sparse dimension providing more information to researchers. Often experiments deviate from expectations due to small misalignments in initial parameters. Our method detects these outlier experiments.

This method has been suggested to overcome the demerits of the general ANN with the local minima problem and low classification accuracy in case of many nonlinear data. This hybrid approach takes advantage of the reduction of learning data and converging time Without any loss of estimation accuracy because the SVM classifies the defect location and reduces the leaming data range. The results of test data have shown that the hybrid method is more reliable and Suitable algorithm than the general ANN for the defect diagnosis of the gas turbine engine.

J	He, QB; Yan, RQ; Kong, FR; Du, RX				He, Qingbo; Yan, Ruqiang; Kong, Fanrang; Du, Ruxu			Machine condition monitoring using principal component representations	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Machine condition monitoring; Principal component analysis; Sound; Vibration	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DEFECT	The purpose of this paper is to find the low-dimensional principal component (PC) representations from the statistical features of the measured signals to characterize and hence, monitor machine conditions. The PC representations can be automatically extracted using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique from the time- and frequency-domains statistical features of the measured signals. First, a mean correlation rule is proposed to evaluate the capability of each of the PCs in characterizing machine conditions and to select the most representative PCs to classify machine fault patterns. Then a procedure that uses the low-dimensional PC representations for machine condition monitoring is proposed. The experimental results from an internal-combustion engine sound analysis and an automobile gearbox vibration analysis show that the proposed method is effective for machine condition monitoring.

J	Wu, FJ; Qu, LS				Wu, Fangji; Qu, Liangsheng			Diagnosis of subharmonic faults of large rotating machinery based on EMD	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Empirical mode decomposition; Subharmonic faults; Fault diagnosis; Large rotating machinery		The vibration signals always carry the abundant dynamic information of a machine and are very useful for the feature extraction and fault diagnosis. In practice, most subharmonic signals have a close relationship to time variables and can manifest large amplitude fluctuation, transient vibration, or modulation signals in time domain. In view of this, this paper describes an effective method to search the features of subharmonic faults of large rotating machinery based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD). Case study on some actual vibration signals of machine parts shows that EMD is an adaptive and unsupervised method in feature extraction and it provides an attractive alternative to the traditional diagnostic methods.

Two fault diagnosis techniques are discussed, namely: invasive and non-invasive techniques. The relative advantages of the non-invasive techniques are also discussed. Various indices used in the non-invasive techniques are then briefly introduced and some outlines for continuing the research on every index are given. The advantages and disadvantages of the indices under different operating conditions and for any type and eccentricity degree are then discussed together with some effective parameters of the motor. The results of this review are useful for manufacturers of fault diagnosis systems in selecting proper indices for existing conditions and also for researchers in determining further research areas.

J	Herzog, MA; Marwala, T; Heyns, PS				Herzog, M. A.; Marwala, T.; Heyns, P. S.			Machine and component residual life estimation through the application of neural networks	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Neural networks; Condition-monitoring data; Residual life	SYSTEMS RELIABILITY; REPAIRABLE SYSTEMS; MAINTENANCE; AIRCRAFT	This paper concerns the use of neural networks for predicting the residual life of machines and components. In addition, the advantage of using condition-monitoring data to enhance the predictive capability of these neural networks was also investigated. A number of neural network variations were trained and tested with the data of two different reliability-related datasets. The first dataset represents the renewal case where the failed unit is repaired and restored to a good-as-new condition. Data were collected in the laboratory by subjecting a series of similar test pieces to fatigue loading with a hydraulic actuator. The average prediction error of the various neural networks being compared varied from 431 to 841 s on this dataset, where test pieces had a characteristic life of 8971 s. The second dataset were collected from a group of pumps used to circulate a water and magnetite solution within a plant. The data therefore originated from a repaired system affected by reliability degradation. When optimized, the multi-layer perceptron neural networks trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and the general regression neural network produced a sum-of-squares error within 11.1% of each other for the renewal dataset. The small number of inputs and poorly mapped input space on the second dataset meant that much larger errors were recorded on some of the test data. The potential for using neural networks for residual life prediction and the advantage of incorporating condition-based data into the model was nevertheless proven for both examples.

J	Shoaran, M; Thomo, A				Shoaran, Maryam; Thomo, Alex			Fault-tolerant computation of distributed regular path queries	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Regular path queries; Semistructured data; Distributed query evaluation; Message complexity; Fault tolerance	TERMINATION DETECTION; ALGORITHM; DATABASES	Regular path queries are the building blocks of almost any mechanism for querying semistructured data. Despite the fact that the main applications of such data are distributed, there are only few works dealing with distributed evaluation of regular path queries. in this paper we present a message-efficient and truly distributed algorithm for computing the answer to regular path queries in a multi-source semistructured database setting. Our algorithm is general as it works for the larger class of weighted regular path queries on weighted semistructured databases. Also. we show how to make our algorithm fault-tolerant to smoothly work in environments prone to process (or machine) failures.

The use of support vector machines (SVM) is considered for their simpler design and implementation, and for allowing the better handling of complex and large data sets. In order to compare results with previously reported works, a standard case study such as the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process benchmark is considered. SVM achieves consistent and promising results. However, the difficulties arising when comparing SVM with previously reported results reveals the need for a systematic procedure for contrasting the performance of different FDS. Hence, general performance assessment indexes based on precision and recall of each FDS are proposed and used. In this sense, this study provides a data set and evaluation measures that could be used as a framework for future comparisons. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As part of a reactive system, each piece and type of equipment exhibits both cyclic and transient behaviors, some of which may indicate faults that presage failures. This paper identifies a number of factors that impact reliability and safety of ocean-bourne turbines. Fouling, salinity, and inaccessibility of equipment are but a few such factors that set this MCM problem apart from those encountered by wind turbines, hydroelectric plants, or ship hulls and propellers.

Using emergent clustering methods to analyse short time series gene expression data from childhood leukemia treated with glucocorticoids	18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation	JUL 13-17, 2009	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	IMACS, MSSANZ, CSIRO, Australian Math Sci Inst, Griffith Univ, eWater Cooperat Res Ctr, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, HEMA Consulting, Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat, Int Council Ind Appl Math, Int Soc Grid Generat (ISGG), Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing (ISPRS), Japan Soc Simulat Technol, Pacific Rim Math Assoc, Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey		Childhood Leukemia; Clustering; Emergent self-organizing maps; Glucocorticoids; Short time series gene expression		Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) causes the highest number of deaths from cancer in children aged between one and fourteen. The most common treatment for children with ALL is chemotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop cell division. The drug and dosage combinations may vary for each child. Unfortunately, chemotherapy treatments may cause serious side effects. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as therapeutic agents for children with ALL for more than 50 years. Common and widely drugs in this class include prednisolone and dexamethasone. Childhood leukemia now has a survival rate of 80% (Pui, Robison, & Look, 2008). The key clinical question is identifying those children who will not respond well to established therapy strategies. GCs regulate diverse biological processes, for example, metabolism, development, differentiation, cell survival and immunity. GCs induce apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in lymphoid cells. In fact, not much is known about the molecular mechanism of GCs sensitivity and resistance, and GCs-induced apoptotic signal transduction pathways and there are many controversial hypotheses about both genes regulated by GCs and potential molecular mechanism of GCs-induced apoptosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this drug should lead to better prognostic factors (treatment response), more targeted therapies and prevention of side effects. GCs induced apoptosis have been studied by using microarray technology in vivo and in vitro on samples consisting of GCs treated ALL cell lines, mouse thymocytes and/or ALL patients. However, time series GCs treated childhood ALL datasets are currently extremely limited. DNA microarrays are essential tools for analysis of expression of many genes simultaneously. Gene expression data show the level of activity of several genes under experimental conditions. Genes with similar expression patterns could belong to the same pathway or have similar function. DNA microarray data analysis has been carried out using statistical analysis as well as machine learning and data mining approaches. There are many microarray analysis tools; this study aims to combine emergent clustering methods to get meaningful biological insights into mechanisms underlying GCs induced apoptosis. In this study, microarray data originated from prednisolone (glucocorticoids) treated childhood ALL samples (Schmidt et al., 2006) (B-linage and T-linage) and collected at 6 and 24 hours after treatment are analysed using four methods: Self-organizing maps (SOMs), Emergent self-organizing maps (ESOM) (Ultsch & Morchen, 2005), the Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) (Ernst & Bar-Joseph, 2006) and Fuzzy clustering by Local Approximation of MEmbership (FLAME) (Fu & Medico, 2007). The results revealed intrinsic biological patterns underlying the GCs time series data: there are at least five different gene activities happening during the three time points; GCs-induced apoptotic genes were identified; and genes active at both time points or only at 6 hours or 24 hours were determined. Also, interesting gene clusters with membership in already known pathways were found thereby providing promising candidate gens for further inferring GCs induced apoptotic gene regulatory networks.

In this direction, a new anomaly detection system (AD) has been posed through a fault detection and diagnosis system. The objective is to be able to detect faults that have never happened before by using training information obtained from processes history (known faults). The methodology consists of two steps: a first fault detection stage (binary classification problem) and a subsequent diagnosis stage (multi-class problem) addressed under a multi-label (ML) approach. The FDDS has been implemented using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The problem addressed is the monitoring and diagnosis of transient operation modes, for which the FDDS has been tested in a pilot plant heat exchange system operating batch wise. Results are discussed and promising measures of diagnosis performance (F1 index) are finally reported.

These techniques are Dynamic Independent Component Analysis (DICA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). DICA is an extension of conventional Independent Component Analysis (ICA) dealing with multivariate dynamic data while SVM is a powerful tool for data classification. This methodology was applied to fault diagnosis in the simulation benchmark of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) plant. The approach compares the diagnosis performance obtained when applying ICA and DICA with SVM. In order to verify the fault diagnosis performance improvement with these techniques, the results are compared with the SVM performance when no feature extraction is used.

Rough set theory is a relatively new soft computing tool to deal with vagueness and uncertainty. It has received much attention of the researchers around the world. Rough set theory has been successfully applied to many areas including pattern recognition, machine learning, decision support, process control and predictive modeling. Due to incompleteness and complexity of fault diagnosis for power transformer, a specific fault diagnostic model based on rough set theory is presented in this paper. After the statistical analysis of the collected fault examples of oil-immersed power transformer and the use of rough set theory to reduce result, diagnosis rules are acquired and they could be used to improve the condition assessment of power transformer. The fault diagnose inference model was built based on the advantage of effectively simple decision rules and easy reality of rough sets. It simplifies the diagnose rules with no affecting the effect of diagnose. The significant advantage of the new method is that it can discriminate the indispensable alarm signals from dispensable ones that would not affect the correctness of the diagnosis results even if they are missing or erroneous.

Two main critical parameters of the fault tolerant nano-PLAs, the area and the number of crosspoint devices, are considered as optimization criteria for the synthesis. The paper introduces a method for synthesizing fault tolerant nano-PLA based FSMs. The method is based on decomposing an initial PLA description of the FSM into a three interacting portions. The proposed solution provides significant reduction of the area without meaningful increasing of a number of crosspoint devices in comparison with known solutions and provides a trade-off between the area and the number of devices in designing FSMs by PLAs.

The first one is based on the recursive least square algorithm where the second one is synthesized around the direct Lyapunov theory. The rapidity of convergence and dynamic precision of these parameter estimators are studied and compared when an unforeseeable rotor resistance default affects the model of the studied system. The validity and the robustness of both proposed estimators will be demonstrated via a simulation study. A performance synthesis of the studied estimators will be performed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of both estimators. This will lead to proceed to a future design and implementation of an online guaranteed stability default detection mechanism.

The unstable vibration signals of engine accelerating process are analyzed by cyclostationarity theory. The fault diagnostic rules are generated by combining signal acquiring process and extracted fault features. And support vector machine is then trained. The result shows that the feature extraction is effectively realized by using cyclostationarity theory. Second order cyclical frequency bands of characteristic can be found corresponding to specific cyclical frequency. The support vector machine is superior to neural network because of the high classification precision and strong generalization ability for small samples. The diagnostic precision can be improved by means of optimizing parameters greatly.

Fault diagnosis has been a major area of investigation among power system and intelligent system applications. This paper use Support Vector Machines (SVM) with strong generalization ability for small samples and fuzzy set theory of being suitable for solving uncertainty linear division relations to perform the recognition task for high voltage transmission line fault types. The simulation results show that the proposed method has the characteristic of simple and clear recognition process, it is able to identify fault types correctly and it is fit for any model structures of a transmission line. Consequently the recognition method for a transmission line fault types based on SVM technique completely overcomes the limitations by using common Multilayer Perceptions (MLP) classification methods, which achieves results by SVM with the transient data and steady-state simulations for transmission line fault mode spaces, and solves the essential problem for high voltage transmission lines.

After thoroughly analyzing the gas production mechanism of power transformer faults, it has been found that there are no explicit mapping functions between the single fault of power transformer and the content of gas. To handle this problem, a multi-class classification model for power transformer fault diagnosis based on least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is presented. Appropriate parameters are very crucial to the learning performance and generalization ability of LS-SVMs. However, the determination of LS-SVMs parameters, more dependent on experience, has always been a problem in research field. To overcome this problem, bacterial colony chemotaxis (BCC) algorithm is firstly introduced to select the LS-SVMs hyper-parameters in this paper. Finally, based on the concentration distribution of some typical fault gases, the proposed method is applied to recognize the faults, and ulteriorly a comparison with IEC three-ratio method, BP neural network (BPNN) and the model optimized by grid search is made in order to evaluate the method properly. Experimental results show that recognition rate of LS-SVMs with BCC is 18.52, 14.82 and 3.71 percents higher than that of IEC three-ratio method and BPNN and LS-SVMs with grid search, respectively. So the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method is proved.

During the last two decades, wavelet transform has been developing as one of the most powerful processors in various areas of science and technology. Many papers have been documented with different types of mother wavelet functions in various fields using different criteria (e.g. similarity between signals and mother wavelet). To name a few. machine condition monitoring including vibration, acoustic and ultrasonic signals, image processing, Electromyographic (EMG) and Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals have been taken into consideration using wavelet transform. The selection wavelet function represents an ongoing challenge in biosignal processing. This paper focuses on the selection of mother wavelet function for human biological signals. In this research, three measures were analyzed. These include surface and intramuscular EMG of the upper limb and psychophysical EEG in response to visual stimuli. 324 mother wavelet functions from wavelet families; including Haar, Daubechies (db), Symlet, Coiflet. Gaussian, Morlet, complex Morlet, Mexican hat. bio-orthogonal, reverse bio-orthogonal, Meyer, discrete approximation of Meyer, complex Gaussian, Shannon, and frequency B-spline were studied.

Vibration signals of a sophisticated motorcycle gearbox system were collected in four conditions: Normal Gearbox, Slight-Worn gear, Medium-Worn gear and Broken-Tooth gear. To monitor the gearbox failures, new features were introduced based on four statistical features: standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, and fourth central moment of continuous wavelet coefficients of synchronized vibration signals (CWC-SVS). Variance of CWC-SVS was selected as the pattern for finding the most similar mother wavelet function across gear vibrations. Among 324 mother wavelet candidates, results show that Daubechies 44 (db44) has a distinctive pattern across gearbox signals. In sum, drawbacks of mother wavelet selection in gearbox diagnostics have been developed in this research.	[Rafiee, J.; Rafiee, M.

And the rapidly increasing demanding of daily monitoring with onsite diagnosis and prognosis is driving homecare solutions to integrate more and more sensing and data processing capacities. So a powerful system is needed not only to address the medication noncompliance but also to be used as a Pervasive Healthcare Station in home. In this paper, a pervasive and preventive healthcare solution for medication noncompliance and daily monitoring is proposed using an intelligent package sealed by Controlled Delamination Material (CDM) and controlled by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Onsite diagnosis and prognosis capacities for kinds of health parameters are supported due to scalable and intensive computing capacitance of the 2D-Mesh-NoC based multi-core architecture. Additionally, friendly human-machine interface is emphasized to make it usable for the elderly, disabled and patients due to enhanced multimedia performance. Experimental results of an implemented prototype confirmed the necessity of the multi-core architecture and approved the feasibility of the proposed intelligent package.

The Continuous Wavelet Transform modulus is used for the extraction of specific frequency components that indicate this kind of fault in a machine. The obtained experimental results in machines connected to AC grid or driven by a three-phase inverter confirm the ability of the proposed technique to accurately identify these characteristic harmonic components of the stator current due to broken bars in asynchronous machines.

We generated binary classifiers using support vector machine (SVM) and conventional linear models for predicting perioperative cardiac events. Input data comprising clinical and surgical risk factors as well as SPECT findings was interpreted to predict the occurrence of all and hard cardiac events. Our SVM models achieved 0.884 and 0.892 in terms of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) in predicting all cardiac events and hard events respectively, and were shown to be superior to linear models for risk stratification. We also found an incremental prognostic value of SPECT results over information about clinical and surgical risk.

For our experiments we use training and testing data obtained from two benchmark industrial processes. The first set is simulated data generated from Tennessee Eastman process simulator and the second set is the data obtained by running experiment on a Three Tank system. Our results show that the C-SVM classifier gives the lowest classification error compared to other methods. However, the complexity and computation time become issues, which depend on the number of faults in the data and the data dimension. We also examined Principal Component Analysis, using PC scores as input features for the classifiers but the performance was not comparable to other classifiers' results. By selecting appropriate number of variables using contribution charts for classification, the performance of the classifiers on Tennessee Eastman data enhances significantly. Therefore, using contribution charts for selecting the most important variables is necessary when the number of variables is large.

An estimate of the amount of fatigue induced metallic debris in the lubricating oil of a mechanical system can help us plan maintenance schedules. A reliably designed preventive maintenance system can reduce lost productivity and prevent catastrophic failures by timely replacement or maintenance of mission critical mechanical components. Oil-debris sensors can provide the required information on the amount of metallic debris in oil return lines. These sensors generate a signal signature similar to a single full period sine wave with the passage of a metallic particle. As such, the output of these sensors can be analyzed and an estimate of the health state of mechanical system can be obtained. However, these sensors are sensitive to vibrations of the structure where the sensor is mounted. This sensitivity leads to the distortion of the signal output. Such signals are difficult to interpret and could be misleading. As such, an imperative step towards successful machinery fault detection is signal enhancement. In this paper, we apply empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique to extract particle signatures from the output of oil-debris sensors contaminated with vibration induced signal components. To reduce the computational burden, the acquired signal is lowpass filtered prior to the application of the EMD. The proposed algorithm has been tested using both simulated and experimental data and has shown to be effective.	[Bozchalooi, I.

However, it is very difficult to diagnose transfer faults accurately and quickly. This paper proposes a test precondition (called input-correct precondition) which is satisfied through the local test in the system development procedure. We further presents a transfer fault diagnosing method based on the finite state machine (FSM), which is applied to diagnose the possible transfer faults in an implementation that satisfies the input-correct precondition. The diagnosing method attempts to provide desirable transfer fault hints or locate some transfer faults accurately in terms of the protocol conformance test results.

Any fault of rotary part could bring about separator's strong vibration and noise. Not only can the strong vibration debase machine's separating efficiency, but it can also affect operator's health. Condition monitoring by vibration is a proper way to reduce loss brought by separator's faults. For dish centrifugal separator, helical gear's condition is closely related to Separator's working state. In this paper, main faults of dish centrifugal separator's helical gear are described. In order to analyze the dish centrifugal separator's vibration with different helical gear correctly, the vibration is tested with helical gear both under normal and abnormal condition. After comparing several general methods of gear's fault feature extraction, a new convenient and effective method is presented on the basis of analyzing vibration spectrum under different rotary velocity.

While the test of the memory array within the cache is usually accomplished resorting to BIST circuitry implementing March test inspired solutions, testing the cache controller logic poses some specific issues, mainly stemming from its limited accessibility. One possible solution consists in letting the processor execute suitable test programs, allowing the detection of possible faults by looking at the results they produce. In this paper we face the issue of generating suitable programs for testing the replacement logic in set-associative caches that implement a deterministic replacement policy. A test program generation approach based on modeling the replacement mechanism as a Finite State Machine (FSM) is proposed. Experimental results with a cache implementing a LRU policy are provided to assess the effectiveness of the method.	[Perez H, W. J.] Univ Valle, Grp Bionanoelect, Cali, Colombia; [Perez H, W.

Procedure designed belongs to simulation before test technique, where the fault models should be assumed at the before test stage (prototype stage). Both, parametric and catastrophic faults based on standard fault models are considered. Selected features from transient domain are classified at the after test stage with use of decision function, which has been designed by SVM algorithm. An exemplary benchmark has been tested and the results prove high classification ability of the SVM application.

And it classified the faults (within 2 diodes faults) as 7 patterns or 22 faults states according to distortion laws of excitation current. Taking 24/16 poles doubly salient electro-magnetic wind generator as a prototype, fault signals at great mass were gathered. Wavelet analysis of fault excitation current was processed and fault diagnosis was carried out by the fault pattern vectors established based on energy eigenvalue. Experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed fault diagnosis system.

The aim of this paper is to show a model-based methodology to detect, diagnose and prognosticate a fault in an electro-hydraulic primary flight control actuator that precedes an imminent failure. The model-based approach is versatile and can be easily applied on another system, whose model is available. The PHM solution proposed is dedicated to health monitoring and failure prediction of a generic primary flight control actuator. This model-based approach systematically assesses health state and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and consists of developing a model of the system for different flight conditions, the introduction of the failure mode. The RUL calculated is a time-to-failure whose confidence level depends on several conditions, such as model fidelity, sensor noise and precision of the data recorder.(12)	[Bizarria, Cintia de Oliveira] Empresa Brasileira Aeronaut SA, EMBRAER, Av Brigadeiro Faria Lima 2170, BR-12227901 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Yoneyama, Takashi] ITA, BR-228900 Sao Jose Dos Campos, Brazil		Bizarria, CD (corresponding author), Empresa Brasileira Aeronaut SA, EMBRAER, Av Brigadeiro Faria Lima 2170, BR-12227901 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.	cintia.bizarria@embraer.com.br; takashi@ita.br		Yoneyama, Takashi/0000-0001-5375-1076	Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), BrazilFinanciadora de Inovacao e Pesquisa (Finep)	This work was supported in part by Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), Brazil.

Validation of such predictions is an important but difficult proposition and a lack of appropriate evaluation methods renders prognostics meaningless. Evaluation methods currently used in the research community are not standardized and in many cases do not sufficiently assess key performance aspects expected out of a prognostics algorithm. In this paper we introduce several new evaluation metrics tailored for prognostics and show that they can effectively evaluate various algorithms as compared to other conventional metrics. Four prognostic algorithms, Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Polynomial Regression (PR), are compared. These algorithms vary in complexity and their ability to manage uncertainty around predicted estimates. Results show that the new metrics rank these algorithms in a different manner; depending on the requirements and constraints suitable metrics may be chosen. Beyond these results, this paper offers ideas about how metrics suitable to prognostics may be designed so that the evaluation procedure can be standardized.

C	Ma, ZS			IEEE	Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)			A New Life System Approach to the Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) with Survival Analysis, Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models, Evolutionary Game Theory, and Three-Layer Survivability Analysis	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT					In this paper, I propose a new architecture for PHM, which is characterized by life-system approach-treating PHM as a hierarchical system with fundamental properties similar to those of life systems. Conceptually, besides drawing on the important concepts from existing PHM theory and practice such as life cycle, condition-based maintenance (CBM), remaining useful lifetime (RUL), I draw on the dynamic hybrid fault models (DHF) from fault tolerance theory and agreement algorithms, three-la),er survivability analysis from survivable network systems (SNS), population dynamics from population ecology, and survival analysis from biostatistics and biomedicine. Methodologically, three main mathematical tools: survival analysis (including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis), dynamic hybrid fault models and evolutionary game theory (EGT) are applied for PHM modeling and analysis. Operationally, the three-layer survivability analysis is applied to deal with the so-called UUUR(Unpredictable, latent, Unobserved or Unobservable Risks) events and to achieve sound decision-making. Overall, the advantages of the new architecture include: (1) Offer a flexible architecture that is not only compatible with existing components/approaches of PHM, such as lifetime, reliability, maintainability, safety, data-driven prognostics, and model-based prognostics, but also readily extendable to incorporate fault tolerance, survivability, and security. (2) Utilize survival analysis, competing risks analysis, and multivariate survival analysis for better modeling of lifetime and reliability at both individual and population (group of components) levels.

Towards Prognostics for Electronics Components	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT					Electronics components have an increasingly critical role in avionics systems and in the development of future aircraft systems. Prognostics of such components is becoming a very important research field as a result of the need to provide aircraft systems with system level health management information. This paper focuses on a prognostics application for electronics components within avionics systems, and in particular its application to an Isolated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT). This application utilizes the remaining useful life prediction, accomplished by employing the particle filter framework, leveraging data from accelerated aging tests on IGBTs. These tests induced thermal-electrical overstresses by applying thermal cycling to the IGBT devices. In-situ state monitoring, including measurements of steady-state voltages and currents, electrical transients, and thermal transients are recorded and used as potential precursors of failure.(1,2)	[Saha, Bhaskar] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, MCT Inc, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Celaya, Jose R.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, RIACS, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Goebel, Kai F.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA; [Wysocki, Philip F.] NASA, Ames Res Ctr, ASRC Aerosp Corp, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA		Saha, B (corresponding author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, MCT Inc, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.	bhaskar.saha@nasa.gov; Jose.R.Celaya@mail.arc.nasa.gov; philip.wysocki@nasa.gov; kai.goebel@nasa.gov					AMERASEKA E, 1998, FAILURE MECH SEMICON; Arulampalam MS, 2002, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V50, P174, DOI 10.1109/78.978374; Buh GH, 2001, APPL PHYS LETT, V79, P2010, DOI 10.1063/1.1404404; DIAZ C, 1994, HEWLETTPACKARD J OCT, P106; GINART A, 2008, INT C PROGN HLTH MAN; GOODMAN DL, 2001, IEEE T COMPONENTS PA, V24; Kuntman A, 2004, SOLID STATE ELECTRON, V48, P217, DOI 10.1016/j.sse.2003.07.001; LIFSHITZ N, 1991, IEEE ELECTR DEVICE L, V12, P140, DOI 10.1109/55.75737; Lombardo S, 2005, J APPL PHYS, V98, DOI 10.1063/1.2147714; Morozumi A, 2003, IEEE T IND APPL, V39, P665, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2003.810661; ORSAGH R, 2005, IEEE AER C; PATIL N, 2008, INT C PROGN HLTH MAN; REYNOLDS F, 1974, P IEEE, V62; SAHA B, 2008, IEEE AER C; SONNENFELD G, 2008, IEEE AUT; Trivedi M, 1999, IEEE T POWER ELECTR, V14, P108, DOI 10.1109/63.737598; WU WC, 1995, ISPSD '95 - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON POWER SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES & ICS, P330, DOI 10.1109/ISPSD.1995.515059	17	1	1	2	10	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1095-323X		978-1-4244-2621-8	AEROSP CONF PROC			2009							3737	+					4	Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BME07	WOS:000271964001117					2022-02-14

Without prognostics, catastrophic, intermittent, and damage propagation faults can compromise the integrity of even the best power systems over time. The problem posed by physical limitations, such as size, weight, and wiring, prevents the upgrade of in-flight power systems with prognostic equipment. The solution is development of a non-intrusive prognostic technologies suite designed for minimal impact on existing systems. Specifically, we explore a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to prognosticate the servo loop of an EMA. Results of this study indicate that a fault-progression methodology overcomes some of the disadvantages of the more familiar FMEA approach, which does not account for the contribution of unobserved failure to a degradation trajectory. We show by example how the Ring-down methodology, often used in power systems, can be adapted to servo loop systems employed in aircraft actuator. Adoption of this approach to electronic prognostics improves monitoring of the behavior and health of key or critical components not only ensures safety and success, it makes dynamic switching to back-up systems, fault mitigation, load-shedding, and condition-based maintenance (CBM) technically and economically feasible.(12)	[Kunst, Neil; Judkins, Justin; Lynn, Chris; Goodman, Doug] Ridgetop Grp Inc, Tucson, AZ 85704 USA		Kunst, N (corresponding author), Ridgetop Grp Inc, 6595 N Oracle Rd, Tucson, AZ 85704 USA.	nkunst@ridgetopgroup.com; justin@ridgetopgroup.com; clynn@ridgetopgroup.com; doug@ridgetopgroup.com					VOHNOUT, 2008, IEEE AER C BIG SKY M	1	2	2	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1095-323X		978-1-4244-2621-8	AEROSP CONF PROC			2009							3761	3767					7	Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BME07	WOS:000271964001120					2022-02-14

Defining Requirements for Advanced PHM Technologies for Optimal Reliability Centered Maintenance	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT					Condition Based Maintenance Plus (CBM+) can be described as optimal condition based maintenance (CBM) procedures defined by applying the principles and process of Reliability Centered Maintenance. This approach offers a rigorous and disciplined method, based on the system FMECA, to determine the least cost maintenance policy and procedures that are consistent with acceptable levels of safety and readiness, applying available prognosis and health management tools. It is argued that the same process is the preferred method to define requirements for advanced PHM technologies based on RCM derived capability gaps, preferably accounting for synergies with concurrent continuous (maintenance) process improvement. There may be synergies in coupling this process with Continuous Process Improvement programs, such as NAVAIR's AIRSPEED. In discussing this proposed approach, several issues are addressed. The first is the question of interdependence between incommensurable safety, affordability and readiness objectives and metrics. The second is the problem of uncertainty in the FMECA failure modes and probabilities until the system and equipment has accumulated considerable service history, while still subject to the emergence or aggravation of failure modes by mission exposure, component deterioration, quality escapes and intentional configuration change. In practice it may be necessary to fall back on less rigorous (semi)qualitative methods to target innovation. In any case, more adaptable PHM architectures are needed to mitigate inevitable uncertainty in requirements.. Note: the terms equipment health management (also, more specifically, engine health management) [EHM] and prognostic health management (or prognosis and health management) [PHM] are used with little distinction in this paper, but in general PHM is restricted to methods generating estimates of remaining useful life.(1 2 3)	USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Syst Engn, Patuxent River, MD 20670 USA		Millar, RC (corresponding author), USN, Postgrad Sch, Dept Syst Engn, 22783 Cedar Point Rd, Patuxent River, MD 20670 USA.	rcmillar@nps.edu					[Anonymous], 2005, 0025403 NAVAIR; *DEF ACQ SYST DEP, 2003, 50001 DEF ACQ SYST D; KRATZ LA, 2007, DEFENSE ACQUISTION U; KREIG KJ, 2007, 415122 US DEP DEF UN; MILLAR RC, 2008, IEEE 2009 AER C MARC; VENELET DJ, 2007, 479020V NAVAIR US NA; MATERIEL READINESS M	7	0	0	0	5	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1095-323X		978-1-4244-2621-8	AEROSP CONF PROC			2009							3785	3791					7	Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BME07	WOS:000271964001123					2022-02-14

Current maintenance methods associated with this degradation are not sufficiently optimized for cost and performance. To address this issue, the United States Army is implementing a policy of Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and being supported by the Army Materiel System Analysis Activity (AMSAA). CBM is a plan of maintenance for a system based upon the actual condition of the system as enabled by the application of usage, diagnostic and prognostic processes executed on a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS). AMSAA has developed and is implementing a CBM system for ground vehicles. This development process has included the development of a robust military-grade HUMS in conjunction with the Aberdeen Test Center and the development of data collection, reduction, analysis, and reporting processes. A key requirement underlying these processes is a thorough understanding of both the ways in which system condition is degenerated and the ability of the HUMS to detect, identify, and communicate all conditions that requires maintenance in a timely manner. AMSAA and the US Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) have jointly initiated testing and applications as the critical means of filling this requirement.(1 2)	[Rabeno, Eric; Bounds, Mark] USA, Mat Syst Anal Activ AMSAA, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA		Rabeno, E (corresponding author), USA, Mat Syst Anal Activ AMSAA, 392 Hopkins Rd,Bldg 392 AMSRD AMS LA, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005 USA.	eric.l.rabeno@us.army.mil; mark.s.bounds@us.army.mil						0	0	0	0	3	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1095-323X		978-1-4244-2621-8	AEROSP CONF PROC			2009							3792	3797					6	Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BME07	WOS:000271964001124					2022-02-14

Hierarchical Fault Diagnosis and Health Monitoring in Multi-platform Space Systems	2009 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-7	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009	Big Sky, MT				DESIGN	Current spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis practices that involve around-the-clock limit-checking and trend analysis on large amount of telemetry data, do not scale well for future multi-platform space missions due to the presence of larger amount of telemetry data and an increasing need to make the long-duration missions cost-effective by limiting the size of the operations team. The need for efficient utilization of telemetry data by employing machine learning and rule-based reasoning has been pointed out in the literature in order to enhance diagnostic performance and assist the less-experienced personnel in performing monitoring and diagnosis tasks. In this research we develop a systematic and transparent fault diagnosis methodology within a hierarchical fault diagnosis framework for multi-platform space systems. Our proposed Bayesian network-based hierarchical fault diagnosis methodology allows fuzzy rule-based reasoning at different components in the hierarchy. Due to the unavailability of real formation flight data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by using synthetic data of a leader-follower formation flight. Our proposed methodology is likely to enhance the level of autonomy in ground support based spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis.

An intelligent shop floor is one that is able to react to changes that are occurring in a positive way. To give the early warning of the system/equipment health conditions and job execution capability to the supervisory control will improve the productivity and efficiency of the shop floor. This paper presents a new concept called iDiagnosis & Prognosis - an intelligent diagnosis, prognosis, manufacturing system condition and job execution capability assessment system based on the Internet, web service and agent technologies. The paper introduces the basic concept of iDiagnosis & Prognosis. The proposed approach provides system functions, architecture and system components. The iDiagnosis & Prognosis dynamic model encompasses both information flow and event handling of the shop floor dynamics.

This paper presents a contract support vector machine to extract the effective information from data and eliminate the redundant attribute among different data. Then utilize the support vector machine to classify the failures effectively on condition of limit samples. Application of piston head looseness indicates that the contract support vector machine not only can decrease the calculation of feature extraction but also can classify the failures effectively under limit samples.

The desire to apply this approach to a majority of new and legacy platforms has led to the development of a prototype radio frequency identification (RFID) tag with both serial and wireless communications capabilities that can be easily configured to different mechanical and electrical systems. This paper addresses the command architecture used for inter-node communication within the data acquisition network, and verifies the RFID's data collection capabilities by obtaining vibration signatures from bearings running on a machinery fault simulator. The vibration signatures from the RFID are compared to those obtained from a proven data acquisition method.

The paper presents the results of the implementation of two fault location algorithms in ATP-EMTP program. Some ATP-MODELS modules were associated to the ATP model of different transmission grids, these modules being developed on basis of Takagi algorithm applied in two-machine systems and on basis of one algorithm processing synchronized positive-sequence phasor quantities on both transmission lines' terminals. DFT and A3 type filters were used to calculate the fundamental frequency phasors of the transient voltages and currents. There are presented sonic simulations', the considered parameters of the presented analysis being: line's load, fault's type and resistance and fault position along the overseen line.

Meeting strength and quality requirements for welding seams is of eminent significance in automobile design. Unfortunately, there might be problems due to the degassing gaps needed between the joining parts when using the galvanized sheet metal that is customary in car body design. This causes incomplete fusion to form with excessively large gap dimensions that cannot be identified from outside. Nor do process monitoring systems available on the market detect these faults with sufficient reliability. VW Sachsen GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology studied the reasons for the inadequacies of conventional systems in the MAINE X joint research project. This article presents the findings and makes recommendations for sufficient methods of detection.

The objective of the machine is to apply periodical forces to restored teeth and to detect the teeth collapse calculating the number of cycles until the fault occurs. There is a Scottish yoke mechanism that converts the torque of a brushless motor on linear forces. This motor is driven by a power drive that receives the torque reference from a computer operating on real-time, and where the fault detection algorithm is applied. There is also a user computer where the parameters of the assay are introduced and where the results are shown. In this work the control system that has been implemented is shown in detail and the developed fault algorithm with adaptive threshold for the system with several sampling times is addressed.

No external sensor is required. A dedicated test cycle, of at least 4-8 seconds long, is run regularly on the axis under examination. The motion data, i.e. position, velocity and torque references is logged and stored in a file. The file is later on subject for automatic backlash analysis. The sampled data is analyzed and the so called backlash energy, invented in this work, is calculated and stored in a database. The stored data are trended and the criticality of the eventual backlash enlargement is established using a number of statistical methods for the unit under examination. The proposed method is verified in three different experiments on total 19 (13+5+1) different movable mechanical units and corresponding transmission units with very good results.

Air-gap irregularities and related monitoring techniques for synchronous machines have been studied in the past mainly it bout large vertical hydro-generators [1], but similar issues have been recently recognized as worthy of attention for on-board ship generators. Static anti dynamic rotor eccentricities were simulated in this work, for a medium power ship brushless generator, by using it dynamic model including inductances computed by parametric 3D FEM and MWFA-based analyses of the faulty machine, and taking in account the damping effect of the parallel paths inside the machine. Current, voltage, and no-load e.m.f.. steady-state waveforms were analyzed by FFT. No-load voltage harmonics are sensitive fault indicators, whose harmonic content directly reflects level and type of eccentricity and which can he used for diagnostic purposes.

Application of Commercial Protective Relays for Monitoring the Insulation Condition of Stator Windings of AC Machines	2009 IEEE ELECTRICAL INSULATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	29th Electrical Insulation Conference	MAY 31-JUN 03, 2009	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Dielect & Elect Insulat Soc			MOTOR PRIMER; DIAGNOSIS	Stator insulation failure during machine operation can lead to a catastrophic machine failure resulting in a costly forced outage. If the insulation condition can be assessed online, more accurate and reliable diagnostic information on insulation condition and its remaining life can be provided to the machine user or operator. Nowadays AC machines, especially in important industries are equipped with computer-based protective relays applied for protecting the machine against electrical faults. Given the limitations of the state-of-the-art in this area and the potential benefits of online insulation condition assessment, the objective of this paper is to develop an effective and practical technique that is capable of relatively monitoring the overall condition of the stator winding insulation online by using commercial computer-based protective relays normally used for electrical protection of machines. The extent of monitoring and the domain of diagnosis that can be obtained depend on the capability of commercial protective relays, which will be investigated in this paper.

An Adaptive Noise-Cancellation Method for Detecting Generalized Roughness Bearing Faults under Dynamic Load Conditions	2009 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition	SEP 20-24, 2009	San Jose, CA	IEEE		Bearings (mechanical); induction machine; sensorless fault diagnostics; bearing failure; generalized roughness; noise cancellation; vibration		This paper proposes an adaptive noise-cancellation (ANC) method for detecting incipient bearing faults, i.e., generalized roughness, with a special focus on dynamic motor operations, including variable-load and variable-frequency conditions. The correlated frequency components in the motor stator current are treated as "noise" to the bearing fault detection and estimated using an adaptive Wiener filter. These estimated noise components are then subtracted from the original motor current and the remaining noise-cancelled current is normalized as the bearing fault index. The Wiener filter parameters are updated for each algorithm iteration, making the calculation of the wideband noise in the motor current (i.e. the bearing fault signatures), and thus adapt to changes of load and frequency, i.e. are independent of load and frequency variations. The feasibility of the proposed method has been primarily validated from experimental results of multiple bearings for different operating conditions. The operating conditions tested in this paper include constant load/frequency, variable load and variable frequency.

This paper addresses the detection of damages of the bearings in servo motors and presents new results of the industrial application of a new developed diagnosis method for detecting such based on frequency response analysis. In the experimental work a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is used and two different cases are considered: first, only the machine under no-load condition is investigated, afterwards the driving machine was installed in a two-mass-system simulating real conditions. The experimental results show that the method for damage detection works in both cases. In contrast to former publications the present paper shows results obtained on bearing faults in motors coming from the field to the repair shop. The measurement of the required signals (current and speed) can be accomplished during operation of the plant in closed loop speed control. The system is excited by pseudo random binary test-signals (PRBS). The deviations between the frequency response obtained during the commissioning of the plant and the curve measured under fault condition serve as indicators for the damage.

A Two-Step Method for Estimating the Parameters of Induction Machine Models	2009 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition	SEP 20-24, 2009	San Jose, CA	IEEE		Induction machines; parameter estimation; fault diagnosis	NONLINEAR LEAST-SQUARES; MOTOR PARAMETERS; IDENTIFICATION	This paper describes and demonstrates a mathematical algorithm that can monitor the physical parameters of the motor solely by observing the stator electrical currents. This method uses measurements of transient stator currents to identify the parameters of an electromechanical model of the induction motor. These parameters are obtained from a relatively poor initial guess, which is constrained only to be within an order of magnitude of the physical parameters, by using a two-step strategy based upon nonlinear least-squares regression techniques. This makes the approach in this paper useful for diagnostic monitoring and energy scorekeeping. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on identifying the parameters of a 1 HP induction motor connected to a squirrel cage fan in an air-handling unit.

Automated Detection of Rotor Faults for Inverter-fed Induction Machines under Standstill Conditions	2009 IEEE ENERGY CONVERSION CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition	SEP 20-24, 2009	San Jose, CA	IEEE		AC Machine; Broken Rotor Bar; Condition Monitoring; Diagnostics; Induction Motor; Inverter; Off-line Testing; Pulsating Magnetic Field; Squirrel Cage Rotor	DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; BARS	It is difficult to apply conventional on-line MCSA techniques for diagnosis of rotor faults for closed loop induction motor drives for many applications due to the masking effect of the feedback current controller and/or variable frequency or load operation. Relying solely on traditional off-line inspection techniques during regular maintenance does not allow frequent monitoring of rotor problems and is inconvenient since it requires rotor disassembly and/or manual rotor rotation. In this paper, a new automated technique for testing inverter-fed squirrel cage induction machines at standstill for rotor faults is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to excite the machine with a pulsating field at a number of angular positions to observe the variation in the impedance pattern due to broken rotor bars, whenever the motor is stopped. An experimental study on a 7.5hp induction motor verifies that broken bars can be detected with high sensitivity and reliability. It will be shown that the proposed method can provide automated and reliable assessment of rotor condition frequently without motor disassembly, manual rotation, or additional instrumentation. The proposed test can also provide rotor quality assessment independent of variations in motor or load operating conditions since it is a standstill test.

These troubles cause characteristic spectral components in many drive quantities, but for economic reasons the electrical quantities, already sensed for drive control purposes, are preferable; among them current signals (i.e. MCSA) are the electric signals of choice to detect the machine conditions. Each trouble produces spectral lines at typical frequencies in the stator current: monitoring them is a usual procedure but the threshold to discern acceptable intrinsic defects from alarming situations is hardly defined. This paper presents an attempt to formulate a mixed eccentricity index developed through the interaction between static and dynamic eccentricity on stator windings and rotor cage. The index can be detected by a no-load test without any spectral resolution problem and it does not require any preliminary knowledge of machine health condition.

The breakdown of these medium voltage motors not only leads to high repair expenses, but also causes extraordinary financial losses due to unexpected downtime. To provide reliable condition monitoring and protection for medium voltage motors, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing condition monitoring and protection methods in the following five areas: thermal protection and temperature estimation, stator insulation monitoring and fault detection, bearing fault detection, broken rotor bar/end-ring detection, and air-gap eccentricity detection. For each category, the related features of medium voltage motors are discussed; the effectiveness of the existing methods are discussed in terms of their robustness, accuracy and implementation complexity; recommendations for the future research in these areas are also presented.

Initially, a reduced scale (1/1275) experimental set-up of the traction part is developed and instrumented based on the extrapolation of real scale parameters. Previous studies on an elementary gearbox-based electromechanical system have shown how the transmission error, the different eccentricities of the pinion and the wheel, and the teeth contact stiffness variation, influence the electrical machine torque and stator current. In this way, it will be demonstrated that the electrical machine can be considered as a sensor by itself through the electromagnetic torque estimation for torsional vibration monitoring without any extra mechanical sensor. The results of the electromagnetic torque estimation are compared with the measured mechanical torque in steady-state condition to validate the proposed technique.

The application of predictive techniques also makes it possible to monitor and supervise critical systems without needing to interrupt their use and to apply individual preventive or corrective measures for each piece of machinery according to its condition. Traction motors are critical elements in railway vehicles, it also being necessary to bear in mind the special working conditions to which they are subjected in the case of underground railway operations. One peculiarity of the environment in which electric railway motors work is that practically the whole network is underground, with a great amount of dirt existing. This dirt, which contains a high concentration of ferromagnetic particles, gets inside the traction motors through the ventilation grilles and accumulates in the air gap in the machinery. This contamination influences stator winding insulation features, since it is highly abrasive and conducts electricity. This work presents a new predictive maintenance method based in leakage flux for diagnosing the level of dirt in railway motors, taking advantage of the ferromagnetic features of this dirt without any need for disconnecting operations, only planning preventive maintenance operations when they are really necessary.

C	Yan, JH; Guo, CZ			IEEE	Yan, Jihong; Guo, Chaozhong			A FCM-Weighted Markov Model for Remaining Life Prediction	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION AND LOGISTICS ( ICAL 2009), VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Automation and Logistics	AUG 05-07, 2009	Shenyang, PEOPLES R CHINA			Remaining life Prediction; FCM; Weighted Markov model		With the development of fault prognostics, remaining life prediction is becoming more and more important as a crucial technology of prognostics. In this paper, an improved Markov model is proposed for remaining life prediction. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm is employed to perform states division of Markov model in order to avoid the uncertainty of states division depending on personal experience. A FCM-Weighted Markov model is established with eigenvalue level theory to conduct performance degradation and remaining life prediction. Multi-sample prediction is implemented in the application of the FCM-Weighted Markov model. A comparison between basic Markov model and FCM-Weighted Markov model for prediction has been made by simulation data. The results illustrate that the latter model is of better prediction performance. Finally, experiment data collected from a Bently-RK4 rotor unbalance test-bed is applied to validate the FCM-Weighted Markov model, and the effectiveness of the methodology has been proved.

In that case, the method of cyclostationary analysis is very effective for extracting and demodulating the modulating signal that usually contains some fault message. However, duo to a good many factors, such as the special construction, the amalgamation of multiple faults and the fluctuation of rotating speed etc., the cyclostationary analysis result of rolling bearing vibration signal become complex and is difficult to identify fault features with naked eyes. By means of the dynamic identification ability of CHMM, this paper proposes a new fault diagnosis scheme of rolling bearings based on cyclostationarity and CHMM. Experiment results show that single-fault and multi-fault can be recognized by this approach.

Concomitantly, there is an increased trend towards the forecasting of system degradation through a prognostic process to fulfill the needs of customers demanding high vehicle availability. Prognosis is viewed as an add-on capability to diagnosis that assesses the current health of a system and predicts its remaining life based on sensed features that capture the gradual degradation in the operation of the vehicle. This paper discusses a hybrid model-based, data-driven and knowledge-based integrated diagnosis and prognosis framework, and applies it to automotive (suspension and battery systems) and on-board electronic systems.

Fault Diagnosis and Failure Prognosis for Engineering Systems: A Global Perspective	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering	AUG 22-25, 2009	Bangalore, INDIA	IEEE				Engineering systems, such as aircraft, industrial processes, manufacturing systems, transportation systems, electrical and electronic systems, etc., are becoming more complex and are subjected to failure modes that impact adversely their reliability, availability, safety and maintainability. Such critical assets are required to be available when needed, and maintained on the basis of their current condition rather than on the basis of scheduled or breakdown maintenance practices. Moreover, on-line, real-time fault diagnosis and prognosis can assist the operator to avoid catastrophic events. Recent advances in Condition-Based Maintenance and Prognostics and Health Management (CBM/PHM) have prompted the development of new and innovative algorithms for fault, or incipient failure, diagnosis and failure prognosis aimed at improving the performance of critical systems. This paper introduces an integrated systems-based framework (architecture) for diagnosis and prognosis that is generic and applicable to a variety of engineering systems. The enabling technologies are based on suitable health monitoring hardware and software, data processing methods that focus on extracting features or condition indicators from raw data via data mining and sensor fusion tools, accurate diagnostic and prognostic algorithms that borrow from Bayesian estimation theory, and specifically particle filtering, fatigue or degradation modeling, and real-time measurements to declare a fault with prescribed confidence and given false alarm rate while predicting accurately and precisely the remaining useful life of the failing component/system. Potential benefits to industry include reduced maintenance costs, improved equipment uptime and safety. The approach is illustrated with examples from the aircraft and industrial domains.					, 叶叶叶/ABE-1619-2020				BUTCHER SW, 2000, LG9031B1; BYINGTON CS, 1997, 51 M SOC MFPT APR; ORCHARD M, 2005, P WORLD TRIB C 3 WAS; PATRICK R, 2009, P IEEE AER C BIG SKY; QIN B, 2000011160 SOC AUT E; ROSENBERG BJ, 1989, P IEEE NAT AER EL C, V3, P1334; Vachtsevanos G., 2006, INTELLIGENT FAULT DI; Vichare NM, 2006, IEEE T COMPON PACK T, V29, P222, DOI [10.1109/TCAPT.2006., 10.1109/TCAPT.2006]; Zhang B., 2008, INT C PROGN HLTH MAN; Zhang B, 2009, IEEE T INSTRUM MEAS, V58, P303, DOI 10.1109/TIM.2008.2005963	10	27	27	1	21	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2161-8070		978-1-4244-4578-3	IEEE INT CON AUTO SC			2009							108	115		10.1109/COASE.2009.5234094			8	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering	BOD54	WOS:000276311700021					2022-02-14

At the same time, multi-core CPUs evolution continued and today's CPUs have 4-8 cores. These two trends, however, have followed independent paths in the sense that we are aware of very few works that consider both devices cooperating to solve general computations. In this paper we investigate the coordinated use of CPU and GPU to improve efficiency of applications even further than using either device independently. We use Anthill runtime environment, a data-flow oriented framework in which applications are decomposed into a set of event-driven filters, where for each event, the runtime system can use either GPU or CPU for its processing. For evaluation, we use a histopathology application that uses image analysis techniques to classify tumor images for neuroblastoma prognosis. Our experimental environment includes dual and octa-core machines, augmented with GPUs and we evaluate our approach's performance for standalone and distributed executions. Our experiments show that a pure GPU optimization of the application achieved a factor of 15 to 49 times improvement over the single core CPU version, depending on the versions of the CPUs and GPUs. We also show that the execution can be further reduced by a factor of about 2 by using our runtime system that effectively choreographs the execution to run cooperatively both on GPU and on a single core of CPU. We improve on that by adding more cores, all of which were previously neglected or used ineffectively. In addition, the evaluation on a distributed environment has shown near linear scalability to multiple hosts.

Providing a quantitative analysis by machine vision is desired for a determination of the grading result. However, the cells on the biopsy are not all in the some depth of focus under the microscope. Some cells in the images captured by machine may become a blur with a small variance of focus. These cells may not be segmented from images or segmented into a undesized shape and thus affect the grading results. Consequently, an "all-in-focus image" is very useful to the grading of Hepatocellular Carcinoma performed by the machine. In this paper, we proposed an image fusion approach based on the wavelet-based focus measure to fuse two images with different depth of focus into one image, which contains much more in-depth focus cells. In our experiments, we demonstrated that the fused images not only provide clear appearance of cells but also higher accuracy of grading than original images.

The hybrid intelligent diagnosis model based on neighborhood rough set is constructed in different granular levels, and the results of support vector machines (SVMS) and artificial neural network (ANN) in granular levels are combined by criterion matrix algorithm as output of hybrid intelligent diagnosis. Finally, the proposed model is applied to fault diagnosis in roller bearings of high-speed locomotive. The applied results show that the classification accuracy of hybrid model reaches to 97.96%, which is 8.49% and 39.12% higher than the classification accuracy of SVMS and ANN respectively. It shows that the proposed model as a new common algorithm can reliably recognize different fault categories and effectively enhance robustness of the hybrid intelligent diagnosis model.

Related works reported that efficiency and availability depend heavily on high reliability and maintainability. Recently, the concept of e-maintenance has been introduced to reduce the cost of maintenance. In e-maintenance systems, the intelligent fault detection system plays a crucial role for identifying failures. Machine learning techniques are at the core of such intelligent systems and can greatly influence their performance. Applying these techniques to fault detection makes it possible to shorten shutdown maintenance and thus increase the capacity utilization rates of equipment. Therefore, this work applies Back-propagation Neural Networks (BPN) to analyze the failures of turbines in thermal power facilities.

And a fault diagnosis model of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) based on an improved binary tree multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is constructed. This method overcomes the disadvantage that the traditional binary tree, which doesn't consider the distributing situation of the data sets, constructs directly the SVM classifier. At the same time, the two-divided method presented by the paper is applied in the choice of the optimal parameters of SVM. The experiment is performed and this method acquires a better performance.

This paper describes an approach of soft fault diagnosis for analog circuits based on least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA), known as AGA-LS-SVM. AGA is applied to optimize the parameters of LS-SVM, and fault features are extracted front the frequency domain response of circuit under test (CUT) and the LS-SVM which trained by the fault features is used to recognize the unknown faults. The experimental results demonstrate that LS-SVM optimized by AGA performs better forecast accuracy and successful modeling of diagnosing analog circuits fault.

In particular, a dynamic model is derived and applied to on-line detection of fouling in the aircraft ECS crossflow plate-and-fin heat exchanger. Predictive maintenance actions can be scheduled as per the on-line detected fouling status of the specific component, supporting condition based maintenance. The heat exchanger model is of the lumped state space form where the state is represented by the core and fin temperatures. The ratios of the thermal capacities of the masses of the two air streams to the thermal capacity of the core itself are negligibly small, and hence can be equated to zero. The model parameters' functional dependency of mass flow rate and inclusion of secondary surfaces (fins) accurately describes the dynamic behavior of the heat exchanger. Since the parameters are functions of mass flow rate as are the core and fin temperatures, and the model is nonlinear in the state variables, the extended Kalman filtering (EKF) algorithm is applied to estimate the state dependent parameters. The model's formulation is justified by the quality of the predicted results, as validated via experimental tests.

This method is attractive for many fields of applied sciences and engineering including medicine, telecommunication, audio processing, noise reduction or data processing, health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of machine. However, the results by the existing BSS algorithms are often not enough for the subsequent signals analysis, on account of the limited assumption on the mixture models. In this paper, special improvements on the existing BSS algorithms were made, which made it possible to restore sources waveform more accurately. The validity of the new method was verified by several selected experiments, which further showed the potential of such technique in practice.

It will bring serious damage to mechanical equipment. A new diagnosis method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Firstly, signals are decomposed into a finite number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).Then, the maximal singular values of the every single of IMF are defined as the feature vectors and served as input parameters of SVM classifiers to classify fault patterns of rotating machinery. Meanwhile the way was used on the rub impact fault identification of dual-disk over-hung rotor-bearing system. Experimental results show that the way can be more effectively and accurately than conventional BP and RBF neural networks, and has high robustness, good generalization ability as well.

Wavelet packet decompresses vibration signals, and wavelet packet nodes sensitive to the change of state, as eigen-nodes, form a decomposition tree; the Signal restructured at all eigen-nodes can be used as the fingerprint in many breaker diagnostic systems.

Vibration attenuation control on HMBs	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHATRONICS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics (ICM 2009)	APR 14-17, 2009	Malaga, SPAIN	IEEE				The article describes the study of the vibration control of unbalanced shafts supported by (active-passive) or hybrid magnetic bearings (HMBs). The vibration control study is carried out on the magnetic active part (stator) of a HMB on the basis of a diagnosis of the shaft dynamics. Since the mechanical faults affecting an active magnetic bearing has its origin in the machine rotor due to mechanical and/or magnetic disturbances, coils current is a reliable variable which can be measured and controlled simultaneously based on the electromagnets models and real time measurements. The vibration (amplitude, frequency and phase) is measured and a compensation current computed for amplitude and shifted phase is applied to attenuate the shaft vibration. Achieved results on a case study are compared with real-time vibration control results, being shown and discussed.				ferreiro@udc.es; jlcalvo@cdf.udc.es; m.haro@uca.es	Calvo-Rolle, José Luis/F-3921-2012	Calvo-Rolle, José Luis/0000-0002-2333-8405			ABDELFATAH, 1977, P 1997 IEEE INT C CO, P586; BLANCOORTEGA A, 1998, ON LINE ALGEBRAIC ID; Duan GR, 2000, IEEE T IND APPL, V36, P1654, DOI 10.1109/28.887218; DUM GR, 1999, ROBUST ACTIVE MAGNET; JOHNSON D, 1998, P AM CONTR C PHIL PE; JUNGSIK, 2003, SENSORLESS POSITION, P83; Kim S.-J., 1999, IEEE ASME T MECHATRO, V4; Komori M, 2003, IEEE T APPL SUPERCON, V13, P2189, DOI 10.1109/TASC.2003.813031; LEE CW, 1994, P 4 INT S MAGN BEAR, P305; Li LC, 2004, IEEE T MAGN, V40, P3512, DOI 10.1109/TMAG.2004.836295; MAZENC F, 2006, IEEE T CONTROL SYSTE, V14; MIZUNO T, 1995, THESSTABILITY CONTRO, P1599; SIVADASAN, 1996, IEEE T MAGNETICS, V32; VISCHER, 1993, IEEE T MAGNETICS, V29; VISHER D, 1990, P 2 INT S MAGN BEAR, P301; ZHANG YS, 2003, SIMPLE NOVEL APPROAC, V125, DOI DOI 10.1115/1.1541670; Zhou S., 2001, SHOCK VIB DIGIT, V33, P361, DOI DOI 10.1177/058310240103300501	17	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-4194-5				2009							415	420					6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Mechanics	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Mechanics	BMP35	WOS:000273269400071					2022-02-14

KPCA is used as a preprocessor of LSSVM, which maps the original input feature into a higher dimension feature space through a nonlinear map, the principal components are then found in the higher dimension feature space. Then the hyperparameters of LSSVM are optimized by particle swarm optimization. Then we compared the accuracies of the hybrid KPCA-LSSVM mode with other artificial intelligence (BPNN and fixed-SVM). The experimental results showed that KPCA based on LS-SVM has a higher correct recognition rate, and a faster computational speed.

Furthermore, the fault criteria set for the severity of the detected fault signature has still been a challenge due to the dynamic behavior of the fault-related signatures in the motor line current. Therefore a generalized solution is needed for multi-phase systems including the adaptive threshold that validates the fault detection algorithm through the entire operation range. In this paper, it is focused on a mathematical analysis of conventional DSP algorithms, frequency tone detectors, including Park's vector approaches. Based on the analysis, it is theoretically extended and simulated for a contribution of a future online fault diagnosis of multiphase machine.	[Choi, S. D.; Rahimian, M. M.; Toliyat, H.

In this paper a new method of fault detection and treatment for open circuit faults in 5-phase PMSM has been investigated. In the proposed technique the stator electrical faults are detected and then cleared. As the optimum performance is of great importance in industrial applications the excitation of the remaining healthy phases should be modified to attain the maximum output torque per input phase current. The field reconstruction method has been used in conjunction with optimization methods to find the proper excitation.

The phase independence characteristics of the SRM enable it to operate also under partial phase failure conditions also in its classical construction. Its reliability can be improved by applying special fault-tolerant designs, respectively monitoring its condition and applying fault detection techniques. The SRMs used in such safe electrical drive systems has to be fed from power converters having also fault-tolerant capability. In the paper two SRMs are proposed together with their converters. The fault tolerance capacities of the two electrical drive systems are compared by means of simulations. Two advanced simulation platforms were coupled together to simulate the drive system. The results of the comparative study emphasize the usefulness of the proposed fault-tolerant electrical drive system. The conclusions of study help the users to select the best fitted variant for they specific application.

Because the line current utility driven motors involve interference components such as low order harmonics, high frequency disturbances, and the noise generated by harsh industrial environment, the fault analyses yield erroneous or fluctuating fault signatures. Mostly, the amplitudes of these components are higher than those of the fault signature itself and neither their existence nor behavior is predictable. The precision of the fault diagnosis methods mostly suffers from these high energy components and the ambiguity caused by them Here, a new method is proposed to monitor and detect the fault signature through the noise ambiguity estimation of a motor current signal, which is cooperatively used to further enhance the fault diagnosis capability and reliability of the familiar FFT technique. The proposed algorithm is mathematically derived in detail and experimentally verified using a 3-hp motor generator setup.	[Choi, S. D.; Rahimian, M. M.; Toliyat, H.

These stator spectral components can include voltage, current and power and are used to detect turn faults, broken rotor bars, bearing failures and air gap eccentricities. Presently, many techniques that are based on steady-state analysis are being applied to induction machines. However, induction motors are not always operating under complete steady state conditions, therefore prompting the development of non-stationary techniques for fault detection. In this paper, it will be shown how the steady-state fault detection technique, Extended Park's Vector Approach (EPVA), can be improved to detect inter-turn faults during transients by incorporating the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the detection scheme. The new technique shows that stator turn faults can be unambiguously detected under transient conditions.	[Barendse, P. S.; Herndler, B.; Khan, M.

Integrated Prognosis of AC Servo Motor Driven Linear Actuator Using Hidden Semi-Markov Models	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES & DRIVES CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC 2009)	MAY 03-06, 2009	Miami, FL	IEEE Power & Energy Soc (PES), IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Miami Sect, ABB, MagneForce Software Syst, Ansoft, LLC, Infolytica Corp, POWERSYS, Bakker Magnet, MotorSolver, Magsoft Corp, Cobham Tech Services, Vector Fields Software, Elect Concepts, Tera Anal Ltd, Discovery Technol Int, Copper Dev Assoc, Florida Int Univ, Inst Engn & Technol			MAINTENANCE; EQUIPMENT	Motor prognosis has great benefit for motion control systems. It is desirable to develop the so-called integrated prognosis capability for motion control products, i.e. with only the existing sensors of a motor drive. This paper presents a scheme of integrated wear prognosis for linear actuators driven by AC servo motor with only current measurement. The Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) was adopted as the prognostic model. Compared to a single observation for a state in the hidden Markov model (HMM), a state in an HSMM generates a segment of observations. Therefore, HSMM structure has a temporal component. For the HSMM based prognostic model, the states correspond to different levels of health status. The duration of a health state is modeled by an explicit Gaussian probability function. To avoid the underflow of computation, the modified forward-backward training algorithm was used to estimate the model parameters. The expectation-modification method was used to estimate the state transition probability matrix, initial state distribution, and observation probability matrix in the model. The trained HSMMs can be used to predict the remaining-useful-life (RUL) on the actuator. The proposed method is demonstrated through the simulation of the wear process of an AC motor driven linear actuator.

A feed forward compensation term is introduced into the zero sequence component of the dq reference voltages which considerably reduces current and torque ripple in the faulted motor drive. If the machine's "neutral point" voltage can be modulated, then a reasonably high speed can be achieved before field-weakening control is required. The paper describes the application of the control method to a delta-connected machine with an open winding fault, with an unmodified inverter drive. The proposed scheme has been verified by experimental results.

This paper proposes its application also during speed transients, with two key advantages: first, it allows an easy filtering of the transient current component corresponding to the mains, and, second, the HT can be use to generate the Hilbert Spectrum (HS), as a replacement of the Fourier Spectrum for the analysis of non-stationary signals, like those that appear in a transient regime.

While digital pathology has made tissue specimens amenable to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for disease detection, our CAP scheme is the first of its kind for predicting disease outcome and patient survival. Since cancer grade is known to be correlated to disease outcome, low grade implying good outcome and vice versa, our CAP scheme captures quantitative image features that are reflective of BC grade. Our scheme involves first semiautomatically detecting BC nuclei via an Expectation Maximization driven algorithm. Using the nuclear centroids, two graphs (Delaunay Triangulation and Minimum Spanning Tree) are constructed and a total of 12 features are extracted from each image. A non-linear dimensionality reduction scheme, Graph Embedding, projects the image-derived features into a low-dimensional space, and a Support Vector Machine classifies the BC images in the reduced dimensional space. On a cohort of 37 samples, and for 100 trials of 3-fold randomized cross-validation, the SVM yielded a mean accuracy of 84.15% in distinguishing samples with low and high RS and 84.12% in distinguishing low and high grade BC. The projection of the high-dimensional image feature data to a ID line for all BC samples via GE shows a clear separation between, low, intermediate, and high BC grades, which in turn shows high correlation with low, medium, and high RS. The results suggest that our image-based CAP scheme might provide a cheaper alternative to Oncotype DX in predicting BC outcome.

The considered faults lead to amplitude and/or phase modulations of the measured stator current. The different faults can be characterized by their time-frequency signatures via the Wigner distribution. The time-frequency representations apply to complex signals that may be obtained through the Hilbert transform of the real measured signal. In case of high frequency modulations, it can not be taken advantage of the time frequency signatures. This study proposes an alternative complex signal representation for modulated stator currents. The so-called space vector is obtained through the Concordia transform. From three stator current measurements, the Concordia transform builds a complex vector which conveniently carries the information about phase and amplitude modulations. This paper applies and compares the Wigner distribution computed with the Hilbert and Concordia transforms in case of simulated and experimental signals with various modulation frequency ranges.

Starting from an advance mathematical model with full representation of a cage and considering arbitrary cage faults the steady-state equations are developed. Those equations are reduced to four equations using symmetrical components of stator and rotor quantities. Base on it, dynamic reduced models of induction motors with cage asymmetry are suggested. Numerical tests show when such simplified modes can be used for correct prediction of basic phenomena in stator currents to cage faults.	[Sobczyk, T.

Operating in aggressive environments, the detection of anomalies at an incipient stage is crucial to decide about the operating continuity of the machines. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to detect stator faults under time varying-condition in two mainly different contexts: Transient-Speed conditions and Fault-Varying conditions. A frequency sliding (FS) with High Multiresolution Analysis (HMRA) approach is proposed for improving the ability of DWT in extracting the most relevant stator fault frequency component dynamically over time thereby. A dynamic mean power calculation at different resolution levels was introduced as a diagnostic index to quantify the fault extent. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in discriminating stator fault severities leading to an effective diagnostic procedure for stator faults in DFIM.

A New Method to Detect Stator Turn-to-turn Faults in a Closed-loop Multiple-motor Drive System	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		Closed-loop motor drive; negative sequence; parallel-connected induction machines; stator turn faults	INDUCTION; DIAGNOSIS	Multiple motors connected to a single closed-loop inverter drive is a common type of drive topology which has wide application in steel processing industry, electric railway systems and electric vehicles. But condition monitoring for this type of drive configuration remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a new method to detect the stator turn-to-turn fault in a multiple-motor drive system. The method achieves very high detecting sensitivity yet remains easy to implement by utilizing the characteristics of current regulators in the motor controller. Experimental results show that the method can reliably detect a short circuit of 1 turn out of 216 turns per phase on two 5-hp, shaft-coupled induction machines. Although originally developed for multiple-motor drives, the detection scheme can be directly applied to most of normal closed-loop induction motor drive.

Thus, timely detection and diagnosis of induction motor bearing (IMB) is crucial to prevent sudden damages. This paper proposes a method to utilize artificial neural network (ANN) by using genetic algorithm (GA) to identify IMB fault diagnosis. In this case, GA is utilized to find the optimum weights and biases for Elman Network (EN), which is one of ANN families. The vibration signal used in this work is obtained from Case Western Reserve University website. During preprocessing stage, vibration signals are been converted from time domain into frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Then, enveloping method is used to eliminate the high frequency components from vibration signal. Subsequently, a set of 16 features from vibration and preprocessed signal are extracted. In order to reduce the size of data, a distance evaluation technique is used as features selection. In the development of ANN fault diagnosis, both networks EN (without GA) and GAEN (utilized with GA) in which results are compared and conclusions are drawn.

The main concept of the new method is to use the inverter to perform off-line tests for quality assessment of the vulnerable components in the inverter, cable, and induction motor automatically, whenever the motor is stopped. This new approach is suitable for monitoring system components that deteriorate gradually to failure, if the degradation is observable. Off-line test methods for monitoring the quality of the 1) do link aluminum electrolytic capacitor, 2) electrical connections, 3) cable and stator winding insulation, 4) stator core, and 5) rotor bar are presented along with a summary of the failure mechanism and existing test methods. It will be shown that the new strategy can be implemented with minimal hardware requirements, and that it has many advantages over existing off-line and on-line tests. An experimental study performed under simulated fault conditions for each component shows that the method provides a reliable and sensitive indication of drive system problems for reliable, efficient, and safe operation.

They can exist in the form of static or dynamic eccentricity or both, in which case it is called a mixed eccentricity fault. These faults cause bearing damage, excessive vibration and noise, unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) and under extreme conditions stator-rotor rub which may seriously damage the motors. Since eccentricity faults are often associated with large induction machines, the repair or replacement costs arising out of such a scenario may easily run into tens and thousands of dollars. Previous research have shown that it is extremely difficult to detect such faults if they appear individually, rather than in mixed form, unless the number of rotor bars and pole pair number conform to certain relationships. In this paper, it is shown that the terminal voltages of induction machines at switch-off reveal certain features that can lead to the detection of these faults in individual form, even in machines that do not show these signatures in line current spectrum in steady state.

Rotor fault distorts the magnetic symmetry and subsequently deteriorates the steady-State and dynamic performance. As fast speed control loop compensates for the unevenly distribution of the field, the inverter supply voltage is adjusted accordingly. The modulated supply voltage pattern is then analyzed and its average duty cycle is determined. When broken rotor bars are present, specific oscillations in the average duty cycle arise. The presence of these oscillations is sufficient for a successful detection. The computation is performed using simple mathematics and demands no significant computational power. The results confirm the suitability of the proposed detection method for FOC scheme.

The stationary wavelet transform is the tool used through the analysis of the three phase stator current signals measured at the stator of an induction machine fed by a three phase voltage inverter. Fault scenarios with one open-switch are considered because they are the most likely to occur. Several signals are analysed simultaneously in order to perform the diagnosis. The currents signals are filtered using the SWT performed with the DB4 wavelet to extract the detail and approximation coefficients tip to level 6. Then, the approximation at level 6 is examined to detect changes in the mean. This is achieved with statistical hypothesis techniques. In this work, a Neyman Pearson change in the mean detection test is used. Finally. a signature table is deduced to isolate the faulty switch. The whole diagnostic procedure can perform on line because of its low computational cost. Real data recorded from a benchmark feed the proposed diagnostic tool. Presented results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

These techniques may provide, in certain situations (unbalance supply voltages, load torque oscillations...), substantial advantages in comparison with the classical method, based on the Fourier spectrum of the steady-state current. Nevertheless, these transient-based techniques have been mainly focused on the tracing of the left sideband harmonics (LSH) introduced by the asymmetry. In this paper, Wigner-Ville distributions are applied to the detection of other high-order components introduced by the asymmetry. Their detection might help to reach a more reliable diagnosis conclusion in cases in which the tracing of the LSH may he difficult (inter-bar currents, load torque oscillations...). The results shore the potential of the tool for the detection of these components as a basis to diagnose the fault.	[Climente-Alarcon, V.; Antonino-Daviu, J.

This paper proposes its application also during speed transients, with two key advantages: first. it allows an easy filtering of the transient current component corresponding to the supply frequency, and, second, the HT allows for the generation of the Hilbert Spectrum, as a replacement of the Fourier Spectrum in the case of non-stationary signals, like those that appear in a transient regime. The performance of the proposed method is compared with other methods as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and is validated through simulation with a mathematical model and experimental analysis of a 1.1 kW three-phase squirrel-cage commercial induction motor with eccentricity.

Non-invasive Detection of Rotor Cage Faults in Inverter Fed Induction Machines at No Load and Low Speed	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; induction machines; rotor broken bar faults; transient excitation; no load; zero speed		Rotor cage fault detection in inverter fed induction machines is still challenging nowadays as dynamics introduced by the control or the load influence the fault indicator signals usually applied. In addition, the detection is usually only possible when the machine is operated above a specific load level to generate a significant rotor current magnitude. This paper proposes a new method to detect rotor bar defects at zero load and around standstill. The method only uses the standard current sensors already available in modern industrial inverters and is thus non-invasive. It is thus well suited as start-up test for drives. By applying a transient voltage pulse sequence using the switching of the inverter and measuring the resulting current slope a new fault indicator is obtained. As a result, it is possible to clearly identify the fault-induced asymmetry in the machine transient reactances. Though the transient flux linkage cannot penetrate the rotor because of the cage, the faulty bar locally influences the zigzag flux leading to a significant change. Measurement results show the applicability and sensitivity of the proposed method.

In this framework the use of cogeneration (CHP) or trigeneration (CHCP) is an attractive solution towards higher system efficiency. Traditional thermal machines are used as a prime mover in a CHP/CHCP plant. Recently novel technologies were investigated for prime mover and cooler. Among them thermoacoustics is attractive as it allows to embed a prime mover, a cooler and an alternator in a single machine. Moreover, it features reduced maintenance cost as it requires no moving parts but the electric alternator. The design of an efficient electric alternator is one of the major challenge, as it must convert into electricity a small linear displacement of the mover at high frequency. The latter is a critical item in terms of diagnostics also. Here the fault diagnosis of a thermoacoustic generator is investigated, where the major defects are ageing or fatigue of the spring used to center and sustain the mover of electric generator. The fault diagnosis is based on the non invasive analysis of electric signals at the generator terminal. The paper also deals with post fault strategies.

Here asymmetrical states of a doubly-fed induction machine, as for example a turn-to-turn fault, are modeled and simulated in state space with hybrid machine equations. These equations are reduced in order of less computation effort. To detect rotor turn-to-turn faults of the doubly-fed induction machine a Luenberger observer is developed and investigated by simulation. The results show a sensitive and fast detection of the fault.	[Dinkhauser, V.; Fuchs, F.

Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis based on Analytic Wavelet Transform via Frequency B-Splines	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		Broken rotor bars; fault diagnosis; induction motor; signal analysis; transient analysis; wavelet transform	ROTOR BAR DETECTION; MACHINES	In this paper a new methodology of Transient Motor Current Signature Analysis (TMCSA) is proposed. The approach consists on obtaining a 2D time frequency plot representing the time-frequency evolution of all the harmonics present on an electric machine transient current. Identifying characteristic patterns in the time-frequency plane, produced by some of the fault related components, permits the machine diagnosis. Unlike other CWT based methods, this work uses Complex Frequency B-Splines Wavelets. It is shown that these wavelets enable high detail in the time-frequency maps and an efficient filtering in the region neighbouring the main frequency. These characteristics make easy the identification of the patterns related to the fault components. As an example, the technique has been applied to no load startup currents of healthy motors and motors with broken bars, showing the Complex FBS Wavelets capabilities. The diagnosis has been done via the identification of the Upper Sideband Harmonic.	[Pons-Llinares, J.; Antonino-Daviu, J.

This approach is based on an adaptive state observer; it is derived from the IM dynamic model considering stator iron losses. In this model the iron losses are represented by an equivalent iron loss resistance (R-Fe). Stator core fault causes important variations on iron losses and these variations are reflected on the R-Fe. Therefore the proposed adaptive state observer estimates R-Fe with the objective of diagnosing stator core fault. Simulation and experimental results for different fault severity conditions are showed. These results demonstrated the validity of the method. In addition, simulation results proved that the proposal is not sensitive to load torque variations.	[de la Barrera, P. M.; Bossio, G. R.; Garcia, G. O.; Solsona, J.

In this context the condition monitoring of magnets status is receiving more and more attention since is critical for industrial applications. This paper presents a characterization of rotor faults for such a motor due to local and uniform demagnetization by means of two dimensional (2-D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and proposes a new non-invasive method for their detection by means of a Fourier transform of the back-EMF. The proposed approach is then validated for three Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors with different winding configurations.

Static and dynamic rotor eccentricities were simulated by using a dynamic mesh-model including inductances computed by an improved MWFA-based analyses and by 3D FEM, and taking in account the damping effect of the parallel paths inside the machine. Current and voltage steady-state waveforms were analyzed by FFT; no-load voltage harmonics appeared as good candidates as fault indicators, given their dependence on level and type of eccentricity. Some voltage measurements on the real machine are also reported and discussed.

Monitoring of Rotor Cage Conditions in Induction Machines by Instantaneous Reactive power and Current Space Vector's Reactive Component	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		Induction motors; Fault diagnosis; Reactive power	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS	Intensive research efforts have been focused on the Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) in order to detect rotor condition of induction machines. The interpretation of the single-phase current spectrum provides direct information on the presence of abnormal conditions, while their quantification is an open problem as signature spectral lines depend also on motor load and inertia. Recently the attention has been focused on the reactive part of the instantaneous power: its spectrum shows a 2s omega component related to the fault severity that might improve the diagnosis. The aim of this paper is the performance evaluation of this diagnostic index to state the rotor breakage severity in induction machines. It is shown that instantaneous current components bear the same features as instantaneous power components. Moreover, it is possible to switch from amplitudes and angular displacements of reactive and active current components to the (1 +/- 2s)w sidebands and therefore to verify the link among torque ripple, speed ripple, flux and current components.

They usually involve supplying a single phase or two series-connected phases. An ideal machine should present the same behavior at all terminals, while in an actual machine non-idealities alter the response to the signals. Some techniques to state machine condition during self-commission procedures based on the parameter values discrepancies or on the response to particular signals injected have been proposed. This paper investigates the effect of the different asymmetries on the usual self-commissioning procedures and the further possibilities given by the machine supply through the digitally controlled inverter. It is shown that, even at standstill, it is possible to detect and state the severity of some fault conditions of the machine. In particular a specific supply voltage signal is proposed that, through the machine response, outlines the machine rotor conditions.

Detection of Insulation Faults on Disc-Type Winding Transformers by means of Leakage Flux Analysis	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		Power transformers insulation; diagnosis; leakage flux analysis; finite element method	CURRENT TESTING PROBE	Power transformers figure amongst the most costly pieces of equipment used in electrical systems. Major research effort has therefore focused on detecting failures of their insulating systems prior to unexpected machine outage. Although several industrial methods exist for the on-line and off-line monitoring of power transformers, all of them are expensive and complex, and require the use of specific electronic instrumentation. For these reasons, this paper will present on-line analysis of transformer leakage flux as an efficient alternative procedure for assessing machine integrity, and detecting the presence of insulating failures during their earliest stages. A 12kVA 400V/400V power transformer was specifically manufactured for the study. A finite element model of the machine was designed to obtain the transient distribution of leakage flux lines in the machine's transversal section under normal operating conditions and when shorted turns are intentionally produced. Very cheap, simple sensors, based on air core coils, were built in order to measure the leakage flux of the transformer, and non-destructive tests were also applied to the machine in order to analyse pre- and post-failure voltages induced in the coils. Results point to the ability to detect very early stages of failure, as well as of locating the position of the shorted turn in the transformer windings.	[Cabanas, M. F.; Melero, M. G.; Rojas, C.

The moving part of the motor is linked to the fixed part by means of linear bearings. As in many other electric machines, bearings represents one of the most vulnerable part because they are prone to wear and contamination. In case of linear roller bearings this issue is even more critical as the rail cannot be easily fully enclosed and protected from environmental contamination, unlike the radial rotating bearing counterpart. This paper presents a diagnostic method based on vibration analysis to recognize the signature frequency of the fault.

Detection of Birdcaging in Steel Wire Rope of a Hoisting Winch System by Analysis of Load Torque and Stator Current	2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRIC MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electric Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2009	Cargese, FRANCE	IEEE		Induction machine; Mechanical system; Diagnosis; Stator current; Load torque; Hoisting winch system; On-line condition monitoring; Wire rope birdcaging	ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; FAILURE	The aim of this paper is to analyze theoretically and experimentally the stator current of a three phase induction machine and load torque signals in a hoisting winch system, in order to show how they are influenced by the wire rope faulty condition. When the wire rope is subjected to axial and torsional loads, the outer strands can separate from the core in permanent way and make the rope useless. The term birdcaging is used to describe this type of phenomenon giving a permanent appearance of a wire rope forced into compression. In a hoisting winch system the running rope is bent over drum and pulley and it is torsionally stressed by the fleet angle between them. In this paper, the effect of the fleet angle is observed in the stator current and load torque, in order to detect the wire rope birdcaging. This study is performed on a 22kW squirrel-cage induction machine and presents an original non invasive was to detect wire rope fault condition, by using the stator current of the electrical machine.

The circuit-oriented approach which represents the machine model as a rotating transformer will be compared to the discrete event method. First, the wound-rotor induction machine model will be described using the classical equations in the abc reference frame. In fact, the circuit oriented method is based on a representation with only resistances, inductances and controlled voltage sources. It has been implemented by using the MATLAB/Simulink(C) software. With the discrete event method, the classical abc reference frame model is based on ordinary differential equations which are translated in block-scheme to be interpreted as a coupling of basic models based on a discrete event system specification. Finally, the performances of the two methods have been verified by comparison between simulation and experiments on a 5.5kW-220V/380V-50Hz-8 poles wound-rotor induction machine working in both healthy and faulty modes at different load conditions.

For this reason, the application of SVMs in fault classification and diagnosis field has becomes one growing reach focus. In this paper a new approach to real-time fault detection and classification is presented for high speed protective relaying in power transmission systems using SVMs. The integration with an online wavelet-based pre-processing stage [1,2,3] enhances the SVM learning capability and classification power. The classification criterion is based on using only the phase angles between the three line currents in the transmission line. The paper begins with the exploration of classifying different fault types (LG, LL, and LLG) using the SVMs. It proceeds with the classification concepts of the nine types of faults. Extensive theoretical studies and simulations using ATP and MATLAB-SVM Toolbox on an EHV transmission line model have proved that the veracity of the SVM classifier is very significant for fault classification.

Keynote Speech:Smart Configurable Wireless Sensors and Actuators for Industrial Monitoring and Control	2009 IEEE SENSORS, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE Conference on Sensors	OCT 25-28, 2009	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	IEEE Sensors Council		wirless sensors; intelligent monitoring; smart sensing; industrial control		Intelligent wireless sensor-based controls have drawn industry attention on account of reduced costs, better power management, ease in maintenance, and effortless deployment in remote and hard-to-reach areas. They have been successfully deployed in many industrial applications such as Maintenance, monitoring, control, security, etc. This presentation focuses on research that addresses the issues faced by instrumentation systems and predictive maintenance industrial applications and presents a design solution to cater to the issues faced by these applications. Instrumentation systems are either open or closed loop control systems formed using sensors and actuators with the objective of controlling certain parameters, or state of the system. The system elements are always in communication with each other, typically, requiring real-time performance and built-in fault-tolerance for communication/node failure - to return to a safe-state in a deterministic amount of time. Predictive-maintenance involves tracking physical state of equipment or machine, and to take action, if an acceptable or allowed state(s) is violated. Predictive-maintenance applications are not active all the time in Order to conserve energy. The sensors are either periodic or event-based; they wake up, check status and go back to sleep. In case of any violation, they raise an alarm or record the digression. They are very useful in keeping machine downtimes low and help locate the problem before the machine breaks down. Typical systems employ different types of sensors (e.g., position, accelerometers, gyros, etc.) and actuators (e.g., motors) often deployed within the same network, having different capabilities, interfaces, and supporting different protocols for data and communications. Formation of systems from such diverse distributed sensor elements entails versatile control modules, which understand different sensor protocols and utilize them. In addition, the operational challenges are exacerbated when different RF links have to be used to satisfy the requirements of bandwidth, payload, delay, jitter, range, noise immunity and others (including cost) for communication. The Smart Sensor Platform discussed in this presentation is an attempt to develop a generic platform with a "plug-and-play" capability to support hardware interface, payload and communications needs of multiple inertial and position sensors, and actuators/motors used in instrumentation systems and predictive maintenance applications. Communication is carried out using a RF link (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Mote or RFID), in a point-to-point topology. The design also provides means to update operating and monitoring parameters, and thresholds as well as sensor and RF link specific firmware modules "over-the-air". It is composed of two main components - a sensor-wireless hardware interface and system integration framework, which facilitates the defining of interaction between sensors/actuators based on process needs.

This however, is expensive, complex and hard to meet the standard required of reliable protection sytem. The diagnosis problems are more serious in speed variant motors because of change of placements and configurations of faulty patterns. In this paper, using Motor current signatures analysis, a simple and effective method is proposed in pattern reorganization. In this strategy, the possibility of the presence of a fault symptom, in well known frequency zones and, expected portion of dectable faults in significant frequency zones is applied to measure and possibility rank the seriousness of fault events in electrical machines.

Communication faults in any stage of these control networks can cause delays or even shutdown of the entire manufacturing process. The current process of detecting and diagnosing communication faults is mostly manual, cumbersome, and inefficient. Detecting early symptoms of potential problems is very important but automated solutions do not yet exist. Our research goal is to automate the process of detecting and diagnosing the communication faults as well as to prevent problems by detecting early symptoms of potential problems. To achieve our goal, we have first investigated real-world fault cases and summarized control network failures. We have also defined network metrics and their alarm conditions to detect early symptoms for communication failures between process control servers and devices. In particular, we leverage data mining techniques to train the system to learn the rules of network faults in control networks and our testing results show that these rules are very effective. In our earlier work, we presented a design of a process control network monitoring and fault diagnosis system. In this paper, we focus on how the fault detection part of this system can be improved using data mining techniques.				fates@postech.ac.kr; yjwon@postech.ac.kr; hwanjoyu@postech.ac.kr; jwkhong@postech.ac.kr; vishnu4@posco.co.kr; jangjin21@posco.co.kr					*ASHRAE, 1995, 1351995 ASHRAE ANSI; Cristianini N., 2000, INTRO SUPPORT VECTOR, V1st; Denis F., 1998, PAC LEARNING POSITIV; Dickerson JE, 2000, PEACHFUZZ 2000 : 19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FUZZY INFORMATION PROCESSING SOCIETY - NAFIPS, P301, DOI 10.1109/NAFIPS.2000.877441; *FIELDB FDN, 2003, FF58113 FIELDB FDN; FRANK J, 1994, P 17 NAT COMP SEC C; Han J, 2006, DATA MINING CONCEPT; Han SH, 2002, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2506, P16; LIAN FL, 2001, IEEE CONTROL SYSTEM, V117, P641; Lippmann R., 2000, P DARPA INF SURV C E, V2, P12, DOI DOI 10.1109/DISCEX.2000.821506; *MODBUS ORG, 2002, MODB APPL PROT V1 0; Mukkamala S, 2003, INT J DIGITAL EVIDEN, V1, P1; Okabe N, 2005, 2005 SYMPOSIUM ON APPLICATIONS AND THE INTERNET WORKSHOPS, PROCEEDINGS, P80, DOI 10.1109/SAINTW.2005.1619983; *PROFIBUS INT, 1999, 61158 IEC PROFIBUS I; Quinlan J.R, 2014, C4 5 PROGRAMS MACHIN; Won YJ, 2008, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V46, P172, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2008.4511666; PACKET DETAILS MARKU	17	3	3	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-3486-2				2009							211	217		10.1109/INM.2009.5188812			7	Computer Science, Hardware & Architecture; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science	BNF13	WOS:000274304300033					2022-02-14

Kernel parameter selection is very important, and which decide the fault diagnosis precision. In order to enhance fault diagnosis precision for electric equipment, the LSSVM algorithm based on PSO is proposed. The algorithm, which can complete automatic parameter selection, is used to choose a parameter of kernel function.

Improper or inadequate Dissolved Gases Analysis (DGA) data may lead to failure fault classification of power transformer. SVM, through statistical learning theory, provides a way of classification information by generating optimal kernel based representative DGA data. In order to make full use of the classification ability of SVM and improve the fault classification accuracy, FRS is used to pre-classify the transformer fault and the multi-level power transformer fault diagnosis model based on FRS and SVM was presented in this paper. By comparing with the traditional method like neural network, there is less fault data discriminated by FRS and SVM model and the accuracy for power transformer fault diagnosis is improved.

Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NDR) theories brought a new idea for recognizing and predicting the underlying nonlinear behavior. In this paper, we propose a NDR based feature extraction method for fault classification of rolling element bearing. Original feature spaces are constructed by time- and frequency-domain feature selection method, NDR-based feature exaction scheme is proposed to acquire the low-dimensional embeddings from feature space, which provide a more truthful low-dimensional representation compared to the linear DR methods. In order to systematically and quantitatively investigate the performance of NDR method, we compare the three nonlinear DR methods: Isometric Mapping(Isomap), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE),and Local Tangent Space Alignment(LTSA) with the intent of determining a reduced subspace representation in which the fault classes of rolling element bearing are more easily discriminable. Evaluation of the classification performance is done by Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised classifiers. Additionally, with optimal neighborhood size, binary code combinations based on NDR embedded results are given for fault recognition. Experiments on 6 fault data sets are used for fault and severity classification. Quantitative evaluation results suggest that NDR methods are superior in identifying potential novel classes within the data.

Depending on wind speed, the induction machine operates continuously in non stationary conditions. In this context, traditional Fourier Analysis fails to discriminate between healthy and abnormal stator operating conditions. To overcome this limitation a wavelet based analysis of rotor currents is here proposed in order to detect stator faults. This technique allows extracting fault frequencies dynamically over time providing effective fault detection. Moreover the mean power at different resolution levels was introduced as a diagnostic index to quantify the extent of the fault. Simulation and experimental results show that wavelet decomposition allows good discrimination between healthy and faulty cases even in time-varying conditions leading to an effective diagnostic procedure for stator faults in DFIG thereby.

Up to 60% of the electricity produced in the U.S. converys into otherforms of energy to provide power to equipment through motor [1]. Machinery reliability and performance can be improved with early fault diagnosis and condition monitoring; therefore, the fault diagnosis system for motor has been highlighted for years. However, among these various diagnosis systems, they all focus on the reliability but not the energy issue. Based on IEA research, the energy consumption of electric motors could be reduced up to 7% with modem engineering approach; unfortunately, the abnormal energy consumption caused by motor faults did not get the reasonable attentions. This paper is presenting an approach for energy conservation diagnosis that could predict the trend of abnormal energy consumption caused by motor faults and enabled the early energy conservation work.

KPCA is an improved PCA, which possesses the property of extracting optimal features by adopting a nonlinear kernel function method. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel approach based on statistical learning theory, which has emerged for feature identification and classification.

By utilizing the proper data collection and analysis techniques, the faults because of vibration can be discovered and predicted. The time-frequency analysis by Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) plays on a significant role in the analysis of singularities, which hide in the signal, and is an effective method for non-stationary signal. The experiment data of rubbing vibration faults signal were analyzed by the method, and the result shows that the proposed method can not only reveal the time-frequency features of vibration signal but also extrude components of low energy. Local rubbing faults can be accurately diagnosed in good time by applying HHT. Therefore, it is a very effective tool to diagnose the early faults of rotor system. And it provides new means for state detection and fault diagnosis of rotating machine.

Our method is based, on the analysis of the characteristics of early fault of the aircraft, and it combined the SVM (support vector machine) with the stochastic resonance theory and the wavelet packet decomposition. First, we zoom the early fault feature signals by using the stochastic resonance theory. Second, we extract feature vectors of the early fault by using the multi-resolution analysis of the wavelet packet. Third, we input the feature vectors to a fault classifier, which can be used to identify the early fault of the aircraft quickly and do self-recovery monitor of fault. In this paper, feature of early fault on aircraft, the zoom of early fault characteristics, the extraction method of early fault feature, the construction of multi-fault classifier and way of fault self-recovery monitoring are studied. Results show that our method can effectively identify the early fault of aircraft, especially for identifying of fault with small samples, and it can carry on monitoring of fault self-recovery.

The effective decomposition approach is the key to demodulate signals and extract fault characteristics. Local mean decomposition (LMD) is a new kind of time-frequency analysis approach, which can decompose the signals adaptively into a set of product function (PF) components. The envelope of PF is the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency can I be calculated by the derivative of the unwrapped phase of modulation signal with uniform amplitude. The method bypasses the Hilbert transform totally. Therefore, it involves no question about negative frequency of no physical meaning. Through the successful mechanical fault diagnosis examples, it shows that LMD has high theoretical value and engineering practicability.

It will bring serious damage to mechanical equipment. A new diagnosis method based on wavelet packet and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The maximal singular values of wavelet packet decomposition coefficients are extracted as robust feature vectors. A new multi-class SVM classifier is constructed in "one versus one" classification strategy and binary tree, which can recognize several patterns of faults after being trained., Meanwhile the way was used on the rub impact fault identification of dual-disk over-hung rotor-bearing system.

Wear mechanisms and changes are investigated for gear with spall fault using ferrographic analysis technique. Furthermore, the features of time and frequency spectrums have been investigated using the time and frequency spectrums of vibration analysis technology in this study. Analysis results show that quantity and size of wear debris and four eigenvalues of the time spectrum gradually become greater in order of the gear with minor spall, the gear with moderate spall and the gear with severe spall. Frequency spectrums of spalling gear appear some sidebands that meshing frequency of output terminal as centre frequency, the rotating frequencies of output terminal as modulating frequency occur. The investigation on wear and vibration characteristics of simulating spall fault gear provides the auxiliary basis to determine fault for the fatiguing spall failure of the actual using gear.

Papers for the detection have been proposed, for example, by the Park vector (PV), the AI techniques, the wavelet analysis, and the negative sequence analysis approaches. This paper proposes a diagnostic method of a stator winding fault of an induction motor by combination of the PV and the negative sequence analysis approaches. The principle consists of two steps. The first step is extraction of a negative sequence admittance component as the diagnosis index because the admittance is almost independent from the slip ratio. The instantaneous positive components are calculated by division between the PVs of the stator voltages and currents. The negative component is extracted as its ripples. The second step is estimation of fault phases and number of turns from the negative component as a complex value. It is possible to find a negative-sequence map which shows a useful relation between fault phases and numbers of turns in multiple phases. Diagnostic simulation results are shown with a real-time simple motor model written in a simulation language of VHDL-AMS. Their experimental results are also shown and the proposed method is investigated and validated.

The origin of most recurrent faults in rotary machines is in the components: bearings, stator, rotor and others. Different methodologies based on current and vibration monitoring have been proposed using FFT and wavelet analysis for preventive monitoring of induction motors resulting in countless techniques for diagnosing specific faults, arising the necessity for a generalized technique that allows multiple fault detection. This work presents a novel methodology and its FPGA implementation for multiple fault online detection analyzing the current and vibration signals of an induction motor combining FFT and wavelet processing during its startup transient and steady state, precisely performing the identification of different faults like misalignment, unbalance, outer-race bearing defects and broken bars. The results obtained using the proposed methodology show its effectiveness providing a precise diagnosis of the induction motor condition.	[Cabal-Yepez, E.; Romero-Troncoso, R. J.; Razo-Hernandez, J.

As our previous paper where ANN is used as a classifier for event detection from measured hard landing signals. In this paper, our aim is to develop our previous work by using least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier instead of ANN. We compare LS-SVM with backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) to classify the extracted features.

Rough set (RS) is a new theory to deal with vagueness and uncertainty information. A model of fault diagnosis knowledge acquisition for the rotating machine based on rough set is presented in this paper. The decision table is formed and the fault attributes are reduced by Showron matrix. The rule degree of confidence and degree of coverage are used as evaluating indictors to judge the reduction rules. The database of the intelligent expert system is updated with these minimum reduced attributes' sets. This model is applied in the rules acquisition of rotating machine. The attributes number is reduced from 11 to 5. The intelligent fault diagnosis expert system with the new acquisition rules is verified in water-injection sets of Daqing oil field.

Weak periodic signals can be detected by identifying the transformation of the chaotic oscillator from the chaotic state to the large-scale periodic state when a weak external periodic signal is applied. As the actual signal is generally a mixture of signal and noise, and interested weak signal is usually submerged in strong background and noise signals. EMD is proposed to remove component interference, and actual signal is divided into finite intrinsic mode functions (IMF's), so that weak characteristic signal can be separated from background and noise signals, and a reliable and convenient measure for weak periodic signal detection by Duffing oscillator can be completed efficiently. Numerical simulation and experimental results show the validity of the presented method.

Due to environmental stress and many others reasons different faults occur in induction motor. Many researchers proposed different techniques for fault detection and diagnosis. However, many techniques available presently require a good deal of expertise to apply them successfully. Simpler approaches are needed which allow relatively unskilled operators to make reliable decisions without a diagnosis specialist to examine data and diagnose problems. In this paper simple, reliable and economical Neural Network (NN) based fault classifier is proposed, in which stator current is used as input signal from motor. Thirteen statistical parameters are extracted from the stator current and PCA is used to select proper input. Data is generated from the experimentation on specially designed 2 Hp, 4 pole 50 Hz. three phase induction motor. For classification, NNs like MLP, SVM and statistical classifiers based on CART and Discriminant Analysis are verified. Robustness of classifier to noise is also verified on unseen data by introducing controlled Gaussian and Uniform noise in input and output.

However, this classification method has some weaknesses. For example, it can not separate fuzzy information, particularly sensitive to the interference and the isolated points of the training samples. Besides, it has great demand for memory in calculation. In view of the problems mentioned above, a binary tree-based fuzzy SVM multi-classification algorithm (BTFSVM) has been put forward. This paper focuses on the study of the application of the Morphology Analysis and the theory BTFSVM (MA-BTFSVM) to fault diagnosis on the bearing of ships. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm has better anti-interference ability and classification effects than others. Consideration should be taken into account that it can be further applicable to the diagnosis on other mechanical faults of ships.

Phase failure occurs when one of the three phases of the supply goes down during the running of motor. Poly phase induction motors continue to operate in this condition but under some severe operating conditions and eventually resulting in performance degradation and permanent burnouts. Detection of phase failure by voltage measurement is not useful in case of poly phase machines and it is not possible even by current monitoring if the machine is installed in a system with a mixture of I-phase and three-phase loads. The proposed method relies on the continuous measurement the phase difference between the terminal voltages of the machine. Further it presents an improvement in other existing methods which are based on stator current monitoring. The proposed method has been simulated using MatLab/Simutink. The simulated results show the reliability and usefulness of the proposed method.

In a manufacturing process, a simple fault can lead to environmental damage. In this way, one of the most commonly applied fault detection method is the parameter estimation technique. In this paper, we present an advanced algorithm for the estimation of electrical machine parameters by combining two approaches: the first one is the analytical Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) strategy and the second one is the Genetic algorithm. Since the DC series motor is widely used in several industrial sectors, the algorithm developed is potentially useful in order to implement a robust closed-loop control. Accordingly, the implementation of this approach to the online estimation of the field and the armature resistance of DC series motor shows interesting results.

Machine prognosis represents set of activities performed based on diagnostic information to maintain its intended operating condition before complete failure. Avoidance of complete failure i.e. sudden breakdowns is desired since it causes economical misfortune to manufacturing companies. There are many literatures available on diagnostic and prognostic models and tools. This paper intends to review and summarize various techniques, models, and its applications. Also, develop a methodology how some of the techniques can be applied to robotic assembly process in an automotive assembly system.

In order to promote wide acceptance by application designers, the most vendors of these technologies propose powerful tools and run-time environments, adequately supporting both off-line network configuration and on-line real-time exchange of process data over the network. The focus of available facilities, however, is merely confined to the network side. The verification of wiring correctness and proper behavior of the plant sensorial/actuation equipment still relies on error-prone and time-consuming manual work. In order to overcome such limitations, a generally-applicable methodology is presented here, aiming to drastically reduce both operator direct intervention and time needed to ascertain that, not only network devices, but also plant devices fulfill the specified application-dependent requirements. Leaving intrinsic features of actuators and sensors out of consideration, typical plant devices are abstractly modeled in terms of the elementary services they may provide and the control/feedback signals they expose to request/notify execution of individual services. Such models give precise indications about devices that do not behave as expected, promptly reporting the cause(s) of each fault and suggesting possible remedies for fault recovery. The validity of the proposed methodology has been experimentally ascertained by carrying out real-fife tests on a complex automated machine with a purposely developed diagnosis tool supporting multiple fieldbus technologies.

While traditionally these approaches have been seen as rivals, in recent years a new consensus has developed in which they are seen as complementary. This article reviews the state of the art regarding ways in which the presence of a formal specification can be used to assist testing.

The rotating system is modeled by applying the rigid shaft Stodola-Green model, in which the shaft gyroscopic moments and rotatory inertia are accounted for, in conjunction with the hydrodynamic cylindrical journal bearing model based on the classical Reynolds equation. A linearized perturbation procedure is employed to render the lubrication equations from the Reynolds equation, which allows predicting the eight linear force coefficients associated with the bearing direct and cross-coupled stiffness and damping coefficients. The results show that the methodology presented is efficient for balancing rotor systems. This paper gives a step further in the monitoring process, since Artificial Neural Network is normally used to predict, not to correct the mass unbalance. The procedure presented can be used in turbo machinery industry to balance rotating machinery that require continuous inspections. Some simulated results will be used in order to clarify the methodology presented.

Firstly, after analyzing the meanings of oil monitoring samples and vibration data, the fusion method in decision-making layer, which is Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, is chosen in the paper. Then, a new kind of fault diagnosis method fusing oil monitoring samples and vibration data based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is established. This method includes two main steps. The first step is to get individual diagnosis result by using oil monitoring samples data or vibration data separately. The method is BP neural network. The second step is to fuse two different results to get a final result. The method is Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In the paper, fault diagnosis of the gear is used to verify the method above. These oil monitoring data and vibration data are collected from several experiments in which gear wear is simulated. In the end, the fusion result is compared with two single results, and the analysis shows that the proposed method is more effective than single method.

Vibration and oil analysis have become the two most commonly used techniques for fault detection and tracking. While these techniques are generally used independently, numerous case studies of machine failures have reported on the benefit of a correlated use. This paper discusses the development of a series of expert systems that, for the first time analyse vibration data in conjunction with oil and wear debris data for machine health assessment, as well as remaining lifetime estimation. The reports of previous research regarding the complimenting and sometimes contradicting nature of the correlation are discussed and compared to the results of the research outcomes.

The DTHD method is an extension of the works on FDD (the fault detection and diagnosis) which are based on FSM-based modeling FDD of DTHD models are suited for real time systems because of their capability of detecting faults leading to failures in terms of erroneous delays and deadlines The occurrences of faults or failures are represented for individual system components by categorizing the set of states of each individual system component model into normal or failed conditions of various types The condition corresponding to the states (of a component model) are represented by an unmeasurable variable The components are then composed to produce the overall representation of failures on the whole system model with a single unmeasurable variable.

Different from the traditional Fault Section Estimation methods, the proposed approach uses measurements available at the substation, circuit breaker and relay statuses. The data is analyzed using the principal component analysis (PCA) technique and the faults are classified according to the reactances of their path using a combination of HSSVMs classifiers and feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). The extensive numerical experiments performed for location of different kinds of faults of the transmission line have proved very good accuracy of fault location algorithm. The average error of fault location is about 4%. The result proved its effectiveness.

However. as components of mechanical system usually interact and Couple with each other, SampEn may Cause inaccurate or incomplete description of a mechanical vibration signal due to the fact that SampEn is calculated at only one single scale. In this paper, a new method, named multiscale entropy (MSE), taking into account multiple time scales, was introduced for feature extraction from fault vibration signal. MSE in tandem with support vector machines (SVMs) constitutes the proposed intelligent fault diagnosis method. Details on the parameter selection of SVMs were discussed. In addition, performances between SVMs and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were compared. Experiment results verified the proposed model.

One of the crucial difficulties of soft sensors is that predictive accuracy drops due to changes of state of chemical plants. To cope with this problem, a regression model can be updated. However, if the model is updated with an abnormal sample, the predictive ability can deteriorate. We have applied the independent component analysis (ICA) method to the soft sensor to increase fault detection ability. Then, we have tried to increase the predictive accuracy. By using the ICA-based fault detection and classification model, the objective variable can be predicted, updating the PLS model appropriately. We analyzed real industrial data as the application of the proposed method. The proposed method achieved higher predictive accuracy than the traditional one. Furthermore, the nonsteady state could be detected as abnormal correctly by the ICA model.

Data aquisition systems are used not only for diagnosis purposes but for realtime process monitoring. Any malfunctioning or deterioration in the operation of a machine component gives rise to increase in vibration level, those vibrations could result in poor surfaces finishing. Current diagnosis techniques can prevent machine-tools fault before it ocur saving time and money in manufacturing proccess.

By detecting changes in these precursors, deviation of the system from its healthy state can be detected early and unanticipated failures can be avoided. The case study illustrates the use of Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET) and Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to detect the onset of failure in Ball Grid Arrays (BGA) subjected to Accelerated Temperature Cycling (ATC) tests. The residuals from MSET show a shift in their distribution as they degrade; SPRT detects the anomalous behavior (degradation) in the interconnects. The time to detection of anomalies was found to be earlier than the time to failure of the BGA interconnects, providing a prognostic distance. Hence the change in resistance of the BGA can be used as a precursor to failure.

In this study, apart from the conventional applications, it is reported that the reference frame theory approach (RFTA) can successfully be applied to real time fault diagnosis of electric machinery systems as a powerful tool to find the magnitude and phase quantities of fault signatures with good precision. Although it is possible to run RFTA for each fault signature consecutively, orthogonal PN (Pseudo Noise) code is proposed as an alternative method to detect more than one fault simultaneously. As the physical facts explaining the incipient fault mechanisms are studied for a long time, the motor fault signature frequencies and fault models are very well-known. Therefore, ignoring all other components, the proposed method focuses only on certain fault signatures in the current spectrum depending on the examined motor fault. Broken rotor bar and eccentricity faults are experimentally tested employing the TMS320F2812 digital signal processor (DSP) to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. In this application, only the readily available drive hardware is used without employing additional components such as analog filters, signal conditioning board, external sensors, etc. The motor drive on-board DSP is utilized both for motor control and fault detection purposes providing instantaneous fault information. Being a model independent fault analyzer, this method can be applied to all multi-phase and single phase motors.

It covers both fault monitoring and decision making stages. In practice, a motor driven by an adjustable speed drive is run at various operating points where the frequency, amplitude and phase of the fault signatures varies with time. These dynamic changes are considered as one of the common factor that yields erroneous fault tracking and unstable fault detection. In this paper, the proposed algorithms deals with the operating point dependent ambiguities and threshold issues. It is theoretically and experimentally verified that the motor fault can continuously be tracked when the operating point changes within a limited range.

Typical fault symptoms firstly are normalized by the membership functions perceptively. Then some samples are used to train SVM of fault diagnosis. With the trained SVM, the correct fault type can be recognized. In the application of condenser fault diagnosis, the approach enhances successfully the accuracy of fault diagnosis with small samples. Compared with the general method of BP neural network, the method combining advantages of fuzzy theory and SVM makes the diagnosis results have higher credibility.

An efficient condition-monitoring scheme is capable of providing warning and predicting the faults at early stages. Usually, this task, is executed by humans. The logical progression of the condition-monitoring, technologies is the automation of the diagnostic process. To automate the diagnostic process, intelligent diagnostic systems Lire used. Many researchers have explored artificial intelligence techniques to diagnose failures in general. However, all papers found in literature are related to a specific problem that call appear in many different machines. In real applications, when the expert analyzes a machine, not only one problem appears, but more than one problem may appear together. So, it is necessary to propose new methods to assist diagnosis looking for a set of occurring fails. For some failures, there are not Sufficient instances that call ensure good classifiers induced by available machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a method to assist fault diagnoses in motor pumps, based on vibration signal analysis, using expert systems. To attend the problems related to motor pump analyses, we propose a parametric net model for multi-label problems. We also show a case study in this work, showing the applicability of our proposed method.

When the fault happens, the motor can be operated without breakdown, but it is necessary to maintain the motor for continuous working. In past research, several methods have been applied to detect winding faults. The representative approaches have been focusing on current signals, which can give important information to extract features and to detect faults. In this study, current sensors were installed to measure signals for fault detection of BLDC motors. In this study, the Park's vector method was used to extract the features and to isolate the faults from the current measured by sensors. Because this method can consider the three-phase current values, it is useful to detect features from one-phase and three-phase faults. After extracting two-dimensional features, the final feature was generated by using the two-dimensional values using the distance equation. The values were used in fuzzy similarity to isolate the faults. Fuzzy similarity is an available tool to diagnose the fault without model generation and the fault was converted to the percentage value that can be considered as possibility of the fault.

Mines in the Future - A Management Perspective	AUSIMM NEW LEADERS CONFERENCE 2009	AUSTRALASIAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY PUBLICATION SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	Australian-Institute-of-Mining-and-Metallurgy New Leaders Conference	APR 29-30, 2009	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Inst Min & Met, Univ Queensland, So Queensland AusIMM Student Chapter, THIESS, ORICA Min Serv				Mines in the future are highly productive, with low production costs and are significantly safer. They operate with a skeleton crew and use intelligent systems that fuse information from field instrumentation and other sources to generate the most efficient operating environment. Automated systems are seamlessly integrated across the mine and across the corporate enterprise. Geological models, long-term and short-term plans create optimised production schedules, suitably generated by the mine simulator. Production schedules are shared with the operations management system for deployment mainly by remotely operated and autonomous equipment. As the schedule is implemented, information is collected and shared with various plans, schedules, models and optimisation programs. This production environment is managed in real time from a 'Central Operations Centre' and it is visible across the business providing fast and accurate information about productivity, machine condition and environmental conditions. Central Operations Centres also house teams of subject matter experts that monitor and manage the mines and are able to communicate directly with the skeleton crew in the field. Constraints across the production line are displayed and managed appropriately from this location to maximise throughput. Maintenance is interactive and predictive. Reliability specialists in Central Operations Centres monitor the status of machinery and equipment and adjust maintenance plans and strategies to suit. Mining businesses rely heavily on knowledge workers - people with considerable knowledge and learning - and by manual workers. This new knowledge work-force is a team of associates rather than of bosses and subordinates. Field experts become leaders with tremendous autonomy regarding their work. The former line hierarchy becomes a support structure, intervening only in extreme emergencies; instead of giving orders, they are now removing barriers, expediting resources, conducting studies and acting as consultants.

The method was designed to overcome the difficulties encountered by traditional methods when coping with those real world problems where the key issue is the detection of particular situations - such as for instance machine faults or anomalies - which in some frameworks are hard to be recognized due to some interacting factors that are analyzed within the paper. The method is described and tested on two industrial problems, which show the goodness of the proposed approach and encourage its use in the industrial environments.

The series represent an isokinetic curve that is obtained from a group of patients performing a knee exercise on an isokinetic machine. This system has two steps: the first one is to analyze the input time series in order to generate a simplified model of an isokinetic curve; the second step applies a grammar-guided genetic program including an evolutionary gradient operator and an entropy-based fitness function to obtain a set of rules for a knowledge-based system. This system performs medical prognosis for knee injury detection. The results achieved have been statistically compared to another evolutionary approach that generates fuzzy rule-based systems.

The MFM decomposes the complex plant process from the main goal to each component at multiple levels to represent the contribution of each component to the whole system to make clear how the main goal of the system is achieved. The plant process is described abstractly in function level by mass, energy and information flows, which represent the interaction between different components and enable the causal reasoning between functions according to the flow properties. Thus, in the abnormal status, a goal-function-component oriented fault diagnosis can be performed with the model at a very quick speed and abnormal alarms can be fully explained by the reasoning relationship of the model.

Based on rigorous multi-resolution wavelet analysis, a fuzzy inference system is proposed to improve fault diagnosis performance for turbo-generator set. To obtain the accurate signal characteristics, the statistic rule is utilized to determine each order threshold of wavelet subspace and decomposition level adaptively, increasing the signal-noise-ratio. The effective eigenvectors are acquired by wavelet transform and the fault patterns are classified by fuzzy inference system. The mathematics model for turbo-generator fault diagnosis is established and the improved least squares algorithm is used to complete network parameters initialization and the network robustness is discussed. Different from wavelet neural network, the fuzzy wavelet basis functions can be specified by experts as traditional fuzzy system. By means of sample training phase, the wavelet fuzzy network indicates its good convergence property of training error. Furthermore, the architecture of wavelet fuzzy network can provide at least the same order of approximation error as neural network. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively diagnose vibration accident for turbo-generator.

In this work, we have used SVM based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methods to select patient attributes/features relevant to the etio-pathogenesis of complications following a drug eluting stent (DES) procedure. With a high dimensional feature space (145 features, in our case), and comparatively few patients, there is a high risk of 'over-fitting'. Also, for the model to be clinically relevant, the number of patient features need to be reduced to a manageable number, to be used in patient care. SVM-RFE selects subsets of patient features that have maximal influence on the risk of a complication. In our results, when compared with our initial model with all the 145 features, we obtained better performance of the classifiers with 75 top ranked patient features, a 50% reduction in the original dimensionality of the data space. There was a universal improvement in performance of all SVMs with different kernels and parameters. This method of feature ranking helps to determine the most informative patient features. Use of these relevant features improves the prediction of complications following a DES procedure.	[Gouripeddi, R. K.; Balasubramanian, V.

Increasing popularity of sensorless controlled variable speed drives requires research in area of reliability, range of stable operation, fault symptoms and application of diagnosis methods. Design/methodology/approach - T transformation used for conversion of instantaneous rotor currents electrical circuit representation to space vector components is investigated to apply with closed-loop modeling algorithm. Evaluation of the algorithm is based on analysis of asymmetry influence to the orthogonal and zero components of space vector representation. Multiscalar model of the machine and selected structures of state observers are used for sensorless control system synthesis. Proposed method of frequency characteristics calculation is used for state observers analysis in open-loop operation. Findings - New algorithm of applying the T transformation allows for closed-loop and sensorless control system simulation with asymmetric machine due to broken rotor. Compensating effect of the closed-loop control system with speed measurements and diagnosis information in control system variables are identified. Proposed frequency analysis of state observers is presented and applied. Variables with amplified characteristic frequency components related to rotor asymmetry are compared for selected structures of state observers and with closed-loop and open-loop operation. Method of improving the sensorless system stability is proposed. Practical implications - In closed-loop and sensorless control system rotor fault can be diagnosed by using PI output controllers variables. Compensating effect of mechanical variables sets limitation to specified diagnosis methods. Rotor asymmetry affects sensorless control system stability depending on estimator structure. Originality/value - This paper concentrates upon sensorless control system operation with machine asymmetry and indicates rotor fault symptoms.

Design/methodology/approach - The machine is modelled by using permeance network theory. The new feature introduced in the permeance network is the subdivision of magnets into segments, modelled as bidirectional elements. These bidirectional elements allow taking into account the effect of one element on the other. To detect the demagnetization faults, a gradient-based algorithm is also developed. This algorithm uses the permeance network model of the PMSM and measurement data of some parameter to find the distribution of remanent induction in the magnet segments. Findings - The methodology presented is able to detect the demagnetization fault using an external data. The measurement data in this paper is obtained through finite element simulations.

Although it is a relatively rare cancer and despite of improvement in prognosis due to recent radio-chemotherapy regimens, it is still a severe disease and only a minority of patients are cured. In the present work we propose a methodological approach, evaluating and benchmarking different supervised learning techniques for the prediction of response to induction treatment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Our research also focuses on the examination of the most significant indicators that contribute to the improvement of diagnosis.	[Manikis, Georgios C.; Kounelakis, Michail.

This is proportional to the tremendous increases of its bit/inch(2) storage capacity. With the significantly difficult lithography process will be involved and drastically increase in number of product total output volume that will be required in near future, conventional maintenance type is no longer feasible. This paper proposes a novel framework for the implementation of predictive maintenance in hard disk media production. A novel technique to visualize the temporal data into pattern that can be trained with machine learning algorithm is introduced. Predictive models were produced after dealing with imbalance datasets issue, ensemble datasets and data cleaning. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed framework is successful.

You can best apply inferential sensing to equipment and condition monitoring. The person operating the equipment can sense there is something wrong while their intuition tells them when and what needs troubleshooting and repair. Attempts have been made to implement this human intuition model to monitor vehicle operation and detect abnormalities. After years of development efforts and experimenting with various techniques, there are few highly reliable on-board systems that duplicate the human intuition model like the Condition Based Maintenance approaches. Conditioned Based Maintenance (CBM) can deliver value through avoiding the cost of unexpected down time and reducing life-cycle maintenance costs by scheduling repairs on the correct equipment subsystems at the correct times. These values are delivered by improving the understanding of the harsh environments in which the equipment operates and prognoses of pending failures. An on-board electronics hardware and software architecture that can deliver CBM Solutions by using inferential sensing methodologies in a low cost platform is outlined. Through real-time statistical data techniques, several months of data can be collected for several subsystems on a platform that is no more complex than a typical electronic control unit (ECU) used in today's off-road or on-highway vehicles. Condition Based Maintenance, Machine Health, and Prognostics are related terms which have extensive history of development with the overall goal to monitor equipment operation; manage machine maintenance; reduce service, warranty and operating costs; and optimize design life. An example of using vibration data combined with inferential sensing is illustrated through monitoring bearing health on a self-propelled forage harvester (SPFH).

A model-based diagnostic observer is adopted to detect, isolate and identify failures. Compensation of unknown dynamics, uncertainties and disturbances is achieved through the adoption of a class of neural interpolators, the support vector machines and trained off-line. Interpolation of unknown faults is performed by adopting an on-line neural interpolator based on radial basis functions, whose weights are adaptively tuned on-line. The effectiveness of the approach is experimentally tested on art industrial robot manipulator. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Creep is one of the dominant degradation mechanisms in the operating life of these components. Monitoring and prognostic of the damage accumulation rate are essential to estimate the remaining life of thermal plants. Literature shows that high temperature strain gages should be used in monitoring, systems although there are divergences in which model best suits the conditions of an industrial plant.

There are two main categories of methods to estimate frequency. One is based on the fast Fourier transform, and the other is on the signal subspace decomposition. Using FFT directly to estimate frequency may introduce larger estimation error, several approaches are proposed to correct or decrease the error, which comprise phase difference, energy centrobaric, interpolation and search method. The signal subspace decomposition method (SSDM) consists of Pisarenko harmonic decomposition, multiple signal classification. In order to assess the performance of these methods, the Cramer-Rao bound is used to compare with the error variance of difference frequency estimation methods, and simulations are based on Monte Carlo experiments for various record sizes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The results show that there is a turning point about 25 dB for FFT based methods, above which FFT based methods are less sensitive to the noise, and SSDM achieves higher precision estimation at higher SNR and for the short time series, but produces poor accuracy at lower SNR's.

The measurement can be performed both by accelerometers placed on the shaft bearing cages and directly on the shaft with use of the laser vibrometer. The procedure was verified on the experimental data. For the experimental verification authors have used the laboratory stand which allows simulation of different faults.

Current methods rely on the response of the machine to unbalance excitation during run-up, run-down or normal operation, and are mainly based on pattern recognition approaches. Of all machine faults, probably cracks in the rotor pose the greatest danger and research in crack detection has been ongoing for the past 30 years. For large unbalance forces the crack will remain permanently open and the rotor is then asymmetric, which can lead to stability problems. If the static deflection of the rotor due to gravity is large then the crack opens and closes due to the rotation of the shaft (a breathing crack), producing a parametrically excited dynamical system. Although monitoring the unbalance response of rotors is able to detect the presence of a crack, often the method is relatively insensitive, and the crack must be large before it can be robustly detected. Recently methods to enhance the quality of the information obtained from a machine have been attempted, by using additional excitation, for example from active magnetic bearings. This research is directed towards the concept of a smart rotating machine, where the machine is able to detect and diagnose faults and take action automatically, without any human intervention. This paper will consider progress to date in this area, with examples, and consider the prospects for future development.

The main idea of the method is firstly to select the condition-sensitive features extracted from rolling bearing vibration signals using Genetic Algorithm to form a condition vector. Then prediction model is established for each feature time series. And the third step is to establish support vector regression models to obtain prediction result in each series. Finally, the condition prognosis can be obtained through combing all components to form a condition vector. Vibration data from a rolling bearing bench test process are used to verify accuracy of the proposed method. The results show that the model is an effective prediction method with a higher speed and a better accuracy.

The advantage of such approach may be clearly seen especially for so called multi-faults problem, i.e. for more than one faults that occurred in the system. In complex mechanical systems like multistage gearboxes, such situation may be often seen. Although this approach becomes more and more popular, it has been noticed that there is difficult to find examples highlighting its potential, especially for real industrial situations. In order to fill partially the gap, the paper deals with the multi fault detection in complex mechanical systems like multi-stage gearboxes: fixed axis and planetary. It has been discussed that during the operation in such machines many faults may appear simultaneously and the classical method like envelope analysis is difficult to use. The paper presents the use of cyclo-stationary properties of signals to identify and characterize sources of modulation. From Spectral Correlation Density Map or more precisely Spectral Coherence Map have been observed the number of sources with different properties of modulation. It is shown that the number of harmonics is important for a kind of fault extraction and interpretation. This approach has been applied to two, three and five stage gearboxes used in mining industry. Vibration signals received in industrial environment during normal operation of objects are considered. It has been also proposed the simple diagnostic feature to estimate the changes of condition with application to a planetary stage in a 5-stage gearbox.

Therefore, timely detection of such rubbing is very important avoid severe consequences. Vibration based methods are very mature and traditional methods but not effective to detect incipient rubbing in rotating machinery. Rubbing between the rotor and the stator will cause elastic strain in the rubbing location and thus can produce acoustic emission (AE). Apparently, such AE contains direct and abundant information about the rubbing and can be used to detect and diagnose such fault effectively. In this paper, the AE based method is proposed for detecting and identifying the rubbing of the rotor-bearing system. An experimental study is presented to investigate the characteristics and features of rubbing AE using parameter analysis method. The results show that AE is very sensitive to the rubbing and AE parameters can reveal the characteristics and features of rubbing A-E. Parameter analysis demonstrates that rubbing AE contains multiple modals, which will attenuate with propagation by negative exponent manner.

It is very difficult to filter the fault vibration signals from the strong noise background because the roller bearing fault diagnosis is a problem of multi-class classification of inner ring fault, outer ring fault and ball fault. Firstly, vibration signals are processed by the pattern spectrum. Secondly, the morphological pattern spectrum entropy, and pattern spectrum values are utilized to identify the fault features of input parameters of PSVM classifiers. The experiment results demonstrate that the pattern spectrum quantifies various aspects of the shape-size content of a signal, and PSVM costs a little time and has better efficiency than the standard SVM.

The machine condition is assessed through an energy-based feature, termed as 'energy index', extracted from the vibration signals. The progression of the 'monitoring index' is predicted using Cl techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR). The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark datasets. The prognostic effectiveness of the techniques has been illustrated through vibration dataset of a helicopter drivetrain system gearbox. The performance of SVR was found to be better than RNN and ANFIS for the dataset used. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of damage/degradation and their progression.

It has become a good choice for machine learning both for supervised and unsupervised learning purposes. The SVM is primarily based on the mapping the data to a hyperplane using some kernel function and then increasing the margin between the hype planes so this hyperplane classifies the data in the normal and fault state. Due to large amount of input data, it is computationally cumbersome to yield the desired results in shortest possible time by using SVM. To overcome this difficulty in this work, we have employed statistical Time-Domain Features like Root Mean Square (RMS), Variance, Skewness and Kurtosis as pre-processors to the input raw data. Then various combinations of these time-domains signals and features have been used as inputs and their effects on the optimal model selection have been investigated thoroughly and optimal one has been suggested. The procedure presented here is computational less expensive otherwise to process the input data for model selection we may have to use super computer. The implementation of proposed method for machine teaming is not much complicated and by using this procedure, an impending fault/abnormal behavior of the machine can be detected beforehand.

The adoption of PHM approaches requires consideration and planning for integration into new and existing systems, operations, and processes. However, PHM must provide a significant advantage in order to add value for the maintenance process and commitments to implement and support PHM approaches cannot be made without the development of supporting business cases. The realization of PHM requires implementation at different levels of scale and complexity. The maturity, robustness, and applicability of the underlying predictive algorithms impact the overall efficacy of PHM within an enterprise. The utility of PHM to inform decision-makers within tight scheduling constraints and under different operational profiles likewise affects the cost avoidance that can be realized. This paper presents a case study conducted using a stochastic discrete event simulation model to determine the benefits and potential cost avoidance offered by electronics PHM (e-PHM). The case study of a multifunctional display in a Boing 737 compared the life cycle costs of a system employing unscheduled maintenance approaches to the same system using a precursor to failure PHM approach.

Doing so is crucial to ensure the relevance and correctness of the collected data. In this work we unify fault and event detection under a general anomaly detection framework. We use machine learning techniques to classify measurements that resemble a training set as normal and measurements that significantly deviate from that set as anomalies. Furthermore, we aim at an anomaly detection framework that can be implemented on motes, thereby allowing them to continue collecting scientifically-relevant data even in the absence of network connectivity. The general consensus thus far has been that learning-based techniques are too resource intensive to be implemented on mote-class devices. In this paper, we challenge this belief We implement an anomaly detection algorithm using Echo State Networks (ESN), a family of sparse neural networks, on a mote-class device and show that its accuracy is comparable to a PC-based implementation. Furthermore, we show that ESNs detect more faults and have fewer false positives than rule-based fault detection mechanisms. More importantly, while rule-based fault detection algorithms generate false negatives and misclassify events as faults, ESNs are general, correctly identifying a wide variety of anomalies.

Our previous work has focused on support vector machines (SVM), but we hypothesize that Bayesian networks (BN) can handle missing data better. To test the hypothesis, we trained a BN and SVM model for 2 year survival on 322 lung cancer patients and compared their performance in three separate external datasets (35, 47, 33 patients), each with their own characteristics in terms of missing data. The models used tumor size, clinical T and N stage, involved lymph nodes and WHO performance as prognostic features. We found that the BN model performed better than SVM (AUC 0.77, 0.72. 0.70 vs. 0.71, 0.68, 0.69), especially if tumor size was missing. We conclude that BN models are better suited for the medical domain, as they can handle missing data better.

In the pre-processing phase we built mathematical models of identification of the first natural frequency for the plate and beam and then verified it using the frequency numerical analysis based on FEM and the experiment. During the processing phase the fatigue test must take place. First the element is analysed in the fatigue numerical analysis in order to identify the parameters of loading and the number of cycles before crack initialization. Also at this time we are able to analyse the thermal mechanical coupling. This analysis is needed to identify the optimal loading frequency in the fatigue experimental test whilst considering the self-activating temperature between laminas in the laminate evoked by friction. In fatigue test the loading force, displacements and self-activating temperature are measured and the number of cycles is counted. Also we can conclude about the influence of the faults and its propagation to the life cycle of laminate.

Modeling and Experimental Investigation of Stator Winding Faults in Induction Motors	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						winding faults; transient analysis; induction motor d-q models; power system relaying	TURN FAULTS; MACHINES	Induction motors play a vital role in industrial applications. Early detection of abnormalities in the motor would help to avoid costly breakdowns. Realizing a versatile modeling of motor winding faults is essential for developing and evaluating protection functions. Accordingly, this article presents an accurate mathematical model for stator winding faults in induction motors for both transient and steady-state analysis. This model is based on the d-q-axis theory and is valid for phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, and turn-to-turn faults. These turn-to-turn shorts arise as one of the most prevalent and potentially destructive electrical faults in induction motors. For investigating the performance of the proposed modeling, an experimental setup is structured with a 0.5-HP, 2-pole, 380/220-V squirrel-cage induction motor. The motor stator winding was rewound for enabling a turn-to-turn fault application. The digital signal processing board (DS1003) is employed for data acquisition and recording purposes. A reasonably close agreement between the measured and simulated results has been observed, which supports the validity of the proposed analysis.

An induction machine model including interbar currents for studying performances during transients and steady state	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Broken rotor bar; Interbar currents; Induction motor; Modelling; Diagnostic	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; MOTORS	This paper presents a mathematical model of a three-phase induction motor taking into consideration the interbar contacts. Several models have been available in the references. However, they consider the rotor of the induction motor as being constituted either a three-phase or a squirrel cage even if it operates under stator and/or rotor faults condition. Nonetheless, the contact between a bar and the iron core for the machine has to be considered, especially when a rotor fault occurs. It is obvious that rotor currents are under the influence of rotor constitution materials. So, the paper aim's concerns a transient model of the induction motors which can consider the rotor broken bars defect. Despite its increasing complexity, it could be able to provide with useful indications for diagnostic purposes. This model is advocated for the simulation of motors behavior under rotor defect which takes into account the interbar currents. The proposed technique is based oil the mesh model analysis of the squirrel cage. As low power induction motors are prevalent in industrial plants, we pay a special attention on them. Notwithstanding, additional currents are due to the contact between the non-insulated bar constituting the squirrel cage to the rotor iron core. The monitoring of induction motors is predominantly made through the stator current analysis of the motor when it operates at nominal condition. Moreover, this one is observed in steady state operating system, knowing that the motor is generally fed by a sinusoidal supply. Consequently, simulation results showed in this paper prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the impact of interbar resistance both oil the model and the line current spectrum for the diagnostic. An experimental test proves the effectiveness of this model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the proposed method, EMD is used to decompose the vibration signal of complex machine into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), then the AR models of some IMF components which contain main fault information are constructed respectively. Finally, the correlation dimensions of auto-regressive parameters in AR models are Calculated. Analysis of the experimental results shows that this method not only can reflect the state changes of dynamic system profoundly and detailedly, but also can realize the separation of state features, thus it may judge the fault conditions of rolling mill main transmission system effectively.

The productivity can be achieved through the availability that can be increased through the adoption of efficient maintenance practices, by focusing the organisations on adequate type of maintenance strategy. Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) uses primarily non destructive testing techniques, as environmental indicators, visual inspection, monitoring functioning variables and performance data. This kind of maintenance replaces tasks of scheduled maintenance by warranted interventions predicted by on-condition limits previously defined. The interventions occur only when the equipments presents abnormal symptoms. The intervals of CBM are determined based on the expected delay to fail and are managed through the frequency by which the predictive interventions have to be done. The technological advances are accepted and applied on CBM systems, which includes improved knowledge of failure mechanisms, advancements in, failure forecasting techniques, monitoring and sensor devices, diagnostic and prognostic software, communication protocols, and computer networking technologies. The measurement precision and sensitivity of the Condition Monitoring (CM) techniques are used because they affect the reaction time available to reduce or eliminate the consequences of the functional failure. CBM maintenance tasks must be applicable under the situation of cost effective improvement, including external costs. The base of development of this paper is supported by an integrated system called SMIT (Terology Integrated Modular System), that permits to manage the maintenance itself, including on-condition maintenance, but it is modular enough to permit to associate new features, namely this last approach, in order to maintain the system up-to-date and, always possible, to anticipate the future.

Appreciation of the subject was performed with the help of data collected cases related to maintenance problems from Plants A and B. The first case was examined in aerial conductor manufacturing Plant A. The company does not apply predictive maintenance (PM) in management of the manufacturing activities. The machines used in conductor and similar wire processing plants have very big rotors and their loads on rotors continuously change. Therefore, these types of machines are good examples in checking the health of the machine regularly. The second case was analysed in vehicle tyre plant named as Plant B and it has perfect usage ability of vibration technique of PM methods. The importance of the regular collection of vibration signatures in evaluation of conditions of rotating machines has been analysed in details to indicate the power of the predictive maintenance technique in prevention of losses, which are caused by unbalanced forces, misalignments, improper lubrication of ball bearings, metal fatigue and cracks occurred in welding of constructed parts and locking of the ball bearings due to excessive heating. The second case observed in Plant B is an example to show detection of a ball bearing failure just in time. Evaluation of second case has been performed using measurements of vibration signatures of the machines with the help of fault indicator graphics.

J	Camci, F				Camci, Fatih			Comparison of genetic and binary particle swarm optimization algorithms on system maintenance scheduling using prognostics information	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						prognostics; condition-based maintenance; maintenance scheduling; binary particle swarm optimization; maintenance planning; genetic algorithm	SELECTION	Recent technical advances in condition-based maintenance technology have made it possible to not only diagnose existing failures, but also forecast future failures, which is called prognostics. A common method of maintenance scheduling in condition-based maintenance is to apply thresholds to prognostics information, which is not appropriate for systems consisting of multiple serially connected machinery. Maintenance scheduling is defined as a binary optimization problem and has been solved with a genetic algorithm. In this article, various binary particle swarm optimization methods are analysed and compared with each other and a genetic algorithm on a maintenance-scheduling problem for condition-based maintenance systems using prognostics information. The trade-off between maintenance and failure is quantified as the risk to be minimized. The forecasted failure probability of serially connected machinery is utilized in the analysis of the whole system. In addition to the comparison of a genetic algorithm and binary particle swarm optimization methods, a new binary particle swarm optimization that combines the good sides of two binary particle swarm optimizations is presented.

Rotor Position Sensor Fault Detection Isolation and Reconfiguration of a Doubly Fed Induction Machine Control	EPE: 2009 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-9			English	Proceedings Paper	13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE 2009)	SEP 08-10, 2009	Barcelona, SPAIN			Direct torque and flux control; Doubly fed induction motor; Efficiency; Reliability; Sensorless control		In this paper, a Doubly Fed Induction Machine (DFIM) operating in motor mode and supplied by two Voltage Source Inverters (VSI), in stator and rotor sides, is presented. The aim is to analyze the position sensor fault effects on a Direct Torque Control (DTC) of the DFIM. This justifies the necessity of a reconfiguration control when a position sensor fault appears in order to avoid an interruption in system operations. In the other hand, this study emphasizes the close dependency between system performance and the output accuracy of the rotor position sensor. Moreover, simulation results point out the operation system deterioration in case of position sensor fault, which leads in most cases to its shut down in contrast to industrial expectations. This work presents a control reconfiguration for a DFIM speed drive when a position sensor fault occurs, in order to ensure system service continuity. For this purpose, SABER simulation results illustrate the system behavior before and after a position sensor fault. System performance preservation is carried out after control reconfiguration. The proposed solution is relevant especially due to its simplicity.

Detection of Rotor Turn-to-Turn Faults in Doubly-Fed Induction Generators in Wind Energy Plants by means of Observers	EPE: 2009 13TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-9			English	Proceedings Paper	13th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE 2009)	SEP 08-10, 2009	Barcelona, SPAIN			Power system simulation; Electric machines; Fault diagnosis; Observers; State space methods	MACHINES; MOTORS	The importance of Condition monitoring and fault detection increases. This paper presents a state-space observer based condition monitoring algorithm for the detection of rotor turn-to-turn faults in doubly-fed induction generators. A reduced order time invariant machine model for asymmetrical internal parameters will be derived. The model is used for simulation of rotor turn-to-turn faults, which can cause phase to ground or phase to phase short circuits in the rotor. Furthermore a Luenberger observer will be designed using the reduced machine model. It can be used for detection and identification of rotor turn-to-turn faults by analyzing the different behavior of system and observer. Another advantage of the observer is its ability to reconstruct immeasurable internal states like the current in the short circuited turns of the turn-to-turn fault. Due to the fact that the induced fault current is speed dependent and becomes zero at synchronous speed, the reconstruction of the fault current can help to evaluate the danger of the short circuit current at the actual operating point of the generator and permits a limited operation until maintenance.

This paper proposes a novel scheme for performing integral condition monitoring in a drive containing a gearbox. The proposed scheme is based on a modified MCSA scheme (motor current signature analysis) that uses the drive rectifier input currents instead than the machine currents, as in the case of the conventional scheme. The approach is based on the principle that any fault signature generated due to a faulty component (machine, load, mains, or power converters) propagates through the drive's main components (rectifier-inverter). In most of the cases the fault signatures should be detectable at the input side by carefully looking at the rectifier supply currents. The proposed scheme allows not only condition monitoring of the gearbox and the machine, but other drive's components at no extra cost. An experimental investigation is carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme to detect a faulty gearbox in a PM servo drive operating under different working conditions. Important differences in magnitude for those frequencies related to the gearbox and system unbalances were found at the input side when the test was repeated with faulty gearbox, which demonstrates the feasibility of the scheme.

Application of accurate wear-out models can identify the dominant failure mechanisms at the design stage and can be employed in reliability assessment and health management under in-service conditions. The work in this paper presents the effect of power cycling frequency, load current and mean temperature on temperature variations within the power module structure and its impact on the life consumption for two common wear-out mechanisms (the bond wire and the substrate-solder). Compact real-time thermal models combined with physics of failure based reliability analysis are used to identify the dominant failure mechanism and predict the life-time of the power module for each thermal cycling condition. It is shown that bond wire degradation is the dominant failure mechanism for all power cycling conditions whereas substrate solder failure dominates for externally applied (ambient or passive) thermal cycling. In addition to informing the design process and enabling real-time health management, the knowledge gained from these studies can be used to design thermal cycling experiments for selected failure mechanisms.

The importance of eliminating false positives and false negatives for these instruments is driving work around embedded test, condition monitoring and both diagnostics and prognostics. This paper proposes two solutions for detecting degradation in electrodes that interface to fluidic or biological systems and form the basis of numerous actuation and sensing mechanisms in the bio-fluidics area. A low frequency, impedance based method for identifying degraded structures within an array is proposed that is backed up by physical measurements from an electrode array for drug testing on cardiac and neuron tissue.

The phase independence characteristics of the SRM enable it to operate (at lower power and higher torque ripples) also under partial phase failure conditions. Its reliability can be improved during its conception stage by applying special fault tolerant designs and in its exploit by monitoring its condition and applying fault detection techniques. In the paper first the most typical faults and their detection methods are summarized. In the second part of the paper a fault tolerant SRM structure is proposed and analyzed by means of simulations. The obtained results emphasize the usefulness of fault tolerant SRMs.	[Szabo, Lorand; Ruba, Mircea] Tech Univ Cluj, Dept Elect Machines, Cluj Napoca, Romania		Szabo, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Cluj, Dept Elect Machines, Cluj Napoca, Romania.

A failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis (FMMEA) for the IGBT power module is performed to identify critical failure mechanisms. For the failure mechanisms identified, relevant physics of failure models are discussed. In addition, the parameters affected by the critical failure mechanisms are identifed that are to be monitored in application. The implementation of this prognostics approach involves precursor parameter monitoring, parameter isolation and trending, and the use of relevant physics of failure models for remaining useful life estimates.

The approach focuses on the prefailure space and methodologies for quantification of damage progression and residual life in electronic equipment Subjected to shock and vibration loads using the dynamic response of the electronic equipment. Traditional health monitoring methodologies have relied on reactive methods of failure detection often providing little or no insight into the remaining useful life of the system. The proposed techniques have a wide-applicability to electronic systems requiring high reliability. Operational readiness and high-system availability are critical for reduction Of uncertainty in mission-critical electronic systems. Examples include aerospace-electronic systems which usually face a very harsh environment, requiring them to Survive the high strain rates, e.g. during launch and re-entry and thermal environments including extreme low and high temperatures and implantable biological systems Such as pacemakers and defibrillators. Prognostic indicators can trigger preventive maintenance based on need instead of "fear-of-failure". Auto-regressive (AR), wavelet packet energy decomposition, and time-frequency (TFA) techniques have been investigated for system identification, condition monitoring, and fault detection and diagnosis in electronic systems. The test vehicle subjected to repeated proof-load events consists of a wide frequency range. In this approach the known auto correlation sequence of the Feature vectors, is extrapolated to estimate auto correlation sequence at unknown lags. One of the main advantages of the AR technique is that it is primarily a signal based technique. Reduced reliance on system analysis helps avoid errors which otherwise may render the process of fault detection and diagnosis quite complex and dependent on the skills of the analyst. Results of the present study show that the AR and TFA based health monitoring techniques are feasible for fault detection and damage-assessment in electronic units. Explicit Finite element models have been developed and various kinds of failure modes have been simulated such as solder ball cracking, package falloff and solder ball failure.

A study of fault diagnosis in a scooter using adaptive order tracking technique and neural network	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Adaptive order tracking; Neural network; Back-propagation; Radial basis function network	ROTATING MACHINERY; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	An expert system for scooter fault diagnosis using sound emission signals based on adaptive order tracking and neural networks is presented in this paper. The order tracking technique is one of the important approaches for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery. The different faults present different order. figures and they can be used to determine the fault in mechanical systems. However, many breakdowns are hard to classify correctly by human experience in fault diagnosis. In the present study, the order tracking problem is treated as a parametric identification and the artificial neural network technique for classifying faults. First, the adaptive order tracking extract the order features as input for neural network in the proposed system. The neural networks are used to develop the training module and testing module. The artificial neural network techniques using a back-propagation network and a radial basis function network are proposed to develop the artificial neural network for fault diagnosis system. The performance of two techniques are evaluated and compared through experimental investigation. The experimental results indicated that the proposed system is effective for fault diagnosis under various engine conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, TS; Huang, CL				Li, Te-Sheng; Huang, Cheng-Lung			Defect spatial pattern recognition using a hybrid SOM-SVM approach in semiconductor manufacturing	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Wafer bin map; Defect diagnosis; Pattern classification; Semiconductor manufacturing; Self-organizing map; Support vector machine		As manufacturing geometries continue to shrink and circuit performance increases, fast fault detection and semiconductor yield improvement is of increasing concern. Circuits must be controlled to reduce parametric yield loss, and the resulting circuits tested to guarantee that they meet specifications. In this paper, a hybrid approach that integrates the Self-Organizing Map and Support Vector Machine for wafer bin map classification is proposed. The log odds ratio test is employed as a spatial clustering measurement preprocessor to distinguish between the systematic and random wafer bin map distribution. After the smoothing step is performed on the wafer bin map, features such as co-occurrence matrix and moment invariants are extracted. The wafer bin maps are then clustered with the Self-Organizing Map using the aforementioned features. The Support Vector Machine is then applied to classify the wafer bin maps to identify the manufacturing defects. The proposed method can transform a large number of wafer bin maps into a small group of specific failure patterns and thus shorten the time and scope for troubleshooting to yield improvement. Real data on over 3000 wafers were applied to the proposed approach. The experimental results show that our approach can obtain over 90% classification accuracy and outperform back-propagation neural network. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cho, HW				Cho, Hyun-Woo			Data description and noise filtering based detection with its application and performance comparison	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Support vector machines; One-class classification; Orthogonal filtering; NNDD; PCADD	ORTHOGONAL SIGNAL CORRECTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BATCH PROCESSES	Abnormalities should be detected reliably so that corrective actions can be taken to maintain a high quality level of products. Fault or outlier detection provides early warning for a fault and identification of its assignable cause. The availability of large real-time datasets has motivated the study of data-driven approaches to fault detection. Recently, many powerful kernel-based nonlinear learning techniques have been developed and shown to be very effective tools. As one of one-classification methods, SVDD is able to define a boundary around samples with a volume as small as possible. This paper proposes a data description-based detection method combined with orthogonal filtering for enhanced detection abilities. The orthogonal filtering as a preprocessing step is executed before SVDD modeling to remove unwanted variation of data. The performance of the proposed method was demonstrated using data of two test processes. The case study has shown that the proposed method produces reliable detection results. In addition, the use of SVDD combined with orthogonal filtering step outperformed other one-class classification-based detection methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this problem, a new SVM algorithm based on possibility degrees (PDSVM) is proposed. Considering the variation of the geometric significance among different classes in a training data set, the possibility degrees of samples are defined in this paper To reflect the geometric shape of one class the possibility degrees of the samples of the class are calculated according to the Mahalanobis distances between the samples and the centroid of the pattern class. Then the training samples and their possibility degrees are trained together with the SVM, so as to make the important samples are classified exactly and the negligible samples are ignored. Based on the numerical experiment, the algorithm is applied to the servo valve fault diagnosis and gains a good effect. According to the theoretical analysis and the experiment, the algorithm is effective and robust.

Fourier transform is hard to analyze these signals. A new method based upon empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectrum is proposed for fault diagnosis of roller bearings. We get vibration signals from 6205-type ball bearings with inner-race faults and with outer-race faults, then analyzing its local Hilbert spectrum and local Hilbert marginal spectrum. Comparing the results with theory value, we can diagnose the fault of rotary machinery fault. In this study, we find that local Hilbert spectrum and local Hilbert marginal spectrum are very useful. Hilbert Transformation is introduced to confirm the HHT method is fit to process nonlinear and non-stationary signals.

Besides, when confronted with multiple fault signals, fusion parameters can be dynamically adapted based on principles of fuzzy soft clustering so as to promote immune ability in artificially mechanical systems. The key point in this new approach lies in its power on faults detection, which requires no prior information on the state vectors of the sensors and system behavior, and no supplemental machine learning operation is required. The proposed algorithm combines principles of artificial immune system and the classical technique in fuzzy theory, which will consist of two main portions. In the first part a traditional data fuse structure is constructed, the sensor signals will be fed into it to implement the fuzzy aggregating algorithm.

The proposed system concentrates on the two different cognitive tests for the diagnosis of different stages of dementia. Dementia is considered as the fourth most common disorder among the elderly. Early detection of dementia and correct staging of the severity of dementia is very much required for the further treatment. Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN) approaches in data mining finds its applications in various fields, in the present study the applications of ML as well as NN methods used for classifying dementia states to improve accuracy over current dementia screening tools. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) are recommended tools for screening of patients by the Agency for Health Care Policy Research (AHCPR).Both ML and NN methods improve the classification accuracy for MMSE and FAQ. When compared to the accuracy obtained from AHCPR. By combining both the tests along with ML and NN it is observed that the accuracy can be optimized.

The rubbing fault of a rotary machine was simulated with a rubbing-block. The decomposed signals at every level were continuous for the case without rubbing fault, while the decomposed signals were bursting signals at level 1, level 2 and level 3, and continuous signals at level 4, level 5 for the case with rubbing fault. The correct rate of test samples was more than 92%, which indicated that the method can be used to identify rubbing faults effectively. The complexity of the SVM model was decreased and the calculation was simplified by using wavelet transform.

Ayaka provides a general monitoring method for detecting anomalies using only resource usage information on systems independent of its domain, target application and programming languages. Ayaka modifies the kernel to detect faults and uses a completely application black-box approach based on machine learning methods. It uses the clustering method to quantize the resource usage vector data and learn the normal patterns with Hidden Markov Model. In the running phase, Ayaka finds anomalies by comparing the application resource usage with learned model. The evaluation experiment indicates that our prototype system is able to detect anomalies, such as SQL injection and buffer overrun, without significant overheads.

The costs of bounded-exhaustive testing include machine time for test generation and execution (which translates into human time waiting for these results) and human time for inspection of results. This paper proposes three techniques that reduce these costs. Sparse Test Generation skips some tests to reduce the time to the first failing test. Structural Test Merging generates a smaller number of larger test inputs (rather than a larger number of smaller test inputs) to reduce test generation and execution time. Oracle-based Test Clustering groups failing tests to reduce the inspection time. Results obtained from the bounded-exhaustive testing of the Eclipse refactoring engine show that these three techniques can substantially reduce the costs while mostly preserving fault-detection capability.

The increasing stringent requirement of quality of a product needs considerable attention in the performance and reliability of the manufacturing system. In general, the feedback control algorithm for a process designed to handle small perturbation that may arise under normal operating condition but can not accommodate any abnormal behavior due to fault. Thus the automated maintenance or early detection of worn equipment is becoming a critical issue. This justifies the need of development of effective methodology in the area of fault aware controller. In this paper we proposed a novel Algorithm and it have been tested and implemented for making Highly reliable system like Automated Cricket Ball Stitching Machine. Considering this need the present paper proposes the work on the development methodology of fault aware controller using embedded processor with reference to an early needle failure detection of a leather stitching machine.				jrc@cmeri.res.in; tribeniju@gmail.com; akbece12@yahoo.com; ajith.abraham@ieee.org	Abraham, Ajith/A-1416-2008; Banerjee, Prasad/AAH-8160-2020	Abraham, Ajith/0000-0002-0169-6738; Banerjee, Prasad/0000-0003-4276-9881			ALUR R, THEORETICAL COMPUTER, V126, P1834; *ATMEL CORP, MAN 89C 2051 CHIP; Demetriou MA, 1998, IEEE T AUTOMAT CONTR, V43, P1612, DOI 10.1109/9.728881; JAN LZ, DIAGNOSIS DISCRETE E; Mall R., 2007, REAL TIME SYSTEMS TH; Norstrom C., 1999, Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications.

In particular, the system computes the values of two indexes introduced by the authors in previous work. The capability of the aforementioned indexes to detect rotor asymmetries in open loop asynchronous AC drive systems has been previously evaluated. In this paper the author will demonstrate that the proposed indexes are effective even when a closed-loop speed control strategy is employed. The developed diagnostic device has been integrated in a V/f inverter drive system featuring encoder-feedback. A proper experimental setup allowed to simulate rotor faults and to evaluate the performance of the diagnostic system. In the last part of the work the experimental results will be presented and discussed.

The paper is about how machine current signature analysis (MCSA) can reliably diagnose faults in squirrel cage motors or generators and determinate if there is any difference in the application of this method when the same machine is working as motor or as generator. This paper focuses on the experimental investigation for incipient fault detection and fault detection methods, suitably adapted for use in squirrel cage machines. The proposed system diagnoses asynchronous machines having three types of faults such as broken rotor bars, short circuit of stator windings and bearing fault when the machine is working as motor and as generator. After processing current data the classical Fast Fourier Transform is applied to detect characteristics under the healthy and various faulted conditions with MCSA and it has been studied which are the differences.

This voltage is induced only by the rotor flux and does not depend on the mechanical load, the voltage supply time harmonies, etc... The diagnosis technique is based on monitoring the amplitude oil harmonies components in the frequency domain using both FFT and MUSIC methods. The experimental results show the presence of harmonies of order 6m +/- 1, m=1,2,3 ... for healthy and faulty machine. When there is a rotor bar fault, the amplitude of these harmonics grows. The spectral analysis shows that MUSIC method is more reliable than the FFT technique, and the induced voltage technique is independent on the load level	[Hamdani, S.] USTHB Houari Boumedien Univ Sci & Technol, Elect & Ind Syst Lab, BP 32,El Alia 16111 Bab Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria; [Bouzida, A.; Touhami, O.; Ibtiouen, R.] Res Labs Electrotech, Algiers 16200, Algeria		Hamdani, S (corresponding author), USTHB Houari Boumedien Univ Sci & Technol, Elect & Ind Syst Lab, BP 32,El Alia 16111 Bab Ezzouar, Algiers, Algeria.	ham_samir@yahoo.fr	Ibtiouen, Rachid/O-9723-2018; Ibtiouen, Rachid/Y-6991-2019; Ibtiouen, Rachid/AAQ-4070-2020; BOUZIDA, AHCENE/N-3419-2019	BOUZIDA, AHCENE/0000-0002-3485-2194			Benbouzid MEH, 1999, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V14, P1065, DOI 10.1109/60.815029; CUPERTINO F, 2003, P IECON 03 29 ANN C, V3, P2829; Henao H, 2004, IEEE T IND APPL, V40, P726, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2004.827480; Joksimovic GM, 2000, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V47, P1078, DOI 10.1109/41.873216; Kia SH, 2005, IEEE IND ELEC, P2603; Kia SH, 2006, IEEE IND ELEC, P774; Milimonfared J, 1999, IEEE T IND APPL, V35, P1000, DOI 10.1109/28.793359; Nandi S, 2002, IEEE T IND APPL, V38, P101, DOI 10.1109/28.980363; Nandi S, 2006, IEEE T IND APPL, V42, P1201, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2006.880838	9	0	0	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-1735-3				2009							914	+					2	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BKV18	WOS:000269315000167					2022-02-14

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is applied to the measured start-up current. More specifically, the space vector of the stator start-up current is decomposed into complex Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) in order to analyze the asynchronous machine's transient. It is shown that in the case of rotor fault a particular IMF arises which characterizes the presence of the fault. The instantaneous frequency and the amplitude of the IMF can be used for an efficient fault diagnosis.

Complementary diagnosis of rotor asymmetries through the tracing of the Right Sideband Component in the stator startup current	ICEM: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES, VOLS 1- 4			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines	SEP 06-09, 2008	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL				INDUCTION MACHINES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BAR FAILURES; SIGNAL	In this paper, the tracing of the Right Sideband Component (RSC) evolution in the stator startup current is proposed for the diagnosis of rotor asymmetries in induction machines. Although several works have dealt with the detection of the Left Sideband Component (LSC) during the transient, few contributions have focused on the RSC, perhaps due to its more difficult detection, since it has often lower amplitude. In this work, several signal processing techniques, such as the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and band pass filtering are applied in order to extract this component during the transient. Several experimental startup current signals are used for this purpose. The results show that the transient extraction of the RSC might constitute an additional source of information which could enable a more reliable diagnosis of the fault, mainly in those cases in which the transient LSC evolution could be partially masked by other phenomena.

The test is designed to reproduce in the laboratory the cage degradation process of an induction motor subjected to a high amount of working cycles, which include heavy startups. During each cycle, the main magnitudes related to the motor condition monitoring are registered, at steady state as well as at transient regime. From these magnitudes, some fault indicators described in the literature are calculated, and so, it is possible to follow their evolution. This analysis assesses the use of such small commercial machines in a test bed as a way of developing a failure that can be used to compare the behaviour of the different diagnosis techniques and also the determination of the threshold values for the application of the diagnosis methods, or the necessity to proceed with further modifications or even build a dedicated prototype.				viclial@doctor.upv.es; mriera@die.upv.es; joanda@die.upv.es; jroger@die.upv.es	Riera-Guasp, Martin/K-5102-2013	Riera-Guasp, Martin/0000-0003-1327-242X			Antonino-Daviu JA, 2006, IEEE T IND APPL, V42, P990, DOI 10.1109/TIA.2006.876082; Bellini A, 2001, IEEE T IND APPL, V37, P1248, DOI 10.1109/28.952499; CABANAS MF, 1999, P INT S DIAGN EL MAC, P537; Cubert J.

The Instantaneous Frequency Signature Analysis (IFSA) relates to the monitoring of the fundamental frequency modulation for the diagnosis of faults. The rotor and stator faults in induction machines involve an internal magnetic imbalance, which is reflected in the stator current. This effect may be detected by estimating the fundamental instantaneous frequency signature via stator current. The IFSA is a non-intrusive, on-line monitoring technique for the faults diagnosis.

Rotor Fault Detection in Closed Loop Induction Motors Drives by Electric Signal Analysis	ICEM: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES, VOLS 1- 4			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conferece on Electrical Machines	SEP 06-09, 2008	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL				VIENNA MONITORING METHOD; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES	This paper deals with the diagnostic procedures that can be applied to assess the severity degree of rotor faults in closed loop induction motor drives with different control architectures. Field Oriented Control (FOC), with or without speed loop, and Direct Torque Control (DTC) are investigated in order to validate the robustness of the diagnostic procedures versus control regulator parameters and motor load. This paper investigates a variety of diagnostic procedures based on several electric quantities depending on control architecture, as a matter of fact spectral components of motor currents and motor voltages, of manipulated and controlled variables, and the third harmonic of voltage zero sequence are taken in to account as possible fault alert signals or diagnostic indexes. Eventually the spectral components of motor currents due to a high frequency voltage injection are considered as well. It turns out that these components, if injection frequency is suitably chosen, give a simple and effective index, independent of the control structure and of control parameters, able to detect and quantify the fault severity.

Non-Stationary Condition Torsional Vibration Monitoring Using Induction Machine Electromagnetic Torque Estimation	ICEM: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES, VOLS 1- 4			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines	SEP 06-09, 2008	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL			Induction machine; Condition monitoring; Torque estimation; Mechanical stresses; Torsional vibration	FAULT-DETECTION; FLUX OBSERVER; FAILURE; MOTORS; LOAD; GEARBOX	Mechanical anomalies like load troubles, great torque dynamic variations and torsional oscillations, result in the fatigue of the shaft driving electrical machine and other mechanical parts as bearings and gearboxes of complex electromechanical systems. Particularly in non-stationary condition, torsional vibration can reach important levels at resonant frequencies by producing weaknesses in the mechanical part and lifetime consumption during an event. In this way, this paper proposes electromagnetic torque estimation using non-invasive measuring as a means for mechanical torsional stresses monitoring in an induction machine driving system at non-stationary operating condition. A test-bed based on a 5.5kW squirrel-cage induction machine connected to one-stage gearbox has been used to validate the proposed method.	[Kia, Sh.

The proposed approach is derived from sensorless control schemes based on HF voltage signal injection for tracking position in a surface-mount PM machine. In this paper the method of space-modulation profiling (SNIP) is used to obtain a magnetic signature of the machine operating under healthy conditions. This signature can then be compared with the on-line measured saliency profile during normal operation to detect any abnormality in the drive's performance. The main application of the presented scheme is for the detection of windings problems such as insulation breakdowns and short circuits. Experimental results are shown for the case of a PM servo drive where incipient and full short-circuit faults have been emulated and successfully detected. Due to its relatively simple implementation and since no additional transducers are required, this approach presents an interesting alternative for condition monitoring.

Diagnosis of Rotor Faults in Traction Drives for Railway Applications	ICEM: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES, VOLS 1- 4			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Electrical Machines	SEP 06-09, 2008	Vilamoura, PORTUGAL				INDUCTION MACHINES; BARS	This paper presents the Virtual Current Technique as a new model-based diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of rotor faults in traction drives for railway applications. The occurrence of a rotor fault in a traction drive based on induction motors introduces some oscillations at twice the slip frequency in the rotor flux as well as in the magnetizing current component. By measuring the amplitude of these oscillations and after an adequate processing of this information, using some motor and controller parameters, one can reconstruct a virtual magnetizing current component which, after adequate normalization, can be used to detect and quantify the extension of rotor faults in a drive subjected to a direct rotor field oriented control scheme. The simulation and experimental results shown demonstrate that with this diagnostic technique, it is possible to diagnose effectively rotor faults, independently of the drive operating conditions, both in steady-state and transient regime.

The observed signal containing too much redundancy information, the application of BSS in machine vibration signals is a new method for feature extracting. The traditional BSS model usually neglect that machine vibration signal always is wideband signal for it can be viewed as sums of differently convolved source, and non-stationary, which will brings the dissatisfactory effects for machine fault diagnosis. In this paper, the BSS technique based on second-order statistic been expended to blind de-convolution (BD), combined the advantage of time-frequency analysis (TFA), a TFA-BD algorithm is proposed for machine vibration signal. The experimental result of the numerical simulation data and the actually measuring data shows that the method is efficiency. Comparable with traditional BSS, the performance index of separation can be increased by once at least. The method is suitable for machine vibration signal processing and fault diagnosis.

The relative energy distribution of frequency bands of vibration signal provides the quantitative evidence to the identification of the crank bearing wear fault. So the feature extraction of wavelet packet energy was used to extract the relative energy signature of frequency bands from different signals as the input feature vector of fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM). The membership grade of sample was introduced and the pattern recognition algorithm of FSVM that made full use of the fuzzy information of the crank bearing wear condition was put forward. Further, the diagnosis model of the crank bearing wear fault integrated the feature extraction of wavelet packet energy and FSVM was established. The diagnosis results show that the diagnosis model can realize the early identification of the crank bearing wear fault.

This work presents a simple and yet, fast approach to detect simultaneous machinery faults using sound mixture emitted by machines. We developed a microphone array as the sensor. By exploiting the independency of each individual signal, we estimated the mixture of the signals and compared time-domain independent component analysis (TDICA), frequency-domain independent component analysis (FDICA) and Multi-stage ICA. In this research, four fault conditions commonly occurred in industry were evaluated, namely normal (as baseline), unbalance, misalignment and bearing fault. The results showed that the best separation process by SNR criterion was time-domain ICA. At the final stage, the separated signal was analyzed using Instantaneous Frequency technique to determine the exact location of the frequency at the specific time better than spectrogram.

In this paper, an improved time-domain blind deconvolution algorithm, based on envelope spectrum and normalized kurtosis, was proposed to recover acoustic signals of defective bearings. A newly defined distance measure based on envelope spectrum was employed to improve the classification accuracy of independent components in the cluster analysis process, and a kurtosis-based criterion was applied to select optimum components. With the help of these enhancements, reliable estimated results can be obtained with low computational complexity, even when the time-delay or the reverberation time is sufficiently large. Both numerical and experimental studies were carried out. The results show that this algorithm can be efficiently applied to rolling element bearing defect detection in real-world situations, and is very promising in acoustic-based machine diagnosis.

In this paper, a new method of fault diagnosis based on principal components analysis and support vector machine is presented on the basis of statistical learning theory and the feature analysis of vibrating signal of rolling bearing. The key to the fault bearings diagnosis is feature extracting and feature classifying. Multidimensional correlated variable is converted into low dimensional independent eigenvector by means of principal components analysis. The pattern recognition and the nonlinear regression are achieved by the method of support vector machine. In the light of the feature of vibrating signals, eigenvector is obtained using singularity value decomposition, fault diagnosis of rolling bearing is recognized correspondingly using support vector machine multiple fault classifier. Theory and experiment show that the recognition of fault diagnosis of rolling bearing based on principal components analysis and support vector machine theory is available in the fault pattern recognizing and provides a new approach to Intelligent fault diagnosis.

These types of models are effective cost reducing tools used in industrial development cycles. There are many variables that can be used as input both internal and external to model automobile performance. The focus of this paper is on those external variable factors such as environment conditions that are not controllable by a human but are instantaneously measurable and affect performance. This paper presents CI-PASM, A Computational Intelligence Based Prognostic Automotive System Model. Initial feature reduction was accomplished by a human expert. Principal Component Analysis was performed to further reduce the input set. Using expert chosen features, the CI-PASM algorithm produced results having an error at worst in the hundredths of a second. These output results were compared against a support vector machine implementation and were shown to be superior. The CI-PASM mean error was half that of the support vector machine error. Results from using PCA attributes and a support vector machine indicated that these are relevant alternative methods given different requirements.

This fact easies fault detection, with the subsequent prevention of dramatic malfunction. In this paper the rotor of a container gantry crane is monitored to get the kurtosis of its normal operation. Then, two types of rolling bearings faults are modeled, according to the design of the rotors crane. These signals are added to the real normal operation recordings, and processed under an estimator of the SK. The experience allows the conformation of a higher-order statistical fault-pattern data base, without the need of stopping huge machinery, and with the subsequent saving, settling the basis of an automatic surveillance system.

According to the method, the five characteristic gases dissolved in transformer oil were extracted by the K-means clustering (KMC) method as feature vectors, which were input to chaotic optimal multi-classified SVMs for training. Then the CSVMs diagnosis model was established to implement fault samples classification. Experiment showed that by adopting facture extraction with KMC, the diagnosis information was concentrated and the consuming in parameter determination was solved effectively.

This project for oil-filled power transformers is taken up by Cooperative Research Centre for Integrated Engineering Asset Management (CIEAM) to develop knowledge models for prediction of remaining life of operating transformers and for other asset decision making processes in prognosis of failure rate. The aims at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) are to come up with partial discharge (PD) and relaxation condition indicators. In this paper, analysis of the earlier paper results is presented to arrive at condition indicators for aging. The time domain results are analyzed with three techniques and frequency domain results are analyzed with four techniques based on the reported dielectric response models. The study yields new dynamic information on aged status to develop the multiple diagnostic models for the prediction of the remaining life, rate of degradation and developing faults.

It can be obtained by concatenating inputs triggering state transitions followed by final state verification sequences. Usually, the latter are derived from a distinguishing set or sequence, assuming that a given FSM possesses it. It has been suggested that, under certain conditions, Unique Input/Output (UIO) sequences can also be used. In this paper, we propose using sequences with less state distinguishability power than distinguishing and UIO sequences. Such sequences are shorter and thus can reduce the length of checking sequences. We formulate conditions under which such sequences can replace distinguishing and UIO sequences and elaborate a checking sequence generation method based on these conditions. An example is provided to demonstrate that the proposed method yields a checking sequence shorter than existing methods.

Application of TFD tools for the tracing of eccentricity-related components in induction machines	IECON: 2009 35TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society	NOV 03-05, 2009	Porto, PORTUGAL	IEEE Ind Elect Soc			ROTOR BAR DETECTION; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; SPECTRUM	The analysis of the stator startup current for the diagnosis of mixed eccentricities has been revealed as an alternative reliable way for detecting the presence of this fault. It avoids some of the constraints of the classical diagnosis approach, based on the identificarion of the eccentricity-related components appearing in the FFT spectrum of the steady-state current. In this context, the selection of suitable Time-Frequency Decomposition (TFD) tools for the analysis of non-stationary quantities-such as the startup current- plays a crucial role. Previous works have proven the reliability of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Hilbert-Huang Transform (HUT) for tracing the transient evolution of eccentricity-related components and, therefore, for the diagnosis of the fault. In this paper, a different tool, the Wigner Ville Distribution (WVD) is applied to the diagnosis of mixed eccentricities, making special emphasis in the detection of high frequency components introduced by this fault. Moreover, a brief comparison with respect to HUT and DWT is carried out, showing the main advantages and drawbacks of each tool regarding the transient-based diagnosis of the aforementioned fault.

Diagnosis of stator short-circuits through Wigner-Ville transient-based analysis	IECON: 2009 35TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society	NOV 03-05, 2009	Porto, PORTUGAL	IEEE Ind Elect Soc			ROTOR BAR DETECTION; INDUCTION MACHINES	Diagnosis of stator inter-turn and inter-coil short-circuits is a matter of increasing concern in the industry. The identification of the specific components amplified by these faults in the Fourier spectrum of the steady-state current has been a reason for controversy between different groups of authors. Alternative diagnosis of these faults based on the analysis of transient processes of the machine has led to interesting results, showing characteristic evolutions of fault-related components able to be detected by modern time-frequency decomposition (TFD) tools such as wavelet or Hilbert transforms. These evolutions arise as reliable indicators of the presence of the fault in the machine. In this paper, the Wigner-Ville and the Choi-Williams distributions are applied for the tracing of stator short-circuit-related components during the startup transient. This tool might enhance some of the features of other alternative TFD tools such as the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT, with regards to the diagnosis of these faults. Simulation and experimental results prove the ability of this tool, providing interesting conclusions on how the components related to these faults evolve during the transient.

The proposed parameter is a partial average power based on the power converter supply current and the rotor mechanical position information. At high speed operating conditions phase current is not regulated and the machine closed-loop control only needs to observe one current, which is the power converter supply current, in order to avoid excessive current amplitudes. The adopted control strategy is clearly explained. Several simulation results are presented and discussed considering different operating conditions. The normal operation, a fault occurrence in a power switch and a sudden mechanical load decrease are analysed. The simulation results permit to validate the proposed partial average power as an appropriate parameter for the diagnosis of an open-circuit fault in a power switch.

In this study, reliable control was applied to a Position servo system that was made to examine the reliable control method in an industrial machine and study its characteristics. The system uses an equivalent transfer function (ETF) for active redundancy compensation after a loop failure and has a fault detection and isolation scheme for the loop failure. The principle of the transfer function is that when a sensor is broken down and the sensor information cannot be acquired, the transfer function of the system differs from a transfer function of the normal system, hence the compensator (the ETF) that conforms the transfer function of the failing system to the transfer function of the normal system stabilizes the failing system. The ETF compensates for the failure of a system using software such that the failing system continues to be in control by switching the normal control program to the control program including compensation for the failing. In this study, the system including the ETF is analysed experimentally	[Karino, Atsutoshi; Ishikawa, Kaoru; Nakamura, Taro] Chuo Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Precis Mech, Bunkyou Ku, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Tokyo 1128551, Japan		Karino, A (corresponding author), Chuo Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Precis Mech, Bunkyou Ku, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Tokyo 1128551, Japan.

Furthermore, high power peaks mean the need for more electrical power contracted, which in turns leads to more fixed operation cost and inefficient use of the electrical installations. In this context, we present a genetic algorithm approach to implement demand-side management (DSM) in an automated warehouse. It has been based on real data from ASRs and models of prognosis of load profile of ASRs. We took into account two main goals: minimize instantaneous power demand and keeping the performance of the system store and retrieval times.	[Cardenas, J. J.; Garcia, A.; Romeral, J.

The thermal model is based on considering the slots and teeth as independent elements with their own temperature. It corresponds to a real motor used in the tractive wheel of an electric vehicle. The model of the vehicle is also obtained in BG and is coupled to the motor. The complete model allows simulating the whole dynamics in a single model and the analysis of electrical/mechanical/thermal interaction is performed. Simulation results are intended to illustrate this interaction under faulty and healthy conditions in the stator winding. The impact on the mechanical and thermal domain produced by a fault in the electrical domain is also analyzed.

Operating in aggressive environments, with plans onshore or offshore, the detection of anomalies at an incipient stage is a crucial step to decide about the operating continuity of the machines. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with High Multiresolution Analysis (HMRA) of stator currents is here proposed in order to detect rotor faults. The instantaneous fault frequency evolution (IFFE) and frequency sliding (FS) are proposed for improving the ability of DWT in extracting the contribution of each left side harmonic dynamically over time. Moreover the mean power at different resolution levels was introduced as a diagnostic index for fault quantification. Simulations and experimental results show the effectiveness of this new method in discriminating healthy from faulty rotor in time-varying operating condition.

The exact failure modes/components in the PCB/Module can be identified by SVM. The results show the proposed modeling and diagnosis methods are effective and are suitable for complex electronic devices diagnosis.

However, there are still open issues that, if suitably addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1) the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for analog circuit fault diagnosis. This system is based on a hybrid PSO optimization framework formulated in such a way as to detect the best discriminative features and to estimate the best SVM parameters in a completely automatic way.

SVM is often chosen as the learning machine because of its good generalization ability in small sample decision problem. However, in practical applications, because the fault samples are hard to acquire, the number of fault sample is far less than that for normal samples, which makes fault diagnosis a typical imbalanced problem. And it is found that traditional SVM can not ensure good performance in this situation. So in this paper, we propose an improved SVM-mu SVM. In the new method, a parameter mu was introduced into the decision function, so that weight for fault class can be adjusted, and consequently the influence of fault class in decision function can be enlarged. Simulation experiments show that this method is effective in solving the problem of analog circuit fault diagnosis.

Back propagation neural network (BPNN) have been proved to be of widespread utility for identifying and classifying gear box faults to prevent serious damage in a mechanical system. Some researchers have used particle swarm optimization (PSO) to train BPNN. However, because the PSO algorithm has several parameters to be adjusted by empirical approach, if these parameters are not appropriately set, the search will become very slow near the global optimum and even trap into local minima. In this paper, a novel hybrid intelligent method for classifying gear box faults based on vibration signal using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, differential evolution (DE) algorithm and BPNN named PSO-DV based BP is presented. The proposed PSO-DV includes both faster convergence of PSO and capability escape from local optima of DE. Experiments were performed on a gear-box fault simulator. The fault samples are obtained by simulating corresponding fault on experiment gear-box. In presented work, a classical PSO based BP neural network and PSO-DV based BP neural network are used for gear box fault classification, their relative effectiveness in fault diagnosis is compared. The experimental results verified that proposed hybrid PSO-DV intelligent method can escape from local minima, so has better convergence than BP neural network and classical PSO based BP neural network. Meanwhile, it achieves also very high accuracy rate of recognition and thus provides decision support in fault classification.

Dynamic Verification of Memory Consistency in Cache-Coherent Multithreaded Computer Architectures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING			English	Article						Reliability; fault tolerance; multiprocessors; multithreaded processors		Multithreaded servers with cache-coherent shared memory are the dominant type of machines used to run critical network services and database management systems. To achieve the high availability required for these tasks, it is necessary to incorporate mechanisms for error detection and recovery. A correct operation of the memory system is defined by the memory consistency model. Errors can therefore be detected by checking if the observed memory system behavior deviates from the specified consistency model. Based on recent work, we design a framework for the dynamic verification of memory consistency ( DVMC). The framework consists of mechanisms to dynamically verify three invariants that are proven to guarantee that a specified memory consistency model is obeyed. We describe an implementation of the framework for the SPARCv9 architecture, and we experimentally evaluate its performance by using full-system simulation of commercial workloads.

The diagnostic system is dedicated to the high-speed train propelled by an induction motor. An analysis of the observed variables allows the identification of problems in the mechanical part of the main traction drive. For example, in the case of speed sensor faults, the motor control system could be switched into speed-sensorless control.

Power Transformer Fault Classification Based on Dissolved Gas Analysis by Implementing Bootstrap and Genetic Programming	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS			English	Article						Bootstrap; dissolved gas analysis (DGA); fault classification; feature extraction; genetic programming; K-nearest neighbor (KNN); neural networks; power transformer; support vector machine (SVM)		This paper presents an intelligent fault classification approach to power transformer dissolved gas analysis (DGA), dealing with highly versatile or noise-corrupted data. Bootstrap and genetic programming (GP) are implemented to improve the interpretation accuracy for DGA of power transformers. Bootstrap preprocessing is utilized to approximately equalize the sample numbers for different fault classes to improve subsequent fault classification with GP feature extraction. GP is applied to establish classification features for each class based on the collected gas data. The features extracted with GP are then used as the inputs to artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers for fault classification. The classification accuracies of the combined GP-ANN, GP-SVM, and GP-KNN classifiers are compared with the ones derived from ANN, SVM, and KNN classifiers, respectively. The test results indicate that the developed preprocessing approach can significantly improve the diagnosis accuracies for power transformer fault classification.	[Shintemirov, A.; Tang, W.; Wu, Q.

J	Fenner, JS; Jeong, YS; Jeong, MK; Lu, JC				Fenner, Joel S.; Jeong, Young-Seon; Jeong, Myong K.; Lu, Jye-Chyi			A Bayesian parallel site methodology with an application to uniformity modeling in semiconductor manufacturing	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Bayesian framework; multiple response surface; multistage manufacturing; parallel site model; single response surface; uniformity model	PROCESS FAULT-DETECTION	The increasing use of standard machines in manufacturing processes provides opportunities for sharing information from similar operations to improve the accuracy of process model characterization for supporting root cause analysis and process monitoring activities. This article investigates how to integrate data from parallel sites that are alike in some ways but dissimilar in others. The parallel sites could be several machines that accomplish the same process step, several industrial locations that produce the same product or even several different time windows for the same machine. The proposed Bayesian parallel site model flexibly allows for a compromise between pooling the data completely and treating sites as completely unrelated. One of the key features in the hierarchical model is the quasi-common parameters that are different from site to site, but have some commonality between sites. The similarities between the individual quasi-common parameters are modeled through common global hyperparameters which determine the prior distribution for the quasi-common parameters. A case study on the uniformity modeling (across the different dies on a silicon wafer, across slots in a furnace, etc.) illustrates how the hierarchy of a Bayesian model can be used to incorporate correlation structure. The Bayesian approach provides the flexibility for handling many other possible parallel data source scenarios that might be encountered in many applications.

J	Brice, P; Jiang, W				Brice, Pierre; Jiang, Wei			A context tree method for multistage fault detection and isolation with applications to commercial video broadcasting systems	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Categorical data streams; dynamic systems; Markov chains; statistical process control	UNIVERSAL DATA-COMPRESSION; QUALITY	Many systems have distributed functionalities among several autonomous components. Such complex systems can generally be described by finite state machines whose behavior is often non-linear and context-dependent. This paper proposes a generic system model based on context trees to predict system behavior for the purpose of fault detection and isolation in a multistage serial system. The approach starts with learning multistage model structures by capturing the expected statistical distribution of the input/output at different stages. The estimated model is then employed to detect departures by comparing the contexts of the new system output with a set of optimal contexts for each stage using the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. Problems can then be isolated to the stage that contributes the most to these differences. The methodology is demonstrated by an application in commercial video broadcasting systems.

This field is increasingly drawing the attention of the industries because the modern electric motors work as electric cams inducing the shaft to move with a cyclic variable-velocity profile. The literature papers take into account only a constant velocity profile and they are not suitable for such applications. In fact literature methods analyse the signal only in the frequency domain, while in variable-velocity condition the bearing diagnostics should be performed in time domain. Both WT and HHT are time-frequency techniques which describe at? input signal as a sum of specific functions. These functions are compared with a signal which simulates the expected vibrations of a bearing with a given fault, e.g. on the outer race. The comparison is done through a cross-correlation between the expected signal and the time-frequency techniques output. WT and HHT are used separately in an industrial case, which consists in bearing fault prediction in an automated packaging machine. In the end of the paper the WT and HHT results are discussed to analyse the different responses.

The proposed security mechanisms are based on physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and they address different, fault, injection threats oil various parts of the FSM. The first mechanism targets the protection of state-transitions, ill a specific class of FSMs. The second mechanism addresses the integrity of secret, information. This is of particular interest in cryptographic FSMs which require a secret key. Finally the last mechanism we propose introduces a new fault-resilient error detection network (EDN). Previous designs for EDNs always assume resilience to fault, injection attacks without providing a particular construction. The, PUF-based EDN design is suitable, for a variety of application, and is essential for, most fault resilient state machines.

We consider attacks under an adversarial model which assumes an advanced attacker with high temporal and spatial fault injection capability. Due to the non-uniform characteristics of FSMs, simple application of the systematic non-linear codes will not provide sufficient protection. As a solution to this problem, we use randomized masking. Furthermore, we show that our proposal detects injected faults with probability exponentially close to 1.

Machine Learning Framework for Classification in Medicine and Biology	INTEGRATION OF AI AND OR TECHNIQUES IN CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING FOR COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatial Optimization Problems	MAY 27-31, 2009	Pittsburgh, PA				CPG ISLAND METHYLATION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; MODELS	Systems modeling and quantitative analysis of large amounts of complex clinical and biological data, may help to identify discriminatory patterns that can uncover health risks, detect early disease formation, monitor treatment and prognosis, and predict treatment, outcome. Inn this talk, we describe a machine-learning framework for classification in medicine and biology. It consists of a pattern recognition module; a feature selection module, and a classification modeler anti solver. The pattern recognition module involves automatic image analysis, genomic pattern recognition, and spectrum pattern extractions. The feature selection module consists of a combinatorial selection algorithm where discriminatory patterns are extracted from among a large set of pattern attributes. These modules are wrapped around the classification modeler and solver into a machine learning framework. The classification modeler and solver consist of novel optimization-based predictive models that maximize the correct classification while constraining the inter-group mis-classifications. The classification/predictive models 1) have the ability to classify any number of distinct groups; 2) allow incorporation of heterogeneous, and continuous/time-dependent types of attributes as input;; 3) utilize a high-dimensional data transformation that minimizes noise and errors in biological and clinical data; 4) incorporate a reserved-judgement region that provides a safeguard against over-training; and 5) have successive multi-stage classification capability. Successful applications of our model to developing rules for gene silencing in cancer cells, predicting the immunity of vaccines, identifying the cognitive status of individuals, and predicting metabolite concentrations in humans will be discussed.

It is based on the so-called voltage spectrum of an auxiliary winding which is a small coil inserted between two of the stator phases. An expression of the inserted winding voltage and its Park components are presented. After that, discrete Fourier transform analyzer is required for converting the voltage signals from the time domain to the frequency domain. Simulations results curried out in the case of an oscillating, varying load torque and non defected motor show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

By simulating the mechanisms of biological immune system such as immune memory, clone selection and self-adaptation, AICSA achieves the dynamic control of evolution process, which realizes global optimal computing combined with the local searching. Compared with traditional evolutionary algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only has higher convergence rate and better searching ability, but also can avoid prematurity and degeneration phenomenon. The experimental results show that feature selection for machine learning is necessary, and AICSA can efficiently reduce the number of features while improving the performance of network fault diagnosis based on SVM.

Rolling element bearings are the most common cause of rotating machinery failure. The existence of the amplitude modulation and noises in the faulty bearing vibration signal present challenges to effective fault detection method. The wavelet transform has been widely used in signal de-noising, due to its extraordinary time-frequency representation capability. In this paper, a new technique for rolling element bearing fault diagnosis based on the autocorrelation of wavelet de-noised vibration signal is applied. The wavelet base function has been derived from the bearing impulse response. To enhance the fault detection process the wavelet shape parameters (damping factor and center frequency) are optimized based on kurtosis maximization criteria. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in revealing the bearing fault impulses and its periodicity for both simulated and real rolling bearing vibration signals.

The framework of fault diagnosis unit was established first, which consisted of signal acquisition, diagnosis rule extraction and fault identification mechanism. The technique of diagnosis rule extraction was then studied and an algorithm for acquisition of decision rules was proposed. The algorithm simplified the analysis of core properties and unnecessary properties, and calculated reduction set by the backwards tracking approach. This algorithm reduced complexity in reductions calculation and improved the efficiency of rule extraction. Finally, to process failure data collected by various sensors, a fault identification mechanism using evidence theory was presented. Feasibility and practicability of the proposed method has been verified by the development and the preliminary application of a prototype system.

J	Cho, HW				Cho, Hyun-Woo			Enhanced diagnostics using orthogonal de-noising based nonlinear discriminant analysis and its application to multivariate data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Classification; Multivariate data; Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis; Discriminant partial least squares; Orthogonal signal correction	BATCH PROCESSES; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SIGNAL CORRECTION; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; PLS	Many multivariate statistical techniques have been developed to solve fault diagnosis problems for productivity and quality improvement. Recently, nonlinear kernel techniques (e.g. support vector machines) have been successfully applied to a number of applications such as bio-informatics, face recognition, handwritten digit recognition, etc. The basis of these techniques is to map input data into a nonlinear space; these mapped data are then analysed. Using the kernel trick on these methods makes it possible to develop powerful kernel-based nonlinear techniques and to extract information from the mapped data. This paper proposes a new diagnosis method based on kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), a nonlinear kernel technique. It utilizes KFDA to extract nonlinear patterns of data effectively. In addition, an orthogonal de-noising technique, called orthogonal signal correction, is incorporated into the proposed framework and used as a pre-processing step. This de-noising is executed before KFDA modeling in order to remove unwanted variation of data. A case study on two processes has been conducted. The proposed method produced reliable diagnosis results and the use of KFDA modeling combined with the orthogonal de-noising technique was able to improve the classification performance.

J	Chinnam, RB; Baruah, P				Chinnam, Ratna Babu; Baruah, Pundarikaksha			Autonomous diagnostics and prognostics in machining processes through competitive learning-driven HMM-based clustering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						autonomous diagnostics; competitive learning; hidden Markov model; clustering of sequential data; prognostics; remaining-useful-life		A prerequisite to widespread deployment of condition-based maintenance (CBM) systems in industry is autonomous yet effective diagnostics and prognostics algorithms. The concept of 'autonomy' in the context of diagnostics and prognostics is usually based on unsupervised clustering techniques. This paper employs an unsupervised competitive learning algorithm to perform hidden Markov model (HMM) based clustering of multivariate temporal observation sequences derived from sensor signal(s). This method improves autonomy of the diagnostic engine over the more traditional classifier based diagnostics models. Classifier models, such as the model presented by Baruah and Chinnam [Baruah, P. and Chinnam, R. B., 2005. HMM for diagnostics and prognostics in machining processes. International Journal of Production Research, 43 (6), 1275-1293] employ 'labelled' feature vectors for supervised model building and subsequent health-state classification during condition monitoring. Improving the autonomy of the diagnostics model also improves the autonomy of the prognostics module that often builds upon information extracted through the diagnostics module. We have validated the proposed methods on a physical test-bed that involved monitoring drill-bits on a CNC machine outfitted with thrust-force and torque sensors. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of this method to estimate on-line the remaining-useful-life of a drill-bit with significant accuracy.

PHD2 (Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2) isoform is the main regulator of HIF-1 alpha degradation in normoxia and mild hypoxia. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between expression of PHD2 and radiosensitivity in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC). Patients and methods: Paraffin embedded sections from untreated primary tumours were obtained for immunohistochemistry in 48 HNSCC patients scheduled for preoperative radiotherapy (RT). Nuclear expression of PHD2 was evaluated as a percentage of tumour cells showing positively stained nucleus. RT was a split-course accelerated hyperfractionated regimen (1.6 Gy twice a day) in 15 patients and standard in 33 patients. Viability of cancer cells was routinely evaluated histologically from resected tumours at planned surgery 3-4 weeks after RT. The follow-up time after multimodality treatment was five years or until death. Results: PHD2 expression was low in normal tissues and well differentiated tumours. The expression was increased and predominantly nuclear in poorly differentiated tumours. In tumours later found to be sterilised by RT, nuclear PHD2 expression was markedly lower as compared to tumours showing viable cells at surgery (p = 0.04). A low nuclear staining of PHD2 (<10% of PHD2-positive nuclei) in the primary tumour was found to associate with good radiation response (p = 0.005). Conclusions: We found low PHD2 expression and in particular low nuclear expression to predict a favourable response to RT. Therefore, nuclear PHD2 expression may act as a surrogate marker for radiation resistance in HNSCC.

The techniques presented here focus on extracting relevant information from spectral matrices. These techniques are qualified as parsimonious tools for exploring the behaviour of current vector valued signals in the frequency domain with minimal loss of information. In fact, the new diagnostic method obtains data from the three stator currents by exploring special fault characteristic frequencies in the power spectral density of the first principal component. The main advantage of this new diagnostic tool is its ability to extract automatically the characteristic frequencies relative to the different machine operating modes. This is accomplished using the proportion of the power attributed to the first principal component and/or using the sensor contribution to the power at specific frequencies. Thus, the new diagnostic method gives a good basis for an automatic non intrusive condition monitoring for rotating machinery.

However, this classification method has some weaknesses. For example, it can not separate fuzzy information, particularly sensitive to the interference and the isolated points of the training samples. Besides, it has great demand for memory in calculation. In view of the problems mentioned above, a binary tree-based fuzzy SVM multi-classification algorithm (BTFSVM) has been put forward. This paper focuses on the study of the application of the theory BTFSVM to fault diagnosis on the gearbox of ships. Simulation experiments show that the algorithm has better anti-interference ability and classification effects than others. Consideration should be taken into account that it can be further applicable to the diagnosis on other mechanical faults of ships.

By approaching these limits, circuits are becoming increasingly sensitive to noise, which will result in unacceptable error rates and make further nanometer scaling increasingly difficult. The error detection scheme based on GRAAL architecture (Global Reliability Architecture Approach for Logic) combines latch-based design and time redundancy techniques to achieve high detection efficiency for temporary faults (timing faults, SEUs, and SETS) at low area, power and speed penalties. In this paper, we use a finite state machine (FSM) circuit as test vehicle to validate the error detection architecture. The experimental results validate the claimed high error detection efficiency.

This paper presents a new approach to unifying techniques in the time, scale, and frequency domains. Specifically, spectral post-processing is performed on the data set extracted by wavelet transforms to enhance the effectiveness of defect feature extraction. The theoretical framework for such a generalized signal transformation platform is introduced, and boundary conditions for implementing the new technique are discussed. Comparison with enveloping technique based on band-pass filtering and wavelet transform has shown that the new technique is more effective in identifying structural defects in bearings, and computationally more efficient, thus providing a good alternative to envelope analysis for defect signature extraction in machine condition monitoring.

J	Wang, J; Xu, GH; Zhang, Q; Liang, L				Wang, Jing; Xu, Guanghua; Zhang, Qing; Liang, Lin			Application of improved morphological filter to the extraction of impulsive attenuation signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Feature extraction; Impulsive attenuation; Improved morphological filter; Structure element optimization; Rolling bearings	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SPEED	Rotating machinery response is often characterized by the presence of periodic impulses modulated by high-frequency harmonic components. It can be defined with three parameters, which are natural frequency, fault frequency and decay coefficient. In this paper, we propose an improved morphological filter for feature extraction of the above signals in the time domain. Firstly, an average weighted combination of open-closing and close-opening morphological operator, which eliminates statistical deflection of amplitude, is utilized to extract impulsive component from the original signal. Then, according to the geometric characteristic of impulsive attenuation component, the structure element is constructed with an impulsive attenuation function, and a new criterion is put forward to optimize the structure element. The proposed method is evaluated by simulated impulsive attenuation signals with different natural frequencies and vibration signals measured on defective bearings with outer race fault and inner race fault, respectively. Results show that the background noise can be fully restrained and the entire impulsive attenuation signal is well extracted, which demonstrates that the method is an efficient tool to extract impulsive attenuation component from mechanical signals.

A vast majority of these systems are often subjected to mechanical vibration. A possible consequence is performance degradation and structural damage that may eventually lead to widespread catastrophic failures. This chapter presents a recently reported technique of data-driven pattern recognition, called Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF), for online detection of slowly evolving anomalies (i.e., deviation from the nominal characteristics) and the associated behaviorial uncertainties. The underlying concept of SDF is built upon the principles of Statistical Mechanics, Symbolic Dynamics and Information Theory, where time series data from selected sensor(s) in the fast time scale of the process dynamics are analyzed at discrete epochs in the slow time scale of anomaly evolution. Symbolic dynamic filtering includes preprocessing of time series data using the Hilbert transform. The transformed data is partitioned using the maximum entropy principle to generate the symbol sequences, such that the regions of the data space with more information are partitioned finer and those with sparse information are partitioned coarser. Subsequently, statistical patterns of evolving anomalies are identified from these symbolic sequences through construction of a (probabilistic) finite-state machine that captures the system behavior by means of information compression. The concept of SDF has been experimentally validated on a special-purpose computer-controlled multi-degree of freedom mechanical vibration apparatus that is instrumented with two accelerometers for identification of anomalous patterns due to parametric changes.

Condition monitoring of manufacturing appliances is often based oil the analysis of machines' vibrations, as the emergence of the fault call be indicated by the variation of the vibration signals that they produce. This is because when a machine or a structural component is in good condition, its vibration profile has the "normal" characteristic shape, and it will change as a fault begins to develop. Piezo-electric accelerometers and microphones are the most common vibration sensors used in fault diagnostics. However, they appear to be less attractive for oil-line quality control because of several limitations, such as invasiveness, problematic installation and high sensitivity to background noise. For these reasons, the use of Laser Doppler Velocimeters (LDV) has become an increasingly popular technique owing to the non-contact principle of the laser. However, despite the advantages of LDV, vibration measurements on rough surfaces can be distorted by undesired surface effects, such as the speckle noise. Acquired vibration signals have to be processed and analysed in order to identify the characteristics that allow distinguishing between the good and the faulty machinery. To this end, several techniques of signal processing have been developed in the last years such as FFT based analysis, Wavelet analysis, Order analysis, etc. After a brief introduction on the vibration theory for on-line diagnosis, this chapter presents an overview of the most common vibration measurement transducers and data analysis techniques, followed by some examples of their applications in the development of test benches for industrial production lines both on electro-mechanical components, such as universal motors and on assembled complex systems, such as washing machines.

The experimental studies have been carried out at a thermal power plant located in Istanbul-Esenyurt. The plant is a special-purpose company founded to implement the project of natural gas fired combined-cycle and cogeneration system having the capacity of 180 MW electricity and 180 MW heat. Esenyurt Power Plant has been developed to meet both the heat energy requirement of the region and electricity requirement of the country. The electric energy produced by the plant is transferred to the national network at 154 kV high-voltage line passing over the plant area. There are various induction motors in the power plant. Though the critical machines have stand-by units, any failures which may occur in the motors may cause workforce loss, time loss and economical losses. For that purpose, the bearing faults which may occur in the machines are detected at the start-Lip phase by making character inference of the vibration indications received from the motor regarding bearing faults; and by this way they can be replaced before they cause any failure in the machines.

The algorithm is simpler and can easily be implemented on a microcontroller or more efficiently; using both microcontroller and FPGA. The other novel thing is that this method does not require system knowledge in the form of a mathematical model; instead knowledge of system behavior in general is sufficient for fault detection using this approach. The method uses crankshaft speed fluctuations as input and compares them with an ideal engine behavior to generate the residuals to identify the cylinder showing the maximum non-uniformity. The index of cylinder showing maximum non-uniformity is fed to a Mealy machine. The output of Mealy machine is processed for fault identification in the presence of noise. The method is capable to detect a single as well as multiple misfire events. The method is applied to a four stroke, four cylinder IC engine and simulation results are presented.	[Rizvi, M.

A state machine model of the correct component is augmented with internal transitions that represent hypothesized faults. Also, constraints on the occurrence or timing of faults are included in this model. This model of a faulty component is then extended with fault detection and recovery mechanisms, again in the form of state machines. Desired properties of the component are model checked for each of the successive models. The models can be made relatively detailed such that they can serve directly as blueprints for engineering, and yet be amenable to exhaustive verification. The approach is illustrated with a design of a triple modular fault-tolerant system that is a real case we received from our collaborators in the aerospace field. We use UPPAAL to model and check this design. Model checking uses concrete parameters, so we extend the result with parametric analysis using abstractions of the automata in a rigorous verification.

Dynamically Detecting Faults via Integrity Constraints	METHODS, MODELS AND TOOLS FOR FAULT TOLERANCE	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Methods, Models and Tools for Fault Tolerance	JUL 03, 2007	Oxford, ENGLAND			Integrity constraint; action system; fault detection; real-time programming	SYSTEMS	Control programs for safety-critical systems are required to tolerate faults in the devices they control. In this paper we examine a systematic approach to devising code to detect faulty devices at runtime. The approach is centred around the use of integrity constraints, which are invariants on the state of a system's variables, including its inputs and outputs. Under normal operation integrity constraints should always hold, but they are designed to fail to hold if there is a fault. By adding variables to capture the previous state of variables or the time of significant events, additional integrity constraints can be devised to check for faults in state transitions or faults with the rate of progress of the system. We discuss techniques for devising integrity constraints as well as efficiently evaluating the constraints. When an error is detected via the failure of an integrity constraint, the integrity constraint(s) that failed can help diagnose the likely fault. The techniques are presented by way of a simple case study of controller software written in the action system style, but the approach is equally applicable to other state machine approaches such as Event-B and TLA.

The diagnosis procedure belongs to simulation-before-test techniques, where simulations of the circuit under test (CUT) are performed at the before-test stage. Two examples have been verified for parametric and catastrophic faults in the time domain, but the conclusion is driven with the use of assumed features. A fault-driven test (FDT) has been applied to a filter circuit and a specification-driven test (SDT) to a field-programmable analog array (FPAA). The SVM classifies features which are calculated from the time domain responses. Results obtained from the examples prove a high detection and localization level of circuit states with the use of the SVM classifier.

Artificial immunisation algorithm (AIA) is used to optimise the parameters in PSO in this paper. The AIA is a new optimisation method based on the biologic immune principle of human being and other living beings. It can effectively avoid the premature convergence and guarantees the variety of solution. With the parameters optimised by AIA, the total capability of the PSO classifier is improved. The fault diagnosis of mine hosit shows that the PSO optimised by AIA can give higher recognition accuracy than the normal PSO.

The analysis of learning and testing of data sets (generated for the selected analog system) allows determining the difficulty of the system for the diagnostic procedure. This helps to compare different artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches used to detect, locate and identify faults. The versatile method of the data sets' difficulty based on the graph clustering algorithm is proposed and explained. It is then applied to test two advanced methods: fuzzy logic and rough sets against the sixth order Butterworth lowpass filter. The paper is concluded with future prospects of the proposed method.

These advances have often accompanied reductions in personnel resources and a diminishing expertise base. Conversely, the resolution of problems in the global manufacturing complex increasingly go beyond the abilities of individual experts and can be very time consuming as the process is influenced by a large number of, often, interactive variables. The application of expert systems in the textile industry can help address many of these problems more effectively and economically. In this chapter, an overview of expert system technology is given and different types of expert systems including rule-based, fault trees, model-based, machine learning and hybrid approaches are described and compared. A brief review of system principles, strengths and shortcomings is given and the development strategy is described. Finally, various applications of expert systems in different sectors of the textile industry including product components (fibre, yarn and fabric), coloration and finishing as well as supply chain and management are highlighted and future trends are briefly portrayed.

Model-Based Fault Detection on a Rotor in an Actively Supported Bearing Using Piezoelectric Actuators and the FXLMS-Algorithm	MOTION AND VIBRATION CONTROL			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Motion and Vibration Control	SEP 15-18, 2008	Tech Univ Munchen, Munich, GERMANY		Tech Univ Munchen			This paper examines the application of the Filtered-X Least Mean Square (FXLMS) algorithm in the domain of model-based fault detection and fault diagnosis to prevent errors in rotating machinery and increase the reliability. The advantage of this model-based approach is the combination of unbalance detection and vibration reduction. Using the FXLMS method, it is possible to detect harmonic disturbance and identify the fault unbalance in a stationary operating point. In reality, this fault may occur in aero engines e. g. due to burst of blade or loss of parts. The aim is to detect an unbalance at an early state before the rotor approaches the region of resonance, where this fault would lead to large radial displacements and forces. The experimental setup consists of an elastic shaft. One of its ball bearings is actively supported by two piezoelectric stack actuators. The rotor with its two disc elements has its first flexural mode at a frequency of 59 Hz and is able to operate up to a rotating frequency of 80 Hz. Eddy current sensors detect the radial displacement of the rotor. These displacement signals are provided to the adaptive filters, which realise external clamping through the actuators and generate information about the fault even at low frequencies. When the filter parameters reach a constant value, quantitative information about the magnitude of the unbalance can be calculated using the plant model. This model-based approach guarantees detection of a fault occurring spontaneously, whereas signal-based methods have difficulty identifying this fault far away from resonance. The concept is explained in detail. Simulation results and experiments on the test rig show the suitability of the method.

SMART MACHINE HEALTH AND MAINTENANCE: TOOL ASSEMBLY PROGNOSTICS	MSEC 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2008, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	OCT 07-10, 2008	Evanston, IL	ASME, Mfg Engn Div				It is well-established that unbalance in tool assembly causes excessive loads on spindle bearings and tool wear and increased vibration levels. However, in the days where highspeed machining (HSM) has become a common practice in the manufacturing industry, methodologies to measure tool assembly unbalance are not developed. In HSM the effects are worse, as the unbalance force is directly proportional to square of the spindle speed. Common practice in industry is to balance the tool assembly either with in-house balancing machines or use third-party balancing services after every batch cycle. This paper describes a data-driven methodology that detects the presence of unbalance in a tool assembly relative to the tools with known balance levels. The unbalance detection prognostic application developed as part of the Smart Machine Platform Initiative (SMPI) checks for the threshold unbalance level in the tool assembly for the given machining requirements before the start of any run. This approach uses statistical tools and a supervised learning algorithm based on the Watchdog Agent (R) toolbox developed by the Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems. The proposed research finds high applicability in high-precision manufacturing operations involving high-volume production.

However, most of these methodologies often apply only to the narrow type of machines that they were developed for, and only support strategic level assessments as opposed to real-time tactical decisions. By enabling widespread integration of diagnostics and prognostics into Our manufacturing business processes, we have reduced spacio-temporal uncertainties associated with future states and system performance and therefore enabled more informed and effective decisions on manufacturing activities. For large-scale systems, the usual approach is to aggregate multidimensional data into a single-dimensional stream. These methods are generally adequate to extract key performance indicators. However, they only point to observable effects of a failure and not to their root causes. An integrated framework for DPHM requires the availability of bidirectional cause-effect relationships that enable system-wide health management rather than just predicting what its future state Would be. This paper summarizes best practices, benchmarks, and lessons learned from the design, development, deployment, and execution of DPHM systems into real-life applications in the automotive industry.

We view a machine as a,,machine communications channel," wherein components along the channel organize power and information flow. Errors from broken or degraded components disrupt this organization and the implicit information processing. Our model based diagnostics approach constructs detailed physics models of the machine having direct physical correspondence to components and faults, measures states off the real in-service machine, simulates states and sensor outputs of the machine under same service loads, compares simulated sensor outputs to real sensor outputs, and adjusts (tunes) the model's parameters until simulated outputs closely mimic real outputs. The tuned model now contains information on the real system's health condition. By comparing the numerical values of parameters to those of an ideal model-an exemplar of perfect health-faults are detected and located. To assess machine functional condition, Shannon's theorems of information theory are applied as a health metric to the machine communications channel. For prognosis of future health, plots of the model's parameter values extrapolated forward in time predicts future parameter values. Simulation of the machine channel model predicts "future" machine behavior, and future machine functional condition, using the aforementioned methods. This article applies these methods to a gearbox with tooth root cracking.

In contrast to previous applications, this paper examines whether acoustic signal can be used effectively along vibration signal to detect the various local fault, in local flault of gearboxes using the wavelet transform. Moreover, envelop analysis is well known as useful tool for the detection of rolling element bearing fault. In this paper, acoustic emission (AE) sensor is employed to detect gearbox damage by installing them around bearing housing at driven-end side. Signal processing is conducted by wavelet transform and enveloping to detect the fault all at once gearbox and bearing using AE signal. Result of fault detection is presented using some general statistical features and a proposed new feature (RGF: Ratio of Gear Frequency) for gear fault calculated from AE signal with different condition.

Comprehensively considered within-class scatter and between-class scatter of samples feature, the fitness function of kernel function parameter optimized is constructed, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm with adaptive accelerate (CPSO) is applied to optimize it. This method is applied to gear box condition recognition, compared with the recognized results based on principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that KPCA optimized by CPSO can effectively recognize fault conditions of gear box by reducing bind set-up of kernel function parameter, and its results of fault recognition outperform those of PCA. The conclusion is that KPCA based on PSO has advantage in nonlinear feature extraction of mechanical failure, and is helpful for fault conditional recognition of the complicated machine.

A low speed test rig was developed to simulate the various defects with shaft speeds as low as 10rpm under several loading conditions. The data was acquired using an AE sensor with the test bearing operating at a constant loading (5kN) and with a speed range from 20 to 80rpm. This study is aimed at finding a reliable method/tool for low speed machines fault diagnosis based on AE signal. In the present study, component analysis was performed to extract the bearing feature and to reduce the dimensionality of original data feature. The result shows that multi-class RVM offers a promising approach for fault diagnosis of low speed machines.

HMM allows modeling the time duration of the hidden states and therefore is capable of prognosis. The estimated state duration probability distributions can be used to predict the remaining useful life of the systems. The previous HMM based prognosis algorithm assumed that the transition probabilities are only state-dependent. That is, the probability of making transition to a less healthy state does not increase with the age. In the proposed method, in order to characterize a deteriorating machine, an aging factor that discounts the probabilities of staying at current state while increasing the probabilities of transitions to less healthy states will be introduced. After the estimation of the aging factor, a grey model is used to calculate the expected residual life (ERL) by redefining the hazard rate. With the equipment health prognosis, we can predict the behavior of the equipment condition.

Morphological pattern spectrum describes the shape characteristics of the inspected signal based on the morphological opening operation with multi-scale structuring elements. The pattern spectrum entropy and the barycenter scale location of the spectrum curve are extracted as the feature vector presenting different defects of the rolling bearings. The support vector machinery (SVM) algorithm is adopted to distinguish different kinds of defective bearing signals. The recognition results of the SVM are ideal and more precise than that of the artificial neural network.

In this paper, a four-step PHM approach for power supplies is presented: 1) precursor parameter identification based on historical data analysis and failure mechanism analysis; 2) baseline establishment by conducting experiments under different environmental and usage conditions and characterizing precursor parameters for healthy power supplies; 3) baseline verification by conducting similar experiments for fielded power supplies; and 4) testing. Precursor parameter identification for one switch-mode power supply (SNIPS) was carried out. The power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor, insulated-gate bipolar transistor, and the Schottky diode were identified as the majority cause by historical data analysis. Gate oxide leakage current, threshold voltage, transconductance, junction temperature, VCE (on), and contact resistance were determined to be monitored parameters for this SMPS after a failure mechanism analysis.

By integrating the key factors in threshold model, such as modeling error, random disturbance, input instructions, system current status and etc, an adaptive threshold scheme for fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper, which is based on a pattern recognition algorithm called support vector machine (SVM). It is very effective to adaptively adjust the fault threshold according to a variety of influencing factors.

A second is to able to produce signals from faults of different sizes and locations in order to test and compare diagnostic algorithms and to develop diagnostic and prognostic procedures and features. Finally, simulations can be very helpful in gaining a physical understanding of the complex (often nonlinear) interactions which sometimes arise in machines.

In this paper, the prediction of wear degree of impellers in slurry pumps is studied. An experimental system is set up to simulate the real working conditions of slurry pumps, from which condition monitoring data and corresponding degrees of impeller damage are collected. An architecture for online prognostics of wear degree is established and an data processing algorithm based on support vector classification is also developed to ensure effective prognostics.

The discrete observation of this 'would be' symptom vector creates so called symptom observation matrix (SOM). Using next the singular value decomposition (SVD) for the given SOM, one can extract the generalized fault symptoms, describing the fault evolution in a given case, and also diagnostic contribution of measured symptoms. Using the symptom reliability concepts further, and the grey system forecast methodology, it is possible to asses the generalized symptoms limit value. In this way one can establish the needed dimensionality of symptom observation matrix, and moreover assess the residual system life. However, doing this we have to establish new criteria for the dimensionality of SOM, based not on the number of symptoms in use, but the quality of diagnostic decision. This concept was verified in the paper using the data taken from real cases of vibration condition monitoring practice.

In recent years, with the development of fault diagnosis and computer technologies, the vibration measuring and analysis instruments are being developed quite rapidly because of their advantages such as highly integrated, multi-function, strong performance, and acceptable price. Due to a variety of uncontrolled or unexpected reasons, such as manufacturing error, installation fault, and operation mistake, the reliability of such instruments has become an important issue because it seriously affect their function and measuring results. In this paper, an integrated and multifunctional vibration signal measuring instrument is studied. The basic principles and structure of measuring instrument are presented. The possible failures are analyzed by using the method of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) according to the characteristics of the instrument's structure and function. The reliabilities of two different measuring circuit configurations are calculated, and analyzed comparatively with respect to cost. The result of this study will be useful during design and maintenance of such instruments.

Input and output of the algorithm are named as fault and hypothesis respectively. Because of the complexity and uncertainty of fault and symptom, it's difficult to accurately model the relationship of them in probabilistic fault localization. Fault localization algorithm depends on the prior specified model, and the parameter and structure of model is approximate correct and often differ from the real situation. So we propose DMCA+ algorithm which has 3 features: reduce the requirement for accuracy of initial conditions; statistically learn to automatically adapt the probability distribution of fault occurrence while localizing fault; generalize the MCA+ algorithm of no feedback. The feedback learning is similar with proportional adjusting of PID control, but increment is sensitive to detection rate because little increment adjusts output too slowly and big will result in a large number of error hypotheses. The simulation results show the validity and efficiency of dynamic learning under complex network In order to promote detection rate, optimizing measures are also discussed.

Support Vector Machine based on Statistical Learning Theory just overcomes this deficiency, and it provides a new approach for diagnosis technology to develop into intelligent diagnosis. The application of Support Vector Machine on fault diagnosis for reciprocating air compressor and a concrete implementation scheme are discussed in this paper. A fault diagnosis system for reciprocating air compressor is established, and the vibration signals of rolling bear in reciprocating air compressor's crankcase are simulated in a test-bed. The test result shows that this system has strong adaptability for reciprocating air compressor diagnosis of a few samples and could recognize fault rapidly and accurately.

C	Jauregui, JC; Gonzalez, O; Rubio, E			ASME	Jauregui, Juan C.; Gonzalez, Oscar; Rubio, Eduardo			THE APPLICATION OF TIME-FREQUENCY AND PHASE DIAGRAM ANALYSES FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF FAULTY ROLLER BEARING	PROCEEDINGS OF ASME TURBO EXPO 2009, VOL 5			English	Proceedings Paper	54th ASME Turbo Expo 2009	JUN 08-12, 2009	Orlando, FL	ASME, Int Gas Turbine Inst				There are many systems that monitor and analyze machinery conditions, but there is a lack on monitoring techniques that are able to identify early faults. This is critical since faulty roller bearings cause most of the problems in rotating machinery. Two major difficulties limit the early prediction of roller bearing failures: The acquisition of high frequency data, and the low energy levels emitted by surfaces cracks on rollers or tracks. Early fault detection requires adequate instrumentation and signal analysis. Therefore, it is important to identify its nonlinear response, and to be able to detect low energy signals in order to detect early faults. The vibration characteristics of the bearing depend on the rotational speed, clearance, radial load, rolling element stiffness, and the surface waviness. Additionally, they generate transient vibrations due to stiffness nonlinearities and structural defects. We present in this work a technique for the detection of early faults. The technique is based on the derivation of the rolling bearing nonlinear stiffness as a function of the roller translation and roller deformation. For the deformation, we determine the relative displacement of the roller tracks and we apply Hertz's contact stress function. With this formulation we identify the nonlinear response to the external excitation forces. Then, the results are analyzed with a time-frequency map and the phase diagram; the two analyses are compared in order to determine the best signal procedure to identify early failures.

Ayaka provides a general monitoring method for detecting anomalies using only resource usage information on systems independent of its domain, target application, and programming languages. Ayaka modifies the kernel to detect faults and uses a completely application black-box approach based on machine learning methods. It uses the clustering method to quantize the resource usage vector data and learn the normal patterns with a hidden Markov Model. In the running phase, Ayaka finds anomalies by comparing the application resource usage with the learned model. The evaluation experiment indicates that our prototype system is able to detect anomalies, such as SQL injection and buffer overrun, without significant overheads.

Using CNC or DNC machine-tools, robots and other automatic equipment, interfaces and computer assistance is a possible solution but prohibitive and not 100% proof, because shutdowns, turnarounds, and outages. The integration of data acquisition systems with machine-tool endowed with various process sensors can ensure a good monitoring of machining process function and fault diagnose or even some down-time avoidance, but for a real-time control and machine running continuously and accurate, is not enough. The total productive maintenance is the desirable solution, but is only a concept. To become a real solution, detailed analyses of entire machining process, hardware and software integration, maintenance planning and scheduling based on predictive methodologies and a new approach of the system architecture are needed. A vision in this field is offered in this paper.

The multi-class classification problem is solved by decision tree combined strategy. And multiple kernel teaming support vector machines are able to translate linearly constrained quadratic programming into quadratic ally constrained quadratic programming by mixed kernel space. Simulation results indicate that the diagnosis precision by multiple kernel teaming support vector machines is better than the standard support vector machines with less number of support vectors. Moreover, the introduction of decision tree combined strategy guarantees the diagnosis speed improvement. The proposed method can solve the radar fault diagnosis problem accurately and rapidly.

Based on the fine refinement function of harmonic wavelet, the characteristic frequency components and other components were decomposed to independent frequency bands, without any overlapping or leaking. Then the characteristic frequency component would be extracted by the recomposed of data.

The combinations of such components are best considered as cyclostationary. This paper discusses which second order cyclostationary statistics should be used for fault diagnosis of bearing. The second order cyclostationary statistical methods are firstly introduced and then applied to fault detection of bearing. This approach is capable of completely extracting the characteristic fault frequencies related to the defect. Experiment results show that the second order cyclostationary statistics is powerful and effective in feature extracting and fault detecting for rolling element bearings.

A new approach to fault diagnosis of bearing under running up based on angle domain average and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) phase map is presented. The non-stationary vibration signals are transformed from the time domain transient signal to angle domain stationary one using order tracking. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can adaptively decompose the vibration signal into a series of zero mean Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Hilbert transform can track the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the intrinsic mode functions at any instant. The experimental results show that average domain average and Hilbert-Huang transform phase map can effectively diagnosis the faults of the gear crack.

This approach employs maximum projective decomposition algorithm combined fractional Fourier transform with quasi-Newton method to estimate the parameters. Then, the expectation maximization algorithm is used to refine the results. Compared with traditional time-frequency analysis methods, such as short-time Fourier spectrum and Wigner distribution, the simulation results show that this method can obtain more accurate estimation, finer time-frequency resolution and de-noising capability. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of bearing, and the results of the experiment demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient in signal feature extraction.

It can classify the faults in the target circuit effectively and accurately. In order to test the algorithm, an analog circuit fault diagnosis system based on SVM is designed for the measurement circuit that approximates the square curve with a broken line.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) has been well recognized as a powerful computational tool for nonlinear problems which have high dimensionalities. Whereas the parameters in SVM are usually selected by man's experience, it has hampered the efficiency of SVM in practical application. Immunity Clonal Selection Algorithm (ICSA) is a new intelligent algorithm which can carry out the global search and the local search in many directions rather than one direction around the same individual simultaneously, and can effectively overcome the prematurity and slow convergence speed of traditional evolution algorithm. To improve the capability of the SVM classifier, we apply the immunity clonal selection algorithm to optimize the parameter of SVM in this paper. The experimental result shows that the fault diagnostics based on SVM optimized by ICSA can give higher recognition accuracy than the general SVM.

In many cases, the accuracy of the instruments and devices used to monitor and control the system is highly dependent on the dynamic performance of the roll bearings. In this paper, A novel method of pattern recognition and fault diagnosis in roll bearing based on the wavelet-neural network is proposed according to the frequency spectrum characteristics of vibration signal. This paper presents an approach for roll bearing fault diagnosis using neural networks and time/frequency-domain bearing vibration analysis. Vibration simulation is used to assist in the design of various roll bearing fault diagnosis. The simulation testing results obtained indicate that neural networks can be effective agents in the diagnosis of various bearing faults through the measurement and interpretation of bearing vibration signal.

Therefore the shaft orbits recognition plays all important role in the fault diagnosis of steam turbine generator set. An automatic identification method of shaft orbit for steam turbine generator sets is proposed in this paper. The median morphological filter combining the open-closing with clos-opening is used to eliminate the noise in the original X and Y vibration signals. Then the seven invariant moment feature are extracted from the shaft orbit reconstructed. Input the seven invariant moments to the trained BP neural network, the shaft orbit can be identified automatically. A case is verified this model. It is shown that this model is feasible and high precision for identify the shaft orbit in fault diagnosis.

We show that the price to pay for this generalization is that only three diagnosis states can be defined, rather than four. However, this is not a significant restriction because it is in accordance with all the literature on finite state automata.

Smart Discrete Sensor Array for Fault Diagnostics of Rotating Machinery	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING/8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ELECTROMAGNETICS, WIRELESS AND OPTICAL COMMUNICATIONS	Electrical and Computer Engineering Series		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Applications of Electrical Engineering/8th International Conference on Applied Electromagnetics, Wireless and Optical Communications	APR 30-MAY 02, 2009	Univ Houston, Houston, TX		Univ Houston	Rotating Machines; Parity Space Model; Self Diagnosis Sensor; Modeling; Smart Sensor; Actuators; Fault Diagnostics; Single Throw Mechanical Equipment (STME); Parameter Estimation; Eigen Values of Faults; Residual generation; Parity-Space; Low-cost limit sensors; Adaptive thresholds		This research builds on the research on single throw mechanical equipment [Lehrasab, 1999] and further extends it to the domain of rotating machines. It aims at developing novel fault diagnostics techniques for the motor or rotating machines for diagnostics. Conventional schemes usually deploy the spectral analysis that requires expensive sensors and powerful data processing engines. This scheme employs the conventional encoder and with a very limited floating point implementations. The complete model based residual generator can be implemented that can relate the rotational jitters and mechanical faults and with further analysis it can be linked with a set of transformations from spectral domain to the jitter domain. The paper presents a novel model based residual generator for shaft Encoder of a motor based on its jitter model. The mechanical errors of the system are translated into variations in the angular velocity. The residual generator presented in this paper is sensitive to the resolution of jitters of 4us to cross 3s thresholds. In this case the polarities of faults are important as the overall RPM of the motor is reasonably stable. Each of 'n' sectors of the shaft encoder is averaged to find the sector jitter that then used to generate the residuals by the set of equations using rms current measurement as input. Each equation is considered to be partially decoupled and partially independent because it can be reasonably assumed that under a fault condition the sector jitter can uniquely be affected by the system. The energy distribution of Residual Spectra generated by such Model Based Parity Space relationship results in drifts in the form of Eigen value. The Eigen vector in such a multi-dimensional Residual Space is used to maintain the degree and polarity of drift. This paper presents investigations into the issues related to such Eigen analysis. It was found that normalized residuals from multiple sources and parity space relations are neutralized in the form of unified representation of energy that can be used to form a generic framework for fault detection and isolation. It is being investigated. how the proper modeling of quantitative entities as energy. could lead to unified and neutral residual space while keeping the implementation cost reasonably low. Higher degree of freedom allows robust model based self diagnostics to cater for sensor, actuators and system failures isolation model based self diagnostics. An attempt to convert the residual generator and fault detection to embedded systems has also been attempted using FPGA. The system design. implementation in VHDL is also discussed.

Analyses show that when a run-to-failure philosophy is adopted in rotating machinery maintenance, their downtime is usually three to four times longer comparing to a periodic or proactive maintenance approach. A successful proactive maintenance program requires an integration of several diagnostic procedures, into an intelligent data processing system. Such a system allows detection of a broad range of faults in an early stage. The main aim of this paper is to present current results of our development of an intelligent rotating machinery diagnostics program for detecting a broad range of faults from signals which can be measured non-destructively and on-line. The main motivation is to develop computationally efficient algorithm that can be implemented on a standard (low-cost) platform. In that respect we have developed a test rotating machine equipped with accelerometers, temperature sensors and sensors fir lubricating oil characterization. In this paper we focus on gear-box faults and aft-attire extraction procedure based on non-parametric statistical concepts as suggested and demonstrated on experimental data.

This is particularly true for the diagnostic monitoring of rotary machinery, because faults in this type of equipment appear frequently and quickly cause severe problems. Such diagnostic methods are often based on the analysis of vibration signals because they are directly related to physical faults. Even though the magnitude of vibration signals depends on the measurement position, the effect of measurement position is generally not considered. This paper describes an investigation of the effect of the measurement position on the fault features in vibration signals. The signals for normal and broken bevel gears were measured at the base, gearbox, and bevel gear, simultaneously, of a machine fault simulator (MFS). These vibration signals were compared to each other and used to estimate the classification efficiency of a diagnostic method using wavelet packet transform. From this experiment, the fault features are more prominently in the vibration signal from the measurement position of the bevel gear than from the base and gearbox. The results of this analysis will assist in selecting the appropriate measurement position in real industrial applications and precision diagnostics.

APPLICATION OF TIME SYNCHRONOUS AVERAGING, SPECTRAL KURTOSIS AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES FOR BEARING FAULT IDENTIFICATION	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING CONFERENCE, VOL 7: OPERATIONS, APPLICATIONS AND COMPONENTS			English	Proceedings Paper	Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference of the American-Society-of-Mechanical-Engineers	JUL 27-31, 2008	Chicago, IL	ASME, Pressure Vessels & Piping Div			VIBRATION	Condition monitoring of rolling elements bearings is investigated in this paper Recently [12, 13], we have developed a diagnosis procedure that combines a signal processing tool, i.e. Time Synchronous Averaging (TSA), and a pattern recognition method, i.e. Support Vector Machines (SVM), for bearing fault detection and prediction. As the generalization performance of the SVM-boundaries was strongly affected by the signal transmission path, this paper is then concerned with the integration of Spectral Kurtosis (SK) analysis in the diagnosis procedure to improve efficiency in such cases. We validate the use of both Time Synchronous Averaging and Spectral Kurtosis analysis, as signal processing tools that will automatically highlight bearing defect frequencies in the envelope spectrum. Twenty-one features (rms, peak, crest factor, band spectral energy, etc...) are extracted from the envelope of signals obtained from these two analyses and are used in the learning scheme. Results show that the generalization performance is less affected by the signal transmission path and the faulty bearing location, thus demonstrating that the modified diagnosis procedure can actually find some underlying patterns that are common to each type of bearing failure. The case-dependency of the support decision tool can therefore be reduced.

A quick search strategy for model-based diagnosis is proposed in this paper to identify both locations and amounts of multiple unbalances by using the unbalance responses at the bearing locations under one specified rotating speed. Effects of measurement noise are analyzed and robustness of the proposed method is validated by means of numerical results. The reason for quick searching is non-repeatedly counting the found faults, and the computational time is saved. This method is suitable for on-line monitoring the gradual changes of unbalance on rotating machines; especially those required fixedly operating speeds.

The amount of equipment degradation and the gain that can be achieved in plant heat rate and power generation by the replacement or repairing of each component is important information for proper plant maintenance management. This paper aims to show how diagnosis and prognosis of a power plant can be performed based on thermodynamic data measured by plant instrumentation on site. Some important points such as how to increase the accuracy of the prognostic by developing the complete Taylor series and how it affects the thermodynamic state are also explained. Practical considerations for implementing a thermodynamic diagnosis/prognosis system in a real plant arc also discussed. The system receives thermodynamic data from the plant information system (PI) and after a filtering step, the performance factors (PFs) of each component are calculated based on the component's performance curves. Thus, the current state can be modeled using these PFs. By replacing the calculated performance factors, component by component, with factors that represents no degradation, future cycle performance can be estimated. This work is a partial result of an ongoing research program that implements a thermodynamic diagnosis/prognosis system on a 130 MW combined cycle co-generation power plant.

Upgrading current military aeroengine overhaul metrics based strictly on engine flight hours and total accumulated cycles with higher fidelity prognostic models will provide an opportunity to prevent failures caused by accelerated degradation due to operation in unusually harsh conditions, and will help avoid unnecessary maintenance caused by routine check on engines that operate under nominal operating conditions. Grade-life (GL) is used to describe the bearing's service life, and a comprehensive engine bearing prognostic model comprised of a physics based mathematical model and a prognostic element is presented in this paper. The mathematical model utilizes information from the Sensed Data module to calculate the cumulative damage sustained by the bearing since it was first installed and the Prediction Grade-life (PGL) is captured. The prognostic estimate model is an empirical lifetime model, in which Empirical Grade-life (EGL) is assessed based on vibration signals intelligently. The final Grade-life of bearings is determined by fusion of analytic Grade-life (PGL) and Grade-life assessment value (EGL) based on Fuzzy Logic Inference, which reduces the uncertainty's affection towards prediction results of the analytic model. Finally, bearing test stand run-to-failure data is used to verify the approach.

Therewith several damages shall be replicated and investigated. In a first approach an unbalanced rotor system and an increasing clearance in a journal bearing are analysed. Therefore extensive experiments with the rotor test rig have been conducted. The implemented test system is modelled with a simulation environment called MBSim (http://mbsim.berlios.de). This simulation environment, developed at the Institute of Applied Mechanics, is based on a framework for the efficient simulation of multi-body-systems with unilateral contacts and elastic elements. Therewith typical defects in rotating machinery can be replicated and critical effects can be investigated. The simulation includes a spatial bending-torsional beam and unilateral contacts with friction and impacts. So it's possible for instance to model unilateral contacts in journal hearings with clearance between shaft and bearing. Experiment and simulation are consistent with each other in a very wide range, so the basis for the higher aim of a model-based fault detection and identification is provided.

With the passage of time the machine may develop faults and may hamper the production line that may lead to production and financial losses. A proper planning of maintenance schedule and condition monitoring is essential to reduce such financial loss and shut down time. A condition monitoring system, which can predict and identify the prefault condition, is the need of the age to prevent such unwanted breakdown time. The MCSA (Motor Current Signature Analysis) technique is found one of the most frequently used technique to identify the prefault condition. This paper focuses on experimental results to prove that MCSA Technique can identify the good and cracked rotor bar in three phase squirrel cage induction motors under no-load and different load conditions. The diagnostics strategy is presented in this paper and variables that influence the diagnosis are discussed.	[Saravanakumar, R.; Ray, K.

The Selective Trigger Scan Architecture (STSA) reduces the switching activity and increases the scanning operation. This paper presents a test vector generator for external test. The design for testability technique consequences are reduced because no need of additional multiplexer is utilized in the scan path. Data reformatting is adopted in order to make the STSA ready to Golomb-like algorithm. This algorithm is employed for further reduction of switching activity. The Finite State Machine (FSM) decoder output is applied to the Circuit Under Test (CUT). The experimental results for S27 benchmark circuit demonstrate that the STSA can significantly improve the power consumption. Delay fault and stuck-at faults can be covered in this approach.

But, for the colored noise mixed in vibration signals, ordinary FFT or autoregressive (AR) spectrum analysis methods can't provide sufficient and reasonable spectra estimates. In this paper, we exploited Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE) technique to separate the colored noise from vibration signals in the time domain. The capability of the technique was evaluated using Simulink for some simulated vibration signals composed of three sinusoids and an additive colored noise. The results show that the technique is capable of separating accurately colored noise even at a lower level of colored noise, and tracking the level variation of colored noise in simulated signals. Further experimental tests for actual complex vibration signals will be conducted to validate the technique.

FEM analysis is used for magnetic field calculation and the magnetic flux density and vector potential of machine is obtained for healthy and faulty cases. Comparing the magnetic flux distribution of healthy and faulty machines helps to detect the influence of turn fault. The machine parameters (self and mutual inductances) are obtained for IM with inter-turn fault. Finally, the FEM machine model is used for studying the machine under different fault condition. Study results including phases and fault currents express the behavior of machine with inter-turn faults. The symmetrical current components of IM with different fault severity are obtained by FE study and studied. The machine torque in healthy and faulty condition is also obtained and compared. The torque vibration increase upon to degree of fault.

The paper investigates the interesting class of probabilistic neural networks (PNN). In comparison with the most popular perceptron, PNN uses a different type of basis function and have the ability to increase amount of knowledge stored in the network. Basic architecture and features of PNNs are presented. The paper presents the case study, where PNN was applied to diagnose several faults (unbalance and misalignment in various degrees) in the electric motor. The performance of the network was better than the multi layer perceptron. Important part of the paper is proposal of the feature set consisting of harmonics from vibration spectrum.

An advance mathematical model of cage motors considering arbitrary cage faults is used. A case study of two broken bars at various relative positions shows that it is impossible to indicate even a simple cage fault. Asymmetry factors, which allow to compare various cage faults, are defined and they have relations to a level of the (1-2s)f(o) component in stator currents, the most important diagnostic signal of cage asymmetry. A reduced mathematical model with those asymmetry factors is presented, which is adequate for basic phenomena caused by cage asymmetry at small slips. Influence of MMF harmonics, speed variation and magnetic non-linearity on diagnostic signals is also discussed.

The change in the severity focus on non stationary or transient signals, and it is accomplished with the development of localized spectral analysis based on time of manifestation. In addition, methodologies based on probabilistic concepts allow the study of the signal added with disturbances by parametric models that establish the state of functioning and later are used as linear filters to process the future state, using the residual signal between the filtered modeled signal and the future signal in its original state. The spectral analysis by parametric modeling techniques is an alternative class of frequency estimation method. The analysis we propose enables the mechanical engineering professional to know about mathematical tools that should be known for an accurate diagnosis, not only in the measurement but also in the vibration analysis, so as to interpret and anticipate operational problems of industrial systems and thus prevent or predict future failures in response to demands for quality, to operate with reliability, to asses the integrity of machines and structures and to plan a predictive maintenance program. For an accurate diagnosis, to predict with reasonable certainty the physical life of a equipment, it is vitally important the analysis of patterns of behavior. By symbolic computation systems we will present a dynamic modeling of such patterns, with the purpose of analyzing in a comprehensive way the spectrum and waveform vibration allowing bearing defects in low-speed machines. Also discuss, in the academic sense of the proposal, the various techniques in signal processing used in fault diagnosis for the type and severity of the fault upon detection.

It is shown that erosion of soils is the most widespread soil degradation process taking place in one fourth of the territory of Ukraine, and this area continues to increase. In accordance with the modem tendencies of climate change, the intensity of soil erosion processes in the near future in Ukraine will grow. In this connection, the problem of estimation and prognosis of the rates of erosive destruction of soils and increasing of eroded areas takes on special significance. It is shown that for the examination of natural-economic terms of Ukraine the spatial-distributed mathematical model of erosion-deposition, developed in Odessa National I.I. Mechnikov University, is the most adequate tool. It is also shown that the progressive increase of area of eroded soils necessitates quantitative evaluation of their influence on climate formation process.

B	Bosnic, Z; Kononenko, I		Hayworth, GI		Bosnic, Zoran; Kononenko, Igor			RELIABILITY ESTIMATION OF INDIVIDUAL PREDICTIONS IN SUPERVISED LEARNING	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING ADVANCES			English	Article; Book Chapter							SELECTION	In machine learning, estimation of predictive accuracy for a given model is most commonly approached by analyzing the average accuracy of the model. In general, the predictive models do not provide reliability estimates for their individual predictions. The reliability estimates of individual predictions require the analysis of specific model and instance properties. Measuring the prediction reliability is very important in risk-sensitive areas where acting upon predictions may have significant consequences (e.g. medical diagnosis, stock market, navigation, control applications). In such areas, appropriate reliability estimates may provide additional information about the prediction correctness and can enable the user (e.g. medical doctor) to differentiate between more and less reliable predictions. This chapter summarizes research areas, which provide the motivating ideas for the development of the approaches for individual prediction reliability. Based on these motivations, we describe five approaches to reliability estimation (i.e., local sensitivity analysis, bagging variance, local cross-validation, density estimation, local error modeling) and define the corresponding reliability estimates. The empirical evaluation of eight estimates using 28 testing domains and 8 regression models indicated the promising results, especially for the usage with regression trees. The testing results also reveal that the reliability estimates exhibit different performance with different regression models and domains. To deal with this issue, we describe two approaches for automatic selection of the most appropriate estimate for a given domain and regression model: (i) the meta-learning approach and (ii) the internal cross-validation approach. The empirical results of both approaches show the advantage of the dynamically selected reliability estimate for a given domain/model pair, when compared to individual reliability estimates in terms of higher positive correlation to the prediction error. The described methodology was applied to a medical prognostic domain, which provided the medical experts with a significant improvement of the prognostic system.

For this reason, machine condition monitoring is being pursued to recognise incipient faults. In this paper, the fault diagnostic problem is tackled within a neuro-fuzzy approach to pattern classification. Besides the primary purpose of a high rate of correct classification, the proposed neuro-fuzzy approach also aims at obtaining an easily interpretable classification model. The efficiency of the approach is verified with respect to a literature problem and then applied to a case of motor bearing fault classification. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it call be difficult to define and implement an adequate and efficient prognostic tool that includes the inherent uncertainty of the prognostic process. Within this frame, neuro-fuzzy systems are well suited for practical problems where it is easier to gather data (online) than to formalize the behavior of the system being studied. In this context, and according to real implementation restrictions, the paper deals with the definition of an evolutionary fuzzy prognostic system for which any assumption on its structure is necessary. The proposed approach outperform classical models and is well fitted to perform a priori reliability analysis and thereby optimize maintenance policies. An illustration of its performances is given by making a comparative study with an other neuro-fuzzy system that emerges from literature.

In order to achieve these targets, the recent maintenance approach is based oil a mix of different policies Such as corrective, planned, and curative. The significance of the predictive activities is becoming more and more important for the new challenges concerning machines and plants health management. In the present paper we describe our experience about the development of a rule-based expert system for the electric locomotive E402B used in the Italian railways system, in order to carry Out an automated prognostic process. The goal of the project was to develop an approach able to improve the maintenance performance. In particular we would like to develop an advanced prognostic tool able to deliver the work orders. This specific issue has been identified and requested from the maintenance operators as the best and the only solution that could ensure some results.

Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) was used. The strategy rests on the follow-up (in amplitude and frequency) of the harmonics representing the defects of the broken bars, preparing and thus generating the adequate inputs for the treatment where the decision is made by fuzzy logic. The results obtained are good and it is capable to detect the correct number of broken bar.	[Zouzou, S.

Embedded Systems Resources, especially critical resources, should be managed, because the over-degradation of them could rise to performance deterioration and even collapse for the whole system. To users, they need a good interface for proper interaction. If there are any functional demotion caused by the degradation of system resources, Interface elements need to be adapted suitably and be harmonious with current status of system performance. This study focused on how embedded device HCI self-adapts while system resources degenerate to make related functions degrading. Researching the problem is one aspect of research of prognostics and health management(PHM) and will promote it.

It has been shown that an adaptive distinguishing sequence is sufficient for these methods. This result is significant because adaptive distinguishing sequences are strictly more common and up to exponentially shorter than preset ones. However, there has been no study on the actual effect of using adaptive distinguishing sequences on the length of checking sequences. This paper describes experiments that show that checking sequences constructed using adaptive distinguishing sequences are almost consistently shorter than those based on preset distinguishing sequences. This is investigated for three different checking sequence generation methods and the results obtained from an extensive experimental study are given.

The EMD method is used to decompose the vibration signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by which the initial feature vector matrices could be formed automatically. By applying the SVD technique to the initial feature vector matrices, the singular values of matrices could be obtained, which could be used as the fault feature vectors of support vector machines (SVMs) classifier. The analysis results from the gear and roller bearing vibration signals show that the fault diagnosis method based on EMD, SVD and SVM can extract fault features effectively and classify working conditions and fault patterns of gears and roller bearings accurately even when the number of samples is small.

CRACK DETECTION IN SHAFTS OF ROTATING MACHINERY USING ACTIVE SENSING WITH AN EXTERNAL EXCITATION ON A BEARING	SMASIS 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS, ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS - 2008, VOL 2	Proceedings of the ASME Conference on Smart Materials Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems	OCT 28-30, 2008	Ellicott City, MD	ASME, Nanotechnol Inst		Acting sensing; crack detection; finite elements; Jeffcott rotor; mode shapes; natural frequencies; rotating shaft	ROTOR; BEAMS; IDENTIFICATION; LOCATION	Because several power plants have undergone burst shafts with catastrophic consequences, methods for detecting cracks in the shafts of rotating machinery are of great interest to the research community. Cracked shafts represent a very small percentage of the vibration issues in machinery (less than 2%) compared with other faults such as misalignment and mass imbalance, which are responsible for 85% of these issues. However, if a cracked shaft is not detected early enough, it can jeopardize the safety of operators and result in high costs for replacement. A method sensitive enough to detect cracks in the shafts of rotating machinery is investigated in this paper. It is shown that changes in the natural frequencies and/or mode shapes are not sensitive enough indicators to detect transverse cracks at the mid-span of shafts in rotating machinery. An exhaustive numerical analysis using a finite element model of a simple machine is conducted to consider many different measurements of the machinery vibratory responses that most clearly detect cracking. It is shown that external excitations applied on a bearing enhance the sensitivity of vibration measurements to cracking. Experimental tests are also used to validate several of the numerical simulation findings.

To develop a monolithic navigational system is probably an impossible task; instead a hierarchical decomposition is presented, which breaks down the safe recovery and landing of distressed aircraft into sub-problems that maximize the probability that the overall objective is achieved. Navigational performance is often hinder by in-flight damage or failures, which often results in mission failure and an inability to guide the aircraft to a safe landing. Uncertainty is a very important concern in recovery of damaged aircraft since it can cause infeasibilities, false diagnosis and prognosis causing further performance degradation and mission failure. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematic model. The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties in the damage assessment process and post-failure trajectory planning are presented and classified. The decision-making process for an emergency motion planning and landing is developed via the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The objective of the trajectory planning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft given uncertain conditions. Simulations are presented for an emergency motion planning and landing that takes into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision.

However, these components are orders of magnitude more expensive than typical desktop components, and they lag years behind in terms of speed and size. We have integrated algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) methods into onboard data analysis algorithms to detect radiation-induced errors, which ultimately may permit the use of spacecraft memory that need not be fully hardened, reducing cost and increasing capability at the same time. We have also developed a lightweight software radiation simulator, BITFLIPS, that permits evaluation of error detection strategies in a controlled fashion, including the specification of the radiation rate and selective exposure of individual data structures. Using BITFLIPS, we evaluated our error detection methods when using a support vector machine to analyze data collected by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. We observed good performance from both an existing ABFT method for matrix multiplication and a novel ABFT method for exponentiation. These techniques bring us a step closer to "rad-hard" machine learning algorithms.

These approaches include inductive versus transductive reasoning, global, local, and personalized modeling and their potentials are illustrated on a case study of gene expression and clinical data related to cancer outcome prognosis. While inductive modeling is used to develop a model (function) from data on the whole problem space and then to recall it oil new data, transductive modeling is concerned with the creation of single model for every new input vector based on some closest vectors from the existing problem space. The paper uses several techniques to illustrate these approaches - multiple linear regression, Bayesian inference, support vector machines, evolving connectionist systems (ECOS), weighted kNN - each of them providing different accuracy on specific problem and facilitating the discovery of different patterns and rules from data.

J	Teramoto, R				Teramoto, Reiji			Balanced Gradient Boosting from Imbalanced Data for Clinical Outcome Prediction	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						clinical outcome; diagnosis; cancer; diabetes; renal cell carcinoma; ensemble learning; boosting; cost-sensitive learning; imbalanced data	TUMOR CLASSIFICATION; GENE	In clinical outcome prediction, such as disease diagnosis and prognosis, it is often assumed that the class, e.g., disease and control, is equally distributed. However, in practice we often encounter biological or clinical data whose class distribution is highly skewed. Since standard supervised learning algorithms intend to maximize the overall prediction accuracy, a prediction model tends to show a strong bias toward the majority class when it is trained on such imbalanced data. Therefore, the class distribution should be incorporated appropriately to learn from imbalanced data. To address this practically important problem, we proposed balanced gradient boosting (BalaBoost) which reformulates gradient boosting to avoid the overfitting to the majority class and is sensitive to the minority class by making use of the equal class distribution instead of the empirical class distribution. We applied BalaBoost to cancer tissue diagnosis based on miRNA expression data, premature death prediction for diabetes patients based on biochemical and clinical variables and tumor grade prediction of renal cell carcinoma based on tumor marker expressions whose class distribution is highly skewed. Experimental results showed that BalaBoost outperformed the representative supervised learning algorithms, i.e., gradient boosting, Random Forests and Support Vector Machine.

The fault diagnosis on HVAC system is a difficult problem due to the complex structure of the HVAC and the presence of multi-excite sources. As the HVAC system fault information has inaccurate and uncertainty characteristic, A new kind of fault diagnosis system based on Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented in this paper. The hybrid model is integrated the advantages of RST effectively dealing with the uncertainty information and SVM's greater generalization performance. The HVAC diagnosis experiment demonstrated that the solution can reduce the cost and raise the efficiency of diagnosis, and verified the feasibility of engineering application. As a result, the presented hybrid fault diagnosis method can help to maintain the health of the HVAC systems, reduce energy consumption and maintenance cost.

A genetic algorithm is a stochastic computational model that seeks the optimal solution to an objective function. A methodology calculation is based on the idea of measuring the increase of fitness and fitness quality evaluation with chaos theory principles applying within genetic algorithm environment. Fuzzy neural networks principles are effectively applied in solved manufacturing problems mostly where multisensor integration, real - timeness, robustness and learning abilities are needed.

Materials performance in CANDU reactors: The first 30 years and the prognosis for life extension and new designs	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on the Advances in Nuclear Materials	DEC 12-14, 2006	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr, Bombay, INDIA	Board Res Nucl Sci, Dept Atom Energy	Bhabha Atom Res Ctr			A number of CANDU reactors have now been in-service for more than 30 years, and several are planning life extensions. This paper summarizes the major corrosion degradation operating experience of various out-of-core (i.e., excluding fuel channels and fuel) materials in-service in currently operating CANDU reactors. Also discussed are the decisions that need to be made for life extension of replaceable and non-replaceable components such as feeders and steam generators, and materials choices for new designs, such as the advanced CANDU reactor (ACR) and enhanced CANDU-6. The basis for these choices, including a brief summary of the R&D necessary to support such decisions is provided. Finally we briefly discuss the materials and R&D needs beyond the immediate future, including new concepts to improve plant operability and component reliability.

J	Haist, B				Haist, Bernhard			Setting up and managing a remote maintenance operation for fusion	FUSION ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Fusion Nuclear Technology	SEP 30-OCT 05, 2007	Heidelberg, GERMANY	Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe		Remote handling; Hot Cell; Virtual reality		Trying to set up and manage a remote maintenance operation for a thermonuclear fusion reactor is a complex undertaking. There are man problems and challenges which need addressing. This paper tries to guide the reader through this process by composing a list of generic problems and by analysing possible solutions. The first challenge before setting up a remote maintenance operation for a fusion reactor is the systematic analysis of all the remote handling requirements. Based upon this the remote handling concept. including facility layout and equipment, can be defined. The following aspects have to be considered and incorporated into the remote handling concept: Remote handling task development. Remote handling task logistics and resource management. Command, control and human-machine interface system. Viewing and camera systems. Virtual reality and Augmented Reality software. Automatic path planning and collision avoidance. Remote transfer of heavy loads. Maintainability of RH equipment. Reliability, redundant systems and safety. Rationalisation and modularity in both hardware and software. Recovery from failure modes. Condition monitoring and fault detection/prediction. Ability to deal with unforeseen problems. Oxford Technologies Ltd. has a proven track record in setting up and running the Remote Handling group at the JET Joint Undertaking in Culham, UK. Based on the unique experience gained at JET, Oxford Technologies Ltd. also developed the current design and remote handling concept of the ITER Hot Cell during a study in 2004. Examples of both the JET remote handling experience and the ITER Hot Cell design and layout are given throughout this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Reconfigurable Motor for Experimental Emulation of Stator Winding Interturn and Broken Bar Faults in Polyphase Induction Machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						Condition monitoring; fault diagnostics; fault emulation; induction motors; reconfigurable motors; rotor broken bar faults; stator winding interturn faults	ROTOR; DIAGNOSIS; ORIENTATION	The benefits and drawbacks of a 5-hp reconfigurable induction motor, which was designed for experimental emulation of stator winding interturn and broken rotor bar faults, are presented in this paper. It was perceived that this motor had the potential of quick and easy reconfiguration to produce the desired stator and rotor faults in a variety of different fault combinations. Hence, this motor was anticipated to make a useful test bed for evaluation of the efficacy of existing and new motor fault diagnostics techniques and not the study of insulation failure mechanisms. Accordingly, it was anticipated that this reconfigurable motor would eliminate the need to permanently destroy machine components such as stator windings or rotor bars when acquiring data from a faulty machine for fault diagnostic purposes. Experimental results under healthy and various faulty conditions are presented in this paper, including issues associated with rotor bar-end ring contact resistances that showed the drawbacks of this motor in so far as emulation of rotor bar breakages. However, emulation of stator-turn fault scenarios was successfully accomplished.	[Yeh, Chia-Chou; Sizov, Gennadi Y.; Sayed-Ahmed, Ahmed; Demerdash, Nabeel A.

A Survey on Testing and Monitoring Methods for Stator Insulation Systems of Low-Voltage Induction Machines Focusing on Turn Insulation Problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Review						Induction motors; interturn shorts; motor diagnostics; stator faults; winding insulation	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WINDING INSULATION; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; SHORT CIRCUITS; MOTOR; AC; DRIVES	A breakdown of the electrical insulation system causes catastrophic failure of the electrical machine and brings large process downtime losses. To determine the conditions of the stator insulation system of motor drive systems, various testing and monitoring methods have been developed. This paper presents an in-depth literature review of testing and monitoring methods, categorizing them into online and offline methods, each of which is further grouped into specific areas according to their physical nature. The main focus of this paper is on testing and monitoring techniques that diagnose the condition of the turn-to-turn insulation of low-voltage machines, which is a rapidly expanding area for both research and product development efforts. In order to give a compact overview, the results are summarized in two tables. In addition to monitoring methods on turn-to-turn insulation, some of the most common methods to assess the stator's phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase insulation conditions are included in the tables as well.

J	Bruzzese, C				Bruzzese, Claudio			Analysis and Application of Particular Current Signatures (Symptoms) for Cage Monitoring in Nonsinusoidally Fed Motors With High Rejection to Drive Load, Inertia, and Frequency Variations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Broken bars; fault indicators; induction motor; sideband calculation; spectral analysis; symmetrical components	INDUCTION-MOTOR; ROTOR FAULTS; BROKEN BARS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; MAINTENANCE; POWER; HARMONICS; FAILURES; SYSTEM	In this paper, some original and effective fault indicators for broken-bar detection in power squirrel-cage induction motors are presented. A motor phase-current signature analysis can be performed by evaluating the typical ratios I(7-2s)f/I-5f and I(5+2s)f/I-7f, I(13-2s)f/I-11f and I(11+2s)f/I-13f, etc., which appear in the phase-current spectrum of faulted motors fed by nonsinusoidal voltage sources. The main advantages of the new indicators are the following: 1) accentuate insensitivity to disturbs such as load torque, drive inertia, and frequency variations; 2) low dependence with respect to machine parameters (except the pole number); and 3) linear dependence on fault gravity. They can-be directly applied on motors fed by open-loop low-switching frequency gate turn-off/thyristor converters. Railway traction drives are possible targets. Application to mains-fed motors can be tried too, if suitable harmonics are present in the plant supply. A detailed analytical formulation for fault indicators is furnished, based on the multiphase symmetrical component theory; theoretical results have been supported by experimental work, performed by using a motor with an appositely prepared cage, and successively, method validation was achieved on three other industrial motors.

As regards rotor faults, the diagnostic procedure based on sideband current components may fail due to the presence of interbar currents that reduce the degree of rotor asymmetry and, thus, the amplitude of these spectral components. On the other hand, the interbar currents produce core vibrations in the axial direction; these vibrations can be detected using a suitable vibration sensor. In this paper, a differential fault analysis based on traditional motor current signature analysis (MCSA) and on radial and axial vibration monitoring is proposed to discern cases in which the presence of interbar currents decreases the sensitivity of MCSA. The features of stator currents and of radial and axial core vibration signals are investigated in order to increase the reliability of the diagnostic system. Moreover, to explore the possibility of obtaining further information, stray flux signals are taken into account.

A General Approach for the Transient Detection of Slip-Dependent Fault Components Based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; induction motors; transient analysis; wavelet transforms	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; INDUCTION-MOTOR; SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; FAILURES; IMPLEMENTATION; DECOMPOSITION; ECCENTRICITY; ALGORITHM	In this paper, a general methodology based on the application of discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the diagnosis of the cage motor condition using transient stator currents is exposed. The approach is based on the identification of characteristic patterns introduced by fault components in the wavelet signals obtained from the DWT of transient stator currents. These patterns enable a reliable detection of the corresponding fault as well as a clear interpretation of the physical phenomenon taking place in the machine. The proposed approach is applied to the detection of rotor asymmetries in two alternative ways, i.e., by using the startup current and by using the current during plugging stopping. Mixed eccentricities are also detected by means of the transient-based methodology. This paper shows how the evolution of other non-fault-related components such as the principal slot harmonic (PSH) can be extracted with the proposed technique. A compilation of experimental cases regarding the application of the methodology to the previous cases is presented. Guidelines for the easy application of the methodology by any user are also provided under a didactic perspective.

Measurement of the resulting carrier signals (either the negative-sequence carrier-signal current or the zero-sequence components) is used to detect turn faults at an incipient stage. The carrier frequency and magnitude are shown to have significant impact on the performance of the method, with the criteria for their selection being presented.

However, MCSA is still an open research topic, as some signatures may be created by different phenomena, wherein it may become sensitive to load and inertia variations, and with respect to an oscillating load torque, although suitable data normalization can be applied. Recently, the topic of diagnostic techniques for drives and low to medium size machines is becoming attractive, as the procedure can be embedded in the drive at no additional thanks to a dedicated firmware, provided that a suitable computational cost is available. In this paper, statistical time-domain techniques are used to track grid frequency and machine slip. In this way, either a lower computational cost or a higher accuracy than traditional discrete Fourier transform techniques can be obtained. Then, the knowledge of both grid frequency and machine slip is used to tune the parameters of the zoom fast Fourier transform algorithm that either increases the frequency resolution, keeping constant the computational cost, or reduces the computational cost, keeping constant the frequency resolution. The proposed technique is validated for rotor faults.

Marques			A New Model-Based Technique for the Diagnosis of Rotor Faults in RFOC Induction Motor Drives	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; induction motor drives; monitoring	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; MACHINES; BAR; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	This paper proposes a new model-based diagnostic technique, which is the so-called virtual current technique (VCT), for the diagnosis of rotor faults in direct rotor field oriented controlled (DRFOC) induction motor drives. By measuring the oscillations at twice the slip frequency found in the rotor flux of the machine, and by conjugating this information with the knowledge of some motor parameters, as well as the parameters of the flux and current controllers, it is possible to generate a virtual magnetizing current which, after normalization, allows the detection and quantification of the extension of the fault. The proposed method allows one to overcome the major difficulties usually found in the diagnosis of rotor faults in closed-loop drives by providing information about the condition of the machine in a way that is independent of the working conditions of the drive such as the load level, reference speed, and bandwidth of the control loops. Although the VCT was primarily developed for traction drives used in railway applications, it can be incorporated in any DRFOC drive at almost no additional cost. Several simulation results, obtained with different types of DRFOC drives, as well as experimental results obtained in the laboratory, demonstrate the effectiveness of this new diagnostic approach.

So far, the VMM was investigated with fixed rotor parameters only. In this paper, the parameters of the current model are provided by a parameter tracking technique. For this advanced rotor fault detection method, measurement results are presented for steady-state and varying load torque operations.

J	Andriamalala, RN; Razik, H; Baghli, L; Sargos, FM				Andriamalala, Rijamaina Njakasoa; Razik, Hubert; Baghli, Lotfi; Sargos, Francois-Michel			Eccentricity Fault Diagnosis of a Dual-Stator Winding Induction Machine Drive Considering the Slotting Effects	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Dual-stator winding induction machine (DSWIM); eccentricity; fast Fourier transform (FFT); indirect rotor field-oriented control (IRFOC); slotting effects	AIR-GAP; MOTOR; SIMULATION; MODEL	To point out the effects of eccentricity within a dual-stator winding induction machine, one needs to detect the high frequency corresponding to the interaction of both eccentricity and slotting effects. In this paper, a model of this kind of machine, whose rotor is mixed-eccentric, has been suggested. One considers slotting effects. This induction machine has two sets of stator three-phase windings electrically shifted by an angle alpha. This model will be used to analyze the impact of the defect on the machine. It will be seen that the analytical expression of inductances can be directly exploited to predict the eccentricity-related frequencies. First, the impact of the defect will be investigated under an open-loop condition, i.e., the motor will be supplied by the volt-per-hertz control mode. Second, the motors will be supplied by using the indirect rotor field-oriented control. One will see the fault propagation on the control variables, which can be used as a tool for diagnosis under closed-loop conditions. Comparisons between simulation and experimental results will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this experiment.

J	Ibrahim, A; El Badaoui, M; Guillet, F; Bonnardot, F				Ibrahim, Ali; El Badaoui, Mohamed; Guillet, Francois; Bonnardot, Ferderic			A New Bearing Fault Detection Method in Induction Machines Based on Instantaneous Power Factor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Bearings; fault diagnosis; induction machines; signal processing	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; ONLINE DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; STATOR	Fault detection and diagnosis of asynchronous machine has become a central problem in industry over the past decade. A solution to tackle this problem is to use stator current for a condition monitoring, referred to as motor current signature analysis. This paper argues that bearing faults would have a negligible effect on motor currents and instead argues that the more likely reason why the faults can be detected in currents is because they entail a fluctuating resistive torque which acts immediately, in contrast to the radial displacement which takes time to integrate to a perceptible displacement even in response to a step change in velocity. In this context, we propose a new method for detecting bearing defects based on the exploitation of the instantaneous power factor that varies according to torque oscillations. Experimental results show the good performances of the proposed method which will be compared with the instantaneous power method to highlight the feasibility and advantages of this method.

The fault detection and location are achieved by a feedforward multilayer-perceptron neural network (NN) trained by back propagation. The location process is based on monitoring the three-phase shifts between the line current and the phase voltage of the machine. The required data for training and testing the NN are experimentally generated from a three-phase induction motor with different interturn short-circuit faults. Simulation, as well as experimental, results are presented in this paper to demonstrate the effectiveness of the used method.

This method is based on a representation space, a selection criterion, and a decision criterion. In order to define the representation space, an optimized time-frequency representation (TFR) is designed from the time-frequency ambiguity plane. The selection criterion is based on Fisher's discriminant ratio, which allows one to maximize the separability between classes representing different faults. A distinct TFR is designed for each class. The following two classifiers were used for decision criteria: the Mahalanobis distance and the hidden Markov model. The flexibility of this method allows an accurate classification independent from the level of load. This method is validated on a 5.5-kW induction motor test bench.

Analytical Modeling Approach to Detect Magnet Defects in Permanent-Magnet Brushless Motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MAGNETICS			English	Article						Analytical model; finite-element analysis; gradient algorithm; permanent-magnet machine	FIELD DISTRIBUTION	The paper presents a novel approach to detect magnet faults such as local demagnetization in brushless permanent-magnet motors. We have developed a new form of analytical model that solves the Laplacian/quasi-Poissonian field equations in the machine's air-gap and magnet element regions. We verified the model by using finite-element software in which demagnetization faults were simulated and electromotive force was calculated as a function of rotor position. We then introduced the numerical data of electromotive force into a gradient-based algorithm that uses the analytical model to locate demagnetized regions in the magnet as simulated in the finite-element package. The fast and accurate convergence of the algorithm makes the model useful in magnet fault diagnostics.	[Farooq, J.

J	Gebraeel, N; Pan, J				Gebraeel, Nagi; Pan, Jing			Prognostic Degradation Models for Computing and Updating Residual Life Distributions in a Time-Varying Environment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Condition monitoring; degradation modeling; prognostics	ACCELERATED DEGRADATION; INSPECTED SYSTEMS; INFERENCE; WEAR; AVAILABILITY; SURVIVAL	This paper presents a degradation modeling framework for computing condition-based residual life distributions of partially degraded systems and/or components functioning under time-varying environmental and/or operational conditions. Our approach is to mathematically model degradation-based signals from a population of components using stochastic models that combine three main sources of information: real-time degradation characteristics of component obtained by observing the component's in-situ degradation signal, the degradation characteristics of the component's population, and the real-time status of the environmental conditions under which the component is operating. Prior degradation information is used to estimate the model coefficients. The resulting generalized stochastic degradation model is then used to predict an initial residual life distribution for the component being monitored. In-situ degradation signals, along with real-time information related to the environmental conditions, are then used to update the residual life distributions in real-time. Because these updated distributions capture current health information and the latest environmental conditions, they provide precise lifetime estimates. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated using real world vibration-based degradation signals from a rotating machinery application.

J	Cempel, C				Cempel, Czeslaw			DECOMPOSITION OF THE SYMPTOM OBSERVATION MATRIX AND GREY FORECASTING IN VIBRATION CONDITION MONITORING OF MACHINES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						machine wear; multidimensional observation; vibration; SVD decomposition; fault space; observation space; symptom limit value; forecasting; grey system theory	SYSTEMS; OPERATION	With the tools of modern metrology we can measure almost all variables in the phenomenon field of a working machine, and many of the measured quantities can be symptoms of machine conditions. On this basis, we can form a symptom observation matrix (SOM) intended for condition monitoring and wear trend ( fault) identification. On the other hand, we know that contemporary complex machines may have many modes of failure, called faults. The paper presents a method of the extraction of the information about faults from the symptom observation matrix by means of singular value decomposition (SVD), in the form of generalized fault symptoms. As the readings of the symptoms can be unstable, the moving average of the SOM is applied with success. An attempt to assess the diagnostic contribution of a primary symptom is made, and also an approach to assess the symptom limit value and to connect the SVD methodology with neural nets is considered. Finally, a condition forecasting problem is discussed and an application of grey system theory (GST) to symptom prognosis is presented. These possibilities are illustrated by processing data taken directly from the machine vibration condition monitoring area.

Classification of burst and suppression in the neonatal electroencephalogram	JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							PROGNOSTIC VALUE; EEG; PATTERNS	Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD), a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) were compared with respect to their ability to distinguish bursts from suppressions in electroencephalograms (EEG) displaying a burst-suppression pattern. Five features extracted from the EEG were used as inputs. The study was based on EEG signals from six full-term infants who had suffered from perinatal asphyxia, and the methods have been trained with reference data classified by an experienced electroencephalographer. The results are summarized as the area under the curve (AUC), derived from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curves for the three methods. Based on this, the SVM performs slightly better than the others. Testing the three methods with combinations of increasing numbers of the five features shows that the SVM handles the increasing amount of information better than the other methods.

J	He, YY; Yin, XY; Chu, FL				He, Yongyong; Yin, Xinyun; Chu, Fulei			Modal Analysis of Rubbing Acoustic Emission for Rotor-Bearing System Based on Reassigned Wavelet Scalogram	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article						modal acoustic emission; rubbing; wavelet transform; reassigned wavelet scalogram; fault diagnosis	SOURCE LOCATION; THIN PLATES; TRANSFORM; SIGNALS; EXTRACTION	Rubbing between the rotor and the stator is the frequent and harmful malfunction in the rotating machinery, which will cause a very serious accident, even catastrophe, to the machine. Thus, such fault needs timely detection to avoid severe consequences. Vibration based methods are the traditional ones for the detection and diagnosis of the rubbing fault, which are effective when the rubbing has been severe, but always do not work in early detection of such fault. Rubbing between the rotor and the stator will cause elastic strain in the rubbing location and thus can produce acoustic emission (AE). Apparently, such AE contains direct and abundant information about the rubbing and thus can be used to detect and diagnose such fault effectively. In this paper, the AE based method is proposed for detecting and identifying the rubbing of the rotor-bearing system. Using the modal acoustic emission (MAE) theory and reassigned wavelet scalogram, the present study emphasizes on modal analysis and time-frequency characteristics analysis for further understanding the characteristics, phenomenon, and features of the rubbing AE. The results show that the rubbing AE is the elastic wave with multiple modals, which has an impact characteristic and mainly consists of the flexural wave and extensional wave. The transmission of the rubbing AE has some directivity. Moreover, different modals have different transmission characteristics: The flexural wave has lower frequency and its attenuation is influenced mainly by the sectional area of the transmission passage. The extensional wave has higher frequency and its attenuation is mainly sensitive to the interface transmission between the two surfaces. The results also reveal that the reassigned wavelet scalogram is more effective than its original scalogram for the characteristic analysis of the rubbing AE.

The machine condition is assessed through a suitable 'monitoring index' extracted from the vibration signals. The progression of the monitoring index is predicted using an SC technique, namely adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Comparison with a machine learning method, namely Support vector regression (SVR), is also presented. The proposed prediction procedures have been evaluated through benchmark data sets. The prognostic effectiveness of the techniques has been illustrated through previously published data on several types Of faults in machines. The performance of SVR was found to be better than ANFIS for the data sets used. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship of machine conditions, the corresponding indicating features, the level of damage/degradation and their progression. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Patel, TH; Darpe, AK				Patel, Tejas H.; Darpe, Ashish K.			Vibration response of a cracked rotor in presence of rotor-stator rub	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Fatigue crack and rotor-stator rub are two important faults in rotating machinery. Researchers have mostly studied the vibration behavior of a rotor with crack and rotor-stator rub separately. However, once the crack is developed in a rotor, the rotor is more likely to make contact with stator under tight clearance conditions, due to increased vibration level. The present study is aimed to examine vibration response of the cracked rotor in presence of common rotor faults such as unbalance and rotor stator rub. Numerical and experimental investigations are carried out and steady-state vibration analysis is presented. Experimental investigation for a multifault rotor system is attempted for the first time. The full spectrum analysis has been used effectively to extract the distinctive directional features of these rotor faults. The investigation focuses on directional nature of the higher harmonics for identification of rub in the cracked rotor. The study reveals that spectrum rich in spectral lines is a rub symptom. However, these higher harmonics are weaker than the 1X response. Rub in uncracked rotor excites forward and backward whirling frequency components almost equally. Cracked rotor without rub exhibits strongly forward whirling vibrations. Rotor rub in the cracked rotor reveals different response compared with the uncracked rotor, particularly the nature of 2X and higher harmonics at corresponding subharmonic resonances. Backward whirling nature of 2X frequency component as well as that of higher harmonic (that matches with the bending natural frequency) at corresponding subharmonic resonances, has been proposed for diagnosis of rotor rub in cracked rotor.

J	Chiu, SH; Chen, CC; Lin, TH				Chiu, Shih-Hau; Chen, Chien-Chi; Lin, Thy-Hou			Using support vector regression to model the correlation between the clinical metastases time and gene expression profile for breast cancer	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Breast cancer; Support vector regression; Feature selection; Metastases time; Microarray	MICROARRAY DATA; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; SIGNATURE; PREDICTOR; PROGNOSIS; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES	Objective: Recently, the microarray analysis has been an important tool used for studying the cancer type, biological mechanism, and diagnostic biomarkers. There are several machine-learning methods being used to construct the prognostic model based on the microarray data sets. However, most of these previous studies were focused on the supervised classification for predicting the clinical type of patients. In this study, we investigate whether or not the expression level of some significant genes identified can be used to predict the clinical metastases time of patients. Materials and methods: We have used a regression method to remodel the data set of breast cancer published in 2002. Some significant genes were ranked and selected based on a wrapper method with 10-fold cross-validation procedure and the selected genes were used to fit the support vector regression (SVR) model. This method could model the relationship between the significant gene expression value and the clinical metastases time of breast cancer. Results: 44 significant genes are selected for building the regression model and the corresponding cross-validated correlation coefficient obtained is 0.82 which is much superior to those reported previously by others using some different data sets. Moreover, there are two breast cancer related genes (the ligand 14 of the chemokine C-X-C motif (CXCL14) and estrogen receptor gene (ER)) selected in the gene set and one of them is never been included in the other data sets. Conclusion: In this report, we have shown that the expression level of some significant genes identified could strongly correlate with the clinical metastases time of breast cancer patients. The 44 selected genes may be used as a benchmark to evaluate the risk of recurrence of breast cancer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mitoma, T; Wang, HQ; Chen, P				Mitoma, Tetsuro; Wang, Huaqing; Chen, Peng			Fault diagnosis and condition surveillance for plant rotating machinery using partially-linearized neural network	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Condition surveillance; Partially-linearized neural network; Fuzzy; Symptom parameters; Rotating machinery		Fault diagnosis and condition surveillance of rotating machinery in a plant is very important for guaranteeing production efficiency and plant safety. In a large plant, with an enormous number of rotating machines, condition surveillance and fault diagnosis for all rotating machines is not only time consuming and labor intensive, but the accuracy of condition judgment cannot be ensured. These difficulties may cause serious machine accidents and consequently great production losses. In order to improve the efficiency of condition surveillance and detect faults at an early stage, this paper proposes a method of condition surveillance and fault discrimination for rotating plant machinery using non-dimensional symptom parameters in a time domain and "Partially-linearized Neural Network" (PLNN), from which the state of a rotating machine can be discriminated automatically. The verification results of precise diagnosis for rolling bearings show that the PLNN can effectively distinguish bearing faults. The verification results for condition surveillance of rotating machinery in a real plant show that the PLNN correctly judges the machine state of the inspected rotating machine as normal or abnormal.

The proof of the convergence of the estimates to their true values is achieved using Lyapunov theories and does not require that the classical persistent excitation condition be satisfied by the input signal. Since the induction motor (IM) is widely used in several industrial sectors, the algorithm developed is potentially useful for adjusting the controller parameters of variable speed drives. The method proposed is simple and easily implementable in real-time. The application of this approach to on-line estimation of the rotor resistance of IM shows a rapidly converging estimate in spite of measurement noise, discretization effects. parameter uncertainties (e.g. inaccuracies on motor inductance values) and modeling inaccuracies. The robustness analysis for this IM application also revealed that the proposed scheme is insensitive to the stator resistance variations within a wide range. The merits of the proposed algorithm in the case of on-line time-varying rotor resistance estimation are demonstrated via experimental results in various operating conditions of the induction motor. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that the application of the proposed algorithm to update on-line the parameters of an adaptive controller (e.g. IM and synchronous machines adaptive control) can improve the efficiency of the industrial process. The other interesting features of the proposed method include fault detection/estimation and adaptive control of IM and synchronous machines. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The approach consists of three stages. First, different features, including time-domain statistical characteristics, frequency-domain statistical characteristics and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) energy entropies, are extracted to acquire more fault characteristic information. Second, an improved distance evaluation technique is proposed, and with it, the most superior features are selected from the original feature set. Finally, the most superior features are fed into ANFIS to identify different abnormal cases. The proposed approach is applied to fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings, and testing results show that the proposed approach can reliably recognise different fault categories and severities. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed feature selection method is also demonstrated by the testing results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this application, the rotor is supplied by a static converter for the control of active and reactive power flows from the generator to the electrical grid. A new diagnostic method based on the frequency analysis of the rotor modulating signals is proposed. Simulation and experimental results confirm that a convenient frequency analysis of these signals and a simple interpretation lead to an effective diagnostic procedure. The proposed system is suitable to be easily embedded in the power-converter digital control system at very, low cost.
