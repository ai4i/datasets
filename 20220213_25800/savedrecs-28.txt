With the continuous development of technology, the way of using threshold to detect faults has been applied to production. Threshold detection, however, can't predict the occurrence of fault. It can only judge whether there is any fault after getting the data. In this paper, we proposed an improved Hidden Markov Model for fault prediction. This algorithm obtains a model by training the previous data, and then it uses the model to deal with the new data so that it could forecast the fault successfully. Experiment shows that this algorithm can better adapt to different production occasions with high accuracy. It also has strong anti-interference ability, and satisfactory effect.

Among them, Incremental Learning (IL) algorithms have shown to be reliable for updating FDD while it has own shortcomings. The FDD system with IL algorithms learns from recent available data without forgetting any previous redundant information. In order to address this drawback of IL for updating the FDD, the use of an Incremental Learning Dynamic Window (ILDW) is proposed. Based on TIM' dated information comparing with the current concept of the process is disregarded and the FDD within the sliding dynamic window is retrained. In this study advantageous of the ILDW are proved while Support Vector Machines (SVM) is employed as fault detection method with its application on simulation of the CSTR reactor. Results show that employing ILDW for updating SVM instead of just IL not only leads to similar outcomes regarding accuracy, but also significantly reduce the number of required support vectors and training time.

Ali			Bearing faults identification and resonant band demodulation based on wavelet de-noising methods and envelope analysis	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY (ICMTE)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Materials Technology and Energy (ICMTE)	APR 20-21, 2017	MALAYSIA	Inst Engineers Malaysia, Miri Branch, Inst Mat Malaysia, Miri Chapter, Curtin Univ			DIAGNOSIS	The vibration signals produced by rotating machinery contain useful information for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Fault severities assessment is a challenging task. Wavelet Transform (WT) as a multivariate analysis tool is able to compromise between the time and frequency information in the signals and served as a de-noising method. The CWT scaling function gives different resolutions to the discretely signals such as very fine resolution at lower scale but coarser resolution at a higher scale. However, the computational cost increased as it needs to produce different signal resolutions. DWT has better low computation cost as the dilation function allowed the signals to be decomposed through a tree of low and high pass filters and no further analysing the high-frequency components. In this paper, a method for bearing faults identification is presented by combing Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with envelope analysis for bearing fault diagnosis. The experimental data was sampled by Case Western Reserve University. The analysis result showed that the proposed method is effective in bearing faults detection, identify the exact fault's location and severity assessment especially for the inner race and outer race faults.

The fault signal denoising characteristics of different scales are considered in the proposed method. A new threshold which is suitable for the situation of noise distribution is selected. Noise reduction can be gotten by improving the threshold function. The signal components decomposed and denoised by EMD is extracted with cross-correlation and kurtosis criterion to highlight the high-frequency resonance components with which the blindness of IMF component selection can be avoided. The results of analysis applied to simulated signal and the measured signal show that the equipment fault detection performance can be improved.

As a result, we could not extract the whole information from the data. In order to reduce the loss of information, it is necessary for us to use the deep structure to describe the structure of the data. In this paper, the method of deep learning is used to deal with the vibration signal of rolling bearing. At the same time, an unsupervised multiple layer stacked sparse auto encoder network is proposed and used to learn the complex structure of the vibration signal because it has a good learning ability. In this paper, the vibration signal processing is processed in two aspects: the time domain and the frequency domain. Deep learning algorithm can learn the hidden information from the data, then the classifier could get very good results. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper performs well for the bearing vibration signal of the Case Western Reserve University.

Based on improved Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) and Chirp-Z Transform (CZT), a novel hybrid fault feature extraction method is proposed. Firstly LMD is used to decompose the original vibration signal into several product functions (PF) components with physical meaning. Secondly the Grey Relational Grade (GRG) analysis and Mutual Information (MI) theory are combined to improve the conventional LMD so as to remove the false PF components. Finally the selected real PF component is demodulated by CZT to extract fault feature frequency. The experimental results of roller bearing point corrosion fault signal demonstrate that the proposed novel method can effectively extract fault feature frequency and has a better performance than conventional FFT method.

This method can get higher diagnostic accuracy and have preferable against disturbances compared with other methods. Previously, wavelet denoising is introduced to three-phase currents for denoising and preprocessing before Concordia transform. Then the feature of these proposed phase currents are extracted by CEEMDAN algorithm and Hilbert transform, and the faults are detected and diagnosed using SVM approach. Simulated data are used to train the fault diagnosis model, as well as validate the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the method.

However, it has computational problem while dealing with high dimensional datasets. To overcome this issue, we propose an efficient dimension reduction technique named random projection combined with the SVM for fault classification in this paper. Compared with well known dimension reduction method like PCA, it provides better tradeoff between pairwised distances reservation and computational time. The experiments on rolling bearing system demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

A more practical situation in this work is the generalized (non-affine) models and real-time implementation. In particular, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is established for vehicle lateral dynamics with varying longitudinal velocity, and the least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) aided datadriven approach is proposed to design the parity vector based residual generation and evaluation framework directly for fault detection. The proposed data-driven FD approach is illustrated via a benchmark simulation of vehicle model and environment from veDYNA.

Firstly, The intrinsic mode functions (IMF) containing fault information was obtained by EMD decomposition based on the collected vibration data. Then, RMS value, energy, Shannon entropy and energy moments were calculated as characteristic index of roller bearing. Next the safety region boundary was demarcated by LSSVM and fault classification of bearings were identified by DAGSVM. The experiment results indicated that the proposed method could identify the working status and fault type of metro roller bearings accurately and effectively.

Time series prediction capabilities of machine learning like support vector regression (SVR) can be utilized for prognostics. But, choosing optimal parameters for SVR is an important step in SVR model design, which heavily affects the performance of SVR. So, a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) based algorithm is proposed for SVR parameters selection. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated through some benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method with moving window technology is used to condition prognostics of the Tennessee Eastman process. Experiments and engineering application show that the SVR-WOA method is effective, by noting that the computation time is shortened in some application scenarios.

Traditionally, intelligent fault diagnosis subjects to a lot of prior knowledge. In this work, a novel method based on the sparse features is proposed. The sparse features directly are extracted from raw mechanical vibration signals using unsupervised learning. Conventionally, Support Vector Machine optimized by Improved Particle Swarm (IPSO-SVM) is used to classify the health condition based on the sparse features for each sample. By introducing improved parameters into PSO algorithm, the global search ability of the PSO algorithm is enhanced. The proposed method is validated by a case of rolling element bearings datasets. In the experiments, we set up fifteen datasets to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can provide a simple and accurate fault diagnosis for bearing multi-faults.

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm is used to process the initial input data, which reduces the computational burden of the network. Using the Prediction Error Sum of Square (PESS) to select the hidden layer neurons, and the PCA method to limit the number of hidden neurons.

By using vibration signals of rolling bearing, a novel rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition and permutation entropy (EEMD-PE) coupled with multiclass relevance vector machines (M-RVM) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can decompose the vibration signals of rolling bearing to a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) that contain different fault features of rolling bearing by using the self-adaptive decomposition ability of EEMD. Permutation entropy (PE) is used to extract the feature of each IMF and the fault feature vector of vibration singal is constituted by the PE values of IMFs. The M-RVM classifier is built by the feature vectors extracted from rolling bearing vibration samples in different fault modes. Moreover, the multiple faults identification result can be implemented by the MRVM classifier in the form of probability output. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fault diagnosis method is capable of effectively extracting fault features in vibration signal and improving the fault identification accuracy compared with the existing bearing fault diagnosis methods.

Moreover, their performance depends on the parameter selection of highpass filters. To further explore the potential of SR, this paper studies the behavior of underdamped SR in a multistable nonlinear system by analyzing its output frequency responses, and presents a promising underdamped multistable SR method for weak signal detection and further incipient fault diagnosis of machinery. Numerical analyses indicate that the proposed method is supposed to possess two advantages: 1) the stable-state diversity of the multistable potential makes it easily match with input signals and 2) under-damped multistable SR is equivalent to a bandpass filter as the resealing ratio varies, which is able to suppress the interference from multiscale noise. Simulated and experimental data of rolling element bearings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For comparison, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and traditional overdamped bistable SR method are also employed to process the data. The comparison results show that the proposed method can effectively detect incipient fault characteristics and perform better than traditional SR and EEMD methods.

The fault diagnosis is based on the analysis of failure patterns in the current or voltage signatures, which allow to distinguish possible incipient faults in the machine. The failure patterns are usually dependent on the line frequency, rotor rotation frequency and some structural features of the machine. The rotor rotation frequency pattern, for example, is indicative of rotor mechanical problems and rotor winding inter -turn short-circuit. In the specific case of two -pole synchronous machines, the rotation frequency is equal to the line frequency. Thus, the ESA failure patterns coincide with the network harmonics. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish the effect of the network harmonics and the machine internal faults in order to get a reliable diagnosis for the machine. This work investigates the behavior of the even harmonics in synchronous generators (SGs) aiming to improve the ESA for fault diagnosis of two-pole SGs. The investigation has been performed through experimental tests accomplished in a scale model laboratory developed to simulate faults in a small SG in a controlled way. A system developed for turbogenerator predictive maintenance based on ESA has been used for this purpose. This system is in operation in a Brazilian 404 MW thermal power station.

In this regard, fair comparisons between the performances of empirical mode decomposition, ensemble empirical mode decomposition and discrete wavelet transform were performed to determine unbalance fault location in a rotating machinery. In order to obtain the required data, a rotating machinery fault simulator with three discs was designed and made for investigating unbalance faults effects. The fault classification process was done using a multi-class support vector machine optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. The obtained results indicated that ensemble empirical mode decomposition method had higher success rate in locating unbalance fault compared to other methods. In addition, one-against-one approach by the optimized multi-class support vector machines outperforms one-against-all approach.

Manufacturing, installation, operation and maintenance are part of the machine's history and should be taken into account. The paper focuses on experimental procedures to develop a multi-criteria methodology to classify up to ten machine conditions. Using machine learning for signal processing techniques, any deviation from a normal steady state might be categorized as an abnormal behavior and, when demonstrated, a fault. To take advantage of machine learning algorithms, a significant amount of data is needed. To demonstrate the procedure the authors examined a synchronous machine. The authors recorded currents and voltages primarily, in stator and rotor winding, well as rotational speed and electromechanical torque. The collected signals were filtered and pre-processed, and to 5038 features were calculated and transformed into a tidy dataset. The sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm was used to extract the most important defined features. The results are shown in 3D scatter plots; in which each machine condition is represented. It is then possible to visualize the ability of the model to identify the most discriminant features. The same method can be used for the diagnostic of other types of machine conditions.

Numerical simulations were carried out for a selected number of shorted turns. The elaborated model consists of field, circuit and motion equations. Based on the models, torque waveforms have been charted. Torque waveforms have been designated for two states of the machine - one with a rated load and the other with no-load. Special attention was paid to analysis of torque during the startup state. Due to the non-stationary of the torque waveform, the wavelet analysis was used.

The selection of windings supplied with power depends on a rotor position which can be determined in a number of ways. Very frequently method is using optical or Hall effect two-state sensors fixed on motors. In the case of a sensor fault, when the sensor output signal remains unchanged, drive operation is significantly deteriorated and it is necessary to take actions ensuring further flawless operation of a drive in accordance with of the idea of fault-tolerant systems' operation. The paper presents the results of experimental research related to the reproduction of rotor angle position used after the detection of a rotor position sensor error.

Wavelet orthonormal bases were built with the use of the recurrent relationships generating higher-degree Legendre polynomials. For the scaling function constructed in the form of linear combination of Legendre polynomials of the selected levels, synthesis of the basic wavelet was performed - this mapped the characteristic properties of the signal carrying the information about the nature of the fault. A signal proportional to the machine axial flux was used for the analysis - this enabled the required diagnostics. On the basis of the constructed wavelet bases, the results of the analyses of the signals registered in the different states of the winding short-circuits of the stator winding of an induction motor operating under the constant load, were presented. The choice of an advanced method of analysis was dictated by the occurrence of the periodic energy flow of signals between the adjacent frequency bands which made the Fourier analyses ineffective.

Through training the deep auto-encoder networks with the training method of extreme learning machine, the classification accuracy and training time of ELM-MDAE are compared with traditional deep auto-encoder network utilizing the rolling bearing fault vibration dataset released by Case Western Reserve University in United States. Experiments turn out to be that the average diagnostic accuracy rate could reach to 98.42%, and the average training time is 3.70 s with the method established in this paper. Therefore, ELM-MDAE possesses a better classification ability and fewer training time.

This paper presents a novel ensemble one-class extreme learning machine (EOCELM), which not only yields sound performance but also facilitates the parallel processing of training and testing. Instead of training on the entire training dataset, EOCELM first partitions the training data into overlapping clusters by k-medoids clustering and a simple Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) based heuristic rule. The proposed overlapping data partition makes it possible to describe the sub-structures within one-class training data more precisely without the risk of creating "clutser gap" that may degrade the generalization performance. Besides, the data partition can alleviate the matrix inversion problem of original extreme learning machine (OCELM) when dealing with massive training data. Next, an OCELM is trained for each data cluster as a sub-classifier, which can be implemented in a parallel way. Finally, OCELMs are combined into EOCELM by the simple maximum combining rule. Experiments on synthetic datasets, UCI datasets and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EOCELM when compared with other state-of-the-art one-class learning approaches.

Therefore, these learning algorithms are called as lazy learning algorithms and implemented in various applications. However, there is a pressing need among the researchers to analyze the performance of various types of the instance-based classifier. Therefore, this chapter presents a pragmatic investigation on performance of the instance-based learning algorithms. In order to conduct this analysis, different instance-based classifier namely instance-based one (IB1), instance-based K (IBK), Kstar, lazy learning of Bayesian rules (LBR), locally weighted learning (LWL) are adopted. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy on various real-world datasets.

As a sound data analysis and knowledge discovery paradigm, RST has much to offer to the ML community. We surveyed the existing literature and reported on the most relevant RST theoretical developments and applications in this area. The review starts with RST in the context of data preprocessing (discretization, feature selection, instance selection and meta-learning) as well as the generation of both descriptive and predictive knowledge via decision rule induction, association rule mining and clustering. Afterward, we examined several special ML scenarios in which RST has been recently introduced, such as imbalanced classification, multi-label classification, dynamic/incremental learning, Big Data analysis and cost-sensitive learning.

Chaos theory is widely used in electric power and machinery industries. It can describe the whole system with some parameters. It is proved that spacecraft telemetry parameters are chaotic by calculating the chaotic characteristics. Aiming at the problems of complicated spacecraft system, complicated parameters and difficult to establish accurate mathematical model, a prediction method based on phase space reconstruction is proposed. The adaptive feature extraction of spacecraft telemetry data is realized by phase space reconstruction, and the prediction of telemetry data is realized by RBF neural network and Volterra filter. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better prediction performance.

J	Guo, RX; Gan, Q				Guo, Runxia; Gan, Quan			Prognostics for a Leaking Hydraulic Actuator Based on the F-Distribution Particle Filter	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Prognostics; hydraulic actuator; F-distribution; particle filter; remaining useful life (RUL)	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; LITHIUM-ION BATTERY; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; STATE; TUTORIAL; SYSTEMS; PREDICTION	Particle filter has been developing prosperously in the prognostics field and is being applied with success in prognostics of complex systems or components. The existing research works on the prognostic process demonstrate that the state prediction phase that is actualized by classical procedures, such as particle projection, is always prone to performance degradation. To overcome such a defect, this paper presents a novel technique, named the F-distribution particle filter -based prognostics, following the principle that the particles' weights are calculated dynamically by the F kernel rather than keeping fixing in the state prediction phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through a real experiment of a hydraulic actuator.

Fault diagnosis is an integral part of CBM, which requires measurement of electrical/ mechanical signals under different conditions to capture the intelligence about health of the system. In system dependent fault diagnosis, diagnosis model is trained using data collected from one machine, and it can be tested on the same machine. In system Independent fault diagnosis, diagnosis model is trained using data measured from one machine, and it can be tested on machine with different capacity. In factory environment with system independent fault diagnosis, group of machines having same characteristics and different power ratings can be diagnosed using a single fault diagnosis model. In this work, we model system independent diagnosis of stator winding inter-turn faults for synchronous generator with the use of two synchronous generators having power ratings of 3 kVA and 5 kVA respectively. System dependent attributes deteriorates performance of system independent fault diagnosis, as compared to system dependent diagnosis. To improve robustness of system independent fault diagnosis model, effect of system dependent attributes should be suppressed. We use nuisance attribute projection (NAP) to improve robustness of system independent diagnosis model by diminishing the effect of system dependent features. Using NAP, performance is improved by 19.63%, 8.31% and 11.80% for R, Y and B fault models respectively, as compared to baseline performance.	[Gandhi, Jeet; Gopinath, R.; Kumar, C.

Its five-year overall survival rate being reported is about 7.7% from 2006 to 2012 by the National Cancer Institute. One of the main causes for its poor prognosis is because its non-typical symptoms make early diagnosis very challenging. Therefore, a predominant strategy for early accurate detection and prognostication on pancreatic cancer is vital to the whole course of comprehensive therapy. In this research, we proposed a method which combined Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Large Margin Distribution Machine (LDM) to identify potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. In our experiments, we have strengthened the process of RFE to achieve better performance. The dataset GSE15471 we adopted are from GEO database with 3(pairs of pancreatic ductal carcinoma and adjacent control pancreatic tissues. Through experiments, a panel of twelve genes was identified as biomarkers in pancreatic cancer with 91.28% classification accuracy. The universality of the candidate genes was examined on another dataset GSE28735 and the classification accuracy was higher than 80%. In addition, by using the SVM, LDM and BP classifiers, we compared the ordered feature sets generated by our proposed method with T-test, SVM-RFE and LDM-RFE, and the results indicated our proposed method obtained higher average classification accuracy.

Therefore, researches on sensor fault diagnosis technology are important for improving the reliability of industry system. A sensor signal which is non-linear and non-stationary, has many kinds of structural characteristics and sensing properties. On the basis of supervised locally linear embedding (SLLE), support vector machine (SVM), and Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS), as a means of sensor fault diagnosis is proposed in this thesis. HMS is put forward to feature analysis from obtained sensor signals. Then SLLE is put forward to reduce dimensionality of high dimensionality fault signal, that is more effective than other dimensionality reduction means, for example multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), locally linear embedding (LLE) and principal component analysis (PCA). In the end, support vector machine (SVM) is used to complete the sensor fault diagnosis on base of the obtained feature vector. The result shows that the above methods improve the feature extraction and recognition result observably.

This paper firstly analyses the basic characteristics of LiFePO4 battery including the capacity and internal resistance. Secondly, particle filter (PF) algorithm is introduced to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of LiFePO4 battery effectively. Based on the LiFePO4 battery life degradation data, the prediction accuracy of four kinds of resampling algorithm is analyzed and compared. The result of Systematic Resampling is the most close to real life end points, and Random Resampling has the lowest prediction accuracy. Therefore, Systematic Resampling is used to predict RUL. The results indicate that PF can efficiently predict RUL of LiFePO4 Battery.

This paper presents a performance enhancement scheme for the extreme learning machine (ELM) to predict the operating parameters of the thermal system using particle swarm optimization (PSO). ELM is a feed-forward neural network with single hidden layer, which has well generalization ability and fast learning ability. However, the number of the hidden layer nodes of ELM could not be automatically obtained. The optimal selection of ELM parameters can improve its performance. In this paper, the discrete-valued PSO is applied for optimizing the number of the hidden nodes to enhance ELM performance. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid algorithm is more accurate and effective for predicting thermal system parameters.

Facing with the difficulties of aging and shortage of labor, we can use home service robot (HSR) as a good companion and servant. However, the security and reliability problems have become bottlenecks in this field. It is meaningful to do researches on fault diagnosis of HSR. Due to its excellent performance in small sample learning, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful tool for many pattern recognition applications which include fault diagnosis. However, SVM suffers a lot from the high complexity of training time and memory space. This paper proposes a novel support vector selection (SVS) method which can accelerate the training speed of SVM.

This paper proposes an online algorithm to diagnose faults of PV module based on multi-class support vector machine (M-SVM). The simulation models of the photovoltaic module are implemented and the output power generation characteristics of PV modules under two typical fault conditions (line-to-line fault and abnormal degradation fault) are analyzed. Through the combination of mathematical model and simulation experiments of PV modules, the fill factor (FF) and the fault type factor K are introduced as feature parameters in the fault diagnosis process. In addition, to address the nonlinear problem in fault diagnosis and improve the single support vector machine, a fault diagnosis method based on the multi-class classification method of one-against-one (OAO) algorithm is proposed. The proposed solution is implemented and simulated through experiments and the numerical result clearly demonstrates its effectiveness and diagnosis accuracy.

The data used for the fault diagnosis is from sensors of the closed-loop traction motor system, in which the deviations between normal and bias faulty data are of 1%similar to 5% and between normal and gain faulty data are of 1%similar to 10%. Considering the non-stationary of the data, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition method is used to transform the original data to intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, the fault feature vector is extracted from IMFs. To deal with the fault diagnosis problem, the kernel support vector machine is utilized to be trained by the feature vector, and achieve the classification of the feature vector. The simulation results show that incipient faults can be diagnosed completely by the Kernel SVM based on EEMD method.

Its running state can influence the performance of the whole machine directly, and the fault of bearing is one of the main factors that lead to the fault of machinery equipment during the running process. Instead of using traditional measures based on signal filtering, decomposition, transformation, feature extraction, and so on, we carried out the research on convolution neural networks(CNN) for fault training and classification. The model architecture and parameters are studied with experiments based on the vibration signal samples of bearing failure. It shows that, the fault detection can reach a high accuracy level based on CNN by simply inputting the original signal plots. Although, long period of model training is needed, the lateral online classification can he simple by taking the benefit of trained model, particularly, no more decomposition, transformation, and feature extraction works need to do.

More features don't mean good performance. Data analysis and experiment based on real wind turbine samples are carried out to achieve efficient fault detection. Firstly, the original signal is decomposed with improved Empirical Mode Decomposition(EMD) to get a finite number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, characteristics of amplitude domain parameters, such as mean and variance are extracted, which can be turned into a high dimensional feature matrix. Principal component analysis(PCA) is adopted to reduce the feature matrix of vibration signals from high dimension to low dimension to remove redundant information. Classification experiments show that, this method can accurately extract the effective features of the original signal, and this can reduce the overfitting phenomenon of the machine learning model, and can also improve the accuracy of fault detection.

The speed governing of induction machine was realized using back-to-back voltage-fed frequency converter. The continuous output direct voltage value of three-phase non-controlled rectifier circuit was calculated, and the parameter setting of carrier signal and modulating wave signal in SPWM inverter circuit was explained. The operation status model of induction machine with open phase fault was proposed based equivalent circuit method and field-circuit coupled method. We analyzed the relation between open phase fault and rated operating phase current, the rotation change, and the variations of torque and magnetic linkage. Through comparison, it can be known that the simulation results of field-circuit coupled method were more accurate, and the curve was more smooth. Although the simulation duration of field-circuit coupled method was longer, it provided theoretical basis for motor fault diagnosis and play an guiding role for operation analysis of induction machine.

And the support vector machine (SVM) and other algorithms would lead to the destruction of the natural structure and the correlation in the original data. In order to solve the above problems, Support Higher-order Tensor Machine (SHTM) is proposed. In order to verify the feasibility of SHTM in the fault diagnosis of electric vehicle extender, firstly, the GT-Crank lattice dynamics model was used to establish the samples of normal, single cylinder fire failure and misalignment failure, and then SHTM model was used to classify the samples. The results show that SHTM makes full use of the structural information and correlation in the engine state parameters, the test accuracy is high, the learning time is short, and the convergence speed is faster.

Hybrid Datafication of Maintenance Logs from AI-Assisted Human Tags	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)	IEEE International Conference on Big Data		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)	DEC 11-14, 2017	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ELSEVIER, CISCO		Natural Language Processing; Intelligent manufacturing systems; Predictive maintenance; Tagging		One of the main challenges of applying AI to certain datasets derives from the datasets themselves being unstructured, unclear, and ambiguous. Furthermore, the insights that are to be gained reflect the quality of the data itself; if the data is skewed, so will be the insights. This problem is not unique to AI technology. People looking back at logs of past events often struggle to understand what was recorded, and to put together a timeline amongst a range of actors. AI technology can help humans sort the data out, but it does not provide the same insight often found in the background knowledge of human participants. This contextual weakness has made unstructured data hard to process. In our work, we have studied typical manufacturing maintenance logs to explore whether and how we can apply AI technologies to gain more insight from this-often vast and under-used-data-source. Our approach combines AI techniques for NLP, machine learning, and statistical processing with human contextual knowledge to quickly develop structured semantics reflecting unique datasets.

Researchers focused on developing big data analytics solutions using machine learning models. Machine learning is a rising trend in this field due to its ability to extract hidden features and patterns even in highly complex datasets. In this study, we used our Big Data IoT Framework in a weather data analysis use case. We implemented weather clustering and sensor anomaly detection using a publicly available dataset. We provided the implementation details of each framework layer (acquisition, ETL, data processing, learning and decision) for this particular use case. Our chosen learning model within the library is Scikit-Learn based k-means clustering. The data analysis results indicate that it is possible to extract meaningful information from a relatively complex dataset using our framework.

This paper proposes the use of multi-model ensemble in generating the final predictions of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL), where the primary focus are in ensemble generation (to produce multiple base models) and ensemble integration (to design weighting methods for the base models). Upon generating the multiple base models, each base model is then weighted by incorporating the importance information of the features that are used.

The developed model interprets performance condition monitoring data and determines machine health status with the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The ANN networks were trained for principle performance parameters from which actual system performance can be predicted based on given set of input parameters. The validity of the proposed model was evaluated through a case study on twin-shaft 18700 kW industrial gas turbine engine to detect a fault happened in engine bell-mouth. The results showed the networks trained using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training function can achieve more accurate results compared to Bayesian regulation (BR) and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) training functions. In addition, the results also showed that both power output parameter and the fuel flow rate can be effectively used to monitor the performance of gas turbine.

Although being standardized procedures for oil analysis vast, they are also very time-consuming and complex to be performed by most companies. This results in an often used standard-less analysis called photo-comparison. Besides not being standardized, this method does not present the real condition of the oil and is highly subjective. In this paper, we present an approach for semi-automatic classification and counting of particles in industrial oils strictly in accordance with the ISO 4406 standard. The aim is to turn feasible for companies in general, standardized methods for particle counting. The results demonstrate the potential of the tool to quickly and effectively count particles, providing the specialist with relevant information concerning the characteristics of the particles, availing one a more accurate decision making.

Therefore, we first develop a locally connected restricted Boltzmann machine (LCRBM) from the traditional RBM in order to handle the periodic appearance of fault characteristics in the raw signals of rotating machinery. Then, using LCRBM, we propose a method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. In the method, LCRBM is used to obtain features directly from raw signals. Based on the features learned by LCRBM, the method uses softmax regression to recognize faults. The proposed method is verified by the dataset of locomotive bearings and its superiority is demonstrated by the comparison with methods using the traditional RBM and eighteen widely used manual features. Results indicate that the proposed method is able to automatically learn fine features from raw signals of rotating machinery and achieves higher diagnosis accuracies.

As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, it is important for robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body and the use of the fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain. The robot is also capable of alerting humans whenever a task will generate artificial pain, or whenever humans fails to acknowledge the alert, the robot can take a considerable preventive actions through joint stiffness adjustment.

Sensors can play a key role to improve safety and convenience in automotive Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A dramatic increase in connectivity and openness of the automotive CPS brings high security risks. If multiple and heterogeneous sensors equipped for braking and steering provides false sensing information for their controllers under deception attacks, it might cause catastrophic situations during driving. If the existing machine learning approaches are applied for sensor attacks while the majority of sensors is attacked, it cannot guarantee to identify deceptions as cyber-physical attacks. To address this problem, we propose an intelligent sensor attack detection and identification method based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) techniques, called deep learning, without a prior knowledge about the deception attacks modifying sensing data in time. We investigate an autonomous vehicle with Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and wheel encoder sensors under conditions of uncertainty and nonlinearity during driving. We firstly identify all possible attacks category on the sensors of it, choose what model to use and then systematically design its architecture on which the performance of deep learning highly depends. We train and then validate the proposed method's performance on real measurement data obtained from an unmanned ground vehicle. Finally, we show analytically the superiority of our method in terms of accuracy, precision, and computation time, including the worst situation where two among three sensors are simultaneously attacked.

The main goal is to explore interesting information regarding the diagnosis and prediction of electrical machines failures by the use of a Bayesian graphical model. This paper has shown the applicability of BN in fault prediction on an electrical asynchronous machine. The graphical structure of the BN was built based on the available knowledge about the system's behaviour, the degradation mechanisms, the functional decomposition and the links between the system's components. After defining the parameters and the structure of the Bayesian network (BN), the inference has allowed to obtain the probability of failure. With the developed Bayesian model, the prediction of induction motor failure has become possible with high precision. The Bayesian model, that has been used, takes into account both internal and external causes of induction motors faults. A census of causes was carried out on induction motors park at the SONATRACH / SKIKDA / GL1K / LNG plant. By the end of this paper and before giving some conclusions, a case study of an induction motor is presented.

Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) is a widely used method for the analysis of vibratory signals since it allows decomposing them in time and frequency domains. The choice of the analyzing wavelet and its order is an important step that affects the estimation of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). In this paper, we compared several types of wavelets in order to choose the most suitable for predicting the RUL of the bearings. The utilized selection criteria were the Minimum Shannon Entropy Criteria (MSEC) and Maximum Energy to Shannon Entropy Ratio criteria (MEER). The tests were carried out on several bearings under different conditions where horizontal and vertical accelerations are measured.

High pressure water and mud burst and the resultant tunnel face collapse is one of the major hazards in any tunneling projects. Detection and forecasting of potential water-bearing geological structures (usually one or another kind of zone of weakness, such as faults and shear zones) in front of the tunnel face, consequently, is the first step to reduce the risk in tunnel construction. Transient (or time domain) electromagnetic (TEM) survey is a major tool to detect and image conductive targets in the geologic formation so that it is an effective method to sense water-bearing structures (high water content resulting in a high conductivity zone than the surrounding formations). Previous studies on the response of TEM to water-bearing structures in front of tunnel face demonstrated that TEM is a cost-effective non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method for detect abnormal geological structures ahead of tunnel face. However, the direct computation of TEM response in the diffusion domain is computationally intensive. In this paper we adopt the correspondence principle between diffusion and wave propagation and compute the TEM response in the fictitious wave domain. With this approach we can take the advantage of the matured techniques in numerical simulation of wave propagations in time domain (such as the finite difference time domain, or FDTD). We then transform the fictitious wave field back to the diffusion domain to compare with the observation or put into the inversion process. This approach substantially increases the computation efficiency. We introduce an explicit definition of the reference frequency omega(0) based on the transition frequency. Based on this definition we can further define the fictitious wave propagation velocity and the equivalent electromagnetic (EM) properties of the materials. We used this approach computed the TEM response in a tunnel boring machine constructed tunnel case. The results obtained by our approach is compared with the results from direct model of TEM. The comparison results indicate that our modeling results bear all the major features that shown in the direct model. However, our approach can save about 10 times of the computation time for the same tunnel model.

Firstly, the corresponding data are found in historical data through IJITL method and the small sample data are output. Then WEMD method is used for data preprocessing of the small sample data. Finally, RLSSVM classifier is trained. To verify the validity, the proposed method is applied to a wastewater treatment process. The experimental results show that the proposed IJITL-WEMD-RLSSVM method is superior to the conventional method in speed and diagnosis accuracy for multimodal process.

Cyclostationarity indicators and bi-frequency maps help to quantify fault related modulations of vibration signals. High quality and robustness of these tools are achieved at a relatively high computational cost. Thus, industrial application of cyclostationarity is limited to off-line analysis in the post-processing stage. In this paper an on-line updating of cyclostationary tools is investigated alternatively to the moving block approach. As an exemplary cyclostationary tool the cyclic modulation spectrum is involved. The filter bank approach is proposed in order to carry out the sample-by-sample updating. We compare properties of the newly proposed method with the one based on sliding discrete Fourier transform.

Condition monitoring of rotating machinery under varying operating conditions based on Cyclo-Non-Stationary Indicators and a multi-order probabilistic approach for Instantaneous Angular Speed tracking	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control, Continental Automot, Occitanie Reg, Toulouse Metropole, CNES, Univ Toulouse III, Paul Sabatier, Inria, CNRS, OPTITRACK, MDPI, ISAE Supaero, iCODE, EECI, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Moveo		Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Instantaneous Angular Speed estimation; Cyclo-Non-Stationary Indicators; Rotating machinery; Varying operating conditions	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CYCLOSTATIONARITY	During the last decades, an emerging interest has been reported on modelling rotating machinery signals as cyclostationary. Several tools, such as the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) and the Cyclic Modulation Spectrum (CMS) have been proposed, assuming constant or almost constant rotating speed. To overcome this limitation, generalizations of SCD and CMS have been proposed that display cyclic Order versus Frequency. On the other hand the estimation of the instantaneous angular speed of the rotating machine is a crucial issue that has to be tackled before any analysis or diagnosis of the machine operating under non stationary conditions. This operation is generally carried out thanks to a tachometer, or an angle encoder, but in some cases this information can be missing for different reasons. The goal of this paper is to combine a novel approach for the analysis of cyclo-non-stationary signals based on the generalization of the indicators of cyclostationarity in order to cover the speed varying conditions, introducing a new speed-dependent angle averaging operator, with a new speed estimation method, that extracts from a vibration signal the most probable instantaneous rotation frequency without focusing on one specific order based on the a priori knowledge of the kinematics of the machine. The effectiveness of the ensemble method is evaluated on an acceleration signal captured at the wind turbine gearbox operating under speed varying conditions.

The advancements in battery technologies played a crucial part for this trend. However, no matter what the advancements are, all batteries have a fixed capacity and after some time drain out. In order to extend the flying time window, the prediction of the time that the battery will no longer be able to support a flying condition is crucial. This in fact can be cast as a standard Remaining Useful Life prognostic problem, similarly encountered in many fields. In this article, the problem of Remaining Useful Life estimation of a battery, under different flight conditions, is tackled using four machine learning techniques: a linear sparse model, a variant of support vector regression, a multilayer perceptron and an advanced tree based algorithm. The efficiency of the overall proposed machine learning techniques, in the field of batteries prognostics, is evaluated based on multiple experimental data from different flight conditions.

However, there are still many shortcomings restricting the large scale commercialization of PEMFCs, such as the short lifetime and high cost. Accurate prognostics of PEMFCs are very significant for its life and cost management. This paper presents an efficient semi-empirical model-based prognostics method estimating the health state and the remaining useful life of PEMFCs based on the adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) algorithm. AUKF algorithm can automatically adjust the system process covariance and observation covariance according to the estimation residuals, and it also solves the initial parameters setting problem of conventional UKF algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model-based prognostics method using the AUKF algorithm has better prognostics performance than using the UKF algorithm.

Analysis of complex machines as CPS can support anomaly detection and diagnosis by providing the required data to model different operational conditions. In this work, we develop a hybrid model of manufacturing machines to estimate operational state based on machine functionality, dynamics, and interactions. We used the identification of a Global Operational State (GOS) to help partition, provide context to signals, and monitor the time of sub-tasks in a manufacturing process. Partitioning a signal based on GOS can improve anomaly detection and diagnosis. Monitoring duration of sub-tasks in the process can provide a detailed insight of cycle time and improve productivity analysis. The proposed approach was implemented using data from an automotive assembly plant to detect backlash and parts slipping in a conveyor system by monitoring energy signature and state variables.

Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named tunable Q-factor wavelet transform(TQWT)-based multi-scale dictionary learning for dealing with this problem. The algorithm exploits TQWT to decompose the measured vibration signal into different scales, and then it adopts K-SVD which can also be replaced with other more efficient dictionary learning algorithm to learn dictionaries at different scales. Once done, it employs a global maximum a posteriori estimator and inverse TQWT to extract feature signal. By comparison with TQWT-denoising and K-SVD-denoising, the proposed algorithm enjoys two main advantages: 1) the dictionaries learnt by our algorithm have the multi-scale characteristic which is essential to deal with non-stationary signal. 2) the dictionaries are learnt from noisy signals itself and thus are adaptive to different types of feature information. Effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulation and fault diagnosis of motor bearing.

Many manufacturers have the ability to collect the physical data called Status Variables Identification (SVID) by sensors embedded in the advanced machines during the manufacturing process. To maintain the competitive advantages, process monitoring and quick response to yield problem are pivotal in detecting the cause of the faults with the help of the sensor data. To state the physical nature of certain SVID, we usually transform SVID into Fault Detection and Classification parameters (FDC parameters) using statistical indicators. The data containing FDC parameters is called FDC data. This study aims to develop a multivariate analysis model to find out the crucial factors which may lead to process excursion among a large amount of FDC data. We proposed a 2-phase multivariate analysis framework: (1) the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is applied for key operation screening. (2) And Random Forest (RF) is used to rank the FDC parameters based on the key operations. Based on the results, domain engineers can quickly take actions responding to low yield problems.

Measurement data obtained may be asynchronous and result in inaccurate features, affecting the accuracy of maintenance prediction. To overcome this drawback, this paper introduces an approach to automatically select a feature subset through a genetic algorithm. The full feature set is created based on different sliding windows characterizing different time shifts on adopted statistical metrics of the measurement data. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is then developed based on the preliminary fitting of a hidden Markov model (HMM) on the selected subset of features and assumed machines' condition in the training data. Ultimately the fittest subset of features is used to enable HMM-based predictive maintenance. The proposed approach is evaluated using data from semiconductor wafer production equipment, recorded over a period of one year.

This hinders operators from promptly identifying the root cause of failure or anomalies in OpenStack services. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework for OpenStack in order to identify the root process of anomalies underlying OpenStack services. The framework utilizes a process relational graph and an anomaly detection technique with a centroid-based clustering algorithm. We demonstrate experiments with regards to two use cases and prove the framework to enable discovery of the root process that is responsible for the anomalous situation.

We present a method to predict refactoring candidates at class level which can help developers in improving their design and structure of source code while preserving the behavior. We propose a technique to predict refactoring candidates based on the application of a machine learning based framework. We use Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) as the learning algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a feature extraction technique and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) as a technique for handling imbalanced data. We start with 102 source code metrics as input features which are then reduced to 31 features after removing irrelevant and redundant features through statistical tests. We conduct a series of experiments on publicly available software engineering dataset consisting of seven open-source software systems in which the refactored classes are manually validated. We apply LS-SVM with three different functions: linear, polynomial and Radial Basis Function (RBF). Statistical significance test demonstrate that RBF kernel outperforms linear and polynomial kernel but there is no statistically significant difference between the performance of linear and polynomial kernel. Statistical significance test reveals that with-SMOTE technique outperforms without-SMOTE and all metrics outperforms PCA based metrics. The mean value of Area Under Curve (AUC) for LS-SVM RBF kernel is 0.96.

C	Zhang, JY; Rizzoni, G			IEEE	Zhang, Jiyu; Rizzoni, Giorgio			Selection of residual generators in structural analysis for fault diagnosis using a diagnosability index	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS (CCTA 2017)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st Annual IEEE Conference on Control Technology and Applications	AUG 27-30, 2017	HI	IEEE, CSS, IEEE Robot & Automat Soc, SICE				Structural analysis for fault detection and isolation (FDI) is an efficient method for designing structured residual generators for model-based diagnosis. It generates a number of diagnostic test candidates, whose number may be large in case of complex systems. This paper proposes a method for selecting residual generators from a possibly large number of candidate equation sets using a diagnosability index that measures the degree of diagnosability in a diagnostic system. The selection process of residual generators is aimed at reducing the solution sets for achieving the optimal diagnostic performance, i.e, maximizing the detectability and isolability of various faults. The approach for selecting residual generators is applied to a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive system in an electrified vehicle to show that the proposed methodology is effective in automatically downsizing the candidate equation sets for diagnostic tests from a relatively larger number of choices derived from the structural analysis algorithms.

In this paper, a minimax probability machine (MPM) approach based on the framework of probabilistic representations is put forward for diagnosing process faults, without imposing any assumptions on data distributions. Moreover, a technique of pairwise discriminate analysis is incorporated to handle the classification of multiple faulty datasets. In addition to the enhanced handling of imbalanced distribution of datasets, the proposed MPM-based approach can also bring the benefits for fault diagnosis, owning to the utilization of an objective function in the form of summation of the pairwise separation probabilities between each pair of faulty datasets. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the benchmark of Tennessee Eastman process.

The conventional methods commonly use single faulty feeder detection methods, such as wavelet transform method, transient energy method, and the fifth harmonic current method, etc. However, their reliability is not satisfied due to the partial fault information is considered. A novel approach to identify the faulty feeder based on discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) and machine learning is proposed in this paper. The time frequency matrices are obtained by utilizing the DWPT to the collected transient zero-sequence current signals of the faulty feeder and sound feeders. The feature vectors will be extracted manually by calculating time-frequency matrices with statistical quantities. The two classifiers (Adaboost+CART and SVM) are trained by a large number of feature vectors under various kinds of fault conditions and factors, respectively. The faulty feeder detection can be achieved by the trained two classifiers. A PSCAD/EMTDC simulator is established to simulate a practical 10-kV resonant grounding distribution system. Simulation results of the testing cases validate that the proposed approach of fault detection is able to achieve good identification accuracy.

The direct multiclass SVM model is capable of obtaining a single classification function and avoids the difficulties of designing multiple groups of model parameters. However, when dealing with mass samples, the direct model will lead to low training efficiency and curse of dimensionality. To make the direct multiclass SVM-based transformer fault diagnosis not subject to the sample size limit, the sample reduction algorithm based on Kmedoids clustering is introduced. Before multiclass SVM training, potential support vectors can be extracted from the large-scale training set via sub-clustering method, which improves the calculation efficiency. Multi-kernel learning is also applied to the SVM model to further boost the classification performance. The effectiveness and application prospect of the proposed method are verified in case study.

By adding a secondary neutral point (NP) in stator windings, both the fault detection and tolerant capability can be improved considering a small turn-to-turn short at early stage. From the perspective of fault detection, the proposed two NP's windings increase the equipment impedance per NP. Once a turn fault occurs, the fault induced voltage harmonic magnitude can be increased. It results in a better signal-to-noise ratio for the fault detection. From the perspective of tolerant drive, the fault induced circulating currents can flow across different phase coils in the windings with two NP's. Reduced influence of circulating currents on a machine is achieved due to the current diversion. Turn fault induced copper losses are then decreased comparing to conventional windings with only one NP. By using the proposed two NP's windings, the influence of turn fault on PM machines can be minimized. A 1-kW PM machine with two different windings is experimentally evaluated to verify the proposed fault detection and tolerant performance.

Because the magnitudes of current harmonic are proportional to the machine load condition, it is still a challenge to detect a phase fault at light load when fault induced current harmonics are too small to estimate. This paper investigates the phase fault detection specifically for the conditions under low fault harmonic magnitudes. Both fault induced harmonics in dq currents and neutral point (NP) voltage are analyzed to find a suited signal for the phase fault detection. By adding a voltage sensor to measure the NP voltage in a PM machine, a better fault detection performance is achieved because the fault harmonic in NP voltage shows the reduced effect on torque loads and sensor measurement errors. A 50-W PM machine is tested to verify the phase fault detection performance under low fault harmonic magnitudes. This paper includes the experimental evaluation to analyze the detection limitation in terms of load capability based on current and voltage fault signals.

Temperature swing can be somehow controlled, if some decrease in efficiency can be tolerated by the power system, changing gate driver parameters to heat up the device in low load conditions. This is known as Active Thermal Control (ATC). To implement ATC, the temperature information of devices is needed. Since this sensing is carried out near power conductors, switched at high frequency, strong disturbances will affect the reading. This paper proposes a new signal-conditioning scheme based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and compares it to some established filtering techniques to assess which is most suitable for the application. Hints about insulation of measuring equipment will be given, too. Moreover, the possibility offered by the algorithms to store long-time temperature information (through compression of incoming data) will be described, as large-span observation can help prognostic algorithms in forecasting the remaining useful life of the power apparatus.

Yet, it is a complex subject in power system research communities and electric utilities. The composition of the end-use loads is changing continually based on climate zone, season, and time. The WECC composite load model has been developed recently to better represent Fault Induced Delayed Voltage Recovery (FIDVR) events, which is caused by air-conditioning stalling phenomena. The approach is based on using the information of the load class at the substation level and composition of airconditioning, induction machines, power electronics, and static loads associated with the load class. Therefore, it is important to be able to identify and classify the load class. This can be accomplished by using machine learning based signature detection since each load class has a unique signature response due to a particular disturbance in the system. The objective of this project is to implement a supervised learning, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), algorithm to detect and classify the composite load signatures in terms of residential, commercial, agriculture, and mixed load class. Furthermore, the process of creating WECC composite load model data, using the Load Model Data Tool (LMDT), to be used in time-domain dynamic simulation (PSS/E) is demonstrated. The One-Area Reliability Test System is used for the purpose of demonstration and validation of our proposed methodology. The key contribution of this research includes: 1) To demonstrate automated disturbance data creation and collection using the latest composite load model developed by WECC. 2) Introduce a new automated solution to determine the load classes by leveraging synchrophasor data and machine learning techniques.

Reliability of GaN HEMT is an important issue for its commercial deployment. Online prognosis of this transistor ensures robust reliability for mission critical applications. Online prognosis requires identification of fault precursors which shows sensitivity to degradation. Although gate threshold voltage and gate leakage current are identified as fault precursors, Extraction methods of these parameters are offline. In this paper, on-state resistance (R-DS,R-ON) is investigated as an online fault precursor for GaN HEMT. Temperature variation during its operation results in irreversible damage to GaN HEMT. Adaptive thermal network based temperature estimation method using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is also proposed. A sequential Monte-Carlo simulation based data driven remaining useful life (RUL) estimation method is also proposed which can be applicable for schedule maintenance before breakdown. Experimental validation of these proposed methods have been presented.

To build the prediction or detection techniques of the fault, a fault analysis should be carried out. Generally, most faults are analyzed by a method using negative-sequence components obtained from symmetrical coordinate transformation. However, the method is complex and required many parameters. Therefore, this study proposes a simplified d-q equivalent circuit model of permanent magnet synchronous motor with an inter-turn fault. By already reflecting the negative-sequence components in d-q direct quadrate current equations derived from finite-element method in advance of a final model construction, the simplified model does not require the separation of positive and negative sequence components. As a result, the model can rapidly examine the influence of the fault due to its simplicity and fast response. The model is verified by numerical analysis, simulation, and experiment.

The method is based on the relationship between the zero sequence voltage components (ZSVC), the stator currents and the resistance deviation of each phase winding. In the proposed method, the HRC fault detection, fault severity estimation and the identification of the faulty phases are achieved by the calculated resistance deviations. To validate the proposed method, the simulation is performed in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The results show that the proposed method has high sensitivity to the HRC fault, high accuracy estimation of fault severity and good ability to identify the faulty phases.

This work simulates the stresses developed in a damaged rotor cage during different transient profiles and for different sizes of the imperfection. A combined model featuring electrical, thermal and mechanical stages as well as three different meshes reflecting a progressing narrowing of one of the bars in its junction to the end ring are used for this purpose. The results qualitatively agree with a previously presented fatigue test and show that under severe conditions the capability of aluminum to absorb stress is limited, and a state of plastic deformation is rapidly reached. The effect of a possible mitigation strategy is also studied.

The analysis of this quantity can be employed, in some cases, as a supportive tool to complement the diagnosis provided by other quantities. In other cases, when no other motor quantities are available, stray flux analysis can become one of the few alternatives to evaluate the motor condition. Its non-invasive nature, low cost and easy implementation makes it a very interesting option that requires further investigation. On the other hand, the analysis of transient quantities has been proven to be very useful for overcoming certain deficiencies of the classical steady-state-based methods while providing a reliable diagnosis of some failures. The basic idea of the transient analysis is to detect 'patterns' or 'signatures' caused by the transient evolutions of fault components by means of applying sophisticated signal processing tools. The aim of this work is to evaluate the suitability of the stray flux analysis during the startup transient as a way to detect certain faults in induction motors (broken rotor bars and eccentricities), even when these faults coexist in the motor. To this end, advanced signal processing tools will be applied. Several positions of the flux sensors are considered in this study. Also, for the first time, a fault indicator based on startup stray flux analysis is introduced and its sensitivity is compared versus other indicators relying on other quantities. It must be emphasized that, since the capture of the transient and steady-state flux signals can be carried out in the same measurement, the application of the approach presented in this work is straightforward and its derived information may become crucial for the diagnosis of some faults.

When an inter-turn short circuit (ISC) occurs, a particular disturbance affects the motor. The proposed method estimates this disturbance using an observer; this estimated signal is used to obtain the short circuit ratio. The observers are based on a dynamic model of an IPMSM under ISC. The proposed technique has several advantages. The observer estimates the ISC disturbances even if multiple phases have ISCs. Torque recovery under ISC is possible with the proposed method. In addition, short circuit ratio is estimated separately for each phase, which makes it more flexible than other conventional methods such as sequence components analysis.

In order to early diagnose motor faults, the classical condition monitoring method focusing on stator current spectrum is well researched and presented. There are already some review papers related to traditional current monitoring method. However, when it comes to the stray flux detection, almost no researchers did a general review on this topic. This paper mainly presents the review of stray flux detection of induction machine. The development and application of stray flux detection method are detailed presented. Comparison with stator current detection is presented aiming at stator insulation failure, bearing fault, eccentricity and broken rotor bar/end-ring. Although stray flux method is used mostly for induction machine, its potential application in PMSM will be included as well.

This paper proposed a finite state machine (FSM) model for automatic action segmentation and recognition solution, based on pose streams in the form of skeleton joint data provided by Kinect. With the action recognition problem reframed as a state identification problem, the key solution to state identification hinges on detection of changing events, which signify the start of new action and the recognition of the underlying action. In that regard, a decision tree is constructed to detect these events based on the spatial positions and the changes of the skeleton data. In addition, to identify the current state or equivalently the action of a detected person, a fault observer is derived from the modeled action FSM. The fault observer does not only identify the initial state of action when the recognition process starts, but also serve the purpose of error recovery when the system loses track of ongoing events at times of intermittent sensor faults. Additionally, an AutoCorrect mechanism is presented to further enhance the accuracy of action recognition. To evaluate the proposed approach, an experiment with 300 participating subjects has been conducted for a total of 900 test sequences. The 98.63% correct identification result ensures the proposed approach a promising solution to constant action monitoring solution.

Instead of taking a look at the current and control signals directly, this paper studies the impact caused by the basic inner structure on the inductances and their frequency components. Modified winding function and equivalent air-gap length are computed such that the combinations of internal faults can be accommodated. Static and dynamic eccentricity reshape the air-gap in a direct manner, while saturation brings third order harmonics, which instead can be equivalently considered as the effect caused by the fluctuation of air-gap length. Thus eccentricity faults and saturation have combined impacts on the equivalent air-gap length. Modified winding function accounting for all space harmonics simplifies the computation of inductances, and is also adequate for the case with rotor asymmetry. By extracting frequency components, different internal fault features are revealed. ANSYS/Maxwell is employed to simulate different cases to verify the theoretical analysis.

In this work, a machine learning classification approach to improve the detection of symmetrical faults during power swing conditions in conventional distance relays is presented. The approach is intended to augment existing power swing blocking methods and trains a classifier with a focus on accuracy and interpretability. The contribution of the approach is the training of classifiers that maintain performance of other methods, while providing interpretable results. Training and test data is generated from time-domain simulations of the IEEE 9-Bus system for 17 280 scenarios. The following classifiers are compared and evaluated: support vector machine, random forest, gradient tree boosting, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors. Utilizing mutual information for feature selection and only local measurements, our results show performance comparable to prior methods and provides the ability to view the decision boundary for greater understanding of the classifier output. Trade-offs between interpretability and performance are also assessed.

Our main interest lies with the effectiveness of a secondary protection system, in which diagnosis plays a key role in enabling reliable and timely recovery from misoperations in the conventional primary protection. The hybrid simulation involves both event driven and time driven dynamics with arrivals of transmission short-circuit faults as independent Poisson processes among transmission lines and the fault location uniformly distributed along the short-circuited line. This paper reports only on the dependability enhancement through the diagnosis scheme, which is measured by the probability of successful fault diagnosis by the secondary protection given that the primary protection has failed to diagnose the fault.

Since the use of this type of machine has been increasing, strategies for analysis and/or mitigation of this kind of fault must be developed. These strategies range from simulation or experimentation to detection, aiming analysis and machine repair, respectively. In this work, aiming the analysis, it proposes a suitable modeling for the machine, which takes into consideration issues like the harmonics involved in electrical AC machines under faulty conditions, switching of the converter supply and modifications in faulty winding parameters. The modeling has propitiated to obtain fault current behaviors that are impossible to measurements.

One of the important challenges in BLSG interturn fault diagnosis is to identify whether the load imbalance exists along with the fault. The multiple indicator approach proposed in this work, is found to be useful, especially at incipient stages of fault development. The fault indicators are derived from the analytic fault model of the BLSG, and the technique is found to work well for complex conditions when fault and load imbalances occur together. The results show the applicability of the method to accommodate varying operating conditions of the machine as well as different imbalances in load.

Traditionally, the coherency analysis is carried out offline, whereby the number of coherent groups of generators is determined in advance. We present an alternative real-time methodology for coherency detection based on modularity clustering of synchronization coefficient matrix. The proposed approach not only accomplishes real time coherency detection but also provides the network integrity indices (splitting, connectivity and modularity indices) for studying the dynamic behavior of the power system. Our methodology is simple, fast, and computationally attractive. A simulation case study on the IEEE 39 bus system consisting of 10 generators following a typical fault demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

In this method, the axial displacement signal is decomposed into a series of stable intrinsic mode functions by the EEMD algorithm firstly. Then, the phony mode components of the IMF are filtered and removed according to the correlation coefficient rule, and the entropy of the filtered IMF is calculate respectively and then be considered as the eigenvectors. Finally, the eigenvectors are put into the LIBSVM and BP neural network to carry out mode identification. At last, the feasibility, effectiveness and superiority of the above method are verified by experiments.

In the paper three numerical techniqueswere used: finite element analysis, signal analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN). The elaborated numerical model of faulty machine consists of field, circuit and motion equations. Voltage excited supply allowed to determine the torque waveform during start-up. The inter-turn short-circuit was treated as a galvanic connection between two points of the stator winding. The waveforms were calculated for different amounts of shorted-turns from 0 to 55. Due to the non-stationary waveforms a wavelet packet decomposition was used to perform an analysis of the torque. The obtained results of analysis were used as input vector for ANN. The response of the neural network was the number of shorted-turns in the stator winding. Special attention was paid to compare response of general regression neural network (GRNN) and multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP). Based on the results of the research, the efficiency of the developed algorithm can be inferred.

In the current era of connectivity, it is easier to get these devices connected to a standard monitoring station. Once the system is connected, OEMs can monitor the health of these devices remotely and take corrective actions by providing preventive maintenance thereby avoiding major unplanned downtime. In this article, we present an overall methodology of predicting failure of these devices well before customer experiences it. We use data-driven approach based on machine learning to predict failures in turn resulting in reduced machine downtime, improved customer satisfaction and cost savings for the OEMs. One of the use-case of predicting component failure of PHILIPS iXR system is explained in this article.

We present a novel AHE detection system, by first quantizing the blood pressure data into clinically accepted severity ranges and then identifying most frequently occurring blood pressure pattern among these which we call consensus motifs. We apply machine learning techniques (support vector machine) on these consensus motifs. The results show that the use of consensus motifs instead of raw time series data extends the predictability by 45 minutes beyond the 2 hours that is possible using only the raw data, yielding a significant improvement without compromising the clinical accuracy. The system has been implemented as part of a new framework called RASPRO (Rapid Summarization for Effective Prognosis) that we have developed for Wireless Remote Health Monitoring.

However, the highly technical nature of the state of the art techniques can be a major obstacle in their usability by health care professionals and thus, their adoption and actual practical benefit. In this paper we describe a software tool which focuses on the visualization of predictions made by a recently developed method which leverages data in the form of large scale electronic records for making diagnostic predictions. Guided by risk predictions, our tool allows the user to explore interactively different diagnostic trajectories, or display cumulative long term prognostics, in an intuitive and easily interpretable manner.

Transient and permanent faults occur often as a result of radiation in industrial environments. Accordingly, Fault-Tolerant (FT) FPGA-based NCSs are desired. In this paper, an NCS model is proposed composing of In-Loop and S2A architectures linked via an Ethernet switch. This architecture is used in shape detection machines with vision sensing requirements. FT techniques are applied in the controller nodes of the system along with Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) for FPGA-based controller recovery. The reliability of the system due to changes in both the recovery rate and the conditional probability of failure occurrence (either transient or permanent), is presented in this paper. Accordingly, a Markov model is constructed for reliability calculations. A case study is used to illustrate the use of such a model to choose appropriate maintenance strategies as well as a quantitative measure for the ability of the FT techniques to increase system reliability.

In this context, this paper describes a new intelligent approach to estimate the remaining useful life in complex systems. This approach is based on the combination of several intelligent techniques. This approach is based on Echo State Network (ESN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique to set the ESN with optimal parameters. The input of this model are the measurements of signals correlated to the component degradation state, whereas the model output is the component RUL. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, real life fault historical data from turbofan engines system were analyzed and used to obtain the optimal prediction of RUL.

The gene expression data has been widely used in disease diagnosis and deep learning approach has achieved great successes in this task. However, the deep learning approach may fail when the expression data for a particular tumor is insufficient for training an effective model. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning (MTDL) to overcome the aforementioned deficiency by leveraging the knowledge among multiple expression data of related cancers. MTDL learns local features from each task with some private neurons, and learns shared features for all tasks simultaneously with some shared neurons, and learns to inference for each task separately in the end layer. Since MTDL leverages the expression data of multiple cancers, it can learn more stable representation for each cancer even its expression profiles are inadequate. The experimental results show that MTDL significantly improves the performance of diagnosing each type of cancer when it jointly learns from the expression data of twelve cancer datasets.

The manufacturers and users of AMR systems are now keen to include diagnostic features in the systems to improve salability and reliability. However, traditional manual fault detection methods are time-consuming and inaccurate. automatic fast fault detection methods are urgently needed. In this paper, we propose several machine learning based fault detection models to meet this requirement. Furthermore, we use novel boosting strategy to fuse multiple models to leverage multi-aspect information in AMR systems. The experimental results on simulated data show that the proposed models are accurate and robust, and fusion strategy indeed improve the performance on fault detection.

External stray flux measurement based techniques have been effectively applied in a number of earlier studies for detection of various faults. In this paper a simple internal flux sensing observer coil (OC), located into stator slots, has been found to be more succinct in detection of stator inter turn and bearing faults which constitutes nearly 80% of induction motor faults. Tools like THD, third harmonic component, and FFT analysis have been successfully applied in detection of these faults. The OC technique has been found to be more simple and effective compared to external flux sensors and current sensors employed in detection of these faults. The present work using OC technique has been implemented on a 0.746-kW three-phase four-pole 415-V squirrel-cage induction motor. Faults were experimentally created from stator winding tapings brought out on external board, and using an outer race cracked bearing.

During its operation, an industrial process as a dynamic system evolves physically. This evolution can have an impact on the modes of operation: nominal, degraded or failure. The proposed approach is based on knowledge of the behavior model of the system. It deals with systems where available measurements are not able to provide information on the level of degradation reached by the system. Since the available data are not usable, and in order to generate indicator signals of degradation, the method based on the generation of residues by an observer was selected. Due to the model uncertainties and disturbances, the evolution of the characteristics of residues is not necessarily correlated with the evolution of the level of degradation. Therefore, the residues generated were exploited to model the degradation behavior. We selected a Hidden Markov Model or its multi-stream extension in the case of a stream of residuals. The proposed approach was conducted in two phases: a learning phase to model the degradation behavior and a prognosis phase to assess the level of degradation and estimate the Remaining Useful Life. To illustrate the approach, a simulated induction motor was used.

Research on fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control for power converters with MPC is insufficient. Accurate fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control solutions with easy implementation are very desirable. In this work we propose a novel current based fault diagnosis method of one-and two-phase open-circuit fault of machine-side converter in advanced back-to-back four-quadratic drive topologies, which is highly immunized from false alarm. The fault-tolerant control scheme can be easily embedded into normal MPC control algorithm. Simulation results validate the feasibility of proposed fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control methods.

This paper demonstrates the application of wireless sensor to measure the rotor field winding current in a Brushless Synchronous Generator and compare the fault detection capability with the stator exciter field current. The faults considered are the stator armature and rotor field winding inter-turn short circuit fault. From the experimental investigation, the rotor field current measurements obtained through a wireless sensor is found to be more effective in tracking the evolution of a fault.

Its reliability largely depends on the absence of failures in the power semiconductors. We propose and analyze a fault-diagnosis technique to identify shorted switches based on features generated through wavelet transform of the converter output and subsequent classification in support vector machines. The multi-class support vector machine is trained with multiple recordings of the output of each fault condition as well as the converter under normal operation. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method has high classification latency and high robustness. Except for the monitoring of the output, which is required for the converter control in any case, this method does not require additional module sensors.

This approach is based on two fundamental operators which are dilation and erosion. This type of filter does not need a huge computing time because the operations involved are simple. The goal of this filter in the application considered in this paper is to de-noise the spectrum of the stator current demanded by an induction motor in order to facilitate the self-extraction of occasional fault components. Furthermore, the induction motors are widely used under speed variation conditions, usually fed by an inverter. Experiments showed in this paper are convincing and suggest the possible extension of the method to a wide range of applications.

Failure detection in industrial electric motors through the use of infrared-based isothermal representation	IECON 2017 - 43RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	43rd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2017	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Ind Eect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Chinese Assoc Automat, Syst Engn Soc China, Chinese Power Supply Soc, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Electrotechn Soc, Beihang Univ Sch, Reliabil & Syst Engn, RMIT Univ, Beijing JiaoTong Univ, China Soc Ind & Appl Math, TaiPEA		induction motors; fault diagnosis; infrared thermography; isotherm; predictive maintenance	LARGE INDUCTION-MOTORS; THERMOGRAPHY; VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS	Infrared thermography is emerging as a very interesting complementary technology for the condition monitoring of industrial electric motors. The expertise acquired from the infrared inspections that have been carried out over years in electric installations and static machines has been recently applied to electric motors, proving the potential of this technique to detect several types of common anomalies in these machines. Recent works have shown that infrared thermography provides very useful information for the diagnosis of cooling system problems, deficient hearing lubrication, transmission system problems or stator winding asymmetries, among others. The progressive incorporation of the infrared technology in electric motors predictive maintenance programs conies together with the necessity of new methods that can make it possible to detect the anomalies in the infrared images or, at least, that make the interpretation of these images easier. In this context, this work presents a representation method based on the infrared images which relies on the study of the isotherms. The method makes it easier to display the temperature gradient, as well as to locate the source of the anomaly. The methodology referred to in this paper is used to detect several types of faults in field motors operating in a petrochemical plant and the results confirm the potential of the proposed method.

Data-driven methods are effective for feature extraction and feature analysis using statistical techniques. In the proposal, the Cumulated Sum (CUSUM) efficiency is explored for incipient fault detection. The fault is assumed to be a Gain variation, an Offset evolution, a Phase shifting or one of the multiple possible combination of such faults. A first preprocessing stage is proposed for this study and using some statistical other features we proceed to the operations of a Fault Detection and Diagnosis process : Detection, and Isolation. For the detection, the CUSUM efficiency is proved. For the isolation, we propose a specific algorithm based on the combination of several multivariate statistical techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The classification of each fault or one of their combination is accurately obtained. The results show that for incipient faults (< 10%), the fault detection and isolation is accurate with a relative classification error lower than 3%.

Due to the extensive participation of these machines in industry, there is an increasing demand of graduate engineering students with skills in this area. In spite of this fact, in many Universities, engineering programs did not include specific courses in this specific area. In recent years, there has been a certain increase in the offer of courses devoted to electric motors condition monitoring. Due to the constant research dynamism of this area, these courses should be prepared to incorporate the latest technological advances in order to instruct the students on the use of the most recent technologies. This paper presents several laboratory sessions that have been built in the context of a course dealing with the maintenance of electric motors. The sessions are designed to facilitate the student participation, promoting the collaborative work and facilitating the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs). At the same time, they are conceived to instruct the students with the most recent techniques for electric motors condition monitoring.

Two kinds of the signal injection methods are proposed to diagnose the HRC. In the proposed method, not only HRC fault can be detected, but also fault severity can be estimated and faulty phases can be identified. The simulation is carried out to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method has high sensitivity to the HRC fault, high accuracy estimation of fault severity and good ability to identify the faulty phases. In addition, the proposed method is immunity to symmetrical stator resistance variations and inter-turn fault.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a single fault diagnostic algorithm for multiple IGBTs open-circuit faults and current sensor faults in direct-driven wind turbines, based on permanent magnet synchronous generators with full-scale back-to-back converters. The proposed method is based on the currents residual generation and on a new adaptive threshold approach. This threshold is calculated from the measured currents and their corresponding reference signals that are already available from the main control system. The proposed diagnostic technique is applied to both generator-side and grid-side converters of a conventional back-to-back topology. Several simulations are presented, showing the algorithm reliability against false alarms under both multiple IGBTs and current sensor faults in the back-to-back converter.

This paper presents an online fault diagnostic algorithm for power converter faults in SRM drives based on high frequency voltage signal injection. Unlike the other methods that use additional sensors, this algorithm extracts the fault signatures from the fundamental current by injecting a high frequency voltage signal into the upper switches of asymmetric power converter. The typical four fault types of power transistors are analyzed by monitoring the frequency and amplitude variation of the extracted high frequency current signal. In addition, the variation in amplitude of the fundamental current with the occurrence of fault is also considered as fault signature. Simulations performed with three phase 12/8 SRM drive and results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic algorithm.

In this paper, the induction motor and vibration signal are taken as an example of the monitored industrial equipment and signal due to their wide use. The discrete wavelet transform and wavelet energy-moment are used for on-sensor machine fault feature extraction, while a minimum distance classifier is adopted for on-sensor fault classification. The data from three motor operating conditions-motor normal operating condition, bearing fault from the motor drive, and bearing fault from the motor fan-are employed to evaluate the proposed system. Experimental results show that compared with raw data transmission, the proposed method can reduce the payload data by more than 99%, and deliver 100% fault diagnosis accuracy on two test sets.

This paper presents a new self adaptive fault diagnosis system for different conditions of roller bearings using InfraRed Thermography (IRT). In the first stage of the proposed system, 2-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT) and Shannon entropy are applied respectively to decompose images and seek for the desired decomposition level of the approximation coefficients. After that, the histograms of selected coefficients are used as an input of the feature space selection method by using Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Nearest Neighbor (NN), for the purpose of selecting two salient features that can achieve the highest classification accuracy. The results have demonstrated that the proposed scheme can be employed effectively as an intelligent system for bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery.

In response to their importance, there is a growing body of research looking at condition monitoring of rolling element bearings to avoid machine breakdowns. In this study, by taking advantages of Compressive Sampling (CS), Laplacian Score (LS) and Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM), an intelligent method for rolling bearing fault classification is proposed. The CS is used to obtain compressed samples of the raw vibration signals, and the LS is used to rank the features of the obtained compressed samples with respect to their importance and correlations with the core fault characteristics. Then, based on LS ranking, we selected a small amount of the most significant compressed samples to produce the features vector. Finally, classification performance using MSVM shows high classification accuracy with a significantly reduced feature set.	[Ahmed, H. O. A.; Nandi, A.

The backstepping algorithm is employed to preserve a good control performance and to avoid different uncertainties in order to have good signals acquisition for the diagnosis process. The used technique for the fault detection is the discrete wavelet transforms which applied to analyze the stator phase current and the output signal of the speed regulator. Furthermore, the calculation of the energy stored in each decomposition can evaluate the effect of the fault. The controls of the induction motor and their diagnosis have been investigated experimentally using Matlab/Simulink environment with Real-Time interface based on the dSpace 1104.

This technique uses the belief functions framework to represent and merge the information about short circuits obtained from sensors placed around the machine to be diagnosed. The influence of the sensors positions around the machine to detect faults is studied. This fusion technique leads to a new diagnosis method, which only uses the information captured from the stray magnetic field around the machine, having then the advantage of being noninvasive. Six external flux sensors placed on a belt fixed around the machine provide information used for the diagnostic technique. These signatures are obtained by experimental tests using a rewound induction machine that allows one to create inter-turn short circuit faults with different severity levels.

With the permanent magnet synchronous motor as object, based on fractional mathematical model and unscented kalman filter, establish the minor fault diagnosis method for current.

This paper proposes a particle filter-based prognostic approach for high-speed shaft bearing track degradation; this approach is validated by inspecting a real data from a wind turbine drivetrain. The particle filter-based prognostic results are compared with the standard support vector regression and Kalman smoother results. The particle filter method shows better results. For longer prediction times, the error of the proposed method is equal to or smaller than that of the regression method. The main improvement of the particle filter-based prognostic approach is its ability to produce a probabilistic result based on input parameters with uncertainties. The distributions of the input parameters propagate through the filter, and the remaining useful life is presented using a particle distribution.

The present work studies the performance and effectiveness of crack fault detection by means of applying wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on fault diagnosis of rotating shafts using multiscale entropy (MSE). After WPD and EMD, the most sensitive reconstruction vectors and intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are selected using Shannon entropy. Then, these feature vectors are fed into support vector machine (SVM) for fault classification, where the entropy features represent the complexity of vibration signals with different scales. Experimental results have demonstrated that WPD combined with MSE can achieve an accuracy of 97.3% for crack fault detection in rotating shafts, whilst EMD combined with MSE has shown a higher detection rate of 98.5%.

Generally, a high-performance mechanical characteristic tester has the ability to offer dozens of parameters consisting of stroke, speed, magnitude of current and so on. Besides, lots of new features have been proposed for specific needs. So choosing useful features from all the features above becomes an inevitable problem. However, most of the features extracted are focusing on fault diagnosis and rare attention has been paid to the health condition evaluation. Here, a new health status centered mechanical feature extraction framework is proposed. Firstly, a large-scale feature selection is carried out among 44 closing features based on monotonicity and consistency. Then the most sensitive ones are fed into a support vector regression(SVR) model for predicting the remaining useful life.

The method of fault diagnosis for HVCB based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and support vector machine is proposed to analyze faults accurately and quickly in high voltage circuit breakers, determining the characteristic and category of the fault. HVCB testing platform based on LabVIEW and acquisition equipment gain the signals of mechanical vibration. The model of fault diagnosis for HVCB is established by using support vector machine (SVM). The data are trained by SVM, thus the type of fault can be clearly determined. The method can obtain better diagnosis results, it is also suitable for fault diagnosis for HVCB.

Although many methods have been proposed, they either require extra sensing devices or suffer from high false alarm rates. In this work, we present a cost-effective hierarchical context aware method for string-level anomaly diagnosis in large-scale PV systems. The proposed approach is based on unsupervised machine learning techniques and requires no additional hardware support beyond widely adopted supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach are evaluated with a 40 MW PV system located in East China. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can support string-level anomaly diagnosis with high accuracy and provide sufficient lead time for daily maintenance.

Hence, repairs in repair shops become more and more complex and thereby time-consuming, where time to repair is a competitive factor. During repairs and servicing of vehicles in the independent aftermarket the data read-out using diagnostic testers is transferred back to a common back-end. This "Big Data" contains millions of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) and freeze frames, where DTCs point to potential fault causes and freeze frames describe the vehicle's condition when the DTC was stored, e.g. the current engine RPM. This paper proposes an approach to benefit from this "Big Data" in order to (a) acquire knowledge for the development of new vehicles and components and (b) to speed up the time for future fault analyses and repairs. The aim is to detect the vehicle operation modes where a specific fault code was previously not or rarely observed, referred to as novelty detection (anomaly detection). This can point to rare fault causes, which are likely to have a longer time to repair since they are not common. From the field of machine learning, one-class classifiers are applied in two setups: (1) one-class novelty detection, where the data items from all operation modes are combined to one training set and (2) multi-class novelty detection, where an individual classifier is trained for each operation mode. On real data it is shown that novelties can be successfully detected. While it was found that many faults predominantly occur while the vehicle is in a specific operation mode, e.g. when the engine is warm and is in idle, the most interesting novelties were faults when the engine was off or cold. It was found that the multi-class case is superior for the underlying problem using autoSVDD to yield the best results.

Unexpected bearing failures in such machines during field operation can lead to machine breakdown, which may have some pretty severe implications. However, the insufficiency of labeled samples is major problem for handling fault diagnosis problem. To address such concern, we propose a semi-supervised method for diagnosing faulty bearings by utilizing unlabeled samples. The superiority of our algorithm has been validated by comparison with other state-of art methods based on a rolling element bearing data.

The model utilizes the survey data that was recorded by the University of Innsbruck, Austria, collected during a study that was related to lung operation and diseases of the respiratory tracts. The model performs feature transformation and feature selection to identify significance of Asthma indicators which shall be treated as Asthma severity indicators. The dataset is pre-processed by standardizing data using normalizing techniques. The impact of pre-processing is verified by performing prediction of likely outcome of Asthma in subjects with the identified severity indicators. The Predictive performance of the model is analyzed by applying KNN classifier and Support Vector Machine techniques which yield considerably good results in terms of performance metrics like Precision, Recall and F-Measure.

Selecting Appropriate Machine Learning Classifiers for DGA Diagnosis	2017 IEEE CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL INSULATION AND DIELECTRIC PHENOMENON (CEIDP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomenon (CEIDP)	OCT 22-25, 2017	Fort Worth, TX	IEEE, IEEE Dielectr & Elect Insulat Soc			DISSOLVED-GAS ANALYSIS	Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a common method of assessing transformer health. There are a number of machine learning classifiers reported to give a high accuracy on specific datasets, such as Artificial Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. When these methods reach the same conclusion about the type of fault present, this can give an increased confidence in the veracity of the diagnosis. However, it is critical to analyze and quantify the strength of these classifiers in the presence of conflicting data to test their practicality for usage in the field. This paper investigates the adequacy of different machine learning based DGA diagnosis models in the presence of conflicting data. The proposed method will aid engineers with the selection of machine learning models so as to maximize the usability and accuracy in the presence of conflicting data.

Internal fault of transformer will cause serious damage to the operation of power system. At present, threshold judgment is the main method of the dissolved gas analysis (DGA) which can be applied to the diagnosis of transformer internal fault. But this method has some disadvantages such as lacking of pertinence and low accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposed a method which can recognize the dissolved gas abnormality based on high dimensional support vector machine. Taking the historical DGA online monitoring data of one transformer as characteristic dataset and the characteristic dataset be divided to training set and testing set for classification and prediction. This paper uses the principle of support vector machine to select the kernel function and use the method of cross validation to select the best parameters. According to the selected kernel function and best parameters, the whole training set is trained to obtain the support vector model, which is the smallest sphere that contains all support vectors. The obtained model is used to identify the abnormal dissolved gas, the data within the sphere are normal, otherwise are abnormal. In this paper, the method of recognize the dissolved gas abnormality is proposed, and the model is established by selecting kernel function and parameters. And the method is verified by field data as well. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it into DGA online monitoring. From the results, we can conclude that the proposed approach can significantly improve the accuracy of abnormal recognition, which means the great value of this method.

Thus, it requires a major periodical revision, because any fault during the operation can be catastrophic. A critical fault is the Broken Rotor Bar, which starts very small and increases until breaks the bar. Thereby, the machine, which has a defect of this type, will increase the possibility to develop others faults that contribute to a rapid and dramatic decrease in its structural integrity.

Reassignment technique for detection of broken rotor bar fault in induction motors	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL AUTUMN MEETING ON POWER, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTING (ROPEC)	IEEE International Meeting Autumn Meeting on Power Electronics and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Ixtapa, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE CENTRO OCCIDENTE SECT		induction motor; monitoring system; signal processing	MACHINES	Motor Current signature analysis (MCSA) is a proven method for fault detection in induction motors. Usually, it is used classical techniques based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or its extensions for MCSA. However, these techniques have disadvantages such as limitations in frequency resolution or time resolution, so it is difficult to know when a frequency component occurs, which is relevant for the study of non-stationary signals in the frequency domain. The present work presents the reassignment technique for the detection of broken rotor bar in induction motors fed with the line during the startup transient, which is tested with real signals, then the results are compared to the classic Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT); where it is obtained better resolution in time and frequency with the technique proposed compared with STFT, making possible to detect clearly when appear a frequency component related with the broken rotor bar fault.

Homogeneity-based approach for bearing fault detection in induction motors by means of vibrations	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL AUTUMN MEETING ON POWER, ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTING (ROPEC)	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power Electronics and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Autumn Meeting on Power, Electronics and Computing (ROPEC)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Ixtapa, MEXICO	IEEE, IEEE CENTRO OCCIDENTE SECT		Induction motors; bearing fault; vibration signal analysis; homogeneity analysis	DIAGNOSIS	Electrical machines, in particular induction motors (IM), are important parts in an industrial plant, representing an 89% of power consumption. Bearings are important parts of the induction motors and one of the principal causes of their malfunction; hence, bearing fault early detection is very important, however its detection is a challenging because the measured signals are acquired in noisy conditions and have transient characteristics. Hence, a system to detect the potential faults into bearings of rotatory machinery in their early stage can have a potential benefit in industry. In this work, a novel proposal that makes use of the homogeneity (HO) algorithm for the bearing defect, in particular the outer race (OBD), detection is presented. The HO method is introduced for the first time to detect the changes produced in the normal regime (steady-state) vibration signals of an IM by the OBD. These signals can contain subtle modifications on motor dynamic features due to the fault presence. The presented results show the proposed methodology is capable of distinguishing between a motor with OBD and a healthy motor with a high efficiency.

Based on this model, an observer is formed for ISC diagnostics and torque compensation. The IPMSM model under ISC is presented as the model of a healthy machine, but with a disturbance given by the ratio between shorted and total turns times the current flowing in the failure path. The disturbance, defined as the fault index current (FIC), is estimated using an observer. The method is tested in Matlab/Simulink and corroborated with finite element analysis (FEA). The proposed technique provides the ability to identify the FIC for early ISC diagnostics. Furthermore, it also provides flux linkage estimation and torque performance compensation under ISC conditions.

This paper presents and investigates a new direct phase-gain re-balancing methodology, especially suited for interior permanent magnet machine (IPM) drives mostly operating at low speed-ranges including standstill. The proposed model-based approach utilizes high-frequency signal-injection (HFI) to facilitate fast and persistent sensor monitoring for any operating state of the drive. No additional sensing hardware is required. Extraction of the HFI-phase-current response enables detection and immediate compensation of sensor gain-faults.

The procedure for conducting such inspections requires marking of the damaged components on a standardized inspection sheet which is then camera scanned. These sheets are marked for different faults in corresponding machine zones using hand-drawn arrows and text. As a result, the reading environment is highly unstructured and requires a domain expert while extracting the manually marked information. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to build an information extraction system for such machine inspection sheets, utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision techniques. The pipeline proceeds in the following stages: (1) localization of different zones of the machine, arrows and text using a combination of template matching, deep learning and connected components, and (2) mapping the machine zone to the corresponding arrow head and the text segment to the arrow tail, followed by pairing them to get the correct damage code for each zone. Experiments were performed on a dataset collected from an anonymous real world manufacturing unit. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and we also report the accuracy for each step in the pipeline.

An efficient method of feature extraction of the vibration signal usually pays a key role in the validity of the fault diagnosis and also lays the foundation for the fault classification in the subsequent stage. The paper presented a feature extraction method which is based on average empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and GP algorithm. The EEMD algorithm is used to decompose the non-stationary signal into several the conqueror functions (IMFs). However, the first four orders usually have great influence on the classification of signal, so we select the first four orders to calculate the correlation dimension. Finally, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) is used to classify different types of fault signals after decomposing (EEMD) and calculating correlation dimension. The test indicates that the represented method have a high recognition rate. To a certain extent, the method is likely to provide a new method for fault diagnosis.

In order to improve safety and reliability of power system, studies about fault diagnosis of high-voltage circuit breaker are needed, especially for mechanical fault. In the study field of mechanical fault diagnosis of HV circuit breaker, the diagnosis process includes three steps: signal acquisition, feature extraction and fault identification. The methods of Fault identification mainly can be divided as three aspects, it is model identification, signal identification and knowledge identification. In this article, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is used for feature extraction, then the EEMD-characteristic entropy can be obtained. However, the frequency of the mechanical action of high-voltage circuit breaker is very few, the experimental data about EEMD-characteristic entropy is precious and highly depends on the existing samples. For classification issues, in this study, radial basis function (RBF) neural network which act as a recognition tool were used to fault diagnosis. The whole process of this research included: signal acquisition, feature extraction, fault diagnosis.

In this paper, we develop an actuator FDD scheme for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems based on extreme learning machine (ELM). In ELM, all parameters of hidden layer nodes need not be adjusted during learning, which may simply be assigned with random values, and the output weights only need to be adjusted. Within this scheme, two ELMs are employed to learn the unknown system function and unknown fault function. Firstly, a stable adaptive observer is designed to monitor faults in an online manner. Secondly, adaptive threshold is designed to make the fault detection, and deviation between the actual and the estimated system is known as residual. If the residual exceeds threshold at finite time denotes a fault occurrence. Different from the existing schemes, online computational efficiency and learning speed are improved considerably because ELM is introduced in this FDD scheme. Finally, a single-link robotic arm will be employed in simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDD scheme.

To solve the problem, a new method was presented here, which was based on the Local Mean Decomposition (LMD) and wavelet de-noising. The LMD was used to decompose the original signal of the bearing into serval PF components which were retained using the principle of maximum kurtosis and cross-correlation coefficients to keep only the reasonable ones. Compared to the traditional PF component selection process, our new method captured more fault impulse features in the selected PF components. For these retained PF components were first de-noised by a db10 wavelet of 5 layers, and then were used to reconstruct the high frequency signal of each component layer by the method of superposition. Finally, the envelope spectrum analysis was applied to the derived the spectral kurtosis to give the result of rolling bearing fault diagnosis. A test experiment was conducted with our bearing fault simulation platform.

The candidate reducts which could be used to build the base classifiers were found by applying a genetic algorithm for feature reduction on the decision table, and then the other genetic algorithm for diversity evaluation was used to search an optimal ensemble of base classifiers. Based on the results above and the improved weighted voting strategy, the final classifier ensemble for fault recognition could be set up. It was proved by the diagnosis experiment including normal condition, inner race fault, outer race fault and rolling element fault of SKF 6203 bearings that the method proposed in this paper was valid due to the satisfactory accuracy of classification.

This paper shows that support vector machine (SVM) is extremely useful in detecting fault information in modern complex industrial processes. With a pilot plant of Continuous Stirred Tank Heater (CSTH) process, the SVM method with radial basis function (RBF) kernels is tested on the CSTH database and compared with an improved Partial Least Squares (IPLS) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The performance of SVM is validated using k-fold cross-validation where the classifier based on SVM outperforms those based on PCA and IPLS. These comparisons show that SVM has remarkable detection performance and satisfying elapsed time. From an industrial point of view, the vitality of SVM algorithm in actual industrial process is discussed.

The abnormal status is harmful to the operation of maglev train. It is necessary to detect the abnormity timely. Generally, the operation data of train is recorded online, but it is analyzed by experts off-line, the efficiency of this approach is very low. So, an efficient and accurate method is urgently demanded. There are 120 levitation sensors in a carriage, which measure the levitation states with nearly 40khz sampling frequency. In tradition, the information of sensors is just used as the feedback of suspension controllers. This paper will study how to use these information for detecting the abnormal status of suspension system by using support vertical machine (SVM). Firstly, some reasonable features originate from experience are extracted from levitation sensors. Secondly, considering that the fault rate is very low, resulting in less fault samples. So, the SVM method is introduced. At last, the raised machine learning model is applied in the practical usage on maglev train by using the programming in the Digital signal processor (DSP) controller. By this method, the existing abnormal status of suspension system can be diagnosed in real-time. The experiment results show that this algorithm can achieve the detection accuracy of 91.3%.

Signal processing is essentially needed to process and analyse signal but it is difficult to process and analyse the noisy signal. In many cases the noise signal is even stronger than the actual vibration signal, so it is important to have some mechanism in which noise elimination can be effectively done without affecting the actual vibration signal. This mechanism is termed as de-noising of the signal, in this research an Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) based de-noising method followed by either discrete wavelet transform or Fourier transform along with their conventional thresholding methods are used to evaluate their effectiveness. It is applied on Raw and TSA form of the vibration signal.

In this paper, Hilbert-Huang transform (HRT) is introduced to SRM fault feature extraction method to solve the problems aforesaid. Firstly, Empirical Mode Decomposition(EMD) is utilized to decompose the bus current of the faulted motor into several simple Intrinsic Mode Function(IMF) to resolve the problem of unsteady characteristics of complex fault signals. Secondly, primary IMF components are selected to form the matrix of initial parameters to calculate both the energy of singular values and the parameters of energy entropy of the matrix, which is used as a feature vector. Finally, multi-classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) are used to identify the extracted small-sample fault feature vector for classification. After verification by simulation, this method can effectively reduce the complexity of the fault signals, redundant data of faults and increase the accuracy rate of fault identification. Its application in SRM fault diagnosis has theoretical and practical value.

It requires not only the real-time and accuracy of the diagnosis, but also demands maintenance according to the needed. In view of this problem, a fault diagnosis method based on the classification framework is proposed in this paper. The warning level is determined in the method, and the next maintain is implemented based on warning level. When the level is 4, the maintenance is demanded to stop work immediately. If the level is 2-3, the machine continues to work, while the fault will be positioned through the intelligent algorithm of fault diagnosis. The method ensures the accuracy of fault diagnosis; at the same time it achieves the required maintenance as far as possible to reduce downtime. Then the work efficiency of machine tool is improved.

LncRNA expression profile has large number of dimensions and small number of samples. In the study of the cancer samples' expression profile, there are a mass of redundant lncRNAs which are unrelated to cancer classification. Selecting key lncRNAs which are closely related to the pathophysiology of cancer from massive lncRNAs, can not only find prognostic factors for survival in cancer patients, but also provide guidance for the target of the precise medical in the future and greatly reduce the cost of biological analysis. In this paper, a new key lncRNA prediction method based on BPSO and ELM is proposed, lncRNAs' combination optimization problem is transformed into a binary particle swarm optimization model. The classification accuracy of ELM is used as the evaluation criterion of feature selection in BPSO.

An approach for fractal feature extraction from vibratory signals of rolling bearings was studied in this paper. We judged the existence of an early-stage inner race defect by analyzing the trend-changing characteristics on all fractal feature parameters synthetically, determined the window time when the early-stage inner race defect occurs by means of the change points of maximum linearity-mean values on fractal characteristic curves, and made a final diagnosis decision by quantitatively evaluating symptom likelihood on the fractal feature parameters. The results from a case study based on the test-to-failure data showed that the propose approach in this paper is effective and of great application potential to early-stage health condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.

Adaptive Prognosis of Bearing Degradation Based on Wavelet Decomposition Assisted ARMA Model	PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 IEEE 2ND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, NETWORKING, ELECTRONIC AND AUTOMATION CONTROL CONFERENCE (ITNEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 2nd Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference (ITNEC)	DEC 15-17, 2017	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE PRESS		Bearing Diagnosis; Bearing Degradation Trend Prognosis; Wavelet Decomposition; ARMA Model; Recursive Least Square		This paper proposes a prognostic model using wavelet decomposition for noise cancellation in the measured vibrational signal of the bearing. An adaptive auto-regressive and moving-average (ARMA) with Recursive Least-Square (RLS) algorithm is implemented for root mean square (RMS) value of the vibrational signal of the bearing. The RLS updates the ARMA model coefficients based on the new signal available during the online monitoring to enhance prediction accuracy. In addition, the implementation of RLS does not require any knowledge of the ARMA model coefficients. This advantage of the model eases the computation of the ARMA model coefficients in comparison with the old method, the Yule-Walker equation. To demonstrate the applicability of this adaptive model, we tested the proposed model using the experimental data of degradation trend of the bearing. The maximum absolute error (MAE) is 0.56 of the RMS value with a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0013 and a mean average percentage error (MAPE) of 1.03%. The error can be further reduced by increasing the iteration of the RLS algorithm to converge to the steady state error.

In this paper, we address bearing fault detection of motors with detection coils and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). Firstly, a detection scheme is proposed, where 8 pre-fixed coils sense the rotor displacements. Then, the serially connected coil pairs are processed with infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Lastly, a LSSVM based algorithm is proposed to detect bearing faults. Experiments are carried out with an oil pump. The results convince the validity of the proposed approach.

However, traditional mathematical and statistical modeling based approaches are difficult to design and they adapt poorly to the ever changing operating and environmental conditions in real-world industries. With recent developments in computational technologies, data storage, and industrial automation recording and storage of large amounts of historical plant data from embedded sensors and maintenance records have become easy. Availability of large data sets together with advancements in data driven machine learning algorithms has been the key driver for prognostic and diagnostic research in the industry as well as by academia. Nevertheless, developing generalized machine learning algorithms for the prognostic domain has been challenging due to the very nature of the problem. This paper describes some of these challenges and proposes a modified regression kernel that can be used by support vector regression (SVR) for prognostic problems. The method is tested on a simplified simulated time-series data set that is modeled to represent the challenges presented.

These limits are imposed by customers and typically assumed to be a single target value, however, for some products, it is more reasonable to target a range of values. Under this assumption we propose a multi-stage approach for mapping operating conditions to product quality classes. We use principal component analysis (PCA) and a pattern mining algorithm to reduce dimensionality and identify predictive patterns in time series of operating conditions in order to improve the performance of the classifier. We apply this approach to an industrial machining process and obtain significant improvements over models trained using features based on the last value of each process variable.

The industry faces the challenges to collect history data that include all type of failures. To overcome the limitation of conventional diagnosis approaches, which misclassify new types of faults into existing categories from training, the unsupervised Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the semi supervised GMM diagnosis frameworks are presented in this paper for effective detection on new fault categories. For the unsupervised GMM framework, the component number is known and the hard assignment is applied to classify the new types of faults. For the semi-supervised GMM framework, the component number can be auto selected, and the soft assignment is able to first detect whether new types of faults occur and further categorize them in detail via the GMM update. The effectiveness of the two fault diagnosis frameworks is testified on an industrial fault simulator of rotary machine. Compared with existing hard clustering approaches, the semi-supervised GMM framework is able to achieve an average diagnosis accuracy of 99.3% without new fault categories and it can also classify new fault categories with diagnosis accuracy of 94.0%.

The main goal is to explore interesting information regarding the diagnosis and prediction of electrical machines failures by the use of a Bayesian graphical model. This paper has shown the applicability of BN in fault prediction on an electrical asynchronous machine. The graphical structure of the BN was built based on the available knowledge about the system's behaviour, the degradation mechanisms, the functional decomposition and the links between the system's components. After defining the parameters and the structure of the Bayesian network (BN), the inference has allowed to obtain the probability of failure. With the developed Bayesian model, the prediction of induction motor failure has become possible with high precision. The Bayesian model, that has been used, takes into account both internal and external causes of induction motors faults. A census of causes was carried out on induction motors park at the SONATRACH / SKIKDA / GL1K / LNG plant. By the end of this paper and before giving some conclusions, a case study of an induction motor is presented.

The mining industry is not an exception; many electric motors operating in mining facilities are critical machines and their unexpected failures may imply significant losses and can be hazardous for the users. Due to these facts, an increasing research effort has been dedicated to investigate on new techniques that are able to provide a reliable diagnostic of the motor condition. Over recent years, monitoring of electrical quantities (e.g. motor currents) has emerged as a very attractive option for determining the health of several motor parts (rotor, eccentricities, bearings) due to its very interesting advantages: possibility of remote motor monitoring, non-invasive nature, simple application, broad fault coverage... The traditional methods based on analysis of motor currents during steady-state operation (MCSA) are being complemented, when not replaced, by modern approaches relying on transient analysis (ATCSA). This work presents several case studies referred to large motors operating in mining facilities. The combined application of both previous methods enables to reach reliable diagnoses of some parts of the motor, such as the rotor. The paper includes some controversial cases, where the classical methods failed due to the variable nature of the driven loads.

Previous studies indicated that the fluctuating torque leads to a multicomponent modulation in stator current. So the motor current signature analysis can realize the non-invasive and remote diagnosis of gear faults. Instead of using the traditional methods which decompose a signal based on the frequency, this paper puts forward a gear fault diagnosis method using resonance-based sparse signal decomposition which distinguishes the signals by their oscillation property to extract fault features in motor current. Firstly, the stator current is amplitude demodulated using envelope analysis to eliminate the effect of current fundamental wave. Then, the demodulated signal is nonlinearly decomposed into a high and a low oscillatory component by the resonance-based sparse signal decomposition method. Finally, envelope spectrum analysis is carried out with the low-oscillatory component to extract fault features. The proposed method is verified on the gear fault diagnosis platform. And its effectiveness over the traditional discrete wavelet transform is also shown.

In this paper, an extensive literature review is conducted for condition monitoring techniques for induction motors. Various state-of-art techniques are presented and summarized under three categories: 1) signature extraction based approach, 2) model-based approach, and 3) knowledge-based approach. Advantages and drawbacks of several commonly used methods are demonstrated. Although research has been conducted in this area for several decades, condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of induction motors remains an active research area, especially recent emerging transition from traditional techniques to knowledge-based approach using artificial intelligent, which opens a pathway to an exciting new research direction.

Spindle common fault is divided into the spindle system is not balanced, the spindle system is not right, the spindle system has a transverse crack and the spindle system rolling bearing failure. The characteristic amount of the machining surface is extracted by CCD laser speckle surface roughness measurement technique. Machine fault information and rough surface relationship were established through the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), to achieve the machine tool spindle fault diagnosis. The results indicate that the roughness characteristic can accurately diagnose the machine tool spindle fault and can be an effective method to study the spindle fault of the machine tool.

These motors are sensitive to different kinds of faults. When one of this faults occur in the induction motor then the motor has to be stopped for maintenance schedule. The cost of this maintenance schedule can be expensive and hence it is necessary to improve fault diagnostic methods. In online condition monitoring involves in monitoring the condition of the motor during operation and detect the faults which will reduce unexpected maintenance costs. In this paper a simulink model of induction motor is developed using Fuzzy logic controller to analyze the performance for short circuit, open circuit, overvoltage.

However vibrations are merely symptoms of good or bad mechanical behaviour. Today these symptoms are used to detect solve many mechanical problems in rotating machines. These machines play the most important role in any industry. Faults results in motor failure causing breakdown and great loss of production due to shutdown of industry. This in turn increases the running cost of machine with reduction in efficiency. Therefore, early detection of fault with diagnosis of its root cause is needed. This project is an approach for fault detection of rotating machine using orbit analysis of shaft and image processing. Several works have been focused on detecting early mechanical and electrical faults before damage appears in the motor. All the techniques are very effective their way. In this project, a new methodology is proposed for identifying if there is a fault in motor. Through image processing based on orbital analysis, different faults will be studied, generating characteristically different patterns that are used for fault detection.

The lifetime of these batteries will vary depending on their thermal environment and how they are charged and discharged. To optimal utilization of a battery over its lifetime requires characterization of its performance degradation under different storage and cycling conditions. Aging tests were conducted on commercial graphite/nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) Li-ion cells. A general lifetime prognostic model framework is applied to model changes in capacity and resistance as the battery degrades. Across 9 aging test conditions from 0 degrees C to 55 degrees C, the model predicts capacity fade with 1.4% RMS error and resistance growth with 15% RMS error. The model, recast in state variable form with 8 states representing separate fade mechanisms, is used to extrapolate lifetime for example applications of the energy storage system integrated with renewable photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Uncertainty quantification and further validation are needed.

One challenge in reducing battery pack cost is to reduce pack size without compromising pack service performance and lifespan. Prognostic life model can be a powerful tool to handle the state of health (SOH) estimate and enable active life balancing strategy to reduce cell imbalance and extend pack life. This work proposed a life model using both empirical and physical-based approaches. The life model described the compounding effect of different degradations on the entire cell with an empirical model. Then its lower-level submodels considered the complex physical links between testing statistics (state of charge level, Crate level, duty cycles, etc.) and the degradation reaction rates with respect to specific aging mechanisms. The hybrid approach made the life model generic, robust and stable regardless of battery chemistry and application usage. The model was validated with a custom pack with both passive and active balancing systems implemented, which created four different aging paths in the pack. The life model successfully captured the aging trajectories of all four paths. The life model prediction errors on capacity fade and resistance growth were within +/- 3% and +/- 5% of the experiment measurements.

Working in environment with high temperature, high pressure and strong impact, it is prone to cracks, wearing and other failures. These failures will lead to the problems such as jamming and slow shooting, seriously affecting the reliability and combat effectiveness of the Gatling gun. In this paper, according to the nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics of the tested vibration signals of the automatic mechanism of Gatling gun, a fault feature extraction method based on second generation wavelet is proposed. Firstly, the second generation wavelet transform is carried out on the vibration signal. Then, the singular entropy and energy entropy of the second generation wavelet coefficients are extracted. Finally, these entropy values are input to the probabilistic neural network as the eigenvector and the fault diagnosis of the automatic machine is realized. The experimental data show that, this method can effectively extract the sensitive fault features of the automatic mechanism of Gatling gun, and achieve a higher fault recognition rate, providing a new way for the early fault detection of the automatic mechanism of Gatling gun.

The most approaches in this field use Machine Learning methods to learn a robot behavior or skill. Besides, there are a few One-Shot PbD-approaches, which reduce the programming effort to a single demonstration and therefore allow a non-expert the quick and intuitive programming of a robot. However, a common drawback of One-Shot approaches is their decreased robustness during the program execution compared to Multi-Shot approaches. This leads to our main motivation: Making One-Shot PhD programs more robust. An important aspect of robustness is the ability to detect and handle unexpected events, e.g. a dropped object or a storage place, which should be free, but is already occupied. We call such events deviations. In our previous work we proposed an approach that provides the detection and isolation of deviations by a monitoring concept using entity-based resources. The advantages of this approach include a unified detection and complete classification principle. In this paper we evaluate our concept in a user study and give several insights to learned lessons to improve usability and comparability of our approach.

Deep learning based nonlinear principal component analysis for industrial process fault detection	2017 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	MAY 14-19, 2017	Anchorage, AK	Int Neurol Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Intel, BMI, Budapest Semester Cognit Sci			CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION	Principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA) are the state-of-art machine learning methods widely used in industrial process monitoring and fault detection field. However, these methods build shallow statistical models based on single layer of features and may not achieve the best monitoring performance. In order to sufficiently mine the intrinsic data features, a deep learning based nonlinear PCA method, referred to as deep PCA (DePCA), is proposed in this paper. Motivated by the idea of deep learning, a layer-wise statistical model structure is designed to extract multilayer data features, including both linear and nonlinear principal components. At each layer, two monitoring statistics are constructed to monitor the feature changes. For integrating the monitoring statistics of all feature layers, a Bayesian inference strategy is applied to convert the monitoring statistics into fault probabilities, which are weighted to form two probability-based comprehensive monitoring statistics for process fault detection.

The diagnostic system contains a data processing unit which aims to progressively generate discriminant features from the vibration signals for decision making. The decision making unit receives a few sets of labeled discriminant features in a chunk by chunk manner, incrementally learns the features-faults relations, dynamically diagnoses multiple bearing defects, and adaptively adjusts itself to learn new concept classes. This adaptive ensemble system is based on incremental learning of multiple extreme learning machines that are able to consult together and adjust themselves based on their confidence in the decision making. Extreme learning machines are used to construct the hybrid ensemble due to their good controllability and fast learning rate. Experimental results show the efficiency of the hybrid diagnostic system. The proposed diagnostic system is applied to diagnosing bearing defects in an induction motor.

Besides the explanation of the ELM model, an attempt is made to find theoretical hints of the excellent generalization capabilities of this model, based on the findings of Cover about dichotomies and the equivalence of Mean Squared Error minimization in the high-dimensional feature spaces induced by kernels, and spaces defined by a finite sample set. The field of application is a practical problem in the context of offshore petroleum exploration where sophisticated submersible motor pumps are extensively tested before being deployed. The work juxtaposes the performance of ELM to an existing statistically sound comparison of state of the art classifier methods for a hand-crafted feature model tailored specially to the spectra of the vibrational signals of the pump. The results suggest the remarkably good generalization capability of ELM, exhibiting the highest scores for the chosen F-measure performance criterion.

In this paper, we focus on the fault tolerance of SC with linear finite state machines (linear FSMs). We show that state assignment of FSMs considerably affects the fault tolerance of FSM-based SC circuits, and present a Markov model representing the impact of the state assignment on the behavior of faulty FSMs. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm for appropriate state assignment that can mitigate the influence of the transient faults. Experimental results show that the proposed state assignment can significantly reduce the influence of the faults.

Spindle common fault is divided into the spindle system is not balanced, the spindle system is not right, the spindle system has a transverse crack and the spindle system rolling bearing failure. The characteristic amount of the machining surface is extracted by CCD laser speckle surface roughness measurement technique. Machine fault information and rough surface relationship were established through the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system(ANFIS), to achieve the machine tool spindle fault diagnosis.

C	Zheng, XJ; Wu, HY; Chen, Y			IEEE	Zheng, Xiujuan; Wu, Huaiyu; Chen, Yang			Remaining useful life prediction of Lithium-ion battery using a hybrid model-based filtering and data-driven approach	2017 11TH ASIAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ASCC)	Asian Control Conference ASCC		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)	DEC 17-20, 2017	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA				PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; KALMAN FILTER; PROGNOSTICS; FRAMEWORK; CAPACITY; STATE; ENERGY	Lithium-ion battery has been widely used for industrial systems, however, its performance gradually deterioration with cycling is an inevitable problem. The main reason for unreliable remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is that the adaptability and accuracy of the physical degradation models are not fully considered. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm using a combination of model-based Kalman filtering (KF) and data-driven relevance vector machine (RVM) is proposed to track batteries' degradation trend. The data-driven RVM is employed to learn the capacity degradation trend and then predict multi-step future observation series, which are fed into KF as new observations. Also, since the RVM implements prediction through iterative calculation, its accumulative error is always being neglected. A weighting function is designed with the purpose of adjusting the updating step in KF in order to avoid over-dependency on either future observations or degradation model, which realizing a reasonable balance between system model and future observations. Simultaneously, considering the system dynamics may change during the prediction period, the modified Sage-Husa adaptive filtering algorithm is utilized to update the observation noise covariance dynamically. Finally, the feasibility and validation of the proposed method are examined using the batteries test data from NASA PCoE.

The fault diagnosis method proposed consists of two steps, first step is the preliminary diagnosis, the second step is the fault fusion. The preliminary diagnosis with two GA-SVM classifiers decreases the information dimension and improve the efficiency. The fault fusion based on D-S evidence theory reduces the conflict of the preliminary diagnosis faults. The voltage phasor and current phasor information are utilized together in the method, the diagnosis accuracy is improved by weakening the detection uncertainties. The method proposed applied in an actual power system in Hubei province in China. The practical results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the method.

Therefore, it is important to ensure the required quality of each individual electronic part through qualification testing specified using standards or user requirements. Qualification testing is time-consuming and comes at a substantial cost for product manufacturers. Many electronics manufacturers have access to large historical sets of qualification testing data from their products which may hold information to enable optimisation of the respective qualification procedures. In this paper, techniques from the domain of computational intelligence are applied. The development of data-driven models capable to forecast accurately and in-line the end result of a sequence of qualification tests is discussed and presented. Data-driven prognostics models are developed using test data of the electronic module by Neural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The performances of the models in predicting the qualification outcomes (pass or fail) are assessed.

This paper details a model-based approach, and associated machine learning algorithms, which can be used to achieve and maintain optimal product quality during production runs and to realise model predictive process control (MPC). The investigated data-driven prognostics based on state-space modelling of the dynamic behaviour of 3D inkjet printing for electronics manufacturing is new and makes it an original contribution. 3D printing of conductive lines for electronic circuits is a main targeted application, and is used to demonstrate and validate the prognostics capability of machine learning models developed from measured process data. The results show that, for moderately non-linear dynamics of the 3D-Printing process, state-space models can inform on the expected process trends (states) and related product quality characteristics even over large prediction horizons. The models can also support the realisation of model predictive process control for optimal target performance.

This paper analyses and develops an online approach to detecting winding and demagnetization faults in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMM) in a marine propulsion setting. The proposed methodology uses search coils to determine faults that reveals data to pinpoint which slot/magnet is affected by the faults, segregating fault symptoms from other asymmetric problems such as load imbalance and input unbalanced voltage. This paper is distinctive in its acute detection of faults even when the severity of the fault is very minimal. The proposed model used for simulation in two-dimensional (2-D) Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a 3-phase, 42 poles, 54 slots fractional slot concentrated wound, SPMM. In addition to the use of search coils, the proposed research looks into the torque profile with various conditions of fault and analyzes the machine current using Hilbert-Huang transform. The simulated results reveal potential for the proposed method to provide reliable data on fault diagnosis of marine propulsion motors.	[Ahsanullah, Kazi; Jeyasankar, Elango; Panda, S.

The final representation of the model can be decoupled in two modes: "Common Mode" and "Differential Mode" and it is the presented in its simplest form. From this faulty model a CV and operation equivalent circuits (EC) are determined. The model is fully simulated for transient and permanent regimens by means of MatLab code solving the ordinary differential equations (ODE). The steady state ECs were simulated in Simulink. Additionally, the sequence components admittances matrix and EC for the faulty IM was inferred for purposes of fault detection and identification (FDI). The effect of the fault severity factor and fault resistance are tested over the faulty leakage current, torque ripple pulsations and space vector current components. Finally, the torque vs slip characteristic curve were examined under input voltage and frequency variation to observe the loading effects on the faulty IM model.	[Berzoy, A.; Mohamed, A. A.

This lack of information implies serious obstructions in the evolution of applying motor current signature analysis as a complete and reliable condition monitoring technology. However, as previous research of the authors resulted in the construction of a unique test-bench where specific mechanical faults can be introduced into an 11kW induction machine with high reproducibility and accuracy, the relations between evolving mechanical faults and their reflections in the stator current can be investigated and quantified experimentally. Using this mechanical fault-emulator, experiments where conducted where the severity of a single point outer race bearing fault and its corresponding signature in the stator current's spectral fault-components are accurately analyzed. These evolving faulty components are trended and characterized, resulting in the desired quantification of the mechanical fault-severity. Based on these results, it is possible to inversely estimate the severity of single point outer race bearing problems by acquiring nothing more then the stator current time-functions.

This paper demonstrates an approach for detecting the existence of generalized-roughness conditions in operational generators. The method tracks the energy contained in the stator current. It has been tested in the laboratory using a 5kW, 480V synchronous generator. Generalized-roughness faults are produced in that setup by injecting shaft currents into the machine so that failures naturally develop during operation. An accelerated failure mechanism is described, and experimental results are presented.

Two main measurements are proposed to confirm or discard these electric faults: External Magnetic Flux Density (EMFD) and External Housing Vibrations (EHV). In the event of a short-circuit winding fault, a correlation between EMFD and EHV is confirmed. Furthermore, the electric power injection dependency is introduced in order to establish the validity range of this method. In this study, only non-invasive and on-line equipment are required to diagnose the SSGM. A diagnostic tool has been developed to show the viability of an operative wireless monitoring system in an industrial environment.

This is accomplished by scoring the unbalance in the current and voltage waveforms as well as in Park's Vector, both for current and voltage. To score the unbalance in the d-q space, a Principal Component Analysis is applied to Park's Vector and with the first two principal components the eccentricity is calculated, while the first principal component is used to determine the phase in short-circuit. The proposed strategy has been experimentally tested on a special 400-V, 50-Hz, 4-pole, 2.2-kW induction motor with reconfigurable stator windings in which it was possible to emulate different types of inter-turn short-circuits. The results are quite promising, even only using 1-kHz sampling frequency to acquire the current and voltage waveforms in the three phases, and the use of the Fast Fourier Transform is avoided. The developed solution may be used for tele-monitoring of the motor condition and to implement advanced predictive maintenance strategies.

In this paper, a novel estimation method for remaining useful lifetime of rotary machines using the vibration signal is introduced. The proposed method employs a linear dimension reduction for extracting a health indicator from wavelet packet transform of vibration signal picked by accelerometers. Then, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the machines failure probability. The proposed method is validated using PRONOSTIA benchmark dataset and the average accuracy of 92% is obtained.

The features in the current residual are analyzed with the consideration of model accuracy. The 2nd harmonic in the positive rotating dq reference or the dc component in the negative rotating dq reference can be extracted as the fault indicator. To estimate the dc component in the negative rotating reference that is more accurate and robust to transient states, a periodical integral is used in favor of conventional filtering or fast Fourier transform (FFT). It can be shown that the proposed fault detection scheme can distinguish the effect of speed or torque transient from the fault, thus giving a more reliable detecting result. The proposed technique is verified by simulation on a 12-slot, 14-pole SPMSM under various operating conditions.

The resultant phase current contains high frequency (HF) components, based on which, a new technique to detect turn fault is proposed. The machine model at high frequency is established and the HF current components are analyzed. A bandpass filter is used to extract the selected sideband components, and their root-mean-square (RMS) values are measured. The ratio of the RMS values in two adjacent phases are calculated. Both the individual ratio and the variance of 3 ratios are studied and testified to show the feasibility of detecting fault. Simulations have shown that both of them are valid fault indicator in ideal conditions while the variance is better in conditions with phase imbalance.

Often, to avoid excessive rotor losses due to open slots, magnetic wedges are used. During operation these magnetic wedges can get loose and brittles. With the accumulation of iron powder on the end windings (overhangs), it can lead to a total failure of the stator and the interruption of the process involving the machine with, sometimes, non-negligible system damage. Often, a detection of a missed magnetic wedges -before failure occurrence-is only possible by disassembling the machine, which is not conceivable in hermetic and sealed high speed centrifugal compressors outside maintenance cycles. A nonintrusive method would increase the reliability, reduce the risk of failure occurrence and anticipate the maintenance operation. In this paper we present a nonintrusive method to detect a missed or partially missed magnetic wedge. It consists on a ground-to-phase impedance measurement (magnitude and phase) and the analysis of the first resonant area in terms of magnitude extremums and passage of zero angle (argument). This analysis is performed on several faulty cases and results show a variation of the impedance behavior and a shift of the resonant area.

Generally, the fault significantly affects the negative-sequence components. However, the method using symmetrical sequences is complicate and requires many parameters. Therefore, this study proposes a simplified d-q equivalent circuit model of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor with the fault by already reflecting negative-sequence components in d-q current equations obtained by finite-element analysis. Because the simplified model does not need to distinguish positive and negative sequence components, it has a fast response speed. In particular, the detection techniques using motor current signature analysis, the proposed model can be usefully used. Due to these benefits, the proposed model help to develop the detect techniques and confirm the effect of the fault on motors, rapidly. The model is verified by numerical analysis, simulation, and experiment.

The proposed method applies artificial modulating signals, which are self-adapting to contain the estimated fault frequencies based on the real-time machine speed and torque, to the stator current feedback. However, these signals are not part of the closed loop and therefore do not interfere with the stator current's harmonics. When a fault occurs, there is a very slow component, or ideally DC, in the product resultant of modulating and current feedback signals. The proposed method identifies this very low-frequency fault-indicative signal component by checking the time between the experimental or simulation runtime and the instance of the last zero-crossing point of the resulting signal. Substantial simulation tests have been performed to detect air-gap eccentricity and broken rotor bar faults under different speed, torque and noise conditions to check the successful detection rate of the proposed method. Moreover, the method has been verified with a hybrid experiment, in which virtual fault signals are injected in a real motor drive system using dSPACE DS1104 platform.

The underlying purpose is to examine the feasibility of frame surface attached fibre optic sensing to be used for condition monitoring purposes, i.e. for recognition of signatures characteristic of healthy and/or faulty machine operating conditions. To this end an experimental study is reported that compares the fibre optic monitored circumferential strain signal spectral content with that of synchronously monitored frame acceleration and shaft torque signals on a laboratory induction machine operating with and without electrical fault. It is shown that the signature of electrical unbalance and fault, as well as that of mechanical effects on the shaft can be effectively recognised in the frame strain signal monitored by the fibre optic strain sensor.

Uniform Demagnetization Fault Diagnosis in Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors By Means of Cogging Torque Analysis	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES AND DRIVES CONFERENCE (IEMDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Electric Machines and Drives Conference (IEMDC)	MAY 20-24, 2017	Miami, FL	IEEE		Internal permanent magnet synchronous motor; uniform demagnetization fault; gyration radius; time-delay embedding; fault detection index; 2D-FE method	PREDICTION; MACHINES; STATE	A demagnetization fault in permanent magnet type motors is a common fault that can lead to deterioration of the machine performance, and would introduce secondary problems. Detection of this type of fault, and establishing diagnosis methods to detect such a fault, requires knowledge of a motor working principles and its structure. Moreover, a uniform demagnetization type of fault is extremely hard to detect, because it results-in no asymmetry in the output/terminal signals, and hence, motor current signal analysis (MCSA) methods fail to diagnose such faults. In this paper, internal permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) with two different rotor configurations are studied/simulated using a two-dimensional finite element (2D-FE) method, by means of which the cogging torque signal is computed under healthy and faulty conditions. Uniform demagnetization is studied and a proper fault diagnosis index is introduced which can successfully detect this type of fault.	[Nejadi-Koti, Hossein; Demerdash, Nabeel A.

In order to deal with these problems, a numerical simulation model is usually implemented. In fact, some companies use modelling and simulation technique for designing, developing and diagnosis their new product. This paper presents an accurate approach for modeling and simulating the SCIM, under nominal and degraded conditions, including BRB fault. The techniques used here are based on Stator Current envelopes Analysis (SCEA). The performance of the model was assessed by comparing the simulation and experimental results. The results shown in this paper approve the effectiveness of the model, and allow detection of these defects.

Research has proven that the dynamic model of an electrical motor under ISC can be modeled as a healthy machine affected by a disturbance current representing the effect of the ISC. This current is equal to the product of the shorted turns ratio and the current flowing in the failure path. This signal has been used extensively for fault diagnostics. Having an understanding of how this fault index current affects the model of the IPMSM allows generating observer-based techniques to extract information of the fault index current and flux linkage estimation. A dynamic model for an IPMSM under ISC in combination with a fault index current observer is implemented in Matlab/Simulink; this model is validated with finite element analysis. The fault index current and sequence components analysis is studied to match previous work from other research. This work aims to accomplish two goals. The first is to show the observer-based estimation being effective in estimating ISC condition for several phases simultaneously and improve torque performance. The second, provide insight into the fault index current for diagnostics and show it as a generalized version of sequence component analysis. These goals produce better diagnostics and improve the control of the motor under ISC.

Being able for the pilot to land the plane properly is of course an important aspect for safety, but also for structure integrity. So the mass repartition monitoring could avoid hard landing occurrences. Hence, it is interesting to develop a mechatronic system able to measure in real time before take off the mass distributed on each landing gear. This measurement provides the ability for the pilot to avoid mass overload which can have direct impacts on the structural health integrity of the aircraft. So, in order to provide a steering aid system to analyze the mass repartition on the ground, the authors have develop a mechatronic equipment able to measure in a static state of the plane, the mass on each landing gear and in a dynamic state, to record the acceleration provided by the shock during the landing phase in order to prevent failures due to hard landing and ease maintenance operations. A human machine interface is developed, with an android application on the pilot smartphone. It provides the mass repartition and static center of mass, the acceleration on each landing gear and the instant when the wheels touch the ground.

Thus the degradation failure process and mechanism of MOSFET attract wide attention of scholars. However current research works cannot solve the real time degradation monitoring problem of MOSFET. Normally, MOSFET should be removed from the system for testing or monitoring. This paper presents a new in-situ prognosis method for MOSFET based on miller effect. According to the theory analysis, simulation and experiment results, the miller platform voltage is identified as a new degradation precursor. Then, particle filter algorithm is used for MOSFET remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on the degradation data of miller platform voltage. Meanwhile, MOSFET samples with different degradation levels are formed by "overstress of gate bias" accelerating life test. The samples are placed into application circuit for the monitoring and extraction of miller platform voltage, so as to verify the method proposed in this paper.

A deep neural network (DNN) method for gear fault diagnosis based on stacked autoencode (SAE) and softmax regression is presented in this work. SAE is first utilized to extract features from the frequency spectra of vibration signal. And then the learned features are used to train softmax regression classifier for identifying gear faults. The diagnosis results validate that the method is feasible and is able to acquire superior classification performance. With the increasing layers of DNN, the learned features of each hidden layer are becoming more and more robust for classification. In this paper, a novel view on the visualization of the learned features is displayed to evaluate the DNN-based fault diagnosis method.

And a time domain signal feature is extracted, the time domain signal feature is highly sensitive to the defect. Firstly, in order to analyze the change trend of time domain signal under intermittent disconnection. The influence of conductor crack on the physical parameters is analyzed. The physical parameters include AC/DC resistance, inductance and capacitance. And then the principle of signal reflection is described. The ringing phenomenon that caused by signal reflection is used for crack intermittency detection. Therefore the maximum, minimum and peak-peak values of time domain signal are used to detect intermittent disconnection. At last solder joint equivalent circuit is used to verify the effectiveness of the method. When the intermittent disconnection happened in circuit board, the time domain reflection phenomenon is observed clearly. The maximum, minimum and the peak-peak values of output voltage signal are changed greatly, simulation result shows that the high frequency signal is sensitive to intermittent disconnection, and the proposed method is effective.

By fault diagnosis, proper maintenance can be arranged to avoid accidents, ensure safety and reduce maintenance costs. However, variable operating conditions and background noise always reduce effectiveness of traditional fault diagnosis methods. Currently the most advanced machine learning technology, that is deep learning, not only has strong ability for hierarchical representations, but also can adaptively extract feature information from considerable measured data without necessary of much prior knowledge. Nevertheless, only the last layer is utilized for feature extraction in current deep learning models, due to its better performance of feature abstraction and compactness than that of the lower layers. Different feature layers hold different identification ability. In order to consider all features in different layers and achieve effective fault diagnosis, an alternative method of feature ensemble learning based on stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) is proposed in this paper. Our proposed method can be constructed in three steps: first, obtaining the samples of raw data under different health conditions. A deep neural network with multiple hidden layers is then established layer-by-layer by considering each pair of layers as a denoising autoencoder (DAE), with the strategies of greedy layer-wise pre-training and fine-tuning. Finally, softmax regression is created by the last hidden layer and integrate feature to classify different fault types. Feature ensemble is considered by mutually independent rules with different weights according to corresponding accuracy. Effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated though identifying health conditions of an induction motor.

One of these challenges is to improve the efficiency of operations and to achieve better customer experience through minimizing the business impact of service interruption and proactively handle it. In this paper, trouble ticket repeat prediction framework is proposed to integrate the enormous data of operations that consist of the voice of the customer (VOC) and the voice of machine (VOM). The VOC is represented by customer trouble tickets collected by the customer relationship management system (CRM) and VOM is represented by the modems' event log that is loaded daily into our platform. Finally, the results from deploying the proposed framework in one of the biggest Telecom Operator in the middle east are presented. In summary, the proposed framework is explained in details starting from tickets classification ending with the actions that control and sustain the improvements through the set up for continuous mining of the data and the plan for monitoring and maintenance of the model.

This manuscript addresses texture identification methodology using Wavelet transform and artificial intelligence techniques. Captured images of machined surface using Electric discharge machining, milling, sand blasting and shaping is decomposed in to sub images and then discrete wavelet transform is applied on the sub images. To select the base wavelet minimum permutation entropy criterion is applied and statistical features were calculated from the base wavelet. Training and testing of feature vector is performed using two artificial intelligence techniques support vector machine and artificial neural network for identifying textured surface images. 100 % training identification of textured images is obtained using support vector machine and artificial neural network and 87.5 % and 100 % testing identification of textured images is obtained using support vector machine and artificial neural network respectively.

Early Prognosis of Alzheimer's Disease using Images from Fundus Camera	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL, INSTRUMENTATION AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING (ICEICE)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Instrumentation and Communication Engineering (ICEICE)	APR 27-28, 2017	Karur, INDIA	IEEE, M Kumarasamy Coll Engn, IEEE Madras Sect, M Kumarasamy Coll Engn, Fac Elect Engn		Alzheimer Disease; Fixed-Grid Wavelet Networks; Sombrero; Fundus Imaging	WAVELET NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia affecting the growing aging population. Clinically, it was proved that there is a progressive decline in cognition, memory, and social functioning due to deposition of different types of protein in the brain. Traditional decision making systems are more manual in nature and ultimate conclusion in terms of exact prognosis is remote. Recently, under certain investigations neurological degradation occurs in the retina of the eye as well as the brain. Also it is clearly investigated that are some parameter changes on the retina of the eye of the AD patients. Therefore eye provides a transparent medium to neuropathology which initiated the development of ocular biomarkers for AD. Retinal imaging and visual testing potentially improves disease management and quality of life for AD patients as they are non invasive methods. Any disease modifying treatments which are developed are most possibly to be achieving success if initiated early in the process, and this needs that we tend to develop reliable, validated and economical ways to diagnose AD. Profiling of human body parameter using computers can be utilized for the early prognosis of AD. There are several imaging techniques used in clinical practice for the prognosis of Alzheimer's type pathology. In this paper we have focused on the fundus imaging, a type of retinal imaging that can be used for the early prognosis of AD. For that we have proposed a new scheme based on Fixed-Grid Wavelet Networks (FGWN) for the segmentation of fundus retinal images that can be used for diagnosing AD.	[Sandeep, C.

Nowadays, clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are widely available to alleviate this issue. However, they are often not transparent, in contrast to medical scoring systems originating in the clinical world itself. This work presents an extension of Interval Coded Scoring System (ICS), an approach for semi-automatic data-driven extraction of such scoring systems from clinical data. It focuses on two ICS improvements for large or high-dimensional datasets. Firstly, it offers an alternative elastic net implementation. This can be solved efficiently due to equivalence with Support Vector Machines and the existing efficient solver for its primal formulation. Secondly, an informed preselection of the variables allows to lower ICS' computational burden. ICS is applied to problems as diverse as arrhythmia diagnosis, breast cancer prognosis, functional capacity assessment and diagnosis of spinal diseases and obtains good results. In particular, a comparison on the arrhythmia database shows the importance of using the extensions which yield similar performance as the original ICS while shortening the execution time with a factor of ten.

We consider the predictive maintenance according to the health condition of the machine to develop a joint optimization model of SPC and maintenance policy. The objective of the model is to minimize the cost per unit time in the cycle by find the optimal values of maintenance time threshold about the health index, maintenance frequency, control limit, sample size and sampling interval. A numerical example and thorough sensitivity analysis are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed joint optimization model.

For this purpose, two paradigms for developing KSOM-based classifiers are evaluated on the problem of interest, namely the gradient descent based KSOM (GD-KSOM) and the energy function based KSOM (EF-KSOM). Their performances are contrasted on a real-world dataset generated by means of a laboratory scale testbed that allows the simulation of different levels of interturn short-circuits (high and low impedance) for different load conditions. Feature vectors are built from the FFT-based spectrum analysis of the stator current, a non-invasive method known as the stator current signature.

For this reason, the detection of its faults already in their incipient phase is very important. Most the classical approaches in fault detection cannot be applied in this case due to the high external vibrations of the generators due to the strongly fluctuating input power, special mechanical construction, etc. In the paper a vibration monitoring based bearing fault detection method is analyzed. It applies the maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution method to extract the fault-typical frequency components from the noisy measured vibration signal. Its usefulness is exemplified with detecting an inner race bearing fault.

Since its introduction, researchers have been working on to increase its ability to predict the incipient faults more accurately. DGA methods have been shifting from off-line to online monitoring, and interpretation techniques from key gas and ratio methods to graphical methods and more advanced methods. But presently, the DGA data is used to interpret more detailed information about the faults like severity of the fault or involvement of solid insulation. In this paper, an effort has been made to cover some of such emerging techniques in the field of DGA along with issues like stray gassing problem, scheduling DGA inspection etc. With the development of alternate insulating liquids, DGA of such liquids is gaining importance and have been proactively covered in this paper. Further, the extensive implementation of AI techniques for more flexible interpretation of DGA data is also evaluated through this paper.	[Chatterjee, Kingshuk; Jadoun, Vinay Kumar; Jarial, R.

Induction Motor is modeled under faulty condition using mesh equations in matlab/simulink blocks. Stator current for different fault percentages in two phases are obtained by simulation. These current signals are further analyzed using wavelet coefficient and statistical parameters. The statistical parameter is used to develop a fault detection algorithm.

The relay time parameters which reflect main performance function were not monitored. So, in this study the relay time parameters and relay contact resistance were detected simultaneously. The method of prognostics and health management (PHM) was used. According to the analysis on test results of contact resistance, relay time parameters, the degradation phenomena of EMR in long-term storage are investigated, and the storage failure mechanism is analyzed. The microscopic morphology and changes in chemical elements for relay contact surface was analyzed, which provide references for the relay storage failure mechanisms.

Recently, numerous HIL systems are in practice for simulating the vehicle networks in real time, by providing necessary signals based on the test cases. There are many approaches to tap the signal from the instrument cluster before it gets displayed, and based on the test case the signal that is captured will be compared with the expected value. The current approaches deal only at the software level and fails in identifying the faults in the end display unit of cluster. The proposed method uses vision based machine learning system to monitor the cluster visually thereby identifying faults in cluster at the end product level. This approach greatly eases the task of testing for more number of units by making onerous repeated test without any human intervention, as the current testing method needs human approval for each and every test case which is tedious task to do.

Condition monitoring using audio signal processing is focused in this paper. The sound of the machine carries information about the machine condition. The change in features of audio signal are observed using the Peak Variation Response (PVR) of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of signal. In this paper, the conventional FFT method has been used to prove that, it is sufficient for the detection of abnormalities due to different loading condition of the machine using audio signature. And a study on PVR of Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) has been carried out to present the cause of variation in the energy and frequency of the oscillations of audio frequency (AF) modulated signals.

The method exploits the transient current response to track eccentricity-and slotting-related machine saliencies. By using the fault indicator's locus, a separation of mixed eccentricity components is performed, without comparison to additional reference measurements of the faultless case (no eccentricity). It is shown, that the fault indicator related to certain machine designs can be used to extract a reliable reference from the eccentric machine. This allows for the separation of static and dynamic proportions from the overall mixed eccentricity.	[Samonig, M. A.; Wolbank, Th.

Typically, the electrical machine is designed for stable operation with minimum noise and vibrations under normal conditions. When the fault emerges, some additional distortions appear. The necessity to detect the fault of an electrical motor in an early stage, to prevent further damage of the drive system due to electric motor fault propagation, is one of the most important features of condition monitoring or diagnostic technique for electrical machines. In this paper, possible induction motor faults are classified and basic algorithm for rotor faults pre-determination is presented.

The ability to reliably identify a mechanical fault occurrence in an induction motor, before it became catastrophic, can reduce risks related to the productive chain. Recently, different intelligent approaches have been proposed to develop feature based methods for the automatic fault diagnosis in induction motors. This article provides an evaluation of different machine learning techniques for fault identification that come from different families. The datasets are formed to allow the performance analysis of the results when the classifier is trained with data obtained from some particular operational conditions, and then it is tested under different operating conditions, as it is usual in industry. The input information is obtained from current signals of an induction motor with one broken rotor bar.

Condition Monitoring of Mechanical Faults in Induction Machines from Electrical Signatures: Review of Different Techniques	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, Tinos Cultural Fdn, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ, IEEE		Mechanical faults; Induction Machine; Fault Diagnosis; Bearings; Shaft; Gearbox; Eccentricity; Motor Current Signature Analysis; Torsional vibration	BEARING DAMAGE DETECTION; STATOR CURRENT; AIRGAP ECCENTRICITY; DIAGNOSIS; MOTORS; ROTOR; VIBRATION; GEARBOX; ASYMMETRIES; SIGNALS	Condition monitoring of electric machines is a procedure of increasing importance, as fault tolerant systems are becoming mandatory in many applications. Early diagnosis of faults is a basic pillar in order to achieve full tolerance by the maintenance of faulty parts in electrical machines. As far as electrical drives are concerned, the share of mechanical faults (imbalances, gears and bearings) is very high. The mechanical fault detection is typically based on vibration signals, a robust and effective technique, that is quite invasive and with high latency. Recently, many theoretical and signal-based methods have been investigated for early diagnosis of mechanical faults by electrical machine signals. This paper will review methods for condition monitoring of mechanical faults, with special reference on those based on electrical signals and quite effective also for an early detection: generalized roughness and realistic incipient faults.

This work presents a strongly coupled 2-D magnetomechanical simulation of an induction machine under heavy operational conditions: a direct-on-line startup. Both healthy and broken bar states are simulated in a time span long enough to allow the detailed study of the varying frequency components. The results yield, in addition to the usual electrical and magnetic quantities, electromagnetic induced vibration components in the stator. A comparison with current and vibration experimental data is also performed.

The technique of analysis is based on discrete wavelet transform energy in transient state where the machine operates at start-up and standstill states. The wavelet offers a very fine analysis of the unidimensional and two-dimensional signals. Through multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition, it is possible to extract the information for the prognosis of the fault in variable state of the machine. The stored energy calculation in each decomposition can evaluate the severity of the fault compared with the analysis of only the external magnetic field.

Turn-to-turn fault protection technique for synchronous machines without additional voltage transformers	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 11th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Industrial Electron Soc (IES), IEEE Power Electron Soc (PELS), IEEE Industry Applicat Soc (IAS), Tinos Cultural Found, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ		Power Generation Protection; Synchronous Generator; Turn-to-turn Fault	INTERTURN FAULT	This paper presents a novel protection technique for the detection of inter-turn faults in synchronous machines. It is based on the calculation of voltage in the stator windings from the usual phases and neutral voltage, typically available in all generator protection relays. The existing turn-to-turn protection mechanisms require additional voltage transformers. The main contribution of this technique is that it can be implemented without using any additional voltage transformers. This technique has been successfully tested in a special synchronous machine with taps in the stator windings, where turn-to-turn faults have been created.	[Redondo, M.; Platero, C.

Local damage in bearings/gearbox provides specific response in the vibration signal. It can be further investigated via time-frequency decomposition where one can track energy distribution change in time. Applying distribution distances to STFT matrix of the vibration signal one can find deviation of subsequent samples from one used as a referential. Combined with appropriate thresholding criterion for the matrix, results can be further enhanced to provide more meaningful information. Analysed real signals were acquired from the belt conveyor driving unit in the mining facility.

In this context, diagnosing rotor magnets degradation at incipient stage is crucial to guaranty the required efficiency of the machines. In the present paper the attention is focused on a five-phase surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous generator, and a new technique is investigated for detecting possible demagnetization of the rotor magnets due to high stator currents. A new diagnostic technique, based on third-space power signature analysis, is presented. The validity of the proposed new approach is verified by numerical simulations.

Thanks to the six-step operation of the BLDC motors, current waveform can be precisely represented by its extrema without loss of too much information, resulting in more computational benefits and less required memory. Effect of PM demagnetization on these extrema analytically investigated here. In addition to the extrema features, autoregressive coefficients and K-means distances are used as auxiliary features. Then, these patterns are utilized for classification of windowed current time-series in order to detect PM defects in the machine. Each window of the current waveform is classified; then final decision is based on majority voting between the decisions for each segment. Segmentation along with majority voting makes this fault detection scheme more robust to noise and external disturbances such as load oscillations due to required short-time for capturing waveforms.

The proposed method diagnoses the ISCF severity and slight ISCFs only by the voltage and the current signals without the rotational angle and the model parameters such as the stator resistance and the inductances. The proposed fault indicator to diagnose ISCFs is developed by using the phase difference between positive-sequence current and positive-sequence voltage, and the magnitude of negative-sequence voltage over negative-sequence current. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault indicator for diagnosing the ISCF severity and slight ISCFs.

First, a new way to accurately model power alternators is depicted. Thanks to a co-simulation process between Flux2D and Matlab, this model of a healthy alternator is able to faithfully reproduce the waveforms of the signals in the system and therefore their harmonic contents. This information is indeed crucial to perform an efficient diagnosis study. The method is then applied to a faulty machine with stator inter-turn short-circuit. It enables a spectral evaluation of the modifications introduced in the signals by the occurrence of a stator fault. Thanks to experimental measurements, the observations noted for simulated spectra have been validated and an identification of fault indicators has been achieved.

However, this way of detecting problems has never been exploited as a full-covering and reliable prognostic monitoring technology. Although the imposed current-signatures of different evolving mechanical faults in electric machines are well characterized, the relation between the severity of those faults and the corresponding faulty signatures is still not elucidated thoroughly. As the authors built an innovative test-rig on which all kinds of mechanical faults can be emulated with a wide variety of controllable environmental conditions, those specific relations can finally be investigated. The test-rig contains an 11kW induction machine with an integrated active magnetic bearing at drive-end side. The magnetic bearing can easily manipulate the rotor's position corresponding to a real manifesting and evolving mechanical fault with a high accuracy and reproducibility. In this paper, the relation of the current fault-signatures and the severity of misalignment and mechanical unbalance is investigated. After theoretically describing the different eccentricity-related rotor-faults, the faults are induced and emulated on the induction machine under test. The fault-components in the stator currents' spectra are monitored while the severity of the faults is being increased. By fitting corresponding trending-functions on the obtained results, the severity of misalignment and unbalance can be estimated out of stator current measurements.

The use of the wavelet transform of rotor current for the fault diagnosis is proposed. In this paper, first, behavior of the motor with stator inter-turn fault and the generated frequencies in rotor current by the fault are investigated using fast Fourier transform. It has been seen that these frequencies are in a specific band of frequencies; therefore, wavelet transform of rotor current is an appropriate mean for diagnosis of the proposed fault. Then, an attempt is made to fully diagnose the fault at appropriate time by a proper selection of sampling frequency and time of monitoring in order to prevent the serious damage to the motor. Finally, to verify the fault diagnosis methods, the results obtained by finite element method are compared with experimental results.

Two main kinds of diagnostic errors, called Type I and Type II or False Positives and False Negatives are encountered whenever classification, such as "good" vs "bad" is considered. This has been thoroughly discussed, especially in the field of medicine, where the consequences of false judgements can be particularly grave. Other disciplines highly interested in this topic are financial forecasting and insurance. Industrial equipment diagnostics deals with these issues as well. In this paper we consider various factors influencing the quality of data, upon which diagnostic classification is based. We also look at the consequences of diagnostic errors to demonstrate why they are bad. We consider various ways employed to mitigate both the probability and the consequences of false judgements.

Broken Rotor Bar Detection in Inverter-fed Induction Motors by Time-Corrected Instantaneous Frequency Spectrogram	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 11th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Industrial Electron Soc (IES), IEEE Power Electron Soc (PELS), IEEE Industry Applicat Soc (IAS), Tinos Cultural Found, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ		Condition monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Induction motors; Inverter; Spectrogram; Reassigned; Spectral analysis	MIXED ECCENTRICITY; FAULTS	Fault detection in induction motors in non-stationary regimes managed by inverters is an existing industrialized demand. Inverter-fed machines have being used due to their adjustable velocity and quick dynamic response, although the injection of objectionable frequency components. The condition monitoring of these motors can significantly reduce the cost of maintenance in the early detection of faults. Under this special performing situation, many of the identification methods researched have problems in distinguishing induction motor failures. This paper introduces an identification methodology founded on the mixed handling of two techniques: Time-corrected instantaneous frequency and the Spectrogram, also known as reassigned spectrogram, where a thresholding is used so that any element with values smaller than the signal-noise-rate are set to zero, and the noise is reduced in the final spectrogram. The suggested method is tested in an inverter-fed induction motor at the time of startup continue by a steady-state condition. It was confirmed its effectiveness to find one broken rotor bar. From the obtained results, the suggested method confirms to be precise enough to identify the failure progression in the time-frequency domain under various operating conditions (startup and steady-state conditions) in inverter-fed induction motors.

The unsupervised classification by k-means method allows regrouping the periods of operation into classes using the Euclidean distance as a criterion of similarity. The analyzed data describes the evolution of gas concentrations as a function of time. The classes obtained are characterized by the production activities of the different gases, various operating constraints and the incipient failures. These periods also highlight the maintenance actions carried out on the insulating oil.

Cost-Effective On-line Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors Using the Reduced Modulus of the Current Park's Vector	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Power Elect Soc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, Tinos Cultural Fdn, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ, IEEE		Fault diagnosis; DSP; FPGA; FFT; induction machines; Park's vector; EPVA; current envelope	ENVELOPE ANALYSIS; MACHINES; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHM; PROTECTION; HILBERT; DRIVES	This paper presents a new algorithm for the practical implementation on embedded devices of the extended current Park's vector approach (EPVA), which substantially reduces the hardware and computational requirements needed for applying this technique. The EPVA is a proven technique for fault diagnosis of induction motors working in steady state regime. However, this approach has some practical limitations: it requires the simultaneous measurement of three-phase currents, using three high-resolution, synchronous analog-to-digital converters, operated at high sampling rates to avoid aliasing artifacts, and during long periods for reaching suitable frequency resolution; thus, a huge amount of data must be stored and processed. To solve these problems, a cost-effective implementation of the EPVA is presented in this paper. The proposed approach only requires a single ADC channel sampled at a very low frequency rate and, besides, it reduces the computational requirements (storage capacity, calculation time) to less than 1% of those required by the conventional EPVA. In this way it can be implemented in real time, using low cost embedded devices.

In the model, individual one-turn stator coils and coils of the field winding located in common slot are represented. Full spectra of coil's MMF are considered, however dumping windings are omitted. An arbitrary connections of those elementary coils are modelled by the constrain matrix technique. Resulting model equations are arranged by introducing the symmetrical components of stator currents and voltages. Spectral analysis of currents has been done by the harmonic balance method. Exemplary spectra of currents have been calculated and presented for chosen cases of short circuited elementary stator and field coils. The characteristic features of these spectra have been discussed from diagnostics point of view. Calculations in this paper have been done for approximated design data of turbo-generator, so results have only qualitative character.

Comments, regarding the usefulness as a fault diagnosis method, the hysteresis method presented in previous publications are offered in this paper. This method points out that the size of a curve and the area that the curve creates as PDs occur may vary and it could be an indicator of the insulation's deterioration, the existing defects and the PDs that have taken place over the years.

Detection and Localization of Insulation Deterioration in Traction Drives Based on Specific High Frequency Current Response Evaluation	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 11th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Industrial Electron Soc (IES), IEEE Power Electron Soc (PELS), IEEE Industry Applicat Soc (IAS), Tinos Cultural Found, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ		AC machines; Fault diagnosis; Insulation testing; Traction motor drives	MACHINES; DESIGN	In modern electric traction drives, on-line monitoring offers the advantage to decrease maintenance cost and increase the reliability. Especially, the electrical insulation is one of the most vulnerable components of an ac machine. Fast switching of the inverter results in high output voltage slew rates increasing the stress on the insulation as well as the rate of deterioration. The described stator insulation monitoring technique detects imminent deviations from a healthy stator insulation state by evaluation of the current response induced by inverter switching. Effects occurring during the aging of the insulation, e.g. changes of electrical parasitic components, lead to deviations in the transient current oscillation. Since the degradation of the insulation is usually a slowly developing process, the observation of the insulation condition is possible during operation and when the drive is put into service and continuing over the whole lifetime. The target of the approach is to detect the insulation degradation in an incipient stage. In order to operate the monitoring system economically, conventional current transducers typically used in industrial applications are used. Experimental results of a 1.4 MW induction machine for railway applications, fed by inverters with different semiconductor technologies (IGBT, SiC-MOSFET) are presented.	[Zoeller, C.; Wolbank, Th.

The method is based on the Linear Discriminant Analysis and on the spectral analysis of three signals (current of one phase and external stray flux measured with two different sensors). In order to obtain a relatively simple instrument for applications in industrial cases, only the first odd harmonics multiple of the fundamental have been chosen as features for the classifiers. All the considered signals have provided interesting diagnostic results, even if the best performance is given by the current.

In addition, a method based on the Linear Discriminant Analysis and on the calculation of the first odd harmonics of these signals is proposed for an automatic detection of this fault. The performances of the classifiers trained with these data are tested in different conditions of supply frequency and load, showing a good diagnostic ability for the current-based classifier. On the other hand, the flux-based classifiers reveal the risk of obtaining misleading results when the flux sensors are not permanently installed on the motor, due to the strong dependence of this signal on the position of the sensors used for its acquisition.

The feature calculation is an important signal processing step used to obtain a characterization related to the working condition of machinery. In order to address this issue, this work proposes a diagnosis methodology based on the calculation of a statistical-time set of features applied to identify the appearance of different faults in an induction motor. In the proposed methodology three acquired stator current signals are characterized by calculating its statistical-time features. Then, such statistical-time sets of features are compressed and represented into a 2-dimentional space through Linear Discriminant Analysis. And, finally a Neuro Fuzzy-based classifier is used to diagnose the different considered conditions. The performance of the proposed diagnosis methodology is evaluated in an experimental test bench; the obtained results make the proposed methodology suitable to be applied in industrial processes.

So this paper proposes a mathematical model for diagnosis of the inter-turn short circuit in the stator winding of electrical machines. This model uses the Pearson correlation coefficient and a pair of sensors, placed at 180 degrees from each other around the machine to measure the external magnetic field in the machine vicinity. The data obtained from each sensor are analyzed and compared with each other when the load varies. It will be shown that one can obtain high probability to detect the fault using this method and experimental results show that the new method has high reliability level for fault detection. On the other hand, the presented method does not require any knowledge of a presumed machine healthy former state.

The adopted approach is based on the observation of the device under test with a particular thermographic camera; no limitations in size and shapes devices are considered and the method can be widely adopted. Examples of defects in the magnetic circuit realization are described, both for traditional ferromagnetic laminated sheets and for Soft Magnetic Composites.

Consequently, it is of special interest to identify the most common faults present in these machines and develop reliable and cost-effective diagnostic tools to properly maintain them. In this context, the infrared thermography coupled with signal processing algorithms can be a very relevant tool. The main objective is to analyze its potential by focusing on two common fault conditions, bearing and ventilation system. To do so, the two of them were induced in an induction motor and compare during transient state and under similar working conditions against the healthy motor. The results reveal its capacity to identify the thermal sensitive regions for each case, highlight significant differences between the tested scenarios and its high temperature sensitivity especially relevant for determining severity degrees. These findings allow the authors to conclude that the proposed methodology, based on thermography and signal processing algorithms, has a high potential to become a diagnostic tool easily implementable in an industrial context.

Low computational cost algorithm for detecting rotor asymmetries in IM based on the negative sequence component of the startup currents	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 11th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Industrial Electron Soc (IES), IEEE Power Electron Soc (PELS), IEEE Industry Applicat Soc (IAS), Tinos Cultural Found, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ		induction motors; fault diagnosis; symmetrical components; negative sequence component; lower sideband harmonic; startup transient; low computational complexity	INDUCTION; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINES; FAULTS; MOTOR	This paper introduces an algorithm with a very low computational complexity, which enables to detect rotor asymmetries in induction motors. The proposed approach is based on calculating the negative sequence component of the startup stator currents, and enables to visualize the characteristic pattern of the lower sideband component (LSH) during the startup transient. Unlike previous published approaches, the proposed method does not need to use either frequency domain transforms nor time-frequency transforms or complex mathematic functions. Thus it can he implemented as an embedded algorithm in preexisting electronic devices or in low cost devices such as DSPs or tablets. In this paper the method is theoretically justified and validated through simulation and laboratory tests.

Online Estimation of Remaining Useful Life of Stator Insulation	2017 IEEE 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DIAGNOSTICS FOR ELECTRICAL MACHINES, POWER ELECTRONICS AND DRIVES (SDEMPED)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 11th International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines Power Electronics and Drives (SDEMPED)	AUG 29-SEP 01, 2017	GREECE	IEEE Advancing Technol Human, IEEE Industrial Electron Soc (IES), IEEE Power Electron Soc (PELS), IEEE Industry Applicat Soc (IAS), Tinos Cultural Found, Municipal Tinos, Univ Patras, Michigan State Univ		Electrical Machines; insulation; leakage current; condition monitoring; Extended Kalman Filter; fault prognosis	QUALITY ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUE; MACHINES; MOTORS	Wide bandgap semiconductor devices in machine drive topologies are becoming more prevalent. These devices improve efficiency and can operate at higher switching frequencies. However, higher switching frequencies will increase the electrical stress applied to the insulation of the machine. Electrical stress, excessive heating, mechanical vibrations, and environmental contamination are leading factors that contribute to insulation degradation. Breakdown of the insulation will lead to a short circuit fault between two conductors. Short circuit faults can quickly propagate and lead to catastrophic failure. This project proposes an online method to accurately predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the stator insulation by monitoring a trend in the leakage current. As the insulation degrades, the magnitude of the overshoot in the transient response of the leakage current exponentially decreases. An analog peak detection circuit is used to acquire this magnitude using low frequency sampling. An Extended Kalman Filter is applied to predict the RUL of the insulation. The proposed strategy will improve machine reliability, especially when using wide bandgap devices, while not requiring expensive or special equipment for assessing the health of the insulation.

Conventional methods applied to the analysis and simulation of rotor asymmetries in induction machines are based in the classical 2-D finite element approach, which is unable to reflect its complex effects, such as interbar currents and their interaction with the stator flux density wave. Thus, this work applies a 2D-3D multiphysics finite element procedure to assess the impact of a bar breakage on a rotor cage during stationary operation, with reduced computational cost compared to a full motor 3-D simulation. Initial results improve previous ones obtained for transient operation conditions, showing the potential of the approach and confirming previous analytical studies.

For every inanimate object can tell us something by the sound it makes, acoustic sensor demonstrates great advantages comparing to conventional electronic and mechanic sensors in such cases: overcoming environmental obstacles, mapping to existing use cases of detecting problems with human ears, low cost for deployment, etc. It could be widely applied to various domains, such as predictive maintenance of machinery, robot sensory, elderly and baby care in smart home, etc. Whether we can use the acoustic sensor data to understand what is happening and to predict what will happen relies heavily on the analytics capabilities we apply to the acoustic data, which has to overcome the obstacles of noise, disturbance and errors, and has to meet the requirement of real-time processing of high volume signals with large number of sensors. In this paper, we propose a scalable cognitive acoustics analytics service for IoT that provides the user an incremental learning approach to evolve their analytics capability on non-intuitive and unstructured acoustic data through the combination of acoustic signal processing and machine learning technology. It first performs acoustic signal processing and denoising, enables acoustic signal based abnormal detection based on sound intensity, spectral centroid, etc. Then based on the accumulated abnormal data, a supervised learning method is performed as baseline and a neural network based classifier is used to recognize acoustic events in different scenarios with various volume of sample data and requirement of accuracy. In addition, acoustic sensor arrays processing is supported for localization of moving acoustic source in more complex scenario. In this paper, we designed a hybrid computing structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on acoustic event recognition for machinery diagnosis, and show that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy.

Existing researches primarily focus on diagnosing faults in physical networks, while they could not identify the faults introduced by virtual networks. Besides, the high complexity of algorithms and the requirement for modifying hardware may limit their scope of use. To address these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to diagnose faults in virtual networks. The rational of our approach is that the faults can be identified when located in the packet traces, with the knowledge that the possible known faults that can happen in that location. To achieve this goal, we apply packet marking, fault injection and machine learning techniques to provide precise fault diagnosis. Experimental results show that our approach can efficiently identify 73% of the faults while for virtual network-specific faults, our approach can diagnose 86% of them.

However, FDD&P for building operations remains with many challenges due to special operation environments of HVAC systems. These challenges include "tolerance or ignorance" of failures in long-haul operations, lack of operation regulations, and even lack of documents for HVAC failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), which is a systematic method of identifying and preventing system, product and process problems. To address some of these challenges, we propose to develop a FMEA for HVAC by exploring work orders generated by building energy management systems (BEMS) using a data mining approach. With the developed HVAC FMEA, it is possible to conduct pre-FDD&P procedures to improve HVAC maintenance and to select the high impact failures in order to acquire the operation data for selected failures and develop machine learning-based predictive models to predict a failure before it occurs and isolate the root component of a given failure. In this paper we report some preliminary results in developing an HVAC FMEA tool from a large number of work orders obtained from a BEMS in routine operations. The developed HVAC FMEA will be used as a guidance tool for data gathering and developing data-driven models for building HVAC FDD&P.

In frame of conventional testing becomes not enough to detect stuck-at faults at circuits' gate poles it is necessary to test timing defects. One of a convenient and popular model of timing defects is path delay faults. A technique of designing a self checking synchronous network of Finite State Machines (FSMs) for path delay. faults is suggested. Checkers observe outputs only external FSMs, i.e. FSMs output lines of which are output lines of the network at whole. Single path delay faults from inputs to outputs of each FSM are contemplated. We use a multilevel or factorized logic synthesis for monotonous (unate) realization of FSM. On output lines of the corresponding FSMs synthesized by multilevel and factorized logic synthesis are provided an unidirectional manifestation of path delay faults. Monotonous realization of FSM is obtained from the State Transition Graph (STG) description of FSMs with using the (m, n)-code for states encoding and negligible enlarge the products of STG.

To achieve effective health management, fault prognosis is indispensable. This paper proposes a fault prognostic method for drivetrain gearboxes, which are one of the most troublesome subassemblies in wind turbines. The proposed method consists of signal collection, health index extraction, health index prediction, and decision making for maintenance. The signal used for fault prognosis is a phase current measured from the generator connected with the gearbox. A health index called noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of the current signal is proposed to reflect the health condition of the gearbox. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is designed to predict the health index online and maintenance is scheduled when the predicted health index reaches a predetermined threshold. The proposed fault prognostic method is validated by the data obtained from an accelerated gearbox run-to-failure experiment for an emulated wind turbine drivetrain consisting of a gearbox and a generator.

Fault Diagnosis (FD) is implemented for analog to digital converter (ADC) with a wide range of faults. FD is considered as the pattern recognition problem and solved by machine learning theory. Functional test is is needed instead of structural test for testing complex circuits. Fault diagnosis using Fault Dictionary, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Fuzzy logic are enigmatic or inconclusive diagnosis results which have more debug duration and even inaccurate repair actions that exponentially rises service overhead. The effectiveness of these methods are considered, which cover ability in detecting, identifying and localization of faults, the ability of analysing linear and nonlinear circuits, etc. Recent machine learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM) with kernel functions improve the preciseness of functional FD which reduces the product cost through correct repair process. The proposed Multikernel SVM (MKSVM) methodology give better results than earlier methods as it works with the fundamentals of machine learning and generalization for FD.

A fault or damage in the transformer windings will result in outage and heavy loss, as a result it needs to be monitored continuously. Due to the adaptation of various advanced techniques in monitoring and diagnostics of power system it has contributed a major hand in the research. The most common fault in the transformer (or in any electrical machine in general), is turn to turn fault in windings of transformer, and it is a type of incipient fault which cannot be detected easily as the magnitude of fault current is very nominal. This paper presents an approach to simulated model of turn to turn fault and its detection in a transformer by analyzing the neutral current of transformer after subjecting it to a standard impulse wave and subsequently applying wavelet transform. The identification of faults by using frequency or time domain based method is difficult.

It is necessary to understand acoustic characteristics for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis via acoustic signal analysis. Based on the generating mechanism of structural noise, planetary gearbox acoustic signal model is developed, and the acoustic characteristics in Fourier spectrum and envelope spectrum are derived for gear fault diagnosis.

The consequences of a bearing fault range from production losses to critical safety issues. To mitigate these consequences condition based maintenance is gaining momentum. This is based on a variety of fault diagnosis techniques where fuzzy clustering plays an important role as it can be used in fault detection, classification, and prognosis. A variety of clustering algorithms have been proposed and applied in this context. However, when the extensive literature on this topic is investigated, it is not clear which clustering algorithm is the most suitable, if any. In an attempt to bridge this gap, this paper reports some preliminary results of a work aiming at comparing four representative fuzzy clustering algorithms: fuzzy c-means (FCM), the Gustafson-Kessel (GK) algorithm, fuzzy c-means with a focal point (FCMFP), and fuzzy neighborhood density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (FN-DBSCAN). The paper reports only results from the real-world bearing vibration benchmark CWRU data set. The comparison takes into account the quality of the generated partitions measured by the external quality, i.e., Rand index. The conclusions of the study are grounded in statistical tests of hypotheses.

This paper presents a health indicator construction method based on distance metric learning (DML). First, multiple features are extracted from the raw monitoring vibration signals, including a designed feature named as average energy of fault frequency band (AEFFB). Then, the optimal features are selected from the extracted features according to monotonicity and correlation metrics, where the correlation metric is calculated by the determination coefficient in random forest regression. Finally, a distance metric is learned utilizing DML, which is then used to construct a health indicator with the help of self-organizing map. The effectiveness of the proposed health indicator is validated by accelerated degradation data of bearings.

In this situation, trying to predict a future state or to classify internal features in the system becomes a challenging task that requires adequate conceptual and computational tools as well as appropriate datasets. A specially difficult case can be found in the problems framed under one-class learning. In an attempt to sidestep this issue, we present a machine learning methodology based in Reservoir Computing and Variational Inference. In our setting, the dynamical system generating the time series is modeled by an Echo State Network (ESN), and the parameters of the ESN are defined by an expressive probability distribution which is represented as a Variational Autoencoder. As a proof of its applicability, we show some results obtained in the context of condition-based maintenance in rotating machinery, where vibration signals can be measured from the system, our goal is fault detection in helical gearboxes under realistic operating conditions. The results show that our model is able, after trained only with healthy conditions, to discriminate successfully between healthy and faulty conditions.

This paper proposes a framework to detect new patterns of abnormal conditions in gearboxes, that would be associated to new faults. This is achieved through a Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm for Evolving Models in scenarios of Classification and Clustering (HHA-EMCC), which is a machine learning algorithm that can be adapted to solve problems related to classification and clustering both combined. The design aims at creating clusters and classes inspired by the main principles of the nearest neighbour (1-NN) strategy and K-means. HHA-EMCC has the particularity of detecting new clusters after being trained, this characteristic defines some guidelines that determine whether a cluster represents new knowledge or not. The framework is able to discover abnormal conditions from unlabelled data through cluster constructions. This analysis can lead to labelling these clusters as new classes. Once a new pattern is identified, the associated data feeds the current classifier for a new training phase. The proposed framework is tested on a fault dataset for gearboxes and experimental results show that valuable new knowledge is obtained.

Usually, feature selection or reduction are conducted through several techniques proposing a unique set of representative features for all available classes; nevertheless, in feature selection, it has been recognized that a set of individually good features do not necessarily lead to good classification. This paper proposes a general framework to analyse the feature selection oriented to identify the features that can produce clusters of data with a proper structure. In the first stage, the framework uses Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) combined with Tukey's test for ranking the significant features individually. In the second stage, a further analysis based on inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances, is accomplished to rank subsets of significant features previously identified. In this sense, our contribution aims at discovering the subset of features that are discriminating better the clusters of data associated to several faulty conditions of the mechanical devices, to build more robust fault multi-classifiers. Fault severity classification in rolling bearings is studied to test the proposed framework, with data collected from an experimental test bed under real conditions of speed and load on the rotating device.

Thus, some strategies arc sought to avoid unscheduled stops, or catastrophic damages, in order to reduce maintenance costs and increase reliability. This paper describes a methodological framework to detect eleven rotating machinery faults by using feature ranking methods and support vector machine, based on information that comes from the measured vibration signal. Thirty features are calculated from the vibration signal in time domain, for each faulty condition. Feature ranking methods such as ReliefF, Chi square, and Information Gain are used to select the most informative features, and subsequently to reduce the size of the feature vector. The feature ranking methods are compared in order to obtain improved diagnosis results with a reduced feature set. Results show good fault identification accuracy with the first four features of ReliefF ranking method as input to support vector machine classifier.

In this paper, a new method based on deep belief network is proposed for aircraft key parts fault diagnosis. Firstly, a deep belief network is constructed with a series of pre-trained restricted Boltzmann machines for feature learning. Secondly, the highest level features learned from the DBN are fed into a softmax classifier for fault diagnosis. Finally, back propagation learning algorithm is adopted to fine-tune the deep model parameters to further improve the diagnosis accuracy. The proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental rolling bearing signals. The results show that the proposed method is more effective and robust than other traditional methods.

Generally, most of the models used for fault diagnosis are based on the same data distribution, while the applications of the equipment in actual production and operation are mostly under unstable conditions, which may make data distribution different and the model unavailable. For example, various operating conditions (e.g. variable speed) in reciprocating compressor may cause difference of data distribution, so the present model established under a stable condition is no longer applicable to fault diagnosis of the compressor under other conditions. Therefore, a model should be established to reduce the differences caused by different operating conditions as much as possible. And at the same time, the model is supposed to synthesis representative features under different conditions containing defects. Domain adaptation is widely used for cross-domain data mining and setting up a learning model applied to source domain and target domain sampled from discrepant distributions. So it can be used to reduce the cross-domain discrepancy by learning joint feature representation. Nonetheless, when it comes to the random assimilation, the feature representation assimilated for each category makes it impossible to distinguish. Hence we propose a strategy that auxiliary feature, as another type of abstract feature which is adept in representation of respective domain for category, is embedded to enhance the representative features for classification. And we also establish an actual complex model. This model can take advantage of rational weakening and strengthening from domain adaptation and assisted training features to ensure a high classification accuracy in the target domain. Experimental results of a reciprocating compressor under different operating conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Thus, prognostic and health management (PHM) of rolling bearing plays an important role on the working status of the machine system. Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is the core of PHM. It's well known that original auto-regression (AR) model is suitable for the prediction of linear and stationary time series. However, the collected bearing vibration signals are non-linear and non-stationary. Moreover, most of the existing techniques require considerable training and parameter tuning which are difficult for practical applications. To overcome these issues, a RUL prediction method for rolling bearing degradation analysis is proposed in this work based on sparse coding (SC) and sparse linear AR model without training and parameter tuning. SC is formulated as a basis pursuit Li-norm problem, where a sparse set of weight is estimated for each test vector. Sparse local linear and neighbor embedding are employed to construct the weight constraint sparse coding (WCSC). Fault trend of rolling bearing is indicated via time-domain features, such as root-mean-square (RMS), peak-to-peak (P2P) and kurtosis. Experimental results well demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for RUL prediction in bearing.

An approach based on Dictionary learning for sparse representation aiming at gearbox fault detection is proposed. A gearbox vibration signal database with 900 records considering the normal case and nine different faults is analyzed. A dictionary is learned using a training set of signals from the normal case. This dictionary is used for obtaining the representation of signals in the test set considering either normal or faulty condition vibration signals. The dictionary based representation is analyzed for extracting features useful for detection of faults. The analysis is performed considering different load conditions. Additionally the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is performed for ranking the extracted features. Results are promising as there are significant statistical differences between the normal case and each of the recorded faults. Comparison between faults also shows that faults tends to group into several clusters in the feature space where classification of faults could be feasible.

Data-driven methods are effective for feature extraction and feature analysis using statistical techniques. In the proposal, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is used to extract the features and to reduce the data dimension. Then, the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) is used to detect the fault occurrence by comparing the Probability Density Function of the latent scores. The faulty sensor is isolated thanks to a linear combination of the original measurements with binary coefficients denoted as Z-decomposition. The proposed approach is experimentally verified with vibration signals used for monitoring hearings in electrical machines.

The stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) is used to extract the abstract features of time-domain features of multi-source signals, and then locality preserving projection (LPP) is used to dimension reduction to complete the feature fusion. Finally, the fused low-dimensional features act as inputs to the support vector machine (SVM) to realize the failure detection and fault location of typical fault modes of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system. The inhibitory effect of the closed-loop system on the incipient fault is discussed as well. Moreover, a health assessment method is presented considering the gradual degradation of leakage fault of the actuator. The results show that the proposed method is more accurate and reliable than any single signal result. The model of health assessment can give the internal leakage severity of the actuator. The significance of this paper is to provide a feasible idea of the fault diagnosis and health assessment of the landing gear hydraulic retraction system.

In this work, a hybrid ensemble scheme, named Learn (++) NCS, is adopted for diagnosing bearing defects in induction motors. This diagnostic scheme includes a feature extraction module and a hybrid ensemble scheme. The former intends to extract discriminant features from the vibrational signals.

With the rapid development of sensors, massive data will be acquired because of the monitoring of machinery. So how to extract and use the effective data from the big data for trend estimation has profound research value. The least square support vector machine (LSSVM), which is a kind of novel artificial intelligence technology, has scored tremendous achievements in this field. Among kinds of methods, multivariable LSSVM takes a full consideration of multiple variables to improve the accuracy of prediction. However, it may ignore the influence factors with time. To improve the performance of multivariable LSSVM, a kind of multivariable LSSVM over time slices is proposed which considers both the influence of multivariable and volatility of data. Firstly, several sensitive features are chosen to construct a new training sample which include the information of data volatility. Then LSSVM is employed to construct the model for prognosis. The vibration signals generated by an accelerated bearing run-to-failure experiment are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results show that the multivariable LSSVM over time slices outperforms general multivariable LSSVM.

American Water Works Association estimated the total cost for pipeline system management would be more than $1.7 trillion by 2050. Therefore, it is important to assess performance of water mains to optimize the rehabilitation of pipelines. To find an approach to improve the prediction of pipe condition, this paper proposes a stacking ensemble method to reduce the drawbacks of single models and to improve the predictive results. Considering soil property data, both a single model and an ensemble-model were built to forecast the pipe condition, which is defined as the remaining wall thickness. Compared with the prediction performance of four single models, the superiority of ensemble method was demonstrated with up to 35.7% increase of R-squared value and 13.6% decrease of the root-mean-square error. With the proposed method, reliable decision-making tools can be developed in the infrastructure management system to help manage the large and complicated deteriorating buried pipeline networks.

As modern rotating machinery becomes more complex with an increasingly extreme working condition, the feature characterization of nonlinear and nonstationary data can be easily smeared by traditional time frequency (TF) analysis tools. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), being well-known for its data adaptiveness and its resulted narrow-band intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), suffer 'mode mixing' problem when characterizing multi-component signals in practical applications. In this contribution, the synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT), is facilitated to characterize the multi-component signal by decoupling the harmonic and impulsive components in the simulated signal. The case studies further conducted on a run-up misaligned rotor kit and a surge fault centrifugal compressor justify our conclusions. The corresponding energy distributions achieve a sharper positioning accuracy simultaneously along the time- and frequency-axis.

This paper presents a model-based method to implement the condition estimation and a data-driven method to conduct the prognosis for boost converter. Firstly, the equivalent circuit for non-ideal boost converter should be simplified and the state space equation should be obtained. Then, constructing the objective function for crow search algorithm (CSA) and several parameters like inductance, on-resistance of Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), capacitance and equivalent series resistance of capacitor are estimated based on CSA. Considering components degradation and variable operating conditions, several simulation experiments have been conducted to validate the presented approach. Finally, the prognosis for capacitor of the boost converter has been conducted based on the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm. The results show that this technique characterizes high computation efficiency and good estimation accuracy. Also, it will be a basis of further study for the circuit-level remaining useful life prediction.

Nonstationary signal analysis is considered one of the main topics in field of machinery fault diagnosis. A set of signal processing techniques has been studied to investigate their feasibility for bearing fault detection in wind turbine gearbox. These techniques include statistical condition indicators, Spectral kurtosis, and envelope analysis.

Therefore, the efficient diagnosis method to detect faults and distinguish fault types at an early stage in bearings is necessary. This paper presents a fault diagnosis method for bearings using finite element method (FEM), wavelet packet transform (WPT) and support vector machine (SVM). In this method, the accurate FE models of the faulty bearing (faults in inner race and rolling body) are constructed and the vibration signals of the faulty bearing are obtained. Decompose the vibration signal into eight signal components using WPT and ten time-domain feature parameters of all the signal components are calculated to generate the training samples to train the SVM, the measured vibration signal and its components decomposed by WPT serve as a test sample to the trained SVM. The condition of bearings can be determined finally. Practical examples of diagnosis for a bearing are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the methods proposed in this paper. The fault types are finally determined and the classification accuracy rates of inner race faults and rolling body faults are 79%, 81%, respectively.

A kurtosis energy based spectrum synch (KESS) technique is proposed in this work to detect incipient IM broken rotor bar defect using electric current signals. In IM fault detection, the proposed KESS technique will capture the peakedness of the fault frequency components distributed over several fault related local bands. These bands are synchronized to enhance fault features. A central kurtosis energy indicator is proposed to extract representative features and formulate a fault index for incipient IM fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the developed KESS technique is demonstrated on IM with broken rotor bars. Test results show that the developed KESS technique can detect incipient IM faults effectively.

Firstly, wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) was used to decompose vibration signals into several sub bands. The fault features were extracted from the sub-bands to construct a high- dimensional fault feature set, and the improved kernel space distance evaluation method was used to extract the sensitive fault features. Then, orthogonal semi supervised linear local tangent space alignment (OSSLLTSA), which is a semi-supervised manifold learning method, was proposed to reduce dimension of the fault feature set, and extract fusion features with low dimension and high clustering performance. OSSLLTSA is able to extract the structural information in both labeled and unlabelled samples, and so OSSLLTSA overcomes over-learning problem of supervised manifold learning. Meanwhile, OSSLLTSA also avoids the drawback of weak pertinence of unsupervised manifold learning. Finally, the extracted low dimensional feature set was input into TSVM for fault diagnosis. TSVM is able to completely utilize the fault information contained in unlabelled samples to modify the model, and as a result the trained fault diagnosis model has better generalization ability. Through a gearbox fault instance, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. Experimental results showed that the proposed method is able to achieve very high fault diagnosis accuracy even when labeled samples are insufficient.

First of all, nonlinear de noising method with unsupervised manifold learning is presented, by combining advantages of manifold learning in mining of nonlinear structure and phase space reconstruction in representation of signal and noise spatial distribution. Then, the frequency spectrum of vibration signals after de-noising is used for fault feature extraction. In order to reduce the high dimensionality and remove redundant information of frequency spectrum, an improved supervised local tangent space alignment (ISLTSA) is proposed. ISLTSA further increases interclass distance and further reduces intraclass distance, and as a result the extracted fault features are more identifiable. At last, the extracted low-dimensional fault features are inputted into a pattern recognition method for fault identification. A fault diagnosis case in bearings is studied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Critical reciprocating compressors that operate under high-speed conditions, flow hazardous gases and have a high duty cycle are target rotating equipment on maintenance improvement lists due to downtime risks and safety hazards. Estimating performance deterioration and failure time for reciprocating compressors could potentially reduce downtime and maintenance costs, and improve safety and availability. This study presents an application of Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA), Cox Proportional Hazard (CPHM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models to estimate failure degradation and remaining useful life based on sensory data acquired from an operational industrial reciprocating compressor. CVA was used to extract a one-dimensional health indicator from the multivariate data sets, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the original data matrix. The failure rate was obtained by using the CPHM based on historical failure times. Furthermore, a SVR model was used as a prognostic tool following training with failure rate vectors obtained from the CPHM and the one-dimensional performance measures obtained from the CVA model. The trained SVR model was then utilized to estimate the failure degradation rate and remaining useful life. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effectively used in real industrial processes to predict performance degradation and failure time.

The problem is to associate a system to each mission and to integrate the necessary maintenance operations in the schedule according to the real state of health of systems. This problem, which falls within the decision part of PHM, is proposed to be solved using an optimal approach based on Linear Programming. Results based on computational experiments assess the efficiency of the resolution method.

As the concerned system is getting complicated and more sufficient health monitoring measurement is available, the traditional reliability prediction schemes resorting to only one kind of prediction approaches, model-based or data-driven, begin to show their limitations. This paper proposes an ensemble prognostic method by combining traditional model-based with data-driven approaches. Initially, two member algorithms for state-of-health (SOH) prediction are weighted-sum by utilizing the historical prediction error. Then, to compare the performance of our ensemble prediction with the model-based, data-driven, kalman filter and hybrid approaches, experiments based on electrolytic capacitor capacitance degradation and lithium-ion battery capacity degradation are performed. Finally, by employing the available data as well as dynamically adjusting weights, smaller prediction error and standard deviation are derived. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the better prediction performance of the proposed method has been verified.

However, most researchers paid their attention to the drift coefficient representing the degradation rate, while much fewer eyes focus on the diffusion coefficient. The under consideration of diffusion process may cause bias in degradation modeling and RUL estimation, when the concerned system has volatile degradation path. Therefore, this paper construct a new kind of age-dependent degradation model based on diffusion process with time-dependent drift and diffusion coefficient. Unlike most existing models, the degradation process' temporal variance is assumed to be proportional to the instantaneous expectation of the degradation process. By doing so, volatile degradation process can be modelled. The exact lifetime and RUL distributions under the concept of first hitting time (FHT) are derived, and normal random-effect are incorporated to depict the unit-to-unit variability within degradation process. The maximum likelihood estimation method based on historical degradation data is presented. Through a specific degradation model and its application to the data of accelerators, the presented degradation model has been illustrated and validated.

Current practice in fault diagnosis is often challenged by the non-normality, multimodality, and nonlinearity of machinery health monitoring signals and their extracted features. A single classifier used in fault diagnosis fails when all these challenges exist. Thus, in this paper a hybrid ensemble learning method is developed to combine the capability of different classifiers to address the challenges. Diversity among classifiers is desired because diversified classifiers lead to uncorrelated classifications, which improve classification accuracy. In this paper two methods are used to increase the diversity. First, different algorithms compatible with rotating machinery data are included in the decision ensemble to get the diversity among algorithms. Second, multiple bootstrap samples are generated to increase the diversity among training data. Each algorithm is trained by multiple bootstrap samples to get multiple classifiers. At the end, classifiers are trained from different combinations of algorithms and bootstrap samples. A final classification result is obtained from the majority voting of the classifiers. The method was evaluated by the classification of simulated data and through the fault diagnosis of experimental data of bearings. Results show the method works when the challenges exist and the performance of the method is better than that of individual classifiers.

In current literature, there have been a few studies highlighting life prediction for equipment subjected to the influence of imperfect maintenance activities. Aiming at this problem, we firstly put forward a stochastic degradation model based on the Wiener process considering the influence of imperfect maintenance activities on the degradation level and degradation rate. Then, the theoretical expression of life probability distribution can be derived under the concept of first hitting time using the convolution operation, and the approximate expression of life probability distribution can be derived by the Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the newly proposed life prediction method.

A novel optimization deep belief network (DBN) in this study has been proposed for a closed-loop single-ended primary-inductance converter (SEPIC) fault diagnosis. Firstly, the wavelet packet decomposition technique is used to extract the energy values from voltage signals of four circuit nodes, as the fault feature vectors. Then, a four-layer DBN architecture including input and output layers is developed. Meanwhile, neuron numbers of the two hidden layers are selected by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and training data. Finally, eleven fault modes such as power MOSFET, inductance, diode and capacitor open circuit faults (OCFs) and short circuit faults (SCFs) are isolated by PSO-DBN. Compared with other intelligent diagnostic method such as back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM), experiment results show that the proposed method has a higher classification accuracy rate which means its effectiveness and superiority.

Robust and accurate battery prognosis is indispensable not just in satellite autonomous mission planning but also in self-determined maintenance. Prognosis based on indirect health indicators (HIs) provide an effective non-invasive approach to identify the battery degradation state. But identification and extraction of effective HIs in different working conditions is still a challenge. In this paper, a self-adaptive non-invasive HIs extraction approach is explored, which benefits enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the indirect health indicators under different working situation. A cluster of potential HIs are extracted from the data samples of the battery. Principle component analysis (PCA) is taken into consideration to select and fuse those different HIs. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid HI. The verifications show that the proposed self-adaptive indirect HIs extraction approach can achieve promising results with high relativity with direct HIs, even operating with diverse conditions.

Firstly, the basic principles of adaptive regression algorithm and particle filter algorithm are introduced. Then, a fusion framework based on statistical prediction and data driven prediction is proposed. Secondly, taking into account the relationship between outlet pressure and performance degradation of airborne fuel pump, an AR model is used to establish the life degradation model of the airborne fuel pump. Finally, the RUL prediction of airborne fuel pump is realized by the fusion particle filter algorithm. The experimental results illustrate that compared to traditional regression approach, the proposed approach not only can effectively predict the life of airborne fuel pump, but also has the uncertainty expression of the prediction result.

In order to achieve real-time monitoring of UAV flight status, and improve the reliability and safety of UAVs. In this paper, an on-line and non-invasive embedded anomaly detection system (EADS) is designed to solve the problem of UAV on-board anomaly detection in complex environment. During the flight, whether the sensors and hardware components are abnormal or not is continuously detected via flight data. The proposed embedded anomaly detection system is divided into two parts, (1) hardware platform for heterogeneous calculation is based on Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC with dual-core Cortex A9 processors and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA); (2) on-line anomaly detection is based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) algorithm, including flight data preprocessing and analysis. The flight data from Flight Gear is utilized for the demonstration of EADS, and the experiment results show that the proposed system is effective for UAV real-time anomaly detection.

However, existing health indicator construction methods are mainly based on manual feature extraction and feature fusion techniques. Such manual techniques are generally designed for specific tasks and need the help of experts' prior knowledge, resulting in labor-consuming and time-costing. So it is desirable to automatically construct health indicators. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a deep convolution feature learning based method to construct health indicators of bearings. The proposed method first learns features from the raw vibration signals through several convolution and pooling operations. Then the learned features are mapped to the health indicator through a nonlinear transformation. At last, the proposed method is validated by a bearing dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to effectively construct the health indicator directly from the raw vibration signals, which is superior to that based on self organizing map. Additionally, because the proposed health indicator is constructed automatically, it significantly reduces the need of experts' prior knowledge and labor resources.

Therefore, performing bearing fault diagnosis is a key point to improve the reliability of the mechanical systems and reduce the corresponding operating expense. Recently, more and more studies focus on addressing this problem through detection transient signal by means of sparse representation (SR) theory. Although tremendous progress has been made, one important drawback remains to be solved: in the early stage of bearing failure, the incipient impact signal is relatively weak, which is hard to detect due to other mechanical components harmonic signals and interference of noise. In order to solve this problem, spectral kurtosis (SK), a popular tool to detect non-stationary signal, is introduced as a pre-procedure of the transient signal sparse representation. A novel sparse representation based on spectral kurtosis method is proposed in this work, namely the SKSR. SKSR utilizes the advantages of both of the methods: it is possible to choose the best matching of the atomic signal with the failure signal structure feature to gain sparse representation and efficiently extract transient signal from strong noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the numerically simulations and lab experiments. The results show that the presented method is efficient for the title problem.

Prognostics of Rolling Element Bearings with the Combination of Paris Law and Reliability Method	2017 PROGNOSTICS AND SYSTEM HEALTH MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE (PHM-HARBIN)	Prognostics and System Health Management Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	2017 Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM-Harbin)	JUL 09-12, 2017	Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA	COSIC, Calce, Reliabil Soc, IEEE Harbin Sect, IEEE		Bearing; Prognostics; Vibration Condition Monitoring; Level Crossing; Paris Law; Reliability	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; DEGRADATION; PREDICTION	In this research, a combination of the physical model based on Paris law and probability method is proposed for remaining useful life prediction of rolling element bearings. Level crossing is used as a feature that represents a linear relationship with defect size. Considering this linear relationship and using Paris law, a new model has been developed for bearings that follow degradation pattern with two stages. In this pattern, a bearing starts working in the healthy condition. Then it starts slow degradation stage and finally it goes to fast degradation stage until it reaches to the failure threshold. Considering a normal distribution for transition point from the slow degradation to the fast degradation stage, the model proposed in this article presents a probability distribution for the remaining useful life at any working point in slow degradation stage. In addition, the model presents a good and accurate prediction results in the fast degradation stage. The bearing run-to-failure vibration condition monitoring record is used for investigating the purpose of this study.

However, the unique construction and complex operating environment of in-wheel motor may aggravate the occurrence of SDGBB faults. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel feature extraction from vibration signals which performance should owe to artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHNs). AHNs are a novel machine learning method which inspiration follows from chemical rules of organic chemistry. When a signal is properly divided into small parts for simulating organic structure, and the vibration information of each part are used to represent the behavior of each molecule or compound, the interested information can be packaged perfectly. All packages can retain the nature of the signal. In that sense, a AHNs-based filtering is established to cancel the noise and extract the feature from vibration signals. The presented method in this article has been applied to perform the feature extraction of in-wheel motor SDGBBs' faults, and practical examples have verified that it is feasible and effective to extract the features of vibration signals by AHNs-based filtering.

Thus, it is of great significance to carry out fault diagnosis of rotating machinery to ensure the complete machinery system to perform in a normal statement. To effectively separate the multi-faults and achieve the fault diagnosis, sparse component analysis based on the sparsity of objective signals was proposed. However, the vibration signals are scantily sparse and it usually cannot be represented in a sparse way. Therefore, a novel approach is suggested to overcome the above problem. First, tunable Q-factor wavelet transform is used to obtain the sparse signal. Then, the quantity of source signal and the mixed matrix are approximated grounded on the potential function which is calculated according to the sparse signal. Ultimately, the shortest path method is taken advantage of gaining separation of the source signal. The simulate signals and vibration signals are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that it is telling to accomplish the separation of multi-faults.

Traditional methods of degradation analysis often rely on many theoretical assumptions to offer the detailed relationship between the machine's condition and the failure probability. However, this kind of theory approximation may not reflect the real complicated relationship. Besides, one of the challenges of predicting the defect distribution lies in the rich kinds of different defects. The sparsity of the defect kinds on a single circuit breakers makes it hard to establish a statistical significance. This paper introduces an data-driven latent Dirichlet allocation method to automatically build the quantitative relationship between the individual circuit breaker and its defect distribution on many kinds of defects. Firstly, a latent layer is introduced between the circuit breaker and its defect distribution as a matrix factorization method. The defect distribution of the circuit breakers is remodeled as the distribution between the circuit breakers and the latent layers, and the distribution between the latent layers and the defects based on Dirichlet allocation, which greatly reduced the state space to build a reliable discrete distribution on each kind of defect. Second, an Bayesian inference is also introduced as an online extension of the basic method. The method offers a new way to analyze large amounts of log data in the power grid, and has the ability to predict the defect distribution of a single circuit breaker. The experiment shows that the accumulated probability of the enhanced LDA method is 23.1% better than the statistical model and 6.2% better than the LDA model. the proposed method has a good performance of defect distribution prognosis and can offer reasonable operation advice.

This paper investigates an effective deep learning method known as sparse filtering, which is used to extract features from fault signal directly. And then, the supervised learning method softmax regression is applied to classify the fault types. The training samples are the vibration signals under a certain rotational speed and the test samples are in different rotational speeds. The key parameters of the model are optimized and analyzed through orthogonal experiments and single factor experiment. The diagnosis results show that the sparse filtering model has strong robustness for rotating machinery fault diagnosis in the case of rotating speed fluctuations.

Compared with the single-component systems, the output of control systems may remain satisfactory tracking on the reference output due to the distinctive structure of closed-loop feedback, even if the structural parameters of internal components degenerate. This will result in the inner degradation difficult to detect, showing a characteristic of hidden degradation. In the existing literatures, there are scarce researches on the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction of control systems, which consider the hidden degradation process under the closed-loop feedback control. In this paper, a prediction method of RUL based on analytic model is proposed for a class of deterministic closed-loop control systems only considering actuator degenerating. In addition, there are more factors that affect the reliability of control systems than the single-component systems. This paper considers three-source factors: control constraint, degradation model and random disturbance, which have direct or indirect effects on the systems reliability. Then, the factors are respectively abstracted into a corresponding parameter in the system model for conveniently discussing their specific influence on the results of RUL prediction.

Considering the collective anomaly data to be detected sensitively, this paper presents a symbolic approach and applies it to anomaly detection of gas turbine subsystem. The trained finite state machine evaluates the posterior probabilities of observed symbol sequence. Thus, an anomaly detection strategy based on FSM estimation is used to detect the defects. Experimental results indicate that, despite the high performance of the model, the robustness of the model is strong, especially within a certain sequence length. Therefore, the proposed method can be a good way to promote the existing anomaly detection performance in gas turbine subsystem.

The wear of the hydraulic pump is the main cause for the performance degradation of the aircraft hydraulic system. In this paper, changing of oil return flow in hydraulic system under the wear condition of slipper and cylinder bore is studied. Firstly, the factor and mechanism of the degradation of the hydraulic system which caused by wear are analyzed. Then the degradation model is established by the co-simulation of Simulink and AMESim. Finally, multi-step support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is adopted to predict the failure of the aero-hydraulic pump and the remaining useful life (RUL) of the system. The results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the established wear model.

Statistics show that 75% of hydraulic system mechanical failures are caused by oil contamination. During the normal working condition of hydraulic equipment, the particles in hydraulic oil have a constant concentration and small size. When abnormal wear occurs, the concentration and the size of particles will increase rapidly. Compared with conventional hydraulic system, marine hydraulic system works in a harsh environment, so it requires high clean hydraulic oil. The qualitative detection and quantitative counting of oil particle contamination is of important significance to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of the marine machineries. A novel inductance/ capacitance microfluidic chip is presented for the detection of multi-contamination in marine hydraulic oil in this paper. The microfluidic chip consists of d a straight microchannel with two embedded single-layer inductance coils, which is not only a micro inductor to detect the inductance changes of the oil but also a micro capacitor to detect the capacitance changes of the oil. In the inductance experiments, iron particles in the size of in the size of 80 to 90 mu m and copper particles in the size of 150 to 160 mu m in the oil are successfully detected and the inductance signals of the two type particles are distinguishable. In the capacitance experiments, water droplets in the size of 180 to 190 mu m and bubbles in the size of 240 to 260 mu m in the hydraulic oil are detected and their signals are also distinguishable. Based on the inductance/capacitance microfluidic chip, an integral micro detection system is presented. The micro detection system is expected to provide supports for fault prognostics and diagnosis in marine hydraulic systems.

Because of its long-life cycle, it should be ensured with a long-term stable operation during the period. Compared to the application equipment on the ground, on-orbit payload is more difficult to get timely maintenance. Since on-orbit payload cannot be manually checked, we can only identify its status through the test point data and observation point data. In this paper, a method of monitoring the health status of on-orbit payload based on fuzzy classification and neural network is proposed to insure the stability of long-term orbit equipment. We choose the test point data and observation point data returned from the payload as the input, and the status of on-orbit payload as the output. The fuzzy neural network is used to assess the health status of the payload in its life span: the normal state, the performance degradation state, or the functional failure state. When aerospace payload is in the performance degradation state, was assess the degree of degradation of the system performance, and grasp the health status information of on-orbit payload. The health status monitor makes PHM (Prognostics and Health Management) more intelligent, so that the system failures can get early diagnosis, prevention and treatment. It can also reduce the cost of payload maintenance, and increase the length of life of on-orbit payload.

Owing to these advantages, deep neural networks (DNNs) are superior to traditional artificial neural networks with shallow architectures, and are thus becoming widely used in the fault diagnosis field. To overcome the difficulties in bearing fault type classification and severity diagnosis, a two-layer hierarchical fault diagnosis network based on sparse DNNs is presented in this paper. In the proposed hierarchical fault diagnosis network, the first layer is responsible for fault type identification, and the second layer is responsible for fault severity diagnosis. An autoregressive (AR) model is established using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to obtain the AR parameters as the input vectors of the proposed diagnosis network. The AR parameters are regarded as the low-level features which are helpful for the diagnosis network mine more useful high-level features. Experiments and comparison analyses are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed hierarchical fault diagnosis network.

In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an optimizing cost-sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM) model. The proposed method is based on cost-sensitive support vector machine. The improved genetic immune particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to select the best regularized constants C+, C-, and kernel function parameter g. This paper use the optimizing CS-SVM proposed to train and predict the bearing vibration signals. The experimental results showed that the CS-SVM can effectively deal with unbalanced small fault class sample in aero-bearing fault diagnosis, it can also improve the diagnosis accuracy of the fault class sample.

This paper proposes a novel fractional-order smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (FrSPWVD) to solve the above problem. The details about step of the calculation are as follows: the appropriate fractional order of original signals are determined firstly; then fractional order Fourier transform transforms the original signals in the most appropriate fractional domain, and transformed signals are analyzed by SPWVD; lastly, parameters of original signals are accurately extracted according to the corresponding appropriate fractional order and fractional frequency of signals. By analyzing the signals in the most appropriate fractional domain, the proposed time-frequency distribution can obtain the time-frequency representation with much higher resolution compared to the classical SPWVD. Simulation results and fault diagnosis cases show the efficiency of the proposed method.

This paper provides three methods to predict the remaining useful life of three-shaft gas turbine engine, which are regression analysis of standard low-pressure turbine outlet temperature, relevance analysis and multiple regression, regression analysis of heat loss index obtained based on mathematical model of gas turbine. Example shows that the three methods all can predict the life. But in the first one the linear regression can't explain the temperature fluctuations well, and the predictions of the quadratic and cubic regression are not consistent with the actual situation. The multiple regression analysis takes the multiple monitoring parameters related to low pressure turbine outlet temperature into account, increasing the adjusted R-squared, but it couldn't consider the influence of compressor washing, and the prediction interval is large, which may not meet the needs of the project. The third method can accurately know and guide the compressor washing time according to certain degradation rate, and can predict remaining useful life effectively, which is a feasible way for gas turbine health assessment and maintenance decision-making.

Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, as one main approach of PHM, provides early warning of failures that can be used to determine the necessary maintenance and replacement of batteries in advance. The existing RUL prediction techniques for lithiumion batteries are inefficient to learn the long-term dependencies of aging characteristics with the degradation evolution. This paper investigates deep-learning-enabled battery RUL prediction. The long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is employed to learn the capacity degradation trajectories of lithium-ion batteries. The LSTM RNN is adaptively optimized using the resilient mean square back-propagation method. The developed LSTM RNN is able to capture the underlying long-term dependencies among the degraded capacities such that an explicitly capacity-oriented RUL predictor is constructed. Experimental data from one lithium-ion battery cell is deployed for model construction and verification. This is the first known application of deep learning theory to battery RUL predictions.

Considering the heteroskedasticity of characteristic signal under the vibration loading, the general time series model cannot describe heteroskedasticity, a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic model (GARCH) is proposed. Firstly, the upper and lower quantiles of the voltage signal are extracted. The failure time is determined by using the upper quantile and the degradation process is analyzed by the lower quantile. Secondly, the Auto-Regressive(AR) is built as the regressive basic model. Thirdly, a GARCH (1,1) model is proposed, which is tested by the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) method, the parameters of the model is estimated by the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Finally, the performance of the presented GARCH based degradation model is examined by real data from experiment, which is compared with the classical AR model according to Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The results suggest that GARCH (1,1) is superior to AR model, presented a theoretical foundation for further study about the degradation modeling of solder joint under vibration loading.

Deep Learning is a major new field in machine learning that encompasses a wide range of neural network architectures designed to perform various tasks. In the thermography energy sector, examples that are processed on a daily basis are sampling of active energy components, focus segmentation, and fault classification. The most popular network architecture for Deep Learning in image analysis is the convolution neural network (CNN), where traditional machine learning methods require determination and calculation, from which the algorithm training comes. Deep Learning approach captures important features as well as the appropriate weight of these attributes to make decision for new data. This paper describes a method and tool that are available to build and conduct an effective analysis of the Deep Learning Method for electrical components.

Due to the non-stationary characteristics of fault signals, empirical mode decomposition and support vector machine (EMD-SVM) arc adopted in the strategy. The load phase voltages are selected as fault detection signals, after preprocessed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), fault signals features are extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) with reduced samples dimensions. Finally, an SVM model is used to classify these faulty samples. Simulation results prove the feasibility and good classification performance of the proposed EMD-SVM strategy.

They directly affect the stability and security of distribution power grid. Dissolved gas analysis (DGA) is a common approach used for operation state identification of distribution transformers. This paper proposes an operation state identification method by using the DGA data measured from the distribution transformers. The proposed method is based on the integration of independent component analysis and support vector machine (ICA-SVM). Firstly, the ICA is performed on the DGA data to extract feature vectors; Then, the feature vectors are served as input of SVM to identify the transformer operation states; Finally, the on-site monitoring DGA data from 110 kV distribution transformers are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

A large-scale automation system like a semiconductor line is composed of multi-agents. Each agent carries out only a given role with autonomy. Therefore, even if an abnormality occurs, it might cause huge accident easily. For quality control, it is necessary to detect such anomalies promptly and take necessary measures, but the system complexity is so high that process managers are unable to detect abnormalities. In order to allow the administrator to quickly recognize the problem situation, we propose an agent that monitors process flow, and detects abnormal flow, and verify its validity using the data.

The fault current of HIF is with low magnitude, non-linear, asymmetrical and random, therefore extracting useful detection features from HIF current and voltage is the key to solve this issue. This paper experiments with 246 conventional electrical features and their combinations and proposes an effective feature set (EFS) via a feature ranking algorithm utilizing simple signal processing technique of discrete Fourier transform and Kalman filter estimation. This EFS is tested in six types of distribution systems and exhibits a promising detection performance in terms of accuracy, dependability and security once a proper pattern recognition classifier is determined. Besides conventional batch learning algorithms, the proposed detection method demonstrates a significant performance in online machine learning environment. Therefore it shows the potential of processing instantaneous signals and updating its prediction model adaptively to detect more HIFs in future smart grid.

The authors propose support vector machine-based classifier with diverse time- and frequency-domain feature models to detect and classify these faults. Three different kernels, i.e., linear, polynomial, and radial-basis function, are employed separately to examine classifier's performance in each case. Furthermore, the respective kernel scales, delta and p of radial-basis function kernel and polynomial kernel, are varied manually to obtain the optimal values. Leave-one-out cross validation is adopted to overcome the overfitting problem. The dataset was acquired from a temperature-to-voltage converter through Matlab and Arduino Uno microcontroller. The efficiency in terms of percent accuracy of proposed time- and frequency-domain feature models can be seen in experimental results.

In essence, simple analytical expressions of over-currents in the two healthy bars adjacent to the broken bars, for a few typical situations, are derived. These calculations should be also instrumental in broken bars diagnosis. The calculated over-currents in case of broken bars have been validated experimentally on an inverted induction machine with stationary cage which allows bar conductivity interruption and direct measurement of multiple bar currents.

This paper introduces different simulation methods of PMSM where finite elements method (FEM) is chosen as computation tools. The logic and problem solving is investigated and positive and negative points are described. Then, the trend of simulation using FEM is explained and a PMSM used in hybrid vehicles is simulated under healthy and faulty conditions and the results are discussed. Finally, short circuit fault in a PMSM is diagnosed using the stator phase currents.

The overhaul for large electrical machine is a costly process; also, unexpected stoppage of product line in factories due to fault leads to huge economical loss. Different methods have been so far proposed for fault diagnosis of large electrical machines. This paper provides comprehensive review of prevalent faults in large electrical machines. These faults include eccentricity fault, rotor broken bar fault and short circuit fault. The impacts of these faults on the vibration signal of machines are surveyed. Analytical method based on air gap magnetic field in presence of different kind of fault is used to extract vibration signal. Finally, distinctive efficient methods for condition monitoring of large electrical machine using vibration signal is introduced and their competency are compared to each other.

A simple solution to upgrade existing machinery is required. With the proposed age estimation of electronic devices a first step towards such a system is taken. A test setup for accelerated aging of switched mode power supplies as well as a software defined radio based system for data acquisition is proposed. The necessary steps to transfer the measured samples into frequency domain and to prepare the data for evaluation with an artificial neural network are discussed. Two experiments are performed with the proposed test setup and neural network architecture, yielding promising results. With the two experiments the validity of the proposed approach is shown and further research is encouraged. Finally, a number of future steps are discussed.

Since increased complexity and critical operation states could foster fault occurrence, this paper investigates faults in elastically-actuated robots. To identify and assess relevant faults, expert opinions from an online survey are statistically evaluated and methodological analyses are performed considering a practical example. A variable torsion stiffness actuator is therefore examined by a function and structure analysis that feeds a failure mode and effects analysis. Beyond confirming the results of previous studies, the analyses in this paper substantiate the potential relevance of faults in the elastic elements and that faults might have crucial effect on human-machine interaction in general. From a methodological perspective, failure mode and effects analysis appears very suitable for fault analysis in systems engineering.

The approach starts from dynamic clustering results and, combining the information about operational modes, automatically generates a discrete event system that improves clustering results interpretability for decision-making purposes and enhances fault detection capabilities by the inclusion of event related dynamics. The generated timed discrete event system is adaptive thanks to the dynamic nature of the clusterer from which it was learned, namely DyClee. The timed discrete event system brings valuable temporal information to distinguish behaviors that are non-diagnosable based solely on the clustering itself.

The technique proposes the study of side-band frequencies, which are generated due to fault conditions within the machine. These side-band frequencies are later analyzed using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT). In the present work, the two different fault conditions namely Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) and Stator Winding Fault (SWF) are jointly analyzed, as a novel approach. The results have been compared with the fault diagnosis of healthy machine. This contribution can be helpful in further carrying out study on prognostics of the machines, and in reducing the unscheduled breakdown while increasing the reliability of the machine.

C	Leeke, M			IEEE	Leeke, Matthew			Simultaneous Fault Models for the Generation of Efficient Error Detection Mechanisms	2017 IEEE 28TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SOFTWARE RELIABILITY ENGINEERING (ISSRE)	Proceedings International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	28th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering	OCT 23-26, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, CNRS, LAAS, IEEE Reliabil Soc, CNRS, Univ Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Ceatech List, Nokia Bell Labs, Groupement Rech, Gelnie Programmat Logicel, INSA Toulouse		Detection; Error; Fault; Injection; Machine Learning	DESIGN	The application of machine learning to software fault injection data has been shown to be an effective approach for the generation of efficient error detection mechanisms (EDMs). However, such approaches to the design of EDMs have invariably adopted a fault model with a single-fault assumption, limiting the practical relevance of the detectors and their evaluation. Software containing more than a single fault is commonplace, with prominent safety standards recognising that critical failures are often the result of unlikely or unforeseen combinations of faults. This paper addresses this shortcoming, demonstrating that it is possible to generate similarly efficient EDMs under more realistic fault models. In particular, it is shown that (i) efficient EDMs can be designed using fault data collected under models accounting for the occurrence of simultaneous faults, (ii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can yield improvements to EDM efficiency, and (iii) exhaustive fault injection under a simultaneous bit flip model can made non-exhaustive, reducing the resource costs of experimentation to practicable levels, without sacrificing resultant EDM efficiency.

Classification of Bearing Faults using Extreme Learning Machine Algorithm	2017 IEEE 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM IN ROBOTICS AND MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION (ROMA)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 3rd International Symposium in Robotics and Manufacturing Automation (ROMA)	SEP 19-21, 2017	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA			Classification; Bearing Faults; ELM; BP; Algorithm	DIAGNOSIS	Roller element bearing fault diagnosis is crucial in industry to maintain that the machine is in good condition so that there is no delay of work due to machine breakdown. This paper discusses the use of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm to classify bearing faults. The performance of ELM is compared with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm. It was found that the results show that the ELM has smaller training error rate and testing error rate as compared to BP. ELM also required lesser time to train the neural network and at the same time, able to achieve higher accuracy than BP. Overall, the performance of ELM is encouraging.

The conventional methods for prognosis and reliability monitoring are mostly based on parametric measurements as on state resistance, threshold voltage, leakage currents etc. The change in switching characteristics of aged devices and the root cause analysis behind this change are also worth exploring for degradation monitoring. In this paper, a real-time monitoring procedure is proposed using readily available system microcontroller. For this purpose, an accelerated aging test bench is utilized to actively swing the junction temperature through power cycles in order to trigger device degradation. A number of parametric measurement results are presented for degradation discussion and turn on time variation are captured by proposed degradation monitoring approach.

This scheme can be practically employed by applying Peak Current Mode (PCM) control technique with an excessive ramp signal. Flyback topology having low cost, minimal components which provides isolation too is being selected over other topologies. By employing PCM on the Flyback converter, dynamics has been controlled both at the input and output terminals because of the position of inductor at input node. Stability analysis has been explained with help of Bode plots of system transfer function clearly showing the removal of RHS pole which occurs due to solar PV as input source. A 60 W hardware protype of Flyback converter has been built to test the proposed scheme. Results clearly show the generated outputs with a better cross regulation over a V-pv range of 60-120V.

Therefore, the technology of condition monitoring and fault recognition for wind turbines gearboxes is becoming a hot topic. A condition monitoring and fault recognition system (CMFRS) is presented for CBM of wind turbines gearboxes in this paper. The vibration signals from acceleration sensors at different locations of gearbox and the data from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system are collected to CMFRS. Then the feature extraction and optimization algorithm is applied to these operational data. Furthermore, to recognize the fault of gearboxes, the GSO-LSSVR algorithm is proposed, combining the least squares support vector regression machine (LSSVR) with the Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) algorithm. Finally, the results show that the fault recognition system used in this paper has a high rate for identifying three states of wind turbines' gears; besides, the combination of date features can affect the identifying rate and the selection optimization algorithm presented in this paper can get a pretty good date feature subset for the fault recognition.

In this paper, behavior of different characteristic parameters of the PD activity recorded in the oil-pressboard insulation with needle-plate electrode under 1: 1 mixed AC-DC voltage is investigated. Based on the hierarchical cluster analysis with six feature parameters including maximum amplitude of apparent charge in pC (Q(max)), average amplitude of apparent charge in pC (Q(ave)), PD repetition rate (N), maximum PD interval (d(max)), pulse equivalent time (T-eq) and pulse equivalent frequency (F-eq), the PD development process can be divided into five stages: initial stage (IS), transition stage (TS), developing stage (DS), steady stage (SS), pre-breakdown stage (PS). The possible physical effects of the identified PD development stages are discussed and the radar maps with the six feature parameters are analyzed. The radar maps have different shapes in different PD development stages. The barycenter-coordinate ratio and depth-width ratio of the radar map are extracted as the new features for recognition of PD development stage. Based on least square support vector machine with particle swarm optimization (PSO), the recognizer for PD development stages is designed.

However, its partial discharge failure usually cause serious consequences. It is necessary to monitor SF6 insulated power equipment operation state by detecting and analyzing the gas decomposition components with the aid of pattern recognition algorithm. The method of fault diagnosis and condition evaluation for GIS by measuring and analyzing SF6 decomposition components possess the ability to resist the electromagnetic interference and high sensitivity. Many existing algorithms proposed realize fault diagnosis and prediction of SF6 insulated power equipment mainly by calculating the ratio of the gas decomposition products which easily lead to low accuracy. This paper proposes a new diagnosis method based on the support vector machine (SVM) and improved k-NN algorithm which can accurately classify various partial discharge faults and have made predictions aimed at estimating their fault state levels and demonstrates its effectiveness and superior performance by applying an example of experiment.

In recent years, machine learning and data mining have proven to be efficient techniques in determining root cause from the problematic functional test result, especially when the integrated circuits (IC) are becoming increasingly highly-integrated. However, the test results are sometimes unavailable due to either abnormal ending of the test sequence or occasional system failures, which results in a decreased performance of data-driven diagnosis systems. In this paper, we propose a data imputation algorithm to predict the missing entries in the functional test result, by considering the correlation between test items with conditional specification. We evaluate our data imputation algorithm over the test results collected from three different stages of functional test on a line card used in the telecommunication system. The result shows that our proposed data imputation algorithm consistently outperforms other imputation techniques with various data-driven approaches in terms of diagnosing the root cause, increasing the diagnosis accuracy by an average of 28.13% compared to none data imputation, and 9.74% compared to the naive pass imputation.

Detecting and Mitigating Faults in Cloud Computing Environment	2017 3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (CICT)			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Technology (CICT)	FEB 09-10, 2017	ABES Engn Coll, Ghaziabad, INDIA	IEEE	ABES Engn Coll	Fault Tolerance (FT); Injection; Detection and Mitigation	MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Distributed Systems have swiftly evolved from net-work of personal computers to cluster and then to grid, moving on to the era of cloud computing and now the latest one as Inter-net of things (IoT). With these rapid enhancements, the scale and complexity of systems providing cloud computing services have also increased tremendously. The major challenge faced by cloud service providers today is to provide an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable solution for seamless delivery of services to users. To achieve this research community is constantly working hard on different related issues like scheduling, power consumption, high availability, customer retention, resource provisioning, reliability and minimizing the probability of failures, etc. Reliability of service is an important parameter. With a large number of components in the cloud, the probability of failures is becoming a norm rather than an exception while delivering services to users. This emphasizes the need to develop fault tolerant schemes for cloud environment to deliver the required level of reliability. In this work, we have proposed a novel fault detection and mitigation approach. The novelty of approach lies in the method of detecting the fault based on running status of the job. The detection algorithm periodically monitors the progress of job on virtual machines (VMs) and reports the stalled job due to failed VM to fault tolerant manager (FTM). This not only reduces the resources wastage but ensures timely delivery of services to avoid any penalty due to service level agreement (SLA) violation. The validation of the proposed approach is done using CloudSim simulator. The performance analysis reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The objective of this paper is to introduce a parametric method Artificial Neural Network based Autoencoder implemented to perform early fault detection of a machinery equipment. The performance of this method is then compared to one of the industry state of the art nonparametric methods called Similarity Based Modeling. The comparison is done by analyzing the implementation result on both artificial and real case dataset. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is applied to measure the performance. Based on the result of the research, both of these methods are effective to do pattern recognition and able to identify data anomaly or in this case is fault identification.

While much attention has been given to detect faults in these mechanical devices, real-time fault diagnosis for streaming vibration data from turbine gearboxes still remains an outstanding problem. Moreover, monitoring gearboxes in a wind farm with thousands of wind turbines requires massive computational power. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction algorithm to diagnose wind turbines' fault using vibration signal. We also implemented the whole system on an Apache Spark, a distributed framework for processing stream data. Using Spark clustering enables the fault diagnosis system to scale to large wind farms. The proposed algorithm has been tested by real-world wind turbine data under a different number of input sources, and an accuracy of 98.93% was obtained. Furthermore, a runtime analysis was done to evaluate the effect of parallelization using Spark stream processing.

Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose stroke in the early stage and give accurate prognosis assessment to improve stroke management. This study tried to automatically classify AIS severity based on EEG signals by using digital signal processing such as Wavelet transform and feedforward type of neural network with ELM algorithm. In this study, Delta Alpha Ratio (DAR), (Delta+Theta)/(Alpha+Beta) Ratio (DTABR) and Brain Symmetry Index (BSI)'s value were used as the ELM input feature score, which were obtained by using Wavelet transformation (Daubechies 4) and Welch's method to classify the acute ischemic stroke severity which refers to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). It had shown that the performance of system test accuracy, the sensitivity and specificity were above 72%. These results were useful for classifying AIS based on EEG signals.

Among open-circuit faults, those in power switches of voltage source converters (VSCs) are the most common ones. Nevertheless, in other cases a poor connection or incipient faults may cause an imbalance in the value of the stator resistances. In this case the phase is not open but this anomalous situation requires detection and eventual isolation. This phenomenon is usually called resistance dissymmetry and it leads to current imbalance that in turn reduces efficiency and produces overheating. Moreover, the variation of the machine parameter is an important issue in those control methods based on the machine model, as it is the case in model predictive control (MPC). For this reason, this work presents a resistance dissymmetry detection method based on the vector space decomposition (VSD), implemented together with a MPC-based six-phase induction motor drive. Simulation results are employed to validate the goodness of the proposed method.	[Rios-Garcia, N.; Gonzalez-Prieto, I.; Duran, M.

Among these studies, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees and other supervised learning methods are used commonly. These methods can detect the failure of rolling bearing effectively, but to achieve better detection results, it often requires a lot of training samples. Based on above, a novel clustering method is proposed in this paper. This novel method is able to find the correct number of clusters automatically the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method can accurately detect the fault types of small samples. Meanwhile, the diagnosis results are also relative high accuracy even for massive samples.

In this method, the original vibration signal passes through MMV-CS framework to obtain compressed samples that possess the quality of the original vibration signals. Afterwards FS algorithm is applied to select the most important features of the compressed samples to reduce the computational cost, and remove irrelevant and redundant features. Finally, the compressed samples with selected features enters SVM classifier for fault classification. Six different conditions including; two healthy conditions (NO) and (NW), and four faulty conditions contains, inner race (IR), outer race (OR), rolling element (RE), and cage (CA) are investigated. The classification results achieved using our proposed method show high classification accuracy with reduced feature set that outperform some results from literature.	[Ahmed, H. O. A.; Nandi, A.

System Abnormality Detection in Stock Market Complex Trading Systems Using Machine Learning Techniques	2017 NATIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (NITC)			English	Proceedings Paper	2017 National Information Technology Conference (NITC)	SEP 14-15, 2017	Colombo, SRI LANKA			machine learning; supervised learning; distributed systems		Stock market trading systems are real time systems that process thousands of data per minute and are considered to be critical as well as complex. It incorporates the features of complex business processing and sophisticated in-memory processing techniques for speed and throughput. These systems are distributed in nature, and they use a large number of processing nodes incorporating fault tolerance mechanisms. Complex systems also have a large effective number of strongly interdependent variables. Hence detecting faults and failures in stock market systems is a complex and cumbersome task. The study explores machine learning techniques to detect anomalous behavior to provide warnings before a system results in a fault or failure state. The study extensively utilizes a supervised learning approach with machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naive Bayes, and ensemble techniques; bagging and Random Forest. The system statistics captured from log files are preprocessed and transformed to eliminate system environment dependencies. For each of the three components the initial feature selection is carried out manually using domain knowledge and expertise. Initial feature selection based on domain expertise was required as the number of features per component is large and does not closely relate to the system state. Feature selection methods (Info Gain algorithm with Ranker search) have been successfully employed to filter out unrelated attributes and to reduce computational complexity. A comparative evaluation is performed under each component status prediction. This study also utilizes oversampling techniques to overcome limitations caused by the class imbalance phenomena. A range of evaluators are used to analyze the results and effectiveness of the models. The highest accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values are achieved when C4.5 decision tree is applied to the oversampled feature set and when the Random Forest algorithm is applied to the oversampled feature set. However, precision, recall and F-measure values vary. Root cause detection for anomalies and numeric values for system health predictions are future work in the research.	[Samarakoon, P.

The fundamental 50 Hz frequency component of the three stator current signals (SCSs) are estimated using three sets of modified-adaptive notch filters (M-ANFs) and the residual signals are extracted. The total harmonic signals (THSs) of the zero sequence component (ZSC) of the residual signals is then used as a new signal for fault diagnosis purpose. The dominant fundamental frequency is eliminated in the spectrum of the new diagnostic signal. This effectively results in amplification of the side bands of interest among other frequency components in the spectrum. Laboratory experiments were conducted with the motor operating at two different load conditions and test results confirm the efficacy of the proposed method in diagnosis of bar breakage.

However, most of the existing fault diagnosis methods are based on a single-mode process and are not adapted to multimode processes. To solve the problem that the fault is difficult to diagnose in the multimode process and improve the efficiency of the fault diagnosis, this paper proposes an ensemble fault diagnosis approach based on variational modal decomposition (VMD), improved fuzzy c-means clustering for just in time learning (IJITL) and recursive least squares support vector machine(RLSSVM). First VMD is introduced to denoise the collected data, and then IJTL method is used for modal distinction, and finally RLSSVM is designed to achieve fault diagnosis. Experimental simulation is carried out in the process of continuous stirring heater (CSTH). The simulation results show that the ensemble method improves the diagnostic efficiency and performance.

However, the risk of damage or loss of property for unmanned underwater vehicle is often a major concern and thruster had been found to be the most common source of faults. Based on the audio recordings using a hydrophone on different thruster's state such as broken propeller fin and propeller entangled with seaweed, fundamental frequency (by YIN fundamental frequency estimator), pitch and root-mean squared (RMS) are extracted for multi-level extreme learning machine (ELM) to perform classification of thruster's faults. However, multi-level machine learning is often built on binary classification for each level with same parameters for each level may not be the most optimal to build a multi-level machine learning. In this paper, a new framework for multi-level ELM is developed using chi-square value that can obtain the optimal parameters from the list of inputs at each level using least number of parameters. Based on this framework, ELM can achieve a 100% accuracy and a comparison to different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine using the same parameters show similar accuracy.

The demand for cost efficient, reliable and safe rotating machinery requires accurate fault diagnosis, classification and prognosis systems. This work presents a study to explore the performances of bearing fault diagnosis by using wavelet neural network classifier. The features vector required for the training and testing of neural network are calculated by the implementation of a wavelet packet. The statistical features such as standard deviation, kurtosis, central moment, wavelet energy and other statistical parameters of vibration signals was run in its normal condition and abnormal operating mode were used as input to ANN classifier. The results show that the statistical parameters identified the fault categories of rolling element bearing accurately and has a good diagnosis performance.

The main signature used is the stator currents to envelope in the analysis of this kind of fault. Moreover, the envelope analysis of the stator currents is calculated based on the Hilbert Transform. Then, Fast Fourier Transform are introduced to extract the fault components. However, the technique used for improving the fault detection technique is based on the neural network. Finally, the results of the stator currents envelope spectrum (the amplitude Am and frequency integral(m) of the harmonic) shows an efficient of detection under varying loads condition. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified by simulation tests.

Static Eccentricity Fault Detection of Induction Motors using MVSA, MCSA and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)	2017 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING - BOUMERDES (ICEE-B)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Electrical Engineering - Boumerdes (ICEE-B)	OCT 29-31, 2017	Boumerdes, ALGERIA			air gap eccentricity fault; discrete wavelet transform (DWT); motor current signature analysis (MCSA); spectrum analysis (FFT); motor vibration signature analysis (MVSA)	BROKEN ROTOR BARS; WINDING FAULTS; DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; INDEXES; MODEL	The aim of the present paper is to diagnose the mechanical faults in induction motors. We have chosen this part in order to contribute to the diagnosis of electrical machines. The raising of stator current allows detecting the fatigue of the machine failure. The manner of the treatment decides the efficiency of the applied technique. We have examined the static eccentricity fault by a vibration signal analysis. Motor vibration signature analysis (MVSA) is a large part for detecting faults in electric machines. The use of motor current signature analysis (MCSA) gives adequate information about the fault type. In this paper, the fast Fourier transforms (MCSA-FFT) and the discrete wavelet transform (MCSA-DWT) are applied to analyze the stator current. In this study a comparison has been made between the three methods which we have used to arrive at a good decision about a static eccentricity fault. In this present paper, experimental results were analyzed under a healthy and faulty machine.	[Bessous, Noureddine; Zouzou, S.

DWT method was based on analyzing the stator current. DWT coefficients of the stator current in a particular frequency band are calculated and analyzed. We used the wavelet mother of Daubechies to analyze the stator current under the eccentricity fault. But, the DWT cannot precise the type of fault. This proposes strategy based on one numerical value (Mean square error) which eliminates the vision to signals shape. This new study treats the experimental results were analyzed for induction motors under the eccentricity fault.	[Bessous, Noureddine; Sbaa, Salim; Zouzou, S.

The proposed method contains two steps. Firstly, the fact that large deviation may emerge as a result of the empirical risk inspires the idea of an improved transductive least square support vector machine (T-LSSVM) which aims at obtaining the best hyperplane that equipped with the maximum margin to the support vectors no matter whether the samples are labeled or unlabeled. Secondly, to overcome the drawback of typical T-LSSVM, i.e., sensitivity to local minima, a laplcian-transductive least squares support vector machine (Lap-T-LSSVM) is proposed which can perform the fault diagnosis via a laplcian. The experiment adopts band-pass filter circuit as diagnosis object. Simulation results verify that the proposed method is superior to previous SVM in accuracy.

Recently, the in-orbit management work of spacecraft in China focuses on fault detection and diagnosis, whereas the spacecraft's health management technology stays in the framework study status. For the spacecraft's health monitoring, the theory and algorithm are important to support practical engineering. Therefore, this paper introduces the profust-reliability-based health monitoring method into the in-orbit management work of spacecraft. This method analyzes telemetry parameters of spacecraft, and calculates the profust reliability of telemetry parameters, component, and system, respectively. Then, the health level of the spacecraft is classified according to the calculated profust reliability value. This method provides a new thought to the in-orbit management work of spacecraft. The simulation result shows that this method can effectively evaluate the health status of spacecraft system.

It can be used as a feature extractor in an unsupervised way. In process diagnosis area, the Sparse Class Gaussian Restrict Boltzmann Machine is developed as a discriminative nonlinear feature extractor for classification in order to solve the discriminative task. Moreover, for the purpose of overcoming the overfitting and raising the training efficiency, a sparse constraint for the hidden layer is added during the training time. The experimental results based on TE process benchmark successfully demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms the MLP classifier, and other GRBM based models, moreover, the sparse constraint employed has a positive effect on the classification performance.

Among various degradation modeling and RUL estimating methods, Wiener process based models recognized by both scholars and engineers as the one of the most effect tools, and thus becomes very popular nowadays. In this paper, a prognostic approach is developed for degrading systems whose performance evolution is capture by an integration of Wiener process and cumulative-type of random shocks depicted by a compound Poisson pro-cess. Under the concept of first hitting time, an approximate lifetime distribution in analytical form, which greatly reduces the computing time while proving an adequately accurate result, has been formulated. The parameter estimation framework based expectation maximization (EM) algorithm has been derived. Simulations and case study of the degradation of Li-ion batteries are executed to illustrate and validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the approach in this paper can not only handle the positive shocks but also process the negative shocks, which outperforms most of the existing models.

Accurate Rotor Fault Detection in Doubly-Fed Wound-Rotor Induction Machine	2017 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLEAN ELECTRICAL POWER (ICCEP): RENEWABLE ENERGY IMPACT	International Conference on Clean Electrical Power		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Clean Electrical Power (ICCEP)	JUN 27-29, 2017	Santa Margherita Ligure, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Power Energy Soc, IES, IEEE Jas, ICCEP, ABB, Univ Birmingham, Dept Elettronica Informazione Bioingegneria		Induction machines; electrical faults; transient operating conditions; fault diagnosis	CONNECTIONS	Rotor fault diagnosis techniques developed for induction machines (IMs) are classically based on current spectral analysis (CSA). For the case of rotor asymmetry in Wound-Rotor Induction Machine (WRIM), the magnitude of the negative sequence component at -sf of the rotor current space-vector is commonly monitored in order to quantify its contribution. Nevertheless, CSA still has some limitations. In fact, under speed-varying conditions, an effective frequency analysis using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm cannot be applied, since slip is varying, and then the magnitude of the rotor fault component -sf is also varying. In the present paper, a new approach based on Voltage Space vector Signature Analysis (VSSA) is presented for accurate rotor High Resistance Connection (HRC) fault detection in WRIM under speed-varying operating conditions. The reliability of the presented diagnosis technique is validated by numerical simulations. The proposed technique can be easily implemented in the control platform of any modern wind power plants, for online rotor fault monitoring.

The process has three stages. The first stage uses a genetic algorithm to find a set of feature subsets for building an ensemble of acurated and diversified classifiers. The second stage uses a particle swarm optimization algorithm for tuning the SVM hyperparameters applied on each feature subset. The third stage uses the clonal selection algorithm or the simulated annealing algorithm for selecting the classifiers that compose the final ensemble. Experiments were performed on data extracted from vibration signals of oil rigs motor pumps. The results show that the proposed method is more efficient than others well-established methods applied to this problem.

Various extreme learning machines (ELMs) including standard ELM, kernel ELMs and online sequential ELM (OS-ELM) are used along with the parallel strategy for multi-step prognosis. These multistep predictors are trained by means of constant current Li-ion battery datasets. The attained results present the effectiveness of these MSPS techniques in the long-term prediction of the remaining useful life of the Li-ion batteries. Besides, the OSELM predictor outperforms other techniques in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE) and the RUL estimation error.

The focus of this research is to accurately model and diagnose the local demagnetization fault in a Surface mount Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (SPMM). The techniques used here for fault detection is based on time-frequency based signal analysis mainly Hilbert Huang Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform. In addition to this, the proposed research deals with torque analysis and also analyzes the machine current using symmetrical components. The main aim of this research is to identify the appropriate technique that would be able to pinpoint the fault even when the fault passes undetected referring the level of the fault to be very low. For simulation purpose, a 3-phase, low speed SPMM was modelled in a FEA platform using Maxwell 17.	[Jeyasankar, Elango; Ahsanullah, Kazi; Xu Zhenzhen; Panda, S.

In addition, the harmonic speed controller provides information that can be used for the estimation of the load torque and for a diagnostic procedure aiming to detect single-point defects in bearings. The variable mechanical load is driven by an inverter fed Surfacemounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine, which is controlled by using a sensorless scheme.

Numerous studies have reported tumor subtypes that consider different characteristics on individual patients, which may play important roles in determining the survival rates in GBM. In this study, we present a pathway-based clustering method using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), called R-PathCluster, for identifying unknown subtypes with pathway markers of gene expressions. In order to assess the performance of R-PathCluster, we conducted experiments with several clustering methods such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and RBM models with different input data. R-PathCluster showed the best performance in clustering longterm and short-term survivals, although its clustering score was not the highest among them in experiments. R-PathCluster provides a solution to interpret the model in biological sense, since it takes pathway markers that represent biological process of pathways. We discussed that our findings from R-PathCluster are supported by many biological literatures.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is one of the most important prognostic indicators for melanoma survival. We present several machine learning models for predicting SLN metastasis using data from a real-world dermatology electronic health record (EHR) system. The class label is the result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, an elective procedure that can be performed for newly-diagnosed melanoma patients to determine if there is metastasis in the nearest lymph node. We show that a simple model, using solely Breslow thickness, can achieve predictive performance (AUC = 0.769) comparable to a logistic regression model using 5 features (AUC = 0.772, p = 0.518). Current clinical recommendations are to perform a biopsy for patients with melanomas thicker than 1mm, however, when applying this 1mm threshold to the simple thickness model, it achieves 0% sensitivity for melanomas <1mm. Using a random forest model, we achieve 78.9% sensitivity (p < 0.001) for melanomas <1mm. Our study shows that the probability of sentinel lymph node positivity is indeed linearly correlated to the tumor thickness (R-2 = 0.934), and that machine learning models can effectively detect thin melanomas that warrant an SLN biopsy.

One of a critical step to identify target molecules is to determine the most representative features for different patient's sub-groups. Breast cancer, one of the most heterogeneous cancer has five main subtypes, so accurately identify gene signatures associated with intrinsic subtypes based on currently available data resource will benefit for precision medicine. Traditional ways to identify subtypespecific targeted molecular biomarkers are based on the platforms such as microarray, or immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers. Very few studies using RNAseq data to predict cancer subtype, due to the limited data resource. Gene expression in RNAseq platform is highly correlated with the microarray. However, it shows superior benefits than microarray in many ways, such as detection of low abundance transcripts, the broader dynamic range of gene expression in both coding and non-coding genes. Therefore, RNAseq platform will become the predominant tool for transcriptome analysis in the long term. To benefit the identification of molecule targets for transcriptomic data including RNAseq and microarray expression, we developed a new feature selection method. Our results of classification accuracy for intrinsic subtypes and prognostic evaluation of selected genes outperform than the traditional PAM50 gene signature, which is derived from microarray and widely used in clinical practice.

This paper introduces a method to diagnose systems with respect to the constraints of the aeronautics field: robustness and low computation costs. The proposed methodology is based on the combination of Support Vector Machine and Fuzzy Membership Functions (SVM-MBF). The distances, which are computed by the SVM, are fuzzified in order to give a degree of confidence in the classification. Besides, using SVM-MBF allows estimating the severity of a fault. The architecture of the proposed diagnosis system consists in putting in series one classifier to detect faults, with a set of classifiers, one per fault, to assess the severity. The method is applied to the diagnosis of inter-turn short-circuits of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM). The data come from measurements performed on a machine designed for aeronautics applications. The method is evaluated in terms of robustness and computation time by using cross validation. The results show the suitability of the methodology for aeronautics applications and to the path of onboard diagnosis algorithm.

Firstly, a dual-entropy and holder coefficient algorithm was proposed to extract the health status feature vector from the bearing vibration signals, and secondly a gray relation algorithm was used to achieve bearing fault diagnosis intelligently based on the extracted feature vector. The experimental analysis has demonstrated the proposed approach can simply and efficiently recognize various bearing fault types as well as severities with good real-time performance.

A reduced 88 kV power distribution network is modelled in Digsilent Power Factory. Transient fault current signals of various types of faults are then subsequently obtained through an Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) study on the model. A Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to extract features from transient fault currents measured at the source terminal of the network. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in order to detect and classify various types of faults. The method uses the first two cycles of the transient fault current measured at the source terminal after the fault inception. A hybrid technique using DWT and SVM is thus proposed. The feasibility of the proposed technique is tested using Matlab. The results of the proposed fault feature extraction, detection and classification technique showed that various types of faults in a power distribution network can be detected and classified accurately.

C	Walinjkar, A; Woods, J			IEEE	Walinjkar, Amit; Woods, John			ECG Classification and Prognostic Approach towards Personalized Healthcare	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, WEARABLE AND WEB ANALYTICS (SOCIAL MEDIA)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Social Media, Wearable And Web Analytics (Social Media)	JUN 19-20, 2017	London, ENGLAND			ECG classification; Wearable IoT; preventive health-care; real-time ECG; arrhythmia detection; arrhythmia Neural-Net; MITDB; Physionet; GP Connect; HL7; FHIR	HEART; FORMS; FHIR; RISK	A very important aspect of personalized health-care is to continuously monitor an individual's health using wearable biomedical devices and essentially to analyse and if possible to predict potential health hazards that may prove fatal if not treated in time. The prediction aspect embedded in the system helps in avoiding delays in providing timely medical treatment, even before an individual reaches a critical condition. Despite of the availability of modern wearable health monitoring devices, the real-time analyses and prediction component seems to be missing with these devices. The research work illustrated in this paper, at an outset, focussed on constantly monitoring an individual's ECG readings using a wearable 3-lead ECG kit and more importantly focussed on performing real-time analyses to detect arrhythmia to be able to identify and predict heart risk. Also, current research shows extensive use of heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and machine learning for arrhythmia classification, which however depends on the morphology of the ECG waveforms and the sensitivity of the ECG equipment. Since a wearable 3-lead ECG kit was used, the accuracy of classification had to be dealt with at the machine learning phase, so a unique feature extraction method was developed to increase the accuracy of classification. As a case study a very widely used Arrhythmia database (MIT-BIH, Physionet) was used to develop learning, classification and prediction models. Neuralnet fitting models on the extracted features showed mean-squared error of as low as 0.0085 and regression value as high as 0.99. Current experiments show 99.4% accuracy using k-NN Classification models and show values of Cross-Entropy Error of 7.6 and misclassification error value of 1.2 on test data using scaled conjugate gradient pattern matching algorithms. Software components were developed for wearable devices that took ECG readings from a 3-Lead ECG data acquisition kit in real time, de-noised, filtered and relayed the sample readings to the telehealth analytical server. The analytical server performed the classification and prediction tasks based on the trained classification models and could raise appropriate alarms if ECG abnormalities of V (Premature Ventricular Contraction: PVC), A (Atrial Premature Beat: APB), L (Left bundle branch block beat), R (Right bundle branch block beat) type annotations in MITDB were detected. The instruments were networked using IoT (Internet of Things) devices and abnormal ECG events related to arrhythmia, from analytical server could be logged using an FHIR web service implementation, according to a SNOMED coding system and could be accessed in Electronic Health Record by the concerned medic to take appropriate and timely decisions.

Inter-Turn Short Circuit Fault Analysis of PWM Inverter Fed Three-Phase Induction Motor Using Finite Element Method	PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUIT ,POWER AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCPCT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Circuit ,Power and Computing Technologies (ICCPCT)	APR 20-21, 2017	Kollam, INDIA	Baselios Mathews II Coll Engn, IEEE		PWM inverter; inter-turn fault; finite element method; radial air gap flux density; transient analysis		This paper deals with the inter-turn short circuit fault analysis of Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) inverter fed three-phase Induction Motor (IM) using Finite Element Method (FEM). The short circuit in the stator winding of a 3-phase IM start with an inter-turn fault and if left undetected it progresses to a phase-phase fault or phase-ground fault. In main fed IM a popular technique known as Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is used to detect the inter-turn fault. But if the machine is fed from PWM inverter MCSA fails, due to high frequency inverter switching, the current spectrum will be rich in noise causing the fault detection difficult. An electromagnetic field analysis of inverter fed IM is carried out with 25% and 50% of stator winding inter-turn short circuit fault severity using FEM. The simulation is carried out on a 2.2kW IM using Ansys Maxwell Finite Element Analysis (FEA) tool. Comparisons are made on the various electromagnetic field parameters like flux lines distribution, flux density, radial air gap flux density between a healthy and faulty (25% & 50% severity) IM.

Various kinds of troubles are occurring in the nuclear power plant to the livelihood belongingness by creating extreme amount of temperature. Thus, the nuclear machine becomes the powerful task to overcome hazardous causes. By using the sensor devices the data's are collected and this is used to the nuclear power plant to examine the ecological factors like heat, pressure, vibration and humidity. By using the sensor the values are calculated using the nuclear power and these values requires to be communicating with the server station improvement in order to acquire proper action on correct time. On the other hand, some unwanted persons corrupt the sensor estimated values by using the DDoS attacks earlier than the values are reaching it to the server station. Therefore, in urgent situation too there is no possibility to take the necessary action. In the previous work, to overcome the trouble of DDoS attacks the Firecol structure is introduced. On the other hand, this work capacity is short of in the network performance deprivation where the traffic difference occurs due to the network failure will also be considered a DDoS attacks. The Improved Detection and Prevention of DDoS attacks based on Network Variation ( IDP-DDOS-NV) are implemented in the present work and it is used to overcome the trouble of DDoS attacks and protected the routing tasks. With the help of various transactions the fault can be identified in every sensor nodes and set in the nuclear power plant is measured in this present work. The DDoS attack id is separated from the network failure attacks based on the error variation value. Therefore, the protected routing with the avoidance of the DDoS attacks is ensured in the present research work. By using the NS2 simulation the entire work is estimated under different performance calculation from which it is proved that the proposed research work guides to give good outcome compared to the previous techniques.

Although, this model has shown to be promising and greatly adopted by industry, the state of the art only assumes that replicas can crash and recover. However, a Byzantine replica (i.e., arbitrary or malicious) can hamper the eventual convergence of replicas to a global consistent state, thus compromising the entire service. Classical BFT state machine replication protocols cannot solve this problem due to the blocking nature of consensus, something at odd with the availability via replica divergence in the EC model. In this work in progress paper, we introduce a new secure highly available protocol for the EC model that assumes a fraction of replicas and any client can be Byzantine. To respect the essence of EC, the protocol gives priority to high availability, and thus Byzantine detection is performed off the critical path on a consistent data offset. The paper concisely explains the protocol and discusses its feasibility. We aim at presenting a more comprehensive and empirical study in the future.

At incipient stage of fault, supremacy of healthy components is a major issue in current based monitoring. To overcome this problem, it is essential to suppress the effect of healthy components to estimate the embryonic fault component in stator current. Therefore, in this paper Frequency Spectral Subtraction (FSS) is carried out to remove the above said healthy components to highlight bearing fault component in stator current. FSS is carried out by two ways: one way is frequency components of both healthy and fault components are obtained using FFT and are subtracted directly. On the other hand, the healthy components are predicted using an adaptive filter and are removed in a real time fashion. In both the cases, the subtracted signal is further analyzed using Stationary wavelet transform (SWT) to get better resolution and compared. The results obtained using proposed topology is compared with conventional vibration analysis performed on 1.5kW test bed.	[Kompella, K. C. Deekshit; Rao, M.

It was reported in prior papers that about 30% to 50% of all failing die were due to defects that cause scan chains to fail [1][2]. Therefore, scan chain failure diagnosis is very important to improve yield. The previously proposed methods of chain diagnosis were primarily based on either deterministic fault models and simulation algorithms or probabilistic analysis. To handle hard-to-model defect behaviors more robustly, in this paper, we propose a new scan chain diagnosis algorithm based on unsupervised machine learning. Its application on "scannable memory designs" (SMD) is demonstrated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

It is also essential to protect the motor and to increase the lifetime machine component. In this work, a novel method has been designed to predict and classify the fault. Three phase stator currents collected from different known types of faulty motors and one healthy motor running as prime mover of a dc generator in load. The three phase stator currents have been used as raw data (amplitude vs time) for the analysis. By adding random bias signal the data samples (amplitude vs time) of six types unknown fault are also generated. The stator currents have been transformed by fast Fourier transform (FFT) method. The principal components have been computed on raw data as well as FFT spectrum. The relative distances have been calculated from scatter plot (PC-1 vs PC-2) of different faulty machines and the scatter plot of unknown faulty machines. Comparing the distance matrices, the unknown fault has been authenticated following minimum distance nearest neighborhood criterion. Comparing two types of scatter plots, one by PCA of raw data and the other by PCA of FFT spectrum, it has been concluded that sensitivity of FFT spectrum PCA yields is better.

The position and heading information relies on the system's measuring sensor. In order to solve the sensor fault problem, in this paper, the states estimation of the system is proposed by using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The faults are detected by the residual error generated by the predicted value output by EKF and the actual measured value output by sensors, and then the faults are classified by the method combining Support Vector Machine (SVM) and binary tree. Additionally, the parameters of SVM are optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to make the best multi-classification. In this paper, the simulation of the method is carried out by using the gyro-compass in the dynamic positioning vessel. The experimental results show that the method can effectively be used in the fault diagnosis of the sensor.

Its vibration signal is not easy to be recognized in the raw signal owing to its low energy level at the early stage of the fault and strong background noise. An early developed and still widely used technique for such a signal detection is envelope analysis. Despite the fruitful modifications and improvements on this technique, its effectiveness and application is still limited by its parameter selection, which is generally understood as the optimization on the structure and the parameters of the filter that are hardly ever known a priori. To solve this problem, this paper focuses on the adaptive selection of the filter parameters, i.e. the center frequency and the band width. By analyzing the energy distribution in frequency domain of the vibration signal, the center frequency is automatically determined by identifying the frequency with the maximal energy; and then, by comparing the energy changes of two adjacent windows and merging these windows if the changes are small enough, the appropriate band width is selected according to the window with the concentrated energy. An experimental vibration signal collected from a bearing with an outer race defect is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filter. A comparison between the proposed method and the fast kurtogram is also completed. The results indicate that the proposed filter can quickly identify the resonance frequency band induced by the faulty bearing and then extract weak transient signal for accurate fault diagnosis.

Generally the fault detection is the major issue in the power network, and if this fault occurs during the power swing then the detection of this fault is difficult. Phase comparison of line current technique is a special form of current differential protection. Here the phase angle of each phase current takes a vital role to decide the significant change in the power network like fault, weather it is internal or external faults. This technique is also used to obtain the stable and unstable power swings by using PSCAD software in a 2-bus system. Here by taking the different percentage of transmission line length at the fault point, the fault during power swing is analyzed. This technique is faster and accurate. This method is also tested in 9- bus 3-machine WSCC power system model.

The remaining useful life is a nonlinear function, which dramatically changes by different internal and external effects in the capacitors. Soft computing approaches can be used as a powerful tool to analyze data and identify complex systems. Neuro-fuzzy approach is one of the important and widely popular topics in soft computing that are used for nonlinear system identification of dynamic functions. In this paper, an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system based on subtractive clustering algorithm with 12 inputs is presented for system identification of remaining useful life in the electrolytic capacitors. An experimental dataset is considered to model the remaining useful life, which was provided by the Prognostics Data Repository of NASA. Comparing between simulations and experimental results has illustrated the accuracy of the purposed method to identify nonlinear systems. According to the results, mean squared error of the training and test data are 3.489 x 10(-4) and 1.476 x 10(-2) respectively.

To address this issue, a robust prognostic framework is presented in this paper to assess the reliability of deteriorating equipment due to fatigue crack growth. In this framework, a new model ensemble methodology that integrates multiple stochastic crack growth models based on the quadratic best-worst weighted voting (QBWWV) is proposed for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study concerning fatigue crack growth is demonstrated. The results indicate that the proposed prognostic framework outperforms single crack growth models in terms of prediction accuracy under evolving operating conditions.

As a result of measuring the sound pressure level for specific faults and comparing the noise generated by the motor running smoothly, the detailed maps of changes in the acoustic spectrum may be generated. These results may be helpful in future diagnostics of internal combustion engines. In the paper, we present the results from the scientific works in the area of research, design and operation of internal combustion engines, conducted at the Department of Automotive Engineering, in cooperation with the Laboratory of Hydraulic Drives & Vibroacoustics of Machines at the Wroclaw University of Technology. The broader study has so far allowed us to develop an authoritative method of identifying the type of engine damage using game-tree structures. The present works assess the possibility of using multi-valued logic trees.

Wireless Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system for damage detection using ultrasonic guided waveform response	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						microcontroller; piezoelectric sensor; sine wave signal; smart sensor; structural health monitoring; wireless sensor	OF-THE-ART; ROTATING MACHINERY; PROGNOSIS	This paper presents an improved version of a wireless device embedded with a smart PZT sensor to detect flaws and structural defects on selected investigated structure. Smart PZT sensors were used as an actuator and sensor, coupled with two XBee's and one signal generator IC chip. Programme execution on transmitting and receiving the ultrasonic guided wave via the PZT sensor had been written in MATLAB. The developed source code is basically to receive serial data from one Xbee to another remote Xbee attached to the investigated structural system. The refined waveform response is utilised for prognosis of the true structural status. The 4-mm simulated holed into one of the aluminium structural plate is benchmarked with its pristine condition in validating the effectiveness of the developed SHM wireless module. Results showed that the wave is more even in non-defected area and disrupted in affected area. Ultrasonic waves increase continuously for non-destructive evaluation and structural health monitoring in various structural applications because the guided wave can propagate long distances and reach difficult-to-access regions; for inspecting porous and some non-porous materials ultrasonic waves attenuate fast and are very useful. Recent advances in ultrasonic wave application model and results are discussed in this paper.	[Shirazi, A. H. S.; Muda, M. K. H.; Thirumurthy, M.

Unsupervised Learning for Improving Fault Detection in Complex Systems	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED INTELLIGENT MECHATRONICS (AIM)	IEEE ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)	JUL 03-07, 2017	Munich, GERMANY	IEEE		Condition monitoring; unsupervised learning; diagnosis; complex system; mechatroni system; Gaussian mixture models	DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSTICS	Complex mechatronic systems are becoming more widespread such as in industrial machinery and robotic systems. Detecting faults in such systems proves to be a challenging task due to the multitude of components that are interacting. In this paper, we demonstrate how we use an unsupervised learning technique to detect accelerated wear patterns in complex systems, where wear interactions between components are present. We use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to uncover the intricate wear process that takes place when old worn out components are coupled with new healthy components. Then through a numerical simulation of a complex system, and experimental data gathered from a gearbox accelerated life testing platform, we demonstrate that this new-old component coupling leads to an accelerated rate of wear of the new components, and so they would have a lowered life expectancy that would jeopardize the reliability of the system. This approach shows that more fault prevention related information is gained if we take all interacting components into account when monitoring and modelling wear processes of complex systems. Such gained information could lead to more accurate Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) estimations and more robust fault prevention.

Extracting these patterns from a set of EEG records provides a dataset to be used in machine learning in order to implement an intelligent classification system that predict prognosis of the baby. In a previous work we proved that Inter-burst intervals (IBI) found in the EEG records predicts abnormal outcomes of the premature. A bibliographic study on the amplitude of an EEG signal, with the annotations of the neuropediatricians, showed that low amplitudes in EEG signal are strongly correlated with an abnormal prognosis of the premature, similar to that of IBI. According to these hypotheses, we present in this paper, a segmentation methodology on the amplitude of bursts intervals of EEG signal into 3 segments: low, medium and high, in addition to the inter-burst intervals. We create a new algorithm that detects 6 important parameters in each interval of these 4 segments. After applying this new methodology, we obtain a new classified dataset that contains 24 parameters extracted from these 4 segments to obtain with gestational age of the preterm and the day of recording 26 input attributes and one output which is the class (normal, sick or risky).

By synchronizing the signal to the rotational angle of the component of interest (e.g. by using a tachometer reference signal), it is possible to perform the averaging in the angular domain, thus obtaining an angle-synchronous signal. Such an operation usually requires a resampling procedure. In this paper, the operations of averaging in time and angular domain are thoroughly discussed, referring to the main measurement and computational errors affecting the extracted waveform. The effects of uncertainty in the pulse arrival times of the reference signal on the synchronous averaging method are studied. Jittering of the reference signal affects the quality of the synchronous averaging process resulting in an attenuation of the extracted synchronous signal components, especially in the high frequency band. A theoretical analysis of the linkage between jitter model and attenuation is performed and an analytical model is proposed. The agreement of the analytical model with numerical simulations is first shown, and then an experimental case study involving the early detection of bearing damage is examined. The results are discussed in the framework of the cyclostationary signal theory.

In consideration of the key position of power supply in the device, estimating remaining useful life (RUL) of PEMFC has positive effects in its new stages of development. Currently, RUL estimation of industrial facilities has played an extremely important role in the field of high safety and reliability requirements. For practical systems, the state is often a stochastic process with inevitable degradation during the runtime. In truth, a large amount of data about system operation state is available, and the linear stochastic degradation model is widely applicable to stochastic degradation system. In view of this, this paper selects the proton exchange membrane fuel cell as an object of study, and the remaining useful life is estimated based on its monitoring data. At first, a brief introduction to proton exchange membrane fuel cell is covered. Then, the stochastic degradation model is built and the method of predicting the remaining life is given.

The high demand for power continuity increases the emphasis on power supply reliability and availability which raises the need for monitoring the system condition for timely maintenance and prevention of downtime. Although present on component level, no current literature addresses the condition monitoring from the perspective of a fuel cell/battery hybrid system such as the telecommunication power supply. This paper is a first step towards a condition monitoring approach for such systems. Firstly, the application is defined, thereafter the benefits of predictive maintenance strategies and the prognostics and health management framework are described. A literature review of condition monitoring of the major system components: fuel cell, battery, and converters, is given. Finally, the paper presents a discussion on the available monitoring techniques from a commercial hybrid system point view.

However, some vibration-related problems in the rotating machinery inevitably exist. These problems influence the measurement accuracy of wMPS and even reduce its service life. In this paper, the rotating machinery vibration analysis of wMPS is introduced. Some significant factors causing vibrations, such as the mass imbalance of the rotor, are discussed. The vibration signals of rotating machinery are captured experimentally by the three-axis accelerometer. These raw vibration signals are processed by the data pretreatment, the time-domain analysis and the frequency-domain analysis. Based on these analyses, some evaluation criteria of rotating machinery vibration are introduced. These criteria provide guidance to the fault detection and ensure the ongoing operational condition of wMPS.

But as a result of the monotonous, baldness and plenty of X-ray image, it is necessary to apply the computer image processing techniques to identification wire injury accuratly and automatically. Then the injury can be located in the actual conveyor belt to maintenance and repair. And the joint is an important part of the conveyor belt, for it is easy to recognize in the practical application, so as the benchmark to joint reference point positioning fault is a good choice. Therefore, the accurate identification of joint is very important to conveyor belt injury locationan. At present there are some algorithms applying the metood of detecting domain gray level or horizontal gradient change frequencyin the identification of joint. These algorithms can be accurate to single image of joint without considering the practical complex and changable X-ray image for the different thickness of the conveyor belt outer rubber. For single image characteristics of the proposed algorithm is easy to failure in practical application. A new robust algorithm is necessary to solve this problem. And SVM(Support Vector Machine) is a novel method of machine learning evolving from Statistics. SVM presents many own advantages in solving machine learning problems such as small samples, nonlinearity and high dimension. In this paper, the image texture SVM classification method construct feature vectors through the extraction of image gray level co-occurrence matrix texture information. classified feature vectors using the SVM classification method to determine whether the image contains joint and provide the joint location information. The metioned texture imformation include gray-level co-occurrence matrix energy, contrast and entropy. And the gray level co-occurrence matrix reflects the image direction, adjacent interval and the change in value of integrated information. SVM classification method is applied to locate the joints number and position on the real conveyor belt. And by means of image binarization, skeleton and such as pretreatments, this paper use the method of template matching for the identification wire fracture. Finally the method locate injury on the real conveyor belt according to the fracture position and joint position of the pixel distance. The results show that the image texture SVM classification method can effectively combine the method of template matching for the identification of conveyor belt injury.

Bug tracking results may be employed by the software practitioners of large software projects effectively. The cost of detecting and correcting the defect becomes exponentially higher as we go from requirement analysis to the maintenance phase, where defects might even lead to loss of lives. Software metrics in conjunction with defect data can serve as basis for developing predictive models. Open source projects which encompass contributions from millions of people provide capacious dataset for testing. There have been diverse machine learning techniques proposed in the literature for analyzing complex relationships and extracting useful information from problems using optimal resources and time. However, more extensive research comparing these techniques is needed to establish superiority of one technique over another. This study aims at comparison of 14 ML techniques for development of effective defect prediction models. The issues addressed are 1) Construction of automated tool in Java to collect 00, inheritance and other metrics and detect bugs in classes extracted from open source repository, 2) Use of relevant performance measures to evaluate performance of predictive models to detect bugs in classes, 3) Statistical tests to compare predictive capability of different machine learning techniques, 4) Validation of defect prediction models.

In this study, we explore a driver drowsiness monitoring and early warning system, which uses machine learning techniques based on vehicle telemetry data. The proposed system can ensure safe driving by real time monitoring of driving pattern. This proves to be a very cost effective technique over biometric and camera based techniques since it doesn't involve expensive sensors. The detection of drowsy state of a driver is modeled as a binary classification issue. We outline the design methodology followed and challenges faced in developing a machine learning based classification scheme on vehicle telemetry data, which is essentially a time-series data. Even though our study is focused on an exemplary application like driver attention monitoring, the results can be equally applied for vehicle prognostics, driving style analytics and various other telematics applications in automotive industry. We have done our entire development and validation on a driver-in-loop simulation platform.

Among various techniques, semi-supervised learning can help in diagnosing faulty states and decision making in partially labeled data, where only a few number of labeled observations along with a large number of unlabeled observations are collected from the process. Thus, it is crucial to conduct a critical study on the use of semi-supervised techniques for both dimensionality reduction and fault classification. In this work, three state-of-the-art semi-supervised dimensionality reduction techniques are used to produce informative features for semi-supervised fault classifiers. This study aims to achieve the best pair of the semi-supervised dimensionality reduction and classification techniques that can be integrated into the diagnostic scheme for decision making under partially labeled sets of observations.

Regarding surface inspection tasks, this endeavor is often not economically reasonable. In this paper, an artificial defect synthetization algorithm based on a multistep stochastic process is proposed. It adds defects to fault-free surface images, which can be used for supervised machine learning. By this means a deep convolutional neural network has been trained, achieving a detection rate of 94% of occurring real defects on the presented test surface.	[Haselmann, M.; Gruber, D.

Pre-event planning currently consists of preparation for all scenarios and some enthusiastic prognoses, leading to most resources spreading thin. Focus on a specific area of concern typically follows large scale power grid failures as post event analysis and does not include an overall analysis. In this study, a neural network is used to conduct "pre-event" analysis of a power grid to determine if it is susceptible to failure. This research study demonstrates that overall "pre-event" analysis can be beneficial with the use of a machine learning agent. The agent can also be used to determine areas that need the most attention. Future work with larger number of constraints and additional machine learning algorithms will be explored to further improve power grid analysis and performance.

This study aims to develop a sound based MFD system for drills using the pattern recognition techniques such as principal components analysis (PCA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The sound signals emitted by healthy and faulty drills are obtained and analyzed. Unlike the conventional methods that focus on the time domain, we explore here the effectiveness of the frequency domain components and demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the time domain based analysis of the sounds produced by the drills. The power spectrum components of the sounds are extracted before using PCA for the purpose of dimensionality reduction and redundancy removal. The first principal components are then selected and given to a neural network based classifier in order to perform the diagnosis. The results show that the proposed method can be used for the sounds based automatic diagnosis system.

The structure of IMA is an open standard platform, on which amount of functionalities are hosted. This structure makes avionics more flexible and more powerful, while it makes avionics more complexity and more critical. For improving the safety and reliability of aircraft, a deep regression method is utilized for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of IMA. The deep regression method adopts stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) to extract deep features and further improve the quality of the learned features. Then the deep features are fed into support vector machine (SVM) to predict the RUL. An IMA degradation model which accompanied with intermittent faults (IFs) is built based on probability distribution approaches. The simulation is realized by Monte Carlo method. The deep regression method is applied to the RUL prediction of IMA. The results confirm that the deep regression method is more effective and robust compared with the existing methods.

During the printing progress, substrate have contacted with many parts of printing press, which makes the printing pictures obtained many useful information, and these information can be used to diagnose printing machine faults. By analyzing these information, a new method for fault detection and diagnosis in printing press based on image texture information is presented. Firstly, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract the data. Secondly, the principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to process the data. Thirdly, the support vector machine (SVM) was used to analyze the data. Finally we realized the fault diagnosis with software. The availability of the diagnostic approach is verified by experiments, and we have realized the high accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis. It is practical in the field of printing machine fault diagnosis.

So it is necessary to monitor the operating state of NPP system and mechanical equipment in real time by inspecting operating parameters. However, the key technology is real-time fault diagnosis of the mechanical equipment in NPP. Traditional fault diagnosis method based on analytic model is difficult to diagnose relevant and superimposed fault because of model error, disturbance and noise. This paper studies the application of fault diagnosis method based on BP neural network in NPP, and proposes an improved method for neural BP network method. For the feed water system in the variable load operation process, we select the normal operation, the single feed-water valve fault, feed water pump and feed-water valve superimposed fault as the analysis objects. One hundred points of data are extracted as BP algorithm training elements in these three processes averagely. The normal and abnormal conditions (including single fault and superimposed fault) can be accurately judged, but the single fault and superimposed failure would produce miscarriage of justice, about 2.4% of the single fault is diagnosed as superimposed fault, the diagnosis time delay is less than 1 second. These results meet the accuracy and real-time requirements. Then we study the application of support vector machine (SVM), which can make up for the deficiency of BP neural network. The results of this paper are useful for the real-time and reliable fault diagnosis of NPP.

Fault diagnosis and health management with predictive ability are the prerequisite for the effective and intelligent operation of the manufacturing system. Different from previous studies about the Prognostics and Health Management are always confined to the static modeling of the basic reliability of system components, a novel approach based on the big operational data and Hidden Markov Model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the RQR chain is proposed to organize the big operational data, which includes the manufacturing system reliability (R) data, manufacturing process quality (Q) data and the produced product reliability (R) data. Secondly, a new concept of the health state of the manufacturing system is presented to highlight the operational performance of the production task. Thirdly, evolution of the key quality characteristics is adopted to fuse the big operational data, and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to model the health state of manufacturing systems. Finally, a case study of a manufacturing system for cylinder head is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The final result shows that the proposed model has favorable dynamic modeling and prognostication capabilities.

This enables remedial actions to be taken in advance and reschedule of production if necessary. However, existing studies pay more attention to the failure diagnosis of equipment, while ignoring the output and input characteristics of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper presents a novel method for health estimation of manufacturing systems from three dimensions of equipment performance, product quality and task execution Firstly, the equipment performance state is represented based on the theory of polymorphism. Secondly, the quality state is defined to describe the qualified degree of the output products according to the response model. Thirdly, a task execution state modeling method is proposed, and the correlation between sub-task execution states is considered based on Copula function. Then, an integrated model is built to prognosis the change trend of manufacturing system health by integrating the above three states. Finally, a case study conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This method considers a non-monotone degradation process that is significantly affected by stochastically-evolving operational conditions. The failure zone instead of the deterministic failure threshold is used to identify the failures, and different operational conditions may have different failure zones. The method is developed using a semi-Markov decision process framework, and illustrated by the prognostic problem of the 2008 PHM Conference Data Challenge Competition.

A statistically optimal solution for known linear systems is provided by the KF, in the presence of Gaussian white noise. However, the optimality of the KF affects numerical stability and robustness. A number of linear and nonlinear forms of the KF have been introduced to overcome numerical, stability, and nonlinearity issues. In recent years, intelligent or cognitive-based KFs have been proposed. Intelligent Filters generally include adaptive gains and feedback for improved estimation accuracy and robustness. These types of filters are typically more robustness to modeling uncertainties and disturbances. This paper provides a comparison of two popular KF methods: fuzzy-based and machine learning-based. These strategies are applied on a flight surface system and the estimation results are compared and discussed. Future trends in intelligent estimation theory are also considered.

Having successfully overcome concept adaptation, funding mechanisms, design processes, with research and development trials, the stage of concept optimization and end-user application has commenced. A variety of new challenges is emerging, with multiple parameters requiring control and intelligence. An interlinked collaboration between operational controllers, Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) systems, databases, safety and monitoring systems, is creating a complex network, transforming the traditional manual re-manufacturing method to an advanced intelligent modern smart-factory. Incorporating machine vision systems for characterization, inspection and fault detection, alongside advanced real-time sensor data acquisition for monitoring and evaluating the welding process, a huge amount of valuable industrial data is produced. Information regarding each individual blade is combined with data acquired from the system, embedding data analytics and the concept of "Internet of Things" (IoT) into the aerospace re-manufacturing industry. The aim of this paper is to give a first insight into the challenges of the development of an Industry 4.0 prototype system and an evaluation of first results of the operational prototype.

However, WSN data is not completely reliable and hence its use in energy management has to be carefully considered. Experiments conducted on a WSN test bed monitoring a campus classroom highlight how sensor data is prone to errors, underlining the need to detect faulty measurements from the data. This paper describes the experiments showcasing faulty measurements as well as methods to detect these faulty measurements. A key contribution of this paper is highly accurate fault detection methods developed using two machine learning approaches: neural networks and support vector machine. Experimental results showcasing the successful application of the proposed methods for fault detection are discussed. The paper also provides insights on implementation of the proposed methods as well as its integration into an energy management platform.

This approach chooses the precise wavelet for Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA). The motor phase currents are continuously monitored and discrete wavelet analysis is performed to obtain the approximate and detailed coefficients at different levels. The wavelet functions used are db1, db2, db3, db4, sym2 and sym3. Various statistical parameters such as standard deviation, inter quartile range, norm and harmonic mean of approximate and detailed coefficients have been calculated. These parameters are obtained for both healthy and faulty conditions of the motor at various load levels. Simulation results indicate that norm parameter of the detailed coefficients at healthy condition is equal for all three phases. However, during the fault condition, the norm of sixth level detailed coefficients of db1 wavelet corresponding to the faulty phase shows an increment in its value compared to other two healthy phases. This variation is valid for all load conditions. Hence, db1 selected as one of the best wavelets for turn-to-turn fault detection. Also among the statistical parameter, norm is observed as the accurate feature for stator fault detection. Hardware results agree with the simulation results.

Typically, manufacturing workshops with time constraints present uncertainties associated to operations. In such system, for each operation, a time interval is associated, which lower limit indicates the minimum time necessary to execute the operation. The upper limit sets the maximum time not to exceed and above which the quality of the product is deteriorated. Developments presented in this paper are devoted to the diagnosis of manufacturing job-shops with time constraints. A new method for monitoring combining P-ime Petri Nets and fuzzy fault tree analysis is proposed. The purpose of the proposed approach is to explain in details what is happening on the system when time constraints are violated and to help operators identifying failures in order to avoid a damage of the process or an accident with human beings. Finally an application of the proposed approach to coil winding machine is outlined.

The proposed approach is based on data classification using an improved version of the Support Vector Domain Description well known as SVDD. Basically, The SVDD is an efficient technique dedicated for one-class problems (called also novelty detection problems). Though, since we are dealing with systems able to operate in various modes (multi-modes), a multiclass scheme remains crucial to ensure a proper diagnosis for such systems. In this paradigm, we extended the standard SVDD algorithm in order to support the multi-classification problems. We proposed for this purpose a new decision criterion called Maximal Kernelized Similarity (MKS). To prove its effectiveness, the proposed approach is applied for fault diagnosis of three-phase asynchronous machine, and employed to perform a monitoring procedure over the real time.

Since a static or a dynamic eccentricity occurs, a mixed eccentricity behavior is observed and manifests by amplitude modulation of the stator current. Many other failures related to the motor condition or its driven load produce this same effect. Hence, by loading an induction machine, eccentricities incidence may be masked. Furthermore, because of power supply imperfections, the detection of characteristic frequencies around principal slot harmonics is not always practicable. In this paper, from theoretical development of eccentricities effects on analytical expressions of rotor and stator currents, a machine classification is proposed and related defect frequencies are predicted. The weakness of the motor current signature analysis is experimentally verified, and an alternative based on spectral analysis of the stray flux is proposed. Experimental results have shown an excellent capability of the suggested frequency signature for detecting and distinguishing the factual eccentricity.

In that respect, we have considered the Motor Current Signature Analysis, the Current Space Vector, and the Current Park Loci, under no-load as well as under full load conditions. On the other hand, the effect of the machine's input-frequency on the detection efficiency is also discussed. Thus, we have assessed these three techniques when the motor is operating under full speed's condition and under half speed's condition. The presented results are experimentally validated on a laboratory's test-rig simulating an angular shaft misalignment.

Consequently, the monitoring of these assets is considered as primordial to minimize unexpected electricity outage and thereby to ensure the effective operation of the used machines. In this sense, this paper presents a comparison of various regression techniques for modeling batteries degradations. Indeed, a rich discussion is introduced to enhance the benefits of regression techniques and to highlight the challenges still untreated by the literature in this important area.

Performance of a machine can be known by analyzing the vibrations that occur in the machine. Vibration that occurs on the machine may be normal or abnormal. Abnormal vibrations on a machine can cause severe damage. This abnormal vibration can be caused by the mass distribution of rotation no longer exists in the centerline. This technique of identifying vibrations can use a combination of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods. The vibration signal is sampled to be transformed using CWT, so the data of Continuous Wavelet Coefficient (CWC) is obtained. The Feature Extraction method is used to extract the Continuous Wavelet Transform data into several types. Root Mean Square (RMS), Kurtosis, and Power Spectrum Density (PSD) are Feature Extraction types used as Artificial Neural Network inputs to identify abnormal vibrations in the machine. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) intelligently classifies the fault from machine vibrations. CWT and ANN combinations are able to classify the damage by 99.72% accuracy.

Actuators in multirotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems are common subjects fault diagnosis methods which are an essential part of the active fault-tolerant control scheme. Defects in a propulsion system of the aerial vehicle lead to the loss of thrust generated by rotors and as a result, to the disturbance of thrust balance, higher power consumption and further degradation resulting in the possible crash of the vehicle. Authors propose a three stage algorithm based on the signal processing and machine learning to detect the occurrence of rotor fault, determine its scale and type. The method is based on measurements of acceleration from the onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor as unbalanced rotating parts commonly cause vibrations in mechanical systems. The acceleration signal is stored in a cyclic buffer and then processed by simple feature extraction algorithms in order to obtain a characteristic signature of the faulty state. Three different methods of feature extraction are considered in this article, along with the analysis of variable buffer length. Next, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used to determine the occurrence and character of the rotor fault. The presented solution was verified in series of experiments proving its effectiveness. In addition, such approach based on signal processing is very versatile and easy to implement in arbitrary flight controller.

The early detection and appropriate treatment according to the progression of RA are effective to improve the patient's prognosis. The modified Total Sharp (mTS) score is widely used for the progression evaluation of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The mTS score assessments on hand or foot X-ray image is required several times a year, and it takes very long time. The automatic mTS score calculation system is required. This paper proposes the finger joint detection method and the mTS score estimation method using support vector machine. Experimental results on 45 RA patient's X-ray images showed that the proposed method detects finger joints with accuracy of 81.4 %, and estimated the erosion and JSN score with accuracy of 50.9, 64.3 %, respectively.

The centralized approach of SDN yields a broad area for intelligence to optimise the network at various levels. Fault tolerance is considered one of the most current research challenges that facing the SDN, hence, in this paper we introduce a new method that computes an alternative paths reactively for centrally controlled networks like SDN. The proposed method aims to reduce the update operation cost that the SDN network controller would spend in order to recover from a single link failure. Through utilising the principle of community detection, we define a new network model for the sake of improving the network's fault tolerance capability. An experimental study is reported showing the performance of the proposed method. Based on the results, some further directions are suggested in the context of machine learning towards achieving further advances in this research area.

The proposed method is based on the zero sequence voltage component (ZSVC) and the stator currents. The PMSM mode in abc stationary frame is presented. The relationship between the ZSVC, the stator currents and the additional resistances of the faulty phases is established. The HRC fault severity detection is described by solving a binary linear equation group about the additional resistance of each faulty phase. The simulation is carried out to validate the proposed method. The results show that the HRC fault severity can be effectively detected by the proposed method in the PMSM drive system.

J	Song, JH; Kim, KH				Song, Jae-Hwan; Kim, Kyeong-Hwa			Reliable Open-switch Fault Localization Scheme in Multiple Switches for Inverter-fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine Drives	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						digital signal processor TMS320F28335; fault diagnosis; moving window; on-line fault localization; open fault in multiple switches; permanent magnet synchronous machine drive; pulse width modulation inverter; reliability	OPEN-CIRCUIT FAULT; INDUCTION-MOTOR DRIVES; DIAGNOSIS; CONVERTERS; SYSTEMS; MODEL	To improve the reliability of a pulse width modulation inverter-fed permanent magnet synchronous machine drive under open faults in multiple switches, this paper proposes an on-line open-switch fault localization scheme. An open-switch fault which often leads to secondary damage in the entire system arises due to accidental overcurrent as well as electrical and thermal stresses. Especially, the open fault in multiple switches occurs in various types of combination, which prevents a fault localization algorithm from operating reliably. To alleviate the complexity in diagnosis algorithm, this paper classifies the open faults into different categories, which enables the diagnosis algorithm to handle and identify multiple failures in switching devices in more straightforward and systematic way. The decision-making process is simple and easy due to unique fault characteristic in each group. In the proposed scheme, the fault group is simply identified from only non-zero phase current information by using the moving window-based signals instead of the entire electrical periodic data. The proposed scheme detects a fault as well as faulty switches by on-line basis without additional hardware. It is not only immune to false alarms due to inexact detection, but also independent of operating conditions. The practical usefulness of the proposed scheme is verified through the simulations and experiments.

Because of this, condition monitoring is employed to assess the status of the system in real-time. However, the condition of the system is usually not considered explicitly when finding the optimal operation strategy. Instead, operational constraints on flow rates, pressures etc., based on worst-case scenarios, are imposed. This can lead to unnecessarily restrained operation and significant economic losses. To avoid sub-optimal operation, we propose to integrate diagnostics and prognostics with the optimal decision making process for operation to obtain an operational strategy which is optimal subject to the expected system degradation. This allows us to proactively steer the system degradation, rather than simply reacting to it. We use the operation of a subsea gas compressor subject to bearing degradation as a case example.

Recent developments in electronics led to use of induction motor-driven electrical vehicles. Faults in inverter-fed induction motor can lead to unusual operation. The knowledge of faults in inverter circuit is as important. Fault identification is as much important as prior knowledge to mitigate the faults that might occur in inverter-driven induction motor drives. In this paper, five-level multi-level inverter was taken up for testing of mitigation using redundant cell. In this simulation model only two fault cases are considered for voltage source inverter (VSI)-fed squirrel cage induction motor drive. Those two cases are switch open fault and switch short fault. In this work redundant cell comes into operation when switch is open fault, short fault in drive system. The Matlab/Simulink-based model clearly explains the effect of adding redundant cell during fault.	[Kiran, B. Madhu] PSRCMR Coll Engn & Technol, Vijayawada, AP, India; [Ram, B. V.

An automobile in the present day world is equipped with millions of sensors which are under the command of a central unit the ECU (Electronic Control Unit). ECU holds all information about the engine. A network of ECUs connected across the globe is a source tap of BigData. Leveraging the new sources of BigData by automotive giants boost vehicle performance, enhance loco driver experience, accelerated product designs. A piezoelectric transducer coupled to the ECU captures the vibration signals from the engine. The engine fault is detected by carving the problem into a pattern classification problem under machine learning after extracting cyclostationary features from the vibration signal. Spark-streaming framework, the most versatile BigData framework available today with immense computational capabilities is employed for engine fault detection and analysis.

C	Arevalo, F; Mohammed, T; Schwung, A			IEEE	Arevalo, Fernando; Mohammed, Tariq; Schwung, Andreas			Fault Detection using Probabilistic Prediction and Data Fusion on a Bulk Good System	2017 52ND INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITIES POWER ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (UPEC)			English	Proceedings Paper	52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)	AUG 28-31, 2017	Heraklion, GREECE			Bulk Good System; Fault Detection; Data Fusion; Full Bayes; Naive Bayes; OPC-UA		Industrial companies worldwide want to keep a steady performance of their processes. In order to ensure this, a company usually implements a continuous condition monitoring for their machines. Ideally, the company analyzes the resulting data and obtains an insight on the failure causes of the machines. Unfortunately, the data itself cannot always discover the hidden causes for a fault in the machine, due either to the big amount of data or its complexity. This paper applies probabilistic prediction and data fusion techniques for fault detection on a bulk good system. The data acquisition from the bulk good system is implemented using the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) Machine-to-Machine Communication Protocol. OPC-UA collects data from the automation platform, and stores it in batches. Each batch contains all system features. Firstly, the system data is analyzed by means of a centralized approach. For that purpose, the probabilistic methods Naive Bayes and Full Bayes are implemented. Furthermore, a decentralized approach is implemented using a two-step method. The first step gathers the health status of the main components by means of a local analysis. The second step fuses the results of each component, in order to obtain an overall status. The results show that the data fusion approach improves the performance of the fault detection algorithm.

Advanced Monitoring Systems aim to detect anomalies and trends; anomalies are data patterns that have different data characteristics from normal instances, while trends are tendencies of production to move in a particular direction over time. In this work, we compare state-of-the-art ML approaches (ABOD, LOF, onlinePCA and osPCA) to detect outliers and events in high-dimensional monitoring problems. The compared anomaly detection strategies have been tested on a real industrial dataset related to a Semiconductor Manufacturing Etching process. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Abou Jaoude, A				Abou Jaoude, Abdo			The paradigm of complex probability and analytic linear prognostic for unburied petrochemical pipelines	SYSTEMS SCIENCE & CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Complex set; probability norm; degree of our knowledge; chaotic factor; linear damage; degradation; remaining useful lifetime; analytic prognostic	MARKOVIAN JUMP SYSTEMS; MODEL	Andrey Kolmogorov put forward in 1933 the five fundamental axioms of classical probability theory. The original idea in my complex probability paradigm (CPP) is to add new imaginary dimensions to the experiment real dimensions which will make the work in the complex probability set totally predictable and with a probability permanently equal to one. Therefore, adding to the real set of probabilities R the contributions of the imaginary set of probabilities M will make the event in C = R + Mabsolutely deterministic. It is of great importance that stochastic systems become totally predictable since we will be perfectly knowledgeable to foretell the outcome of all random events that occur in nature. Hence, my purpose is to link my CPP to unburied petrochemical pipelines' analytic prognostic in the linear damage accumulation case. Consequently, by calculating the parameters of the novel prognostic model, we will be able to determine the magnitude of the chaotic factor, the degree of knowledge, the complex probability, the system failure and survival probabilities, and the remaining useful lifetime probability, after a pressure time t has been applied to the pipeline, and which are all functions of the system degradation subject to random effects.

J	Abou Jaoude, A				Abou Jaoude, Abdo			The paradigm of complex probability and analytic nonlinear prognostic for unburied petrochemical pipelines	SYSTEMS SCIENCE & CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Complex set; probability norm; degree of our knowledge; chaotic factor; nonlinear damage; degradation; remaining useful lifetime; unburied pipelines; analytic prognostic	MARKOVIAN JUMP SYSTEMS; MODEL	Andrey Kolmogorov put forward in 1933 the five fundamental axioms of classical probability theory. The original idea in my complex probability paradigm is to add new imaginary dimensions to the experiment real dimensions which will make the work in the complex probability set totally predictable and with a probability permanently equal to one. Therefore, adding to the real set of probabilities R the contributions of the imaginary set of probabilities M will make the event in C = R + M absolutely deterministic. It is of great importance that stochastic systems become totally predictable since we will be perfectly knowledgeable to foretell the outcome of all random events that occur in nature. Hence, my purpose is to link my complex probability paradigm to unburied petrochemical pipelines analytic prognostic in the nonlinear damage accumulation case. Consequently, by calculating the parameters of the novel prognostic model, we will be able to determine the magnitude of the chaotic factor, the degree of knowledge, the complex probability, the system failure and survival probabilities, and the remaining useful lifetime probability, after that a pressure time t has been applied to the pipeline and which are all functions of the system degradation subject to random effects.

High Impedance Fault Detection Technique based on Discrete Wavelet Transform and Support Vector Machine In Power Distribution Networks	2017 IEEE AFRICON	Africon		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE AFRICON Conference - Science, Technology and Innovation for Africa	SEP 18-20, 2017	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	IEEE, mlab, IEEE Reg 8, IEEE S Africa Sect, IES, Univ Pretoria, SAiEE, IBM, Altair, CST		High Impedance Fault; Fault Detection; Discrete Wavelet Transform; Support Vector Machine		A High Impedance Fault (HIF) is a long standing complex type of a fault, because of its distinctive nature. The major concern with HIF is the potential risk it poses to human lives, because of its association with arcing. From the point of safety and reliability HIF is still a challenge for protection engineers. In this paper a HIF model is adopted and the combinations of wavelet transform and support vector machine is presented to detect a HIF. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used as a feature extractor to extract useful information from the distorted HIF current signal. For classification purposes Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to distinguish HIF from other events such as normal load, capacitor switching, and load switching. An Eskom network is studied and modelled in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The waveform results are fed into a DWT tool for feature extraction and the results from DWT are used to train the SVM for classification and ultimately detecting HIF.	[Moloi, K.; Jordaan, J.

A segment of a 88 kV power distribution network is modelled in Digsilent Power Factory. Various types of fault cases are obtained through an Electromagnetic Transient study on the model. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract features from transient fault currents measured at the source terminal of the network. The method uses two cycles of transient fault current measured at the source terminal after fault inception. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, support vector regression (SVR) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) schemes in order to diagnose various system faults. SVM is used to detect and classify various types of short circuit faults. The Naive Bayes is also used to classify faults. Furthermore, SVR and GPR schemes are used to estimate fault locations. A hybrid method using DWT, SVM and GPR is thus proposed. The feasibility of the proposed technique is tested on MATLAB. The results of the proposed method show that various types of faults can be classified with accuracy of up to 98.8% and a minimum estimation error for fault location.	[Magagula, X.

This paper explains periodogram as a non-parametric estimate of the power spectral density (PSD) and also discusses how two types of periodogram (Default-P and DFT-P) can be used to detect stator winding faults in an induction machine. The maximum PSD values of the healthy electrical machine for both Default-P and DFT-P signature indicate the machine is in good condition. However, when there is any fault in the machine, there are discrepancies in the signatures compared to the signature of the machine in good condition. The percentage deviations, and abnormalities observed from an electrical machine with faults give indications about the extent of the severity level of the fault in the machine. The percentage deviations for each state of the machines are similar in the two periodograms. It is approximately 10% for the phase-to-ground fault, around 12% for the shorted-turn fault and about 94% for the coil-to-coil fault. Thus, with periodogram, it is possible to diagnose winding faults of electrical machines.	[Imoru, O.; Bhaskar, Arun. M.; Jimoh, A.

Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system is an emerging field in medical informatics which has high importance for providing prognosis of diseases. Research efforts have reported with increasing confirmation that the twin support vector machines (TWSVM) have greater accurate diagnosis ability. The goal of TWSVM is to construct two non-parallel planes for each class such that each hyper-plane is closer to one of two classes and as far as possible from the other one. In this paper, we propose a new CAD system for glaucoma diagnosis using TWSVM and three heterogeneous families of feature extraction. In this work, we have used 169 images to classify into normal and glaucoma classes. The performance of the method is evaluated using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results show that the highest classification accuracy (98,53%) is obtained for the TWSVM using Gaussian kernel function, and this is very promising compared to the SVM results.

Given the variety of factors with an impact on AAA growth, an integrative approach to the problem could potentially benefit from incorporating clinical and morphometric data, as well as mechanical stress characterizations. In addition, here we investigated the use of texture information on computed tomography angiography images within the AAA sac. A cohort of n=38 patients underwent a baseline examination, plus a follow-up visit to measure AAA growth rates, in terms of its maximum diameter (Dmax) divided by the elapsed time period. Subsequently, each case was labelled as 'slow', 'medium' or 'quick' growth, compared to the expected rate reported in demographic studies, as a function of gender and baseline Dmax. We computed a total of 102 features (5 clinical, 17 morphometric, 4 biomechanical, and 76 on texture) and used a number of machine learning (ML) algorithms; with the aim of minimizing misclassification costs. The performance of the system was evaluated with a leave-one-out cross-validation scheme. The results achieved by the best performing approach, an ensemble of decision trees ('LPBoost') using the entire 102-dimensional feature space, indicated that the combination of different information sources, along with ML algorithms, may have a positive impact on the AAA prognosis assessment.

The developed protection is constructed from digital relays (modules), each of which provides protection for a specific location of the PMG-based WECS and battery storage. Moreover, each module is featured with phaselet-based fault detection. The outputs of the developed protection are trip signals to operate circuit breakers in the PMG-based WECS, battery storage, and point-of-common-coupling. The modular digital protection is implemented for experimental testing on a 5 kW PMG-based WECS that has a 2.3 kW battery storage. Test results show that the developed protection can offer fast, accurate, and reliable responses to faults occurring in different parts of the tested WECS and battery storage.

In wearable applications, electronics may be subjected to stresses of daily motion in addition to exposure to human body temperature, and ambient environments. Existing test standards and protocols are geared towards the assessment of rigid electronics. In this paper, a test-protocol has been developed to impose deformations that mimic the stresses of daily motion on flexible batteries during charge-discharge operation. The test protocol is intended to be used for assessment of the ability of flexible battery to meet the power needs of wearable electronics and provide adequate survivability while being subjected to constant human body or ambient temperature and flexing typical of stresses of daily motion. The changes to the state-of-charge of the battery have been tracked for the development of method to prognosticate prior accrued damage and remaining useful life.

C	Tsypkin, M			IEEE	Tsypkin, Mikhail			Induction Motor Condition Monitoring: Vibration Analysis Technique - Diagnosis of Electromagnetic Anomalies	2017 IEEE AUTOTESTCON	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE AUTOTESTCON Conference	SEP 11-14, 2017	Schaumburg, IL	IEEE, IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc		Induction motors; Voltage distortions; Voltage/current imbalance; Adjustable speed drives (ASD); Vibration analysis; Torque pulsation; Speed pulsation; Radial electromagnetic forces; Resonance condition; Torsional vibration		Vibration analysis is one of the most successful techniques used for condition monitoring of rotating machines. Vibration analysis is a very efficient and convenient tool for diagnosing mechanical problems in induction motors. The aim of this paper is to show that vibration analysis is an efficient tool for diagnosing electromagnetic problems in induction motors, which are very specific for this type of machines. The industry today widely uses different kinds of nonlinear systems operating in the power lines, for example, adjustable speed drives, which cause voltage distortion on the induction motor supply and in the power lines. Faulty operation of adjustable speed drives very often creates unusual voltage content on the induction motors input. Single phase load in three phase power systems may cause voltage imbalance. Induction motors operating under non-sinusoidal voltage (voltage distortion) or under non-symmetrical three phase voltage (voltage imbalance) have usually experienced significant vibration of electromagnetic nature. Vibration of an electromagnetic nature may also be a result of an internal fault in the motor. Motor vibration data contain substantial analytical information about internal motor electrical problems such as: stator and rotor winding and core condition, air gap eccentricity; and information about external electrical problems: current/voltage imbalance, voltage distortions in the power line, etc. A short theoretical analysis of electromagnetic excitation forces is included to exemplify how the internal and external electrical faults create parasitic radial forces (rotating waves) and tangential forces (pulsating torques) inside the induction motors, which deteriorates equipment health. Faults are illustrated in numerous case histories of electromagnetic problems from different industries, which result in machinery vibration that is significantly above acceptable standards. Among them are: voltage (current) imbalance, voltage waveform distortion, faulty control of ASD, motor eccentric air gap, induction motor winding (stator and rotor) damage, //and combinations of mechanical and electrical problems//.

The signal-processing methods based on Hilbert-Huang transform can effectively extract the fault features. The fault diagnosis of machinery is a typical small sample problem. Support vector machine is a machine learning method that is suitable for small sample classification problem. It is effective to the fault diagnosis of bearings. Zynq-7000 is a type of novel heterogeneous processor, which has both embedded resources and logical resources. It can be designed flexibly and has a powerful performance, well suited to the demand for bearing fault diagnosis. After completion of the hardware platform built on Zynq-7000, we develop the host computer which provides users a good display. Moreover, we use the open data of the rolling bearing at case western reserve university and the data collected from INV1612 type multifunction flexible rotor experiment platform, developed by Beijing COINV, to make the algorithm and hardware platform function test and verification. Test results demonstrate that the hardware platform based on Zynq-7000 can effectively make fault diagnosis of bearings.

Assessment of operational performance, prediction of the dynamic responses, and prognosis of the remaining service life of the structure therefore requires accurate, high-resolution measurements, and modeling of the dynamic loads. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, with the current state of the art. First, dynamic loads on structures usually come from a wide spectrum of sources, some of which are extremely challenging to accurately measure, such as the traffic loads on a bridge. Also, it is impractical to instrument a dense array of force measurement devices on the structure due to the high cost, the effect of mass-loading, and modification of the structure's surface. On the other hand, digital video cameras are non-contact measurement device that are relatively low-cost, agile, and able to provide high spatial resolution, simultaneous, pixel measurements. This study develops a novel method for identification of the high-resolution, full-field loads on the structure from the video of the operational structures by leveraging advanced computer vision and unsupervised learning techniques. Impact and wind loads were applied on a cable structure to experimentally validate the method. The non-contact, remote, simultaneous sensing capability of the proposed technique should enable truly high-resolution, full-field force estimation that was previously not feasible.

The injected faults followed a Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. Features, belonging to different domains, have been extracted from the measured signals. These indexes are based largely on the motor driving currents, in order to avoid the installation of new sensors. Finally, a Gradient Tree Boosting algorithm has been chosen to detect the system status: the choice has been dictated by a comparison with other known classification algorithms. Furthermore, the most promising features for a classification point of view are reported. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Autonomous Bearing Fault Diagnosis Method based on Envelope Spectrum	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control, Continental Automot, Occitanie Reg, Toulouse Metropole, CNES, Univ Toulouse III, Paul Sabatier, Inria, CNRS, OPTITRACK, MDPI, ISAE Supaero, iCODE, EECI, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Moveo		Autonomous bearing diagnosis; Envelope spectrum; Band-pass filter		Rolling element bearings are one of the fundamental components of a machine, and their failure is the most frequent cause of machine breakdown. Monitoring the bearing condition is vital to preventing unexpected shutdowns and improving their maintenance planning. Specifically, the bearing vibration can be measured and analyzed to diagnose bearing faults. Accurate fault diagnosis can be achieved by analyzing the envelope spectrum of a narrow band filtered vibration signal. The optimal narrow-band is centered at the resonance frequency of the bearing. However, how to determine the optimal narrow-band is a challenge. Several methods aim to identify the optimal narrow-band, but they are not always precise. The bearing fault vibration components are lost if the narrow-band is incorrectly chosen, thus leading to an incorrect fault diagnosis. For on-line systems, it is critical that bearing faults are diagnosed with a high degree of confidence. In this article, a method for analyzing multiple narrow bands is presented. Bearing faults are detected autonomously by a narrow-band envelope spectrum-based algorithm. This algorithm removes the need for manual spectrum analysis, allowing operators to focus on more important tasks. Bearing fault vibration data from an accelerated life-test is used to verify the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method accurately diagnoses the worn-out bearing for three characteristic defect types and shows when one fault propagates to a second one.

This paper presents a Particle Filtering based multi-level prognostics approach to predict the Remaining Useful Life of a system based on its State of Health degradation estimation with online inspections of covariates. A degrading system is simulated with covariates at different level. By investigating the covariate online, the degradation estimation shows a better prediction and lower cost than the estimation without inspection.

A dynamic maintenance decision approach based on maintenance action grouping for HVAC maintenance costs savings in Non-residential buildings	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	20th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	JUL 09-14, 2017	Toulouse, FRANCE	Int Federat Automat Control, Continental Automot, Occitanie Reg, Toulouse Metropole, CNES, Univ Toulouse III, Paul Sabatier, Inria, CNRS, OPTITRACK, MDPI, ISAE Supaero, iCODE, EECI, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Moveo		maintenance decision making; prognostics; maintenance costs; non-residential buildings; HVAC system; maintenance grouping; odds algorithm; opportunity; stoppage; optimal stopping; availability	MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEMS; PROGNOSTICS	Huge maintenance costs in non-residential buildings weighted it down the overall costs allocated to HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) system maintenance. Maintenance Management objective is to reduce or even avoid the corrective maintenance by proper planning and implementation of maintenance tasks at the right time. The aim of this paper is to early plan maintenance interventions for a multi-components system based on stoppages characteristics, system RUL (Remaining Useful Life) and components criticalities. This maintenance plan is made through a dynamic maintenance decision approach (DMDA) to help the maintenance expert in taking decision. Since combining maintenance activities is cheaper than performing maintenance on components separately, maintenance actions groupings are performed in the proposed approach by the mean of odds algorithm. This will allow optimizing system availability, reducing maintenance costs and delaying as late as possible maintenance interventions. Components criticalities are used for prioritizing components in the grouping process. Moreover, DMDA take into account predictive information such as system/components RUL, given by an existing prognostic process. At the end, a numerical example of a HVAC system with five components (Heat exchanger, filter, dampers, valve and fan) demonstrates the use and the advantages of the proposed DMDA.

The inverse first-order reliability method (Inverse FORM) is an uncertainty propagation method that can be adapted to remaining useful life (RUL) calculation. An extended Kalman filter (EKF) is first applied to estimate the current degradation state of the system, then the Inverse FORM allows to compute the probability density function (pdf) of the RUL. In the proposed Inverse FORM methodology, an analytical or numerical solution to the differential equation that describes the evolution of the system degradation is required to calculate the RUL model. In this work, the method is applied to a Paris fatigue crack growth model, and then compared to filter-based methods such as EKF and particle filter using performance evaluation metrics (precision, accuracy and timeliness). The main advantage of the Inverse FORM is its ability to compute the pdf of the RUL at a lower computational cost.

Renewable energy sources (such as wind energy) based power generators are important energy conversion machines and have widely industrial and commercial applications due to their superior performance, and the fact that they endure faults well and are environmentally friendly. The study of the transient behavior of such generators under fault condition has drawn much attention. This study presents Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) perturbation during a symmetrical (three-phase) short circuit (SSC) at different points. Simulation results reveal that after a fault occurs, there is decay of SC parameters (transient time, maximum current, steady-state and voltage dip) at the point of common coupling (PCC) and the grid-side converter (GSC) of DFIG. Simulation results depict a more sensitive and robust point during a SSC of DFIG. Current findings present the main difference between the PCC and the GSC during SSC faults. These comparisons provide a more precise understanding of fault diagnosis reliability with reduced complexity, stability, and optimization of the system. This study verified by the simulation results helps us understand and improve the performance of sensor sensibility (measurements), develop control schemes, protection strategy and select a more accurate and proficient system among other wind energy conversion systems (WECS).

A 5-MW reference drivetrain installed on a spar type floating wind turbine is selected. Degradation and damage in the main bearing which carries the axial loads can cause severe damage inside the gearbox as it causes non-torque loads entering the gearbox. Therefore, monitoring of the main bearing is very important. In this paper, different fault cases of the main bearing are considered and responses are obtained by the multi-body simulation. Gearbox failure is then evaluated in two different perspectives: one from the main bearing itself by analysing vibration, and one through studying the remaining fatigue life of another bearing inside the gearbox. The results reveal that not only the local vibration of the main bearing housing is important, but also the consequence of this degradation on other components can be a key factor in the "system" failure. This is a step forward in monitoring the wind turbine drivetrains on a system level. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nowadays it is very difficult to find machines or mechanical systems which do not have any rotating component such as gears, bearings, shafts, wheels and so on. Wind turbines, gearboxes, combustion and electrical engines, generators and gas turbines are just few examples of objects with several rotating substructures. These machines face very complex and non-linear conditions during their operating cycles. they are often subjected to the fatigue problem and it is fundamental to detect faults or damages well in advance in order to reschedule the maintenance cycles. This is especially true for big machines (i.e. wind turbines) where the maintenance costs are a huge part of the total costs. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a technology which is able to provide a continuous indication of the health and the reliability of the structure along its lifecycle. A damage detection technique is an essential part of any SHM system. Its scope consists in the identification of some structural and environmental parameters which have to be monitored regularly during the operation of the machine. This technique should be able to distinguish if the damage is present or not in the structure, but it should also locate and quantify the same damage. A damage can be seen as a change in material and/or geometric properties of a structure, including variation of boundary conditions and structural connections. Several studies have been performed and two different SHM strategies have been defined. The first one is based upon the whirling phenomenon. The whirling modes are the most identifiable modes in operating conditions and they appear to be very sensitive to changes of stiffness. Their amplitude and phase can be used as damage indicators because they allow to identify the loss of isotropy in the rotor. A second parameter which is quite sensitive even to small changes of stiffness is the curvature of the mode shapes. For beam-like structure it has been demonstrated being a very good damage indicator. Several simulations have been run together with some experimental validation on a wind turbine blade.

Monitoring bearing vibration signals is an effective method for diagnosing faults and preventing catastrophic failures in rotary mechanisms. The state-of-the-art vibration monitoring algorithms are mainly based on frequency or time-frequency domain analysis of rotary machines that are operating in steady state. However, the steady state assumption is not valid in applications where the loads and speeds are time-varying. Finding a method for capturing the variability in vibration signals, which are caused by varying loads and speeds, is still an open research problem with potentially many applications in emerging areas such as electric vehicles. In this paper, we address the problem of vibration signal monitoring by applying a feature extraction algorithm to rotary machine signals measured by accelerometers. The proposed method, which is based on the wavelet scattering transform, achieves overall high accuracy while being computationally affordable for real-time implementation purposes. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we apply our technique to a well-known vibration benchmark dataset with variable load. Our algorithm can diagnose various faults with different intensities with an average accuracy of 99% and thus effectively outperforming all prior reported work on this dataset.

This feature is required to indicate the need for maintenance whenever the filter is clogged to the point where the engine performance may be impacted. The prognostics of the air filter helps in saving on operational costs, maintaining the optimal fuel economy, and planning for service/maintenance before failure. In this paper, one diagnostics/prognostics method is reviewed and a generic statistics based process is proposed to convert the percent life remaining of the air filter into time and distance indicators. The estimated indicators are determined based on the vehicle driving statistics together with the degradation rate of the filter. These indicators provide more meaningful real time information to the driver or fleet owner than a percentage of the remaining life. The proposed method was validated based on driving data of a production vehicle obtained from Ford big data drive (BDD), combined with simulated degradation profile of the air filter.

This paper investigates the resolver fault propagation in electrified powertrain, with focus on the amplitude imbalance, quadrature imperfection and reference phase shift in the resolver position sensing system. The resolver fault effects in the Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) drive system are first analyzed based on the mathematical model of a surface mounted PMSM with direct Field-oriented Control (FOC). Then the resolver fault propagation in the powertrain is studied in terms of two different motor operating conditions, motor torque control and motor speed control. Simulation is done in Matlab/Simulink based on the PMSM drive model and the powertrain-level simulator to verify the fault propagation analyses. The results can be used to help design the resolver fault diagnostic strategy and determine speed matching condition between engine and electric motor for mode transition control in hybrid electric vehicles.

Specifically, this method assigns an optimized, degradation dependent weight to each learner (i.e., learning algorithm) such that the weighted sum of the prediction results from all the learners predicts the RUL of mechanical components with better accuracy. The ensemble prognostic algorithm is demonstrated using a data set collected from an engine simulator. Analysis results show that-the predictive model trained by the ensemble learning algorithm outperform the existing methods.

However it is sensitive to a single kernel radius. By analysis of the relation of statistics in the kernel feature space, improved KECA introduces two kernel radii and an adjusting factor to make KECA less sensitive to kernel radius. A method for fault diagnosis of analog circuits based on the combination of improved KECA and minimum variance extreme learning machine(ELM) is presented. Through wavelet decomposition of sampled signals, features are extracted. Improved KECA for feature dimension reduction is used. Then the fault patterns are classified by minimum variance ELM. Case studies on two analog circuits demonstrating our diagnostics method are presented.

Since different sensors may be sensitive at different stages of the degradation process and each sensor data contain only partial information of the degraded unit, data fusion approaches that integrate degradation data from multiple sensors can effectively improve degradation modeling and life prediction accuracy. We present a non-parametric approach that assigns weights to each sensor based on dynamic clustering of the sensors observations. A case study that involves a fatigue crack-growth dataset is implemented in order evaluate the prognostic performance of the unit. Results show that the fused path obtained with the proposed approach outperforms any individual sensor data and other paths obtained with an adaptive threshold clustering algorithm in terms of life prediction accuracy.

In the last years, an important attention has been devoted to this subject, leading to the development of several vibration-based structural health monitoring approaches. In this paper, a fault detection technique based on the so-called modal state observer is applied to detect transversal cracks in rotating machines. The Luenberger state observer is described in modal domain to determine the most affected vibration modes due to the crack presence. A cracked rotor composed by a flexible horizontal shaft, two rigid discs, and two self-aligning ball bearings is used for illustration purposes. The additional flexibility introduced by the crack is calculated by using the linear fracture mechanics theory. The breathing behavior of the crack is simulated according to the Mayes' model, in which the crack transition from fully open to fully closed is described by a cosine function.

They can excite bearings and adjacent mechanical structures into vibration. By measuring machine vibration, it is possible to detect potential bearing damage. However, to do so, it is critical to understand the bearing vibration characteristics that are excited by localized damages. The vibration of a TRB (tapered roller bearing) excited by a localized damage on a rotating cone (inner ring) raceway was studied using a three-dimensional, non-linear vibration model. Bearing vibration responses were analyzed in three directions. The responses exhibited multiple BPFI (ball passing frequency, inner) harmonics. The spectral envelope is determined by the bearing's dynamic properties. The vibration characteristics in the axial direction were discovered to be different from those in the radial directions. The reason behind that is revealed in this paper.	[Li, Desheng] Timken Co, North Canton, OH 44720 USA		Li, DS (corresponding author), Timken Co, North Canton, OH 44720 USA.

For that purpose, physics-based models with partially observed stochastic Petri nets are used to represent the system and its sensors. The advantage of the proposed modelling approach is to provide a realistic representation of the system, including the interaction between the normal behaviours and the failure processes. From the proposed modelling and collected measurements, timed trajectories, which are consistent with the observations, are obtained. Based on the event dates, our approach consists in evaluating the probabilities of the consistent behaviours using probabilistic models. State estimation is obtained as a consequence. The most probable future degradations, from the current state, are then considered and a method for fault prognosis is presented. Finally, the prognosis result is used to estimate the RUL as a time interval. A case study is proposed to show the applicability of the proposed method.
