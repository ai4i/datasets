On close inspection of the bearing surface after stoppage of the machine, small chunks of babbit material was found dislodged from the bearing shell, with wiping/scoring marks on the journal surface. Detailed investigation into the bearing failure is reported, using visual and chemical examination scanning electron microscope and energy dispersion analysis, x-ray fluorescence, and ferrographic oil analysis. investigations revealed that the babbit material used was non-standard and high concentration of lead resulted in the reduction of load carrying capacity of the bearing, leading to eventual failure, as noticed in the discolouration of oil.

C	Arthur, N; Penman, J			IEEE COMP SOC	Arthur, N; Penman, J			Inverter fed induction machine condition monitoring using the bispectrum	PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP ON HIGHER-ORDER STATISTICS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics	JUL 21-23, 1997	BANFF, CANADA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, USN, Off Naval Res				This submission proposes the use of the unnormalised bispectrum as a signal processing tool for the diagnosis of inverter fed induction machine fault conditions. Increasingly, induction machines are supplied from nonsinusoidal, variable speed sources which increases the complexity and magnitude of the machine cage vibration. In addition, contamination of the vibration signal from both known and unknown sources makes accurate fault detection more difficult. This paper addresses both issues, experimental results are presented, and it is shown that the unnormalised bispectrum improves on the diagnostic capability of more conventional second order statistical measures.

J	Ilott, PW; Griffiths, AJ				Ilott, PW; Griffiths, AJ			Fault diagnosis of pumping machinery using artificial neural networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART E-JOURNAL OF PROCESS MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pump fault diagnosis; artificial neural networks; data preprocessing; cumulative sum chart		Pumping costs within British industry are enormous, with the potential for considerable financial savings through fault diagnosis and condition-based maintenance. Accurate condition monitoring data interpretation is a key requirement in pump fault diagnosis. However, the human skills required to transform monitored data into maintenance information are often unavailable. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are proposed for automation of this skill in the development of a pumping system decision support tool, the key requirement of which is accurate pump fault diagnosis. The cumulative sum charting procedure was used to establish a knowledge base of fault data for ANN implementation based on historical parameter measurements. Various preprocessing techniques were investigated in relation to generalization ability and convergence rates during the learning phase. Preprocessing predominantly affected ANN convergence rate, with the quality of training data crucial to generalization ability. ANNs could provide accurate, incipient fault diagnosis of pumping machinery based on real industrial data corresponding to historical pump faults.

Methane photolysis by the feeble solar irradiation at Saturn (similar to 100 times smaller than the irradiation at the Earth) converts the methane into a plethora of hydrocarbons. Some unsaturated hydrocarbons polymerize, to form long chains, which condense into aerosols. Indeed, three aerosol layers shroud Titan, as observed by the Voyager spacecraft. In the present paper, we try to construct an adequate kinetic model, to describe the experimentally observed methane photolysis products and high hydrocarbon polymer formation, as well as their chemical structures. The Adequate Kinetic Model (AKM) of chemical processes in Titan's atmosphere possesses three main properties: it is valid for the adequate description of any phenomena of the process investigated and describe these phenomena with a preassigned and known accuracy as well as having a prognostic capability. An adequate model is designed by a special procedure which consists of the determination of all possible (non-prohibited) elementary reactions - the so-called maximal mechanism. This mechanism is further successively decreased on the basis of stoichiometric, thermodynamic and kinetic restrictions. As a result, the adequate model does not contain any inner hidden contradictions. The most comprehensive AKM of chemical activity in Titan's atmosphere is found to consist of 732 elementary reactions and involves 147 chemical species. These species are saturated and unsaturated low hydrocarbons (such as C2H2, C2H4, C2H6 etc.), active intermediate-radical (H, CH2, CH3., etc.) and high molecular weight hydrocarbons, belonging to the Polyacetylene family (PA), Vinylacetylene family (VA) Polyvinyl family (PV) and Allenes (Polyenes). A row of low-dimensional partial AKM (Like AKM-98, AKM-145, etc.) are subtracted from the complete AKM-732. The validity of these models was verified by various testing procedures including direct comparison of the theoretical data with the available experimental data. Some general results of this AKM are: the overall time of establishment of chemical equilibrium (i.e. complete termination of chemical activity in Titan's atmosphere) is not less than 1.7 x 10(7) years, the current net-rate of production of the stable components of chemical evolution is 4.3 x 10(18) molec/m(3) sec; the ''coefficient of efficiency of the chemical machine'' converting the initial composition into the final stable products is similar to 0.82. The final products consist mainly of PA similar to(30-35)%, VA similar to(20-25)%, PV similar to(35-40)%, equilibrium abundance of low hydrocarbons (C2H6, C3H8, etc.) <10% and a small amount of Allenes <5%. These results will be used, further, to determine the composition and structure of Titan's three aerosol layers.

It then follows the progress of the early 1900s through the golden era of the late 1960s and early 1970s and to the present, An examination of trends and developments in recent years, as well as the early history, provides a context in which the future of absorption refrigeration systems can be projected. Current and future market drivers are diverse when viewed front. a global perspective. The energy infrastructure, national policies, and economics all play a role, with each being dominant in some region of the world. The current state of technology is examined prospects for new developments are assessed. Considerable progress has been made in the past twenty years; two-stage machines have significantly improved coefficients of performance (COPs) and electronic controls have greatly improved reliability and the range of operation, Triple-effect machines are under development but face considerable obstacles on technical and economic fronts. The prognosis for the future antic;,pates continued improvements, not only in, absorption, but in competing systems as well, The position of absorption will continue to be determined by policy, infrastructure, and economics in varying degrees depending on the region considered. Absorption will continue to be strong and grow rapidly in some areas but remain a niche in some parts of the world.

The periodic nature of rotating machinery however gives rise to vibrations which are cyclostationary. This paper applies a periodically time varying autoregressive fitter to better model such signals. Experimental results indicate that a model based approach can be applied to fault diagnosis where vibration data from faulty machines are available and to fault detection where only vibration data from normal operation are available.

As a severe accident could have important radiological consequences, this method is based on the diagnosis of the state of the safety barriers and on the prognosis of their behaviour. These tools allow the crisis team to provide advices to mitigate the accident on the damaged unit and to deliver public authorities with information on the radiological risk. At a first level, the software TOUTEC is intended to complement the hand - book of crisis team members with simplified calculation models and predefined relationships. It can avoid tedious calculation during stress conditions. The main items are the calculation of the primary circuit break size and the evaluation of hydrogen burning. The set of models named CRISALIDE is devoted to evaluate the following critical parameters : delay before core uncovery, containment pressure behaviour and finally source term. With these models, EDF Crisis Team is able to take into account combinations of boundary conditions according to safety and auxiliary systems availability and operator's actions. The set of models CRISALIDE and its man machine interface TOUMEC are running under WINDOWS environment on a Personal Computer. Assessment tests have shown a very good accuracy with best estimate codes as CATHARE. The models have become operationnal since the beginning of 1992 and they have been already used successfully during crisis drills.

For a sequential fault, the problem is more complex because of the memory effect (the probability of detection at time I depends on the vectors previously applied) and the exact solution requires the analysis of a Markov chain modeling the detection process. This paper shows that there is a value, obtained from the transition matrix of the Markov chain, which can take the place of p(f) when the test length is relatively long (this value is different from the average detection probability). From this result and taking into account a particular property of bounded faults in RAMs, several results concerning these faults, already observed by several authors, are shown.

This approach steps far beyond the ''fix it'' attitude that has often been the understood job of a maintenance technician. SMC incorporates Total Quality Management (TQM) practices, the predictive and preventive maintenance programs. The goal of the program is to maximize uptime while continuing to reduce variation. Variation has an effect on product yields, and equipment can be a major cause of the total variation in a factory. SMC addresses these concerns, and it requires a change in mind set that takes time, training and a lot of energy to bring to fruition. SMC works if the organization is committed to overcome the stumbling blocks along the way. This paper is illustrated with four practical examples.

While the electronics used in these systems have been upgraded to microprocessor technology, the basic detection principles have not changed over the last 30 years. In this paper, we present a novel method to detect, recognize, and classify a variety of railroad wheel-bearing defects using audible acoustic signals at several different train speeds (or different angular wheel speeds). Our algorithm consists of a data preprocessor, a feature extractor, and a single multilayer neural network. The feature extractor can use any one of four different transforms to generate feature vectors from input acoustic data: the fast Fourier transform (FFT), the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the discrete wavelet transform (nonredundant DWT), and the wavelet packet (redundant DWT). The classification performance using each feature vector type is presented. This algorithm can be applied to many kinds of bearings in rotational machinery to perform nondestructive fault detection and identification.

These signals include three-phase generator voltages and currents, generator held winding voltages and currents, generator power angle and turbine front standard speed deviation. The data is collected by a 16 analog channel 10 bit digital fault recorder (DFR) for several operating conditions including steady state, transient events due to transmission line faults, etc., and staged tests. The paper also discusses the methodology behind the use of these measured signals for on-line tracking of the stability parameters of a synchronous generator. In this context, a procedure for the on-line estimation of machine parameters and turns ratios will be developed. Continuous monitoring of the machine parameters and turns ratios in real time may then be used for incipient failure detection. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science S.A.

J	Yen, GG				Yen, GG			Health monitoring of vibration signatures in rotorcraft wings	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						artificial neural network; fault detection and identification; fuzzy logic; health monitoring; rotorcraft wing	DIAGNOSIS	We propose to design and to evaluate an on-board intelligent health assessment tool for rotorcraft machines, which is capable of detecting, identifying, and accommodating expected system degradations and unanticipated catastrophic failures in rotorcraft machines under an adverse operating environment. A fuzzy-based neural network paradigm with an on-line learning algorithm is developed to perform expert advising for the ground-based maintenance crew. A hierarchical fault diagnosis architecture is advocated to fulfill the time-critical and on-board needs in different levels of structural integrity over a global operating envelope. The research objective is to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed health monitoring procedure through numerical simulations of bearing faults in USAF MH-53J PAVE LOW helicopter transmissions.

Based on measured cutting forces, model parameters are estimated for each insert of the milling cutter. Using a classifier, the patterns of these estimated parameters are processed further, and the state of the milling process is determined. The method was first tested with simulated data, and then verified with measurements on a machining center.

J	Penman, J; Stavrou, A				Penman, J; Stavrou, A			Broken rotor bars: Their effect on the transient performance of induction machines	IEE PROCEEDINGS-ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						broken rotor bars; transient performance; induction machines	STEADY-STATE; MOTORS; ASYMMETRY; FAULTS	Around 10% of failures in cage induction motors are on the rotor. Problems result from defective castings in die-cast rotors, or from high resistance joints as a result of poor welding or brazing in fabricated cages. In such cases uneven bar stress is then unavoidable. Often, however, failure occurs due to fracture of bars caused by fatigue. This is common in machines with uneven and heavy duty cycles, which consequently are subject to high stress in the cage during periods of rapid braking and acceleration. Some success has been achieved in the development of techniques to identify bar failure, or high resistance joints, even on operational machines. The majority of techniques depend upon detecting a twice-slip frequency modulation in speed, torque or stator current by analysing an appropriate frequency spectrum. As yet, there is still no universally effective procedure for the early detection of such conditions. In this contribution, rotor parameters are evaluated allowing for current redistribution in the damaged rotor cage, and for the concomitant changes in resistance which result. Based upon this, a modified model of the induction machine, which includes the effect of broken rotor bars, and which will represent both transient and steady state behaviour, is developed. Experimental and calculated results compare the transient performance of the healthy and faulty machines.

For bearings, it focuses on the analysis of stress waves which are set up in metal-to-metal impacting, scuffing, abrasive wear, etc, Unlike demodulation, PeakVue does not employ any low pass filter, i.e., there are no implicit assumptions about a low frequency occurrence modulating a high frequency carrier, In theory, as well as practice, the PeakVue analysis procedure is capable of detecting bearing defects on very slow machinery (< 1 RPM) as well as on intermediate to fast machinery, It is demonstrated that PeakVue analysis is comparable to demodulation analysis on intermediate speed machinery and significantly superior to demodulation on slow speed machinery.

We compare the prognostic accuracy and the explanation ability of different classifiers. Among the different algorithms the semi-naive Bayesian classifier and Assistant-R seem to be the most appropriate. We analyze the combination of decisions of several classifiers for solving prediction problems and show that the combined classifier improves both performance and the explanation ability.

J	Tse, P; Wang, DD; Atherton, D				Tse, P; Wang, DD; Atherton, D			Harmony theory yields robust machine fault-diagnostic systems based on learning vector quantization classifiers	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						neural networks; fault diagnosis; pattern classification; harmony theory; consistency; probability distribution	BEARINGS	This contribution describes an algorithm to improve the ability of a learning vector quantization (LVQ) classifier in machine fault diagnosis. By adding a harmony model to the LVQ classifier the proposed method can construct an input-output mapping based on human knowledge and stipulated input-output vector pairs. Knowledge atoms from harmony theory are used to encode the knowledge of various machine fault patterns by capturing the probability distributions of input features during the training process. Therefore, the class boundaries of various fault patterns are made more distinguishable, and the capability of classification is enhanced. Moreover the summation of all the deviations generated from the input vectors and weights during the classification process can be better discriminated; therefore, the chance of misclassification caused by a few dominant distorted features is reduced. This proposed approach has been tested an classifying various faults obtained from a tapping machine, against other popular neural-network-based classifiers. The results from a series of experiments have demonstrated that this hybrid approach is promising, and particularly useful in classifying input features inherent with overlapping distributions and high uncertainty in the class boundaries.

They allow a much higher design productivity, but the designer often does nor directly control the circuit structure. Thus, when circuits are dedicated to dependable applications, designers have difficulties in implementing manually the devices needed to obtain fault detection or tolerance capabilities. The ASYL-SdF System has been developed over the last Few years in order to avoid this break in the design flow, and to facilitate the designer's work when dependability is targeted. This paper gives an overview of the resulting tool, its synthesis flow for fault detection and fault tolerance in Finite State Machines, its limitations and the current developments. Actual circuit implementation results are given in terms of area overheads, expected reliability and experimental fault detection coverage.

The neural network is trained to contain the knowledge of a detailed finite-element model whose results are integrated with system measurements to produce accurate machine fault diagnostics and component stress predictions. This technique rakes advantage of recent advances in neural network technology that enable real-time machinery diagnostics and component stress prediction to be performed on a PC with the accuracy of finite-element analysis. The availability of the real-time, finite-element-based knowledge on rotating elements allows for real-time component life prediction as well as accurate and fast fault diagnosis.

It concerts complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display. As if thereby compresses information while preserving the most important topological and metric relationships of the primary data elements on the display, it may also be thought ro produce some kind of abstractions. These two aspects, visualization and abstraction, occur in a number of complex engineering tasks such as process analysis, machine perception, control, and communication. The term self-organizing map signifies a class of mappings defined by error-theoretic consideration. In practice they result in certain unsupervised, competitive learning processes, computed by simple-looking SOM algorithms, The first SOM algorithms were conceived around 1981-1982, and the popularity of the more advanced SOM methods is growing at a steady pace. Many industries have found the SOM-based software tools useful. The most important property of the SOM, orderliness of the input-output mapping, can be utilized for many tasks: reduction of the amount of training data, speeding up learning, nonlinear interpolation and extrapolation, generalization, and effective compression of information for its transmission.

The bearing internal contact force tends to change when the spindle is subjected to abnormal operating conditions. In this paper, the complicated variations in the condition of a grinding spindle in a three-shift production line were studied with a focus on examining the drift of bearing operating conditions over a long period of time. The results show that a stable operating condition was achieved and this condition gradually shifts due to factors such as the start-stop of the spindle between shifts, wear, contamination, and temperature. It is shown in this paper that the bearing condition can be explicitly expressed on-line in a chart, denoted as a stability margin (SM) chart, where the nominal operating condition can be specified. As a result, predictive maintenance can be achieved by examining the bearing condition in comparison with the nominal operating condition specified in the chart.

J	Segal, L				Segal, L			Diagnosis of machinery by analysis of running temperature data	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						thermal diagnosis; maximum increase rate of temperature; time required to reach maximum; ambient temperature; technical condition; service life friction		A thermal diagnosis method is proposed for mechanisms and machinery under a transient regime, with a 10-15 minute implementation time. The suggested diagnostic parameter is the ratio of the maximum rate of increase of the temperature of the mechanism during operation to the time required to reach it. The temperature pattern, processed by computer, yields the overall technical condition of the mechanism and its pre-overhaul service term. For specific mechanisms, statistical data are needed to determine the initial and limiting values of the parameter. The proposed method is applicable in production as a means of control over the technological process; in overhauls as a means of quality evaluation; and in service for detection of faults and prediction of the service life.

J	Cooray, NL; Czeck, EW				Cooray, NL; Czeck, EW			Guaranteed fault detection sequences for single transition faults in finite state machine models using concurrent fault simulation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						sequential logic test generation; finite state machine testing; transition fault; distinguishing sequences	TEST-GENERATION	This paper presents a new algorithm for the generation of test sequences for finite state machines. Test sequence generation is based on the transition fault model, and the generation of state-pair distinguishing sequences. We show that the use of state-pair distinguishing sequences generated from a fault-free finite state machine will remain a distinguishing sequence even in the presence of single transition fault, thus guaranteeing complete single transition fault coverage. Analysis and experimental results show that the complexity of the test sequence generation algorithm is less than those of the previous algorithms. the utility of the transition fault model, and the generated test sequences is shown by their application to sequential logic circuits. These results show more than a factor of 10 improvement in the test generation time and some reduction in test length while maintaining 100% transition fault coverage.

J	Pawlak, WS; Vicente, KJ				Pawlak, WS; Vicente, KJ			Inducing effective operator control through ecological interface design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article								Ecological Interface Design (EID) is a theoretical framework for designing interfaces for complex human-machine systems. This article investigates the utility of EID in inducing effective real-time operator control performance during both normal and abnormal conditions. Two interfaces for a thermal-hydraulic process were compared, an EID interface based on physical and functional (P + F) system representations and a more traditional interface based solely on a physical (P) representation. Subjects were given 4 weeks of daily practice with one of the two interfaces before their performance on normal events and unfamiliar faults was evaluated. Under normal conditions, there was no performance difference between the P + F and P interfaces. However. dual task results indicate that the P interface loads more on verbal resources, whereas the P + F interface loads more on spatial resources during normal trials. Furthermore, a process tracing analysis of the fault trials showed that the P + F interface led to faster fault detection and more accurate fault diagnosis. Moreover, the P + F subjects exhibited a more sophisticated and effective set of fault management strategies that are similar to those observed in field studies of experienced operators in complex human-machine systems. In addition, a deficiency of the P + F interface was identified, suggesting a need for integrating historical information with emergent feature displays. Collectively, these findings have significant practical implications for the design of advanced computer interfaces for complex industrial systems.

Basic concepts	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							STRANGE ATTRACTORS	There is a wide variety of condition monitoring techniques currently in use for the diagnosis and prediction of machinery faults, but little attention has been paid to the occurrence and detection of chaotic behaviour in time series vibration signals. This paper introduces some of the basic concepts of chaos theory, then details a method for quantifying a fractal dimension from a time series, the correlation dimension. Some of the practical difficulties encountered in measuring the correlation dimension from the correlation integral algorithm are also outlined. Finally, some experimental results from a rolling element bearing test rig are presented. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited.

J	Lin, CCD; benWang, HP				Lin, CCD; benWang, HP			Performance analysis of rotating machinery using enhanced cerebellar model articulation controller (E-CMAC) neural networks	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	For today's sophisticated machinery systems, on-line predictive maintenance has become a most reliable and cost effective method for machinery maintenance. An effective fault monitoring and diagnosis tool is able to recognize the characteristics, conditions, and developing trends of an operating machinery system, and is able to estimate fault severity of the system quantitatively. In order to meet the requirements, a new approach combining cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural networks and advanced vibration monitoring methods has been presented. A test rig consisting of two rotating hubs driven by a d.c. motor was used to produce different machine imbalance levels. A two-stage experiment is proposed, First, a CMAC network is trained with pre-defined imbalance conditions and a test data set is given to check the trained CMAC for imbalance severity prediction. Second, a CMAC network is trained by using a set of different imbalance levels and is then given an untrained condition to test the CMACs ability of imbalance severity interpolation. In addition, several potential capabilities of CMAC networks will be discussed and shown. The properties of the CMAC are notable. If implemented properly, CMAC can be used as an effective machinery condition monitor and fault severity estimation tool.

J	Chen, YB; Li, X; Orady, E				Chen, YB; Li, X; Orady, E			Integrated diagnosis using information-gain-weighted radial basis function neural networks	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								A new approach, the information-gain-weighted radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), has been proposed for machinery diagnosis in a manufacturing environment. This approach is based on the composite neural network, in which a series of RBFNNs are integrated together to perform the task of classification. Each RBFNN has only one output node and is treated as a sub-network. Unlike the conventional RBFNNs, in which only the outputs of hidden nodes are weighted, the information-gain-weighted RBFNN uses a weighting vector also in its input layer. In addition, the weighting vector is obtained according to the information gain of each input index to the process of diagnosis. In the diagnosis strategy, one sub-net is responsible for diagnosing one specific fault, while the composite network as a whole can diagnose different kinds of faults. By this approach, classification among known faults can be made and a novel fault, if any, can also be identified. This approach has been tested in the diagnosis of an internal thread tapping process. The results showed that the information-gain-weighted RBFNN can produce better distinction between conditions and the scheme of a composite neural network is indeed an improved structure for machinery diagnosis in the manufacturing environment.

The fault diagnostic system includes an artificial neural network and a fuzzy logic-based hypothesis and test program. The performance of this transputer network is compared with that of a 486 33 MHz personal computer. It is found that a single T800 25 MHz transputer is much slower than the 486 PC. However, the performance is improved substantially when transputers are implemented in parallel. With the hardware cost of transputers continuing to drop, it is economically feasible to introduce this technology to the shop floor, acid to use it to perform many routine tasks.

Studies [2, 4] have shown that a rotor fault generates flux harmonics which induce in term of harmonics in the stator currents. So, the analysis of the torque which is the product of these two quantities, must give a better information on the faults. In this paper a new technique is presented allowing the diagnostic of an end-ring fault of a cage threephase asynchronous machine. Previous researches by the authors [5] have given the expression of the instantaneous electromagnetic torque with these defects influence. It has been observed actually that the ruptures influence greatly this quadratic quantity. The torque was calculated from the line currents and the e.m.f across flux sensors placed in the stator windings. In this method, the flux sensors are not essential to determine the electromagnetic torque. The rotor flux can be directly estimated by using an observer. This study presents how a model of the asynchronous machine is used to build the observer.

J	Parekhji, RA; Venkatesh, G; Sherlekar, SD				Parekhji, RA; Venkatesh, G; Sherlekar, SD			Monitoring machine based synthesis technique for concurrent error detection in finite state machines	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						concurrent error detection; monitoring machines; finite state machine synthesis	ASSIGNMENT	This paper discusses a new design methodology for concurrent error detection in synchronous sequential circuits based on the use of monitoring machines. In this approach, an auxiliary sequential circuit, called the monitoring machine, operates in lock-step with the main machine, such that any fault in either of the two machines is immediately detected. This methodology is independent of the fault model. It can be applied to FSMs with pre-encoded states and can also be used for ones being synthesised. It also provides a systematic framework for the combined optimisation of the main and monitoring machines, and for exploring tradeoffs in their implementation. The design of monitored sequential circuits is a two-fold problem; namely one of designing an optimal monitoring machine given the main machine, and the other of encoding the main machine states so that the resulting monitoring machine is minimal. This paper formally discusses the design of both the main and monitoring machines and techniques for their combined optimisation. Tradeoffs in their implementation based on selective fault detection are also examined. Through experimental results, it is shown that the proposed synthesis technique is eminently suitable for the design of low-cost sequential circuits with concurrent error detection. The monitoring machine is less costly than the main machine. It is also not identical to it. As a result, a monitored sequential circuit has significantly lower hardware cost and improved fault coverage than previous implementations.

The distorted line current waveforms in a single-phase thyristor ac controller and a three-phase diode rectifier that feeds an inverter-machine load have been taken into consideration, and neural networks have been trained to estimate the total rms current, fundamental rms current, displacement factor, and power factor, The performance of the neural network-based estimators has been compared with the actual values, and excellent performance is indicated, Neural network-based estimation has the usual advantages of very fast and simultaneous response of all the outputs, noise, and fault-tolerant performance and can be easily implemented in dedicated analog or digital hardware chips, which can coexist with digital signal processor (DSP) and/or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, The estimation techniques can be extended to more complex waveforms in power electronics.

The model considers repair lead time and the stochastic history of the sensor measurements being monitored in making these decisions. This research provides a significant contribution to the area of automated machine diagnostics and monitoring systems, which are becoming a critical competitive technology for capital intensive industries.

J	Burnett, R; Watson, JF; Elder, S				Burnett, R; Watson, JF; Elder, S			The application of modern signal processing techniques for use in rotor fault detection and location within three-phase induction motors	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						time-frequency distributions; signal analysis; non-stationary; transient analysis; machine condition monitoring; fault detection		A commonly used technique for the detection of faults which may occur in three-phase induction motors is to carry out a spectral analysis of the supply current to the motor under investigation. The presence of certain frequency components within the spectral analysis has been shown to be indicative of a fault condition (Hargis et al., 1982). Such techniques are becoming well established and are used regularly to monitor the health of large induction motors which are operated in critical applications within, for example, the nuclear and oil industries. This technique is generally applied to machines when they are operated under steady-state conditions. Recent work however has suggested that greater information may be obtained from a faulty motor if the same parameters which are monitored in the steady state are measured and analysed during transient conditions, such as the initial starting and acceleration periods of the motor. The frequency components which are indicative of motor faults are functions of speed, and hence, under these transient conditions are non-stationary in nature. This paper presents a review of modern signal processing techniques applicable to the analysis of signals whose frequency content is non-stationary. The individual techniques are compared using both test and actual data. Results are presented which identify the technique most appropriate for the task of fault detection in an induction motor under transient conditions. This technique is further investigated with regard to the possibility of locating as well as detecting machine faults.

Moreover, it is noted for its cost effectiveness, though there could be a limited time between detection and failure. Equipment rotating at low rotational speeds present an increased difficulty to the maintenance engineer, since conventional vibration measuring equipment is not capable of measuring the fundamental frequency of operation, also, component distress at low operational speeds does not necessarily show an obvious change in vibration signature. Consequently techniques normally associated with vibration analysis of rotating machines become difficult to perform. This paper presents a study into the use of stress wave analysis as a means of detecting early stages of loss of mechanical integrity in low speed machinery. This is achieved by the simulation of a variety of faults on a test rig. Stress waves were detected using a commercial acoustic emission type transducer.

The measured variable in the system is the pump outlet pressure; the transient response of this as the flow valve is closed is used as a pattern for fault recognition. A two stage diagnostic system using a back propagation NN at each stage is described and this is trained by using data from the coolant system under healthy (that is unfaulty) and faulty conditions. The faults are simulated on the real coolant system. Novel (that is previously unmet) faults are defined by maximum values of a 'deviation' which is used to allocate faults. The diagnostic system is shown to be capable of first deciding whether the system is healthy or faulty, if faulty it then decides whether one of the three common faults or a novel fault is occurring. Having made the decision that one of the common faults is occurring it is then capable of deciding, from four different levels, the approximate severity level of the fault. Of 345 tests on the coolant system the diagnostic system allocated the fault 99% correctly and the severity level 96% correctly.

This paper describes an approach which performs condition monitoring of production lines based on a max-plus model of the event-time dynamics. In particular, this work pertains to discrete part manufacturing systems such as automotive assembly lines or electronic circuit board lines where the dynamics are governed by the action of certain events, e.g., the processing of a part by a machine or the departure of a part from a buffer. A state model of the event-time dynamics, based in the max-plus algebra, is used to emulate the nominal operation of a production line. The machine completion times are taken as the states of the model. Since only output measurements of the production line are available, an observer is needed to provide estimates of the machine completion times. Because of the nature of the max-plus algebra, a recursive state observer is not obtainable; instead, a block-form state observer is used to update the model state on a periodic basis. A timing residual is formed using the outputs of the model and the output measurements of the plant. The residual is then analyzed using standard statistical process control (SPC) techniques to detect failures. Simulation results for a simple production line illustrate the approach. The novelties of this approach are the introduction of an event-time observer and the application of the observer to the problem of condition monitoring.

To optimise maintenance activities, one needs to know, for a start, what plant items are maintenance critical. Apart form many things, these maintenance critical items must be condition monitoring, either on line, off line or the monitoring of process information, to ensure the overall enhancement of the plant in terms of availability, reliability, or general maintenance conditions. To manage and optimise predictive maintenance activities based on condition monitoring information, one needs to be sure that the correct parameters are identified, managed and condition monitored. For this a structured activity analysis method, a plant condition information system, and a definite link between these activities, the information systems and a maintenance management system is required. This paper presents a method called Front End Maintenance Analysis which has widely been applied in industry and proved to be an effective method of identifying parameters for condition monitoring and clearly shows the link between these parameters and a maintenance management system in general. No plant or any machine can be optimally maintained within a specific organisation without a documented and agreed maintenance strategy. The process thereby starts off with the maintenance strategy. The next step is the identification of all hardware items (structured plant inventory) to be maintained. Thereafter a failure mode and criticality analysis is done which is used by the MSI Logic (Maintenance Significant Item) to separate the preventive maintenance activities from the corrective maintenance activities. Using the RCM Logic (Reliability Centred Maintenance), a further split can be made on preventive maintenance items. The specific parameters of each component or item to be condition monitored can thereby be identified. Having the right parameters, the appropriate condition monitoring equipment can be identified and acquired. A condition based information system can then be linked into any maintenance management system, feeding it with the correctly selected information for optimised ongoing maintenance scheduling.

In a control room, it is difficult to know accidents such as fire, fuel oil leak, and unusual sound, at a moment's notice. Maintenance operators, therefore, have to patrol the plant yard to find out them. To release from the patrol, the needs for automatic monitoring system to detect those accidents are increasing. We have developed a new intelligent monitoring system using advanced ima,ae and sound analysis, which is reference to human senses, to realize the request. This system can detect oil and steam leak from burners, unusual sound from machines, and, fire and smoke in the circumference. This paper describes the system outline, features, and methods of image processing and sound analysis.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were proposed for condition monitoring data interpretation utilising quantitative performance data. In the analysis, the Cumulative Sum (Cusum) charting procedure was successful in incipient fault identification. Various preprocessing techniques were investigated to obtain maximum diagnostic information despite the inherent problems of real industrial data. The orthonormal technique highlighted good generalisation ability in fast machine learning rime. ANNs were successful for accurate, incipient diagnosis of pumping machinery fault conditions based on real industrial data corresponding to historical pump faults.

The technique uses positive- and negative-sequence models of the synchronous generator, and voltages and currents measured at the generator terminals. It does not need information concerning the machine parameters and is applicable to all types of generators, irrespective of their size. Fault discrimination characteristics and a digital algorithm based on the proposed technique are described. The performance of the proposed technique was evaluated using fault data generated by simulations using an electromagnetic transient program, EMTDC. Fault data were also acquired by subjecting a laboratory generator to internal and external faults. Results of the studies using simulated and experimental data are included in the paper. The results indicate that the proposed technique can detect faults including open circuits and faults that short-circuit windings of one phase.

Specifically, the detection of a disturbance in the input arrival times is demonstrated. A timing residual is formed using an event-timing model based on the max-plus algebra of the production line. The residual is then analyzed using standard statistical process control (SPC) techniques to detect failures. Simulation results for a simple two-machine production line illustrate the approach. The novelty of this approach is the use of a max-plus event-timing model with an additive noise model and the application of an event-timing model to the fault diagnosis problem.

But modern manufacturing systems are not obtaining the production rates that were thought for them during their design phase. Unscheduled downtimes of machines due to unexpected breakdowns are one of the main reasons for not:reaching the production objectives and for the increase of production and maintenance costs. In this context, it is necessary to improve the quality and availability of the machines that take place in the productive process, developing systems that try to prevent the faults and try to minimize the effects of unscheduled breakdowns. For this reason, it is necessary to provide the maintenance staff with advanced diagnostic and maintenance management tools and an integration platform in which an of them can work in an integrated form together with production. For this purpose, a methodology for the management of maintenance has been developed and used in an automated manufacturing system located in the ETSII and of Telecommunications of Bilbao.

An applied research work was carried out in two hydraulic turbines analysing the rotor response both theoretically and experimentally. A developed mathematical model was used to simulate the rotordynamic behaviour of Francis and Kaplan turbines. The main dynamical effects that appear during the operation of the machines are discussed too. A series of measurements were carried out in the turbines using impact hammers to determine the modal behaviour of the units. The tests were carried out with the machine still and in operation. Some results and the comparison with the theory is presented in this article. The improved theoretical model was used for a sensitivity analysis of the different bearings to the main excitations that fake place during the machine operation. From this analysis, the best measuring points for condition monitoring were determined.			Nascimento, LP (corresponding author), UNESP,DEM,FEIS,AV BRASIL 56,BR-15385000 ILHA SOLTEIRA,BRAZIL.

Then both of them are applied comprehensively to machinery fault diagnosis. Wavelet trans form is used to pre-process data and extract feature vectors. Anns is used to identify fault types. By Wavelet transform, the dimension of the feature vector is greatly decreased and the noises are restrained as well. Thus the construction of the Anns is simplified and tile calculation speed is raised without lowering accuracy. For comparing, two types of features are extracted. Such diagnosing measure is proved to be efficient by an experience at the end of the paper.

Among the multitude of phase-keeping purifying method, limit-duration impulse response filters have received recently renewed attention for several reasons. The finite-length filter offers the advantages of stability, exactly linear phase and high speed implementation with the Past Fourier Transform. This paper presents an efficient numerical technique for the accelerating optimum (in the Chebyshev sense) FIR digital filters design. Its advantages over other FIR filters (typically the Kaiser windowing technique) are discussed and compared. Upon this basis, the authors apply the technique for the machinery's vibroacoustical signals phase-keeping purification and get some obviously analytic results that proved its extensively flexible suitability and effectiveness.

In this model the concerned aging phenomena are described by the postcharge-index, the initial up-current-index, the first-peak-time, and some other related indices, which are defined in this paper. The theoretical inferences of the DC behavior model to aging phenomena have been verified with the experimental results, which are obtained by a so called ''Reverse-drive'' aging test with rotating machines. The result of the research verifies that dielectric polarization plays an important role in the aging progression of low voltage winding insulating systems. It indicates also that the aging-state of winding insulating systems can be practically supervised by means of this description method to the DC behavior. This model can be used as an active tool to the estimation of aging-state and fault prognosis for low voltage winding insulating systems.

The system learns the normal behavior of the network. Deviations from the norm are detected and the information is combined in the probabilistic framework of a Bayesian network. The proposed system is thereby able to detect unknown or unseen faults. As demonstrated on real network data, this method can detect abnormal behavior before a fault actually occurs, giving the network management system (human or automated) the ability to avoid a potentially serious problem.

The aim of this investigation is to improve the learning characteristics of LVQ so as to get more accurate classification results. In the proposed scheme, the reference vectors are set to the locations mostly matching the probability distribution of training vectors. Genetic Algorithms are applied to optimize the locations and distribution of the reference vectors. After competitive learning of LVQ, the reference vectors are employed to be representatives of various patterns to determine the categories which testing vectors belong to. A comparison study is reported based on LVQ with random initial reference vectors, LVQ with GA learning and LVQ with initial reference vectors set by GA. Experiment results of case study have shown that the proposed method is promising to machine fault classification.

For a set of similar new machines, coming from the assembly line, the typical features of vibration differ from one machine to another. Consequently, one must make a specific model for every machine and test if new, possibly harmful, vibrations will occur during the use of the machine. The classification system must discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar patterns with inclination to reject unseen patterns rather than accept badly distorted familiar ones.

In the support and maintenance of shipboard machinery and equipment, preemptive maintenance will provide ships' personnel with the ability to act on potential machine failure and repair/replacement situations before shutdown and operational crisis can occur. A Preemptive Maintenance system combines the concepts of equipment Intrinsic Health Monitoring (IHM) (a form of condition monitoring) and Predictive Maintenance (PDM) in a manner which produces optimum efficiency in equipment functional operation as well as optimizing logistics in support of operations. The implementation of IHM and PDM within a centralized and automatic system will provide preemptive maintenance as an integral component of intelligent ship operations. The integration of this kind of an equipment ''health'' status system within the framework of functional performance will provide a ship's ''equipment situation report'' with fewer manhours spent in equipment surveillance and will provide greater assurance of continued faultless machinery operation. The great benefit of an IHM system as applied to ship operation is the system console presentation that continued ''fail-free'' operation can be expected over a future demand period. (The assurance of planned operations without interruption.) In addition, remote observation of impending problems at a central maintenance support facility can assist in the diagnosis of the problem and the most efficient corrective action.										0	0	0	0	1	AMERICAN SOCIETY NAVAL ENGINEERS	ALEXANDRIA	1452 DUKE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314							1996							31	52					4	Engineering, Marine	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BH30Z	WOS:A1996BH30Z00004					2022-02-14

Schedule or use-based maintenance is performed based on mortality statistics (e.g., statistical studies of wear and failure which allow prediction of the expected time to failure of a population of similar mechanical systems). A new philosophy, termed Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), is evolving in which a system is instrumented with one or more sensors, and maintenance is performed based on the observed condition of the individual system. and on projections of failure events (usually based on simple trending techniques). CBM provides the potential for improved safety, reduced lifecycle maintenance costs? and extended use of existing equipment. Indeed, if properly implemented, smart CBM systems could be used to reduce the manpower required for ships. CBM is becoming increasingly viable due to recent advances in sensors, digital signal processing, mechanical modeling, and automated reasoning techniques. This paper introduces the concept of CBM systems, and provides an overview of research currently being performed at the Applied Research Laboratory, The Pennsylvania Stare University (ARL Penn Stare). The research involves five main areas: (1) sensors and sensing technology; (2) signal processing and multisensor data fusion; (3) micro-mechanical modeling; (4) nonlinear dynamical modeling; and (5) intelligent reasoning and control. In each area. new advances art being made to provide the basis for reliable condition monitoring and failure prediction. Advances include. new smart sensors fabricated via nanofabrication techniques; development of new tools for signal processing and fusion of non-commensurate sensor data; development of improved understanding of the micro-mechanical failure phenomena; new models for prediction of failure evolution; and hybrid approximate reasoning techniques for automatic, contextual, interpretation of the output of sensors and models. This research is being performed as part of a portfolio of research projects funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR), including a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) on Integrated Predictive Diagnostics (IPD). The paper will present an overview of mis research and an assessment of the applicability of that research to Smart Ship applications.

J	Huang, HH; BenWang, HP				Huang, HH; BenWang, HP			An integrated monitoring and diagnostic system for roller bearings	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						artificial neural network; autoregressive; fuzzy logic; machine monitoring	NEURAL-NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	This paper discusses a machine fault diagnostic system which integrates three techniques: 1. An autoregressive model, which compresses digitised vibration signals and preserves the information carried in the original signal. 2. A supervised artificial neural network for fault classification. 3. A fuzzy logic-based ''hypothesis and test'' program, which, when the artificial neural network fails to provide any suggestion, is able to provide the human diagnostician with some initial ''educated'' guesses of machine conditions. This integrated machine diagnostic system was developed on a 486 personal computer. Throughout the course of this development, the program has been tested with three types of vibration signal: 1. Vibration signals created using bearing physical models. 2. Vibration signals collected from two laboratory experiments ruing accelerometers. 3. Vibration signals collected from real production machine tools. In this article, the authors discuss the underlying theory of those three techniques. Experimental apparatus is introduced. Performance statistics are provided. For those conditions it was designed and developed to diagnose, the program demonstrated remarkably dependable performance.

J	Baillie, DC; Mathew, J				Baillie, DC; Mathew, J			A comparison of autoregressive modeling techniques for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								The paper introduces the concept of fault diagnosis using an observer bank of autoregressive time series models. The concept was applied experimentally to diagnose a number of induced faults in a rolling element bearing using the measured time series vibration signal. Three distinct techniques of autoregressive modeling were compared for their performance and reliability under conditions of various signal lengths. The results indicate that backpropagation neural networks generally outperformed the radial basis functions and the traditional linear autoregressive models. This modeling technique for fault diagnosis was found to require much shorter lengths of vibration data than traditional pattern classification techniques used in the field of machine condition monitoring.

The drawbacks of this approach are mostly related to the knowledge acquisition techniques. To avoid this lengthy task an approach is proposed which? is based on using simplified process models and simulating their response at different faulty and non-faulty conditions Using the resulting set of learning examples iteratively through the learning cycle, an optimal decision tree with maximum classification? accuracy and simple structure can be generated. The approach and its features is studied on a simulated laboratory process.

Computer/machine vision systems offer a solution, but the development of effective algorithms that are able to accommodate the natural variability of food products has proved to be problematic. This paper will examine and compare three techniques for processing multi-spectral imagery for these applications. One technique is to use artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs have the ability to be fault tolerant when establishing decision surfaces within the test data and can operate in parallel at high speeds-this makes them ideal for this application. The main drawback of ANNs is their inability to provide a meaningful justification for the decision boundaries they establish when classifying data. Another image processing technique that uses a more deterministic data classification method is vector quantization (VQ). VQ uses a data clustering and splitting algorithm that can be modified to improve speed and accuracy according to the application. In an effort to include all levels of algorithm complexity, a modified thresholding approach is also compared to the more computationally demanding ANN and VQ techniques. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these algorithms are highlighted based on their performance in these domains.

However, the standard electronic operator station still functions primarily as a replacement for hardwired traditional control panel devices like pushbuttons and lamps: it gets status updates from a PLC and permits operators to make simple entries. But the operator still has to survey all status information and make all of the decisions. What if the operator station could also present action suggestions which were context-sensitive, to lead an operator through a necessary series of steps? A new ''Guided Operator Station'' approach to operator station design and function is now available: giving the operator station the power to use PLC status information to select sequences of actions to be presented to operators. Such a system can guide an otherwise untrained operator through a correct sequence for machine startup or fault diagnostics, without extensive additional programming in the PLC.

Research has been produced a considerable effort in seeking systematic approaches to fault detection for both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. In this framework, different techniques to FDI for robot manipulators have been proposed in recent years: although the problem of application, of such techniques on industrial robots has not been, extensively investigated. In this paper an observer-based approach to FDI is applied to a conventional industrial manipulator with open control architecture. A nonlinear discrete-time observer is designed to generate the residuals sensitive to both sensors and actuators failures. Then, the effectiveness of the resulting FDI scheme is tested in a number of experimental case studies. The results show that clear and distinct fault signatures can Be obtained also in, the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. Also, the potential of nonlinear FDI techniques np plied to conventional industrial machines is demonstrated.

In order to detect bias type faults, a bias chi(2) FDI method is proposed here on the basis of the pseudo separated-bias estimation (PSBE) algorithm. Estimates of biases ob tained by PSBE are used to construct a statistical variable which obeys chi(2) distribution in normal operational conditions. As a result, by testing if the constructed variable is chi(2) distributed at every estimation step, one can detect input-output bias faults quickly. In order to identify where a bias fault occurs, a bias component chi(2) detection scheme is proposed further. Simulation results of a paper machine illustrate the effectiveness of the method for real-time application.

The MD&P information is used for predicting remaining life, and for real-time constraining of operational parameters for life extension of operating machines. Both technical and economic feasibility issues are examined Technical feasibility analysis is supported by laboratory experiments and simulations of a reusable rocket propulsion engine and electric power plants. These experiments demonstrate substantial reductions in total accumulated damage by slight adjustments in the process variables to reduce system stress. Furthermore the results lead one to devise life extension methods for operating machinery by constraining the process variables based on load history, operational requirements and total accumulated damage of critical components Typically, the health and monitoring of equipment is done on site, historic and diagnostic databases are archived, logistics and schedule data are available from plant management, and the dynamic models of damage and operating equipment performance under thermomechanical fatigue, creep, corrosion and wear are often proprietary and available only from vendors of equipment or research organizations. Concepts for utilizing the emerging National Information Infrastructure in meeting the computational and economic challenges of equipment life extension methods are developed. The technical vision supporting these concepts is that of electronic monitoring, diagnostic and prognostic services for electromechanical systems from specialized and generic centers over a ubiquitous information infrastructure. Necessary advances in information technology and an operational concept for supporting such a maintenance infrastructure are presented.

The usefulness of different levels of simulation prior to clinical trials has been shown in previous studies in anaesthesia. Thus, in earlier work on pole-placement self-tuning for muscle relaxation, a dual computer real-time simulation was undertaker, subsequent to algorithm validation via off-line simulation. In the present work, supervised fuzzy rule-based control algorithms are being used. The control software was implemented on the actual machine to be used in theatre, while another computer acted as a real-rime patient simulator. it provides a fast design and simulation environment for safety-critical validation. The resultant validated controllers are now being used clinically.

Key components are rotating machineries like main coolant pumps in nuclear power plants, recirculation pumps, turbines, fresh water and feed water pumps as well as mills and blowers. Diagnostic systems are requested which detect, diagnose and localize faulty operation conditions at an early stage in order to prevent severe failures and to enable predictive and condition oriented maintenance. The knowledge of vibrational machine signatures and their time dependent behavior are the basis of efficient condition monitoring of rotating machines. The performance of vibration reference measurements are of importance for fault detection during operation by trend settings. The use of vibration thresholds given by norms and standards is only a small section of available possibilities. Therefore, for each machinery individual thresholds should be determined using statistical time values, spectra comparison, cepstrum analysis and correlation analysis for source localization corresponding to certain machine operation conditions.

J	Chen, YD; Du, R; Qu, LS				Chen, YD; Du, R; Qu, LS			Fault features of large rotating machinery and diagnosis using sensor fusion	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Large rotating machinery such as turbines and compressors are the key equipment in oil refineries, power plants, and chemical engineering plants. To minimize the economic loss incurred because of the defects or malfunctions of these machines, diagnosis is very important. Currently, diagnosis is carried out mainly using spectral analysis. In spite of being effective in detecting the faults (monitoring), spectral analysis is often ineffective in pin-pointing what the fault is (diagnosis). This is due to the fact that it cannot clarify the spatial and temporal features in the sensor signals that are correlated to different types of faults. In this paper, phase spectra, holospectra, purified orbit diagrams, and filtered orbit diagrams are used in searching for fault features. From the data obtained from more than 50 practical machines, distinct fault features and diagnostic indices are found for 11 different types of faults including unbalance, cracks, misalignment, rub, loose bearing caps, oil whirl, surge, fluid excitation, rotating stall, electric power supply fluctuation, and pipe excitation. Accordingly, a diagnostic procedure is proposed. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.

Vibration monitoring of mechanical bearing frequencies is currently used to detect the presence of a fault condition. Since these mechanical vibrations are associated with variations in the physical air gap of the machine, the air gap flux density is modulated and stator currents are generated at predictable frequencies related to the electrical supply and vibrational frequencies. This paper takes the initial step of investigating the efficacy of current monitoring for bearing fault detection by correlating the relationship between vibration and current frequencies caused by incipient bearing failures. The bearing failure modes are reviewed and the characteristic bearing frequencies associated with the physical construction of the bearings are defined. The effects on the stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. This is an important result in the formulation of a fault detection scheme that monitors the stator currents. Experimental results which show the vibration and current spectra of an induction machine with different bearing faults are used to verify the relationship between the vibrational and current frequencies. The test results clearly illustrate that the stator current signature can be used to identify the presence of a bearing fault.

This system utilizes artificial neural networks to learn the spectral characteristics of a good motor operating on-line. This learned spectrum may contain many harmonics due to the load which correspond to normal operating conditions. In order to reduce the number of harmonics which are continuously monitored to a manageable number, a selective frequency filter is employed. This frequency filter only passes those harmonics which are known to be of importance in fault detection, or which are continuously above a set level, to a neural net clustering algorithm. After a sufficient training period, the neural network signals a potential failure condition when a new cluster is formed and persists for some time. Since a fault condition is found by comparison to a prior condition of the machine, on-line failure prediction is possible with this system without requiring information on the motor or load characteristics. The detection algorithm was implemented and its performance verified on various fault types.

Different techniques have been proposed for stuck-at fault diagnosis in combinational as well as sequential circuits. On the other side, diagnosis of delay faults has received attention for the first category of circuits, but not for synchronous sequential circuits. So, this paper concerns with delay fault diagnosis iri non-scan circuits. The principle of the proposed method, based on a path tracing algorithm, is first given. Next, new concepts for improving path tracing in the proposed diagnosis process (identification of self-masking) are also presented. As the method is based on path tracing through the sequential circuit, gate delay faults as well as path delay faults are considered and may be located in a faulty machine. Results of experiments on ISCAS-89 sequential benchmark circuits are finally discussed.

J	LEE, J				LEE, J			MODERN COMPUTER-AIDED MAINTENANCE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AND SYSTEMS - REVIEW AND PERSPECTIVE	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS	This paper examines various methods in modern computer-aided maintenance including machine monitoring,fault detection and fault diagnostics. A perspective on proactive maintenance by monitoring the degradation of manufacturing equipment and systems is presented and illustrated. If the behavior of manufacturing equipment and systems call be monitored and measured adaptively then an early warning of possible faults can be generated. By doing this, maintenance personnel can perform early diagnostics and part replacement during regular maintenance hours. The paper also addresses the research needs based on the industrial perspective. The author believes that the development of in-process monitoring of machine degradation and faults is one of the most important research tasks for increasing machine uptime and improving production quality.

The conventional method, using a decision tree, applies only to discrete attribute values, To apply it to fault diagnosis of power distribution lines, in practice it must be revised in order to treat attributes whose values range over certain widths, This is because the sensor value or attribute value varies owing to the resistance of the fault point or is influenced by noise, The proposed method is useful when the attribute value has such a property, and it takes into consideration the cost of acquiring the information and the probability of the occurrence of a fault.

J	KONRADT, U				KONRADT, U			STRATEGIES OF FAILURE DIAGNOSIS IN COMPUTER-CONTROLLED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS - EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF ADAPTIVE DECISION-SUPPORT SYSTEMS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VERBAL REPORTS; KNOWLEDGE; MODELS	This study investigates strategies in failure diagnosis at cutting-machine-tools with a verbal knowledge acquisition technique. Sixty-nine semi-structured interviews were performed with mechanical and electrical maintenance technicians, and a protocol analysis was conducted. Strategies were analysed in dependence of the technician's job experience, his familiarity with the problem and problem complexity. The technicians were categorized into three groups, novices, advanced, and experts, based upon level of experience. Results show that typical strategies of failure diagnosis are ''Historical information'', ''Least effort'', ''Reconstruction'', and ''Sensory check''. Strategies that lead to a binary reduction of the problem space, such as ''Information uncertainty'' and ''Split half'', play only a minor role in real-life failure diagnosis. Job experience and the familiarity with the problem significantly influenced the occurrence of strategies. In addition to ''Symptomatic search'' and ''Topographic search'', results show frequent use of case-based strategies, particularly in routine failures. In novel situations, technicians usually used ''Topographic search''. A software design method, the strategy-based software design (SSD) is proposed, that uses strategies to derive decision support systems, that are adaptive to the different working styles and the changing levels of experience in user groups.

J	LEE, J				LEE, J			MACHINE PERFORMANCE MONITORING AND PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE IN COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING - REVIEW AND PERSPECTIVE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	A major problem confronting American manufacturers today is how to economically achieve high quality in the goods which they manufacture. Equipment reliability and maintenance drastically affect the three key elements of competitiveness: quality, cost and product lead time. Well-maintained machines hold tolerances better, help reduce scrap and rework, and raise consistency and quality of the part. They increase uptime and yields of good parts, thereby cutting total production costs, and also can shorten lead times by reducing downtime and the need for retooling. The recent rush to embrace computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) has further increased the use of relatively unknown and untested technology. In a computer-integrated manufacturing system, a fault can cause machine and production downtime and create serious productivity losses. Today, many factories are still performing maintenance on equipment in a reactive, or breakdown, mode, since traditional process monitoring systems can detect machine or process faults only when they occur. Reactive maintenance is expensive because of extensive unplanned downtime and damage to machinery. In high-performance systems one often cannot tolerate significant degradation in performance during normal system operation. This had led many US manufacturers to look to suppliers for smarter equipment that will ease the need for strong technical support. The proactive maintenance approach is to use integrated, investigative and corrective practices to significantly extend machinery life. The goal of proactive maintenance is to eliminate failures of equipment forever. If the behaviour of a machine can be monitored adaptively then an early warning of possible faults can be generated. By doing this, maintenance personnel can perform early diagnostics and part replacement during regular daily maintenance hours. Therefore, the mean-time-between-failure can be extended to an unlimited length. The author believes that the development of in-process monitoring of machine degradation and faults is one of the most important research tasks for increasing machine uptime and improving production quality. This paper examines various methods in machine monitoring, fault detection, and fault diagnostics. A perspective on proactive maintenance and research needs is also presented.

Three regression and one neural network modeling methods were investigated, The models are verified on data collected several weeks after the initial experiment, demonstrating that the models built with real-time data survive small changes in the machine due to normal operation and maintenance, The predictive capability can be used to assess the quality of the wafers after processing, thereby ensuring that only wafers worth processing continue down the fabrication line, Future applications include real-time evaluation of wafer features and economical run-to-run control.

The paper discusses one of these approaches in detail, the use of a graph-reduction machine such as ALICE. The technique is illustrated through two example domains: automobile fault diagnosis and organic psychiatric mental disorders. The paper discusses extensions to the graph reduction technique as applied to knowledge-based systems, including partitioning, time considerations and input data types. The paper shows that the graph-reduction technique has significant advantages for knowledge-based system implementation over conventional approaches, and it demonstrates that this programming style is amenable to knowledge engineering domains.

A neural network can substitute in a more effective way the faulted machine models used to formalize the knowledge base of the diagnostic system when inputs and outputs are suitably chosen. Training the neural network by data achieved through experimental tests on healthy machines and through simulation in case of faulted machines, the diagnostic system can discern between ''healthy'' and ''faulty'' machines, This procedure substitutes the statement of a trigger threshold, required by the diagnostic procedure based on the machine models.

J	SCHOEN, RR; HABETLER, TG				SCHOEN, RR; HABETLER, TG			EFFECTS OF TIME-VARYING LOADS ON ROTOR FAULT-DETECTION IN INDUCTION MACHINES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE Industry-Applications-Society 28th Annual Meeting	OCT 02-08, 1993	TORONTO, CANADA	IEEE, Ind Applicat Soc				This paper addresses the problem of motor current spectral analysis for the detection of nonidealities in the air gap flux density when in the presence of an oscillating or position-varying load torque, Several schemes have been proposed for the detection of air gap eccentricities and broken rotor bars. The analysis of these effects, however, generally assumes that the load torque is constant, If the load torque varies with the rotational speed, then the motor current spectral harmonics produced by the load will overlap the harmonics caused by the fault conditions, The motor current spectral components in the presence of various fault and load conditions are reviewed, The interaction of the effects on the actual stator current spectrum caused by the fault condition and the torque oscillations are shown to be separable only if the angular position of the fault with respect to the load torque characteristic is known. This is an important result in the formulation of an on-line fault detection scheme that measures only a single phase of the stator current, Since the spatial location of the fault is not known, its influence on a specific current harmonic component cannot be separated from the load effects. Therefore, on-line detection schemes must rely on. monitoring a multiple frequency signature and identifying those components not obscured by the load effect, Experimental results which show the current spectra of an induction machine under eccentric air gap and broken rotor bar conditions are given for both fixed and oscillating loads.

J	MANGASARIAN, OL; STREET, WN; WOLBERG, WH				MANGASARIAN, OL; STREET, WN; WOLBERG, WH			BREAST-CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS VIA LINEAR-PROGRAMMING	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							MODELS	Two medical applications of linear programming are described in this paper. Specifically, linear programming-based machine learning techniques are used to increase the accuracy and objectivity of breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The first application to breast cancer diagnosis utilizes characteristics of individual cells, obtained from a minimally invasive fine needle aspirate, to discriminate benign from malignant breast lumps. This allows an accurate diagnosis without the need for a surgical biopsy. The diagnostic system in current operation at University of Wisconsin Hospitals was trained on samples from 569 patients and has had 100% chronological correctness in diagnosing 131 subsequent patients. The second application, recently put into clinical practice, is a method that constructs a surface that predicts when breast cancer is likely to recur in patients that have had their cancers excised. This gives the physician and the patient better information with which to plan treatment, and may eliminate the need for a prognostic surgical procedure. The novel feature of the predictive approach is the ability to handle cases for which cancer has not recurred (censored data) as well as cases for which cancer has recurred at a specific time. The prognostic system has an expected error of 13.9 to 18.3 months, which is better than prognosis correctness by other available techniques.

The systems and languages communities have built many tools for error detection, fault isolation, architecture translation, performance measurement, simulation, and optimization using this approach of modifying executables. Currently, however tools of this sort are difficult and time-consuming to write and are usually closely tied to a particular machine and operating system. EEL supports a machine- and system-independent editing model that enables tool builders to modify an executable without being aware of the derails of the underlying architecture or operating system or being concerned with the consequences of deleting instructions or adding foreign code.

The simplicity, precision, and generality of the graphs mean that they are very useful tools in the representation of manufacturing systems. At the same time, any system modelled by means of graphs is an ideal candidate for coding with AI tools. The physical and functional models of manufacturing systems can be represented by means of petri nets, status diagrams, decision trees, logic graphs, grafcets, fault diagnosis graphs, and so on.

METHODOLOGY	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article								The use of electric motors in industry is extensive. These motors are exposed to a wide variety of environments and conditions which age the motor and make it subject to incipient faults. These incipient faults, if left undetected, contribute to the degradation and eventual failure of the motors. With proper monitoring and fault detection schemes, the incipient faults can be detected; thus, maintenance and down time expenses can be reduced while also improving safety. Unfortunately, many of the conventional methods used to determine these faults are either very expensive to implement, performed off-line, require the need of an expert, or impractical for small machines. Artificial neural networks have been proposed and have demonstrated the capability of solving the motor monitoring and fault detection problem using an inexpensive, reliable, and noninvasive procedure [3]-[6]. However, the major drawback of conventional artificial neural network fault detection is the inherent black box approach that can provide the correct solution, but does not provide heuristic interpretation of the solution. Engineers prefer the accurate fault detection as well as the heuristic knowledge behind the fault detection process. Fuzzy logic is a technology that can easily provide heuristic reasoning while being difficult to provide exact solutions. Part I of this work introduces the methodology behind a novel hybrid neural/fuzzy system which merges the neural network and fuzzy logic technologies to solve fault detection problems. Part I will also discuss a training procedure for this neural/fuzzy fault detection system. This procedure will be used to determine the correct solutions while providing qualitative, heuristic knowledge about the solutions.

J	FARAROOY, S; ALLAN, J				FARAROOY, S; ALLAN, J			CONDITION MONITORING AND FAULT-DIAGNOSIS OF RAILWAY SIGNALING MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT USING ACOUSTIC-EMISSION SENSORS	INSIGHT			English	Article								Safety-critical railway signalling equipment at the track side, such as points machines and train-stops, are required to operate in 'fail-safe' mode, which means that if their operation is suspect, trains are not allowed to go through. These equipments currently make up for a significant ratio of failure statistics I elated to delays due to signalling problems. In order to improve the quality of service to passengers and reduce losses associated with delays, it is therefore required to predict developing faults and degradation in advance and to diagnose them using latest technology. The scope and motivation of the paper relates to condition monitoring and diagnostics of railway signalling equipment, using train-stops as a case study in the first. instance, employing acoustic emission and other types of sensors. The electro;pneumatic operation of train-stops is firstly described, the test rig and the data acquisition and analysis system developed at the University of Birmingham are outlined Results from the application of acoustic emission sensors on the test rig are presented. Practical issues related to the use of AE technology, based on the experience of field trials on one of the London Underground Ltd lines, are discussed. A complementary condition monitoring technique employing neural networks which was successfully used, and further work currently being undertaken, are briefly explained.

Furthermore, these faults could result in a decreased production rate and an increase in the cost if sudden process changes are so serious that the production line has to be stopped for investigation. Thus, sudden process changes should be detected and eliminated as soon as possible to prevent defective products from being produced and to reduce the cost of repairs/reworks. A monitoring algorithm is developed to detect, classify, and group process changes by analyzing the dimensional data of car bodies. The results of this monitoring algorithm can help diagnose the root causes of variation according to the locations of measurement points, body structure, assembly sequence, and tooling layout. Measurement data obtained from an optical coordinate measuring machine (OCMM) are used to demonstrate the monitoring technique.

J	HANSEN, RJ; HALL, DL; KURTZ, SK				HANSEN, RJ; HALL, DL; KURTZ, SK			A NEW APPROACH TO THE CHALLENGE OF MACHINERY PROGNOSTICS	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								Current generation mechanical diagnostic equipment is designed to identify individual events or trends in the output of sensors mounted on a mechanical component, subsystem, or system. Such equipment can provide a useful indication that a failure condition may be developing, but it cannot provide reliable predictions of the remaining safe or operational life. Typically, these diagnostic systems simply compare the output of individual sensors against a priori thresholds to establish a measure of the system's health. Two problems result from this approach: (1) There is no advantage taken of possible synergy among the sensors, i.e., the determination of health is one dimensional; and (2) the diagnosis provides only a statement regarding the current equipment health, but does not provide a prediction of the time remaining to failure. This often leads to an operational environment in which diagnostic equipment outputs are either ignored because of frequent false alarms or frequent (and costly) time-based preventive maintenance is performed to avoid hazardous failures. This paper describes a new approach to the development of a more robust diagnosis and prognostic capability. It is based on the fusion of sensor-based and model-based information. Sensor-based information is the essence of current diagnostic systems. Model-based information combines dynamic models of individual mechanical components with micromechanical models of relevant failure mechanisms, such as fracture and crack propagation. these micromechanical models must account for initial flaw size distribution and other microstructural parameters describing initial component condition. A specific application of this approach is addressed, the diagnosis of mechanical failure in meshing gears. Four specific issues are considered: (a) how to couple a validated numerical simulation of gear transmission error (due to tooth spacing irregularity, contour irregularity, or material inhomogeneity) with physically and empirically based descriptions of fatigue crack growth to predict a failure precursor signature at the component level; (b) how to predict the manifestation of this signature at the subsystem or system level where sensors are located: (c) how to fuse this model-based information with the corresponding sensor-based information to predict remaining safe or operational life of a gear; and (d) issues associated with extending this methodology to bearings and other rotating machinery components.

J	GELSEY, A				GELSEY, A			AUTOMATED REASONING ABOUT MACHINES	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							SIMULATION; MECHANISMS; DESIGN	Numerical simulation is often used in predicting machine behavior, a basic capability for many tasks such as design and fault diagnosis. However, using simulators requires considerable human effort both to create behavioral models and to analyze and understand simulation results. I describe algorithms which automate the kinematic and dynamical analysis needed to create behavioral models and which automate the intelligent control of computational simulations needed to understand a machine's behavior over both short and long time scales. The input is a description of a machine's geometry and material properties, and the output is a behavioral model for the machine and a concise qualitative/quantitative prediction of the machine's long-term behavior. My algorithms have been implemented in a working program which can predict a machine's behavior over both short and long time periods. At present this work is limited to mechanical devices, particularly clockwork mechanisms.

Test generation for sequential circuits has been a difficult task. This is due to the large search space to be considered in test pattern generation. Different approaches have been taken in the past to solve the problem of fault detection and test generation in sequential circuits. A popular approach, called the scan design, is often used where the problem of test generation in sequential circuits is transformed into that in combinational circuits. Unfortunately, this approach is restricted to synchronous sequential circuits free of critical races. Moreover, when a circuit is very large and complex, the test generation can be quite involved, making the ad hoc approaches ineffective. Therefore, alternative methods should be considered. In this paper the detection of permanent faults in sequential circuits by random testing is analyzed utilizing the circuit partitioning approach together with a continuous parameter Markov model. Given a large sequential circuit, it is partitioned into several smaller partitions using either series of parallel decomposition. For each partition with certain stuck faults specified, the original state table and its error version are derived from an analysis of the partition under fault-free and faulty conditions, respectively. A random testing strategy that uses a three-state Markov model is used for detecting permanent stuck faults. Experimentation on various sequential circuits has shown that a significant saving in testing or test generation time can be achieved if we partition the circuit and then test each of its components as opposed to testing the circuit in its original form.

J	CHEN, YB				CHEN, YB			A FUZZY DECISION SYSTEM FOR FAULT CLASSIFICATION UNDER HIGH-LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Note								The problem of high levels of uncertainty existing in machine diagnosis is addressed by an approach based on fuzzy logic. In this approach, multiple sensors/channels are used, and the uncertainty is treated by membership functions in different stages of the signal processing. The concepts of fuzziness, fuzzy set, and fuzzy inference are described particularly for the development of a practical procedure for machine diagnosis. The membership functions are established through a learning process based on test data, rather than being selected a priori. The information-gain weighting functions are also introduced in order to improve the robustness and reliability of this method. As a result, a framework of a Fuzzy Decision System (FDS) is proposed and applied to a machining process. Experiment verification with an optimistic success rate of 97.5 percent was achieved.

Microscopic examination of the morphology of such wear debris is an accepted method for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Wear particle analysis has not, however, been widely accepted in industry because it is dependent on expert interpretation of particle morphology and relies on subjective assessment criteria. Consequently, the methods are time consuming and expensive and are not always consistent. The use of automated computer image analysis systems to assess the morphology of debris promises to overcome these limitations by making the methods more time and cost efficient, and also more consistent and effective. The first step required for automation of the analysis procedure is to develop objective criteria for assessing the wear particle morphology. Numerical parameters to describe the morphology have been developed and are outlined in this paper. A system using such techniques promises to obviate the need for subjective, human interpretation of particle morphology in machine condition monitoring, thus overcoming many of the difficulties with current methods and facilitating wider use of wear particle analysis in machine condition monitoring.

J	BLANKENSHIP, GW; SINGH, R				BLANKENSHIP, GW; SINGH, R			ANALYTICAL SOLUTION FOR MODULATION SIDE-BAND ASSOCIATED WITH A CLASS OF MECHANICAL OSCILLATORS	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Sideband structures are a commonly observed phenomenon in measured vibro-acoustic signatures of many types of mechanical systems, and especially in rotating machinery. Such spectral information is often used for fault diagnostic application well as noise and vibration control studies. A new theory is developed that examines in a critical manner the commonly held belief that simple amplitude and frequency or phase modulation processes are responsible for generating such sidebands, and instead provides a more logical explanation. A class of viscosity damped mechanical oscillators is examined having spatially periodic stiffness and displacement excitation functions that are exponentially modulated by the instantaneous vibratory displacement of the inertial element. To this end, a new family of dual domain periodic differential equations is introduced which is shown to be more pertinent to the study of force modulation inherent to many mechanical systems, such as a gear pair. Analytical expressions are then derived to predict sideband amplitudes in terms of key system parameters. The harmonic balance method and direct time domain integration techniques are employed to study various subsets of the problem.

The learning algorithm addressed the knowledge acquisition problem by developing and maintaining the knowledge base through inductive learning. The performance ofthe learning system is discussed in terms ofthe knowledge extracted from example cases and its classification accuracy on the test cases. Results indicate that the introduced system is a promising alternative to neural networks for fault diagnosis and a complement to expert systems.

J	KIM, YJ				KIM, YJ			A FRAMEWORK FOR AN ONLINE DIAGNOSTIC EXPERT-SYSTEM FOR INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								This article outlines a framework for performing two different but interrelated functions in diagnosis, that is, sensor validation and reasoning under uncertainty for a manufacturing process. Sensor validation plays a vital role in the ability of the overall system to correctly determine the state of a system monitored by imperfect sensors. Two subsystems: algorithmic (ASV) and heuristic (HSV) sensor validation, separate activity according to the degree of system knowledge required and represent sensor validation expert system (SenVES) when combined. Uncertain information in sensory values is represented through probability assignments on three discrete states, ''high,'' ''normal,'' and ''low,'' and additional sensor confidence measures in ASV. HSV exploits deeper knowledge about parameter interaction within the system to cull sensor faults from the data stream. Finally, the modified probability distributions and ''validated'' data are used as input to the reasoning scheme, which is the run-time version of the influence diagram. The influence diagram represents the backbone of reasoning under uncertainty in influence diagram knowledge base (InDiaKB). These influence diagrams represent the relationship between symptoms (sensor behaviors) and causes (process failures) in a causal direction. The output of the influence diagram is a diagnostic mapping from the symptoms or sensor readings to a determination of likely failure modes. Once likely failure modes are identified a detailed diagnostic knowledge base suggests corrective actions to improve performance. This framework for a diagnostic expert system with sensor validation and reasoning under uncertainty applies in a milling machine process diagnosis.

This paper presents an Integrated Machine Troubleshooting Expert System (IMTES) that enhances the efficiency of the diagnostic process, improves the completeness and consistency of the knowledge base, and assists users in developing and maintaining their diagnostic systems. IMTES consists of five modules: a diagnostic tree module establishes the hierarchical structure regarding the function or connectivity of the diagnostic system, a fuzzy multiattribute decision-making module determines the most efficient diagnostic process and creates a ''meta knowledge base'' to control the diagnosis process, a knowledge base module captures the human expertise and deep knowledge to diagnose the possible machine fault, an inference engine module controls the diagnosis process and deals with the uncertainty from the user input and knowledge base itself, and a learning module uses the failure-driven learning method to train the knowledge base from the past actual cases. The system has been successfully implemented on MS-Windows environment, and it is written in MS Visual BASIC. To validate the system performance, IMTES is compared to EXACT, an expert system for automobile air-compressor troubleshooting, using 50 sample cases. The result shows that IMTES can reduce the number of queries by 20.7%.	UNIV HOUSTON,DEPT IND ENGN,HOUSTON,TX 77204								BADIRU AB, 1992, EXPERT SYSTEMS APPLI; Bonissone P.

As in tokamaks, the former is provided by the toroidal field (TF) winding and the latter by the ohmic heating (OH) winding and the equilibrium field (EF) winding. The two induction field components have similar amplitudes, so that the toroidal component required in a RFP is about one order of magnitude lower than that in a tokamak with equal plasma current and aspect ratio. Owing to the local stability properties, the TF coils have to be located as close as possible to the plasma but, at the same time, the magnetic field ripple from TF coils (as well as any kinds of stray fields) must be kept to a minimum. Another peculiarity of the TF winding is that it is required to operate with a time-varying current and at high voltage levels. From these points of view, the design of the TF winding presents much less tehnological problems than a tokamak of similar size. The RFP requires a high toroidal loop voltage during fast current rise and a relatively high toroidal loop voltage during the flat top. The main consequences for the RFX PF magnet systems are as follows: large flux and energy to be inductively stored; very high voltage across the OH and EF winding terminals, giving rise to substantial insulation problems; the very fast rate required for current rise may produce remarkable skin effects within the OH conductors, so that large cross-section conductors have to be avoided; the electrodynamic forces acting on the OH winding are large and comparable with those in tokamaks; in case of any fault, currents in the coils can rise beyond safety limits at a very high rate, leading to extremely critical conditions for the machine integrity. From a mechanical point of view, both the OH and the EF windings are subject to working conditions similar to those experienced in tokamaks. Thus, RFX windings were manufactured with a similar technology. To detect the TF and PF winding faults a very fast, hard-wired system has been developed, which is able to elaborate signals from specific probes and to decide on necessary protective actions. The present contribution deals with the whole magnet system of RFX, including all TF and PF magnets, mechanical structure, magnetic and electric measurement instrumentation, as well as the fast fault detection system. After a review of the basic concepts representing the theoretical background behind the main choices, all aspects and features concerning the magnet design are presented in detail and deeply discussed. The manufacturing technology is then presented together with the main problems met during manufacture, development and acceptance tests and the methods adopted in order to solve them are explained. On-site assembly procedures, testing and the first integrated RFX operation are finally described.

An attempt was made to estimate average concentrations for some non-reactive air pollutants. These estimates were made with a two-way interactive nesting, prognostic model, RAMS, a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, LPDM, and a synoptic classification scheme developed for this purpose. Simulations were made with this complicated modelling system because of the significant variation of the physiographic characteristics in the region. Such variation was found to be responsible for the development of thermal circulations of various scales and consequently the complicated dispersion characteristics. The conclusions derived from this approach should be considered as very important for the region in general. More specifically, it was found to be very helpful for planning the expansion of the existing power production units and the development of a monitoring network.

This paper considers the role of software in system operation, control and automation, and attempts to define intelligence. AI is characterized by its ability to deal with incomplete and imprecise information and to accumulate knowledge. Expert systems, building on standard computing techniques, depend heavily on the domain experts and knowledge engineers that have programmed them to represent the real world. Neural networks are intended to emulate the pattern-recognition and parallel processing capabilities of she human brain and are taught rather than programmed. The future may lie in a combination of the recognition ability of the neural network and the rationalization capability of the expert system. In the second part of the paper, examples are given of applications of AI in stand-alone systems for knowledge engineering and medical diagnosis and in embedded systems for failure detection, image analysis, user interfacing, natural language processing, robotics and machine learning, as related to clinical laboratories. It is concluded that AI constitutes a collective form of intellectual property, and that there is a need for better documentation, evaluation and regulation of the systems already being used in clinical laboratories.

J	SHIN, YS; LIU, CS				SHIN, YS; LIU, CS			VIBRATION ALERT LEVELS IN SHIPBOARD MACHINERY CONDITION MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTICS	NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL			English	Article								The vibration alert level plays a vital role in machinery condition monitoring and diagnostics for providing an early warning of fault development in the machinery. Approaches for setting an appropriate vibration alert level are presented for either the time or frequency domains, using the vibration signals generated by shipboard fire pumps. For the time domain, Cross Peak Analysis (CPA) is proposed to extract the dominant peak amplitude between the zero crossings. Statistical analysis of the measured data shows that the peak envelope distribution follows a lognormal distribution when using a linear velocity scale. However, it follows a Gaussian distribution when using a velocity dB(VdB) scale. The mean plus two standard deviations in VdB is calculated and suggested as a broadband vibration alert level with a 97.7% acceptance level. In the frequency domain approach, 1/1 full Octave Band Analysis (OBA) is proposed, which divides the frequency spectrum into constant percentage bands. The change in VdB level in a particular frequency band using OBA is more sensitive damage indicator than the change in broadband level.

Laboratory studies with an anaerobic consortium from this area demonstrated the capabilities for transforming PCBs. The field and laboratory observations indicate that disappearances of PCBs in the sediment might be caused by in situ microbial dechlorination. These processes appear to have lowered the PCB toxicity of four reactive congeners by 75% during the last two decades. In addition, dechlorination reactions are the essential first steps in the only natural pathway that eventually may lead to a complete elimination of PCBs from the aquatic environment. This can only be achieved if the dechlorination products are subsequently mineralized under aerobic conditions. Several implications for environmental policies with regard to contaminated sediments are discussed. Long-term prognoses on sediment quality generated with mathematical models that include these reactions may lead to a distinct, probably less costly, sediment policy.

J	SASSEN, JMA; OLLONGREN, A				SASSEN, JMA; OLLONGREN, A			DEVELOPING REAL-TIME KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS WITH PERFECT	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						REAL-TIME KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT; MULTILEVEL FLOW MODEL; MONITORING; FAULT DIAGNOSIS; HUMAN-MACHINE INTERFACE	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	PERFECT (Programming EnviRonment For Expert systems Constrained in reasoning Time) is aimed at providing the necessary engineering support in real-time knowledge-based system development. PERFECT bridges the gap between the traditional analysis and design methodologies, and the implementation tools for these systems. It does so by providing the means to construct a knowledge model and to choose a suitable inference strategy. Subsequently the properties of the knowledge model and inference strategy may be analysed. For instance, it may be checked whether the knowledge model contains sufficient knowledge to diagnose a fault in an industrial process. Moreover, it may be checked whether the inference engine is able to provide an answer to a certain problem in time. If not, the analyser of PERFECT proposes art alternative structure of the knowledge model. When the constructed knowledge model and the chosen inference strategy show the required time efficiency, the compiler of PERFECT may translate them to art actual real-time knowledge based system in COGSYS. In addition, guidelines are provided with respect to the design of the human-machine interface. The resulting system is an instrument-a source of information that can be used by the human operator during problem-solving, rather than a prosthesis-a device that solves the entire problem by itself and presents the outcome to the human operator.

The proposed on-line relay and dynamic pattern classifier utilizes specific frequency spectra of the hyperplane discriminant vector of machine rotor angle, speed, accelerating power, instantaneous power, voltage, and current using either a perception single layer detection scheme or a two layer feed forward ANN for on-line classification and detection of fault condition causing first swing transient stability or loss of excitation. Other relay binary outputs include fault type and allowable clearing time identification. The detection accuracy is improved by utilizing the cross spectra of discriminant vector input variables correlations. The proposed pattern classification technique can be extended to interconnected multi-machine systems by using relative rotor angles, frequency deviations, tie-line powers, and their cross spectra variables.

These enveloping methods condition transducer signals to isolate and enhance their response to small impulse forces. In general, initial bearing defects, felt seam anomalies, roll flat spots, and lubrication breakdowns generate small signals that are buried in the noise of higher vibration levels, making it difficult to detect these problems, much less assure correct diagnosis. Both acceleration enveloping and high-frequency acoustic emission technology can enhance the diagnostic tools available to paper mill maintenance engineers. This paper briefly explains these measurement methods. Case studies are discussed analyzing felt problems affecting paper quality, assessing paper machine bearing failure modes, and correcting lubrication problems in the early stages in order to extend bearing service life.

There are many advantages in hot end inspection, such as tire detection of glass distribution faults which cannot be reliability detected at the cold end. Furthermore, it is possible to analyse production trends and give a much faster feedback of developing or intransient faults. A system has been developed by Electronic Automation that is able to detect poor glass distribution and gross sidewall faults such as birdswings, wedged bases and choked bores on flint or coloured ware. If will warn of impending faults occurring by analysing production trends and monitoring on a per cavity basis. Emphasis is also given to user friendliness of operation, adaptation to the harsh environment and system transportability.

The goal of the research is to show that using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, measurements, and some general basic knowledge about the ecosystem suffice to automatically generate better models and in less time than is the case by traditional construction of models. Namely, advanced techniques of AI are able to identify and model a system that we do not understand yet. The methodology of the approach is presented and illustrated by an example of a successfully constructed model in the field of medicine. Subsequently some encouraging results were obtained in the field of ecology and related sciences.

J	GUILLEMIN, CL				GUILLEMIN, CL			THE DEFERRED STANDARD	PROCESS CONTROL AND QUALITY			English	Review						PROCESS CHROMATOGRAPHY; DEFERRED STANDARD; RELIABILITY; CREDIBILITY; MAINTENANCE; VALIDATION	GAS; CHROMATOGRAPHY	Despite their increasing sophistication, process gas and liquid chromatographs remain blind machines which do not entirely fulfil the main criteria that any process monitor should satisfy: reliability, credibility, continuous response and low maintenance. They remain unable of carrying out a self-diagnosis of their status. Although excellent, their reliability cannot be known at any given instant without a recent calibration. Their credibility as well as the validation of the quantitative data depends on the availability of proper standard mixtures and frequent recalibrations. This operation is costly, and often takes away the process chromatograph from the control loop during a period of time. Finally, their maintenance has to be preventive, and thus costly. The deferred standard concept (DS), recently called in the US ''internal reference injection'', dawned in 1964, and consists of injecting during each analytical sequence a sample of a pure compound, preferably a main component present in the mixture to be analysed. The time of this independent injection is selected to afford elution of the standard within a window of the mixture chromatogram. Monitoring the DS peak area permits an assessment of the process chromatograph status during each sequence. The design requirements and the advantages of the procedure are discussed and exemplified. The four functions of the deferred standard, alarm, calibration, validation and predictive maintenance functions, afford to the process control chromatograph to move from the stage of sophisticated analyser to the stage of true process monitor.

This article discusses the components of such a system. The specific example presented in this article is a system utilizing in situ ellipsometry developed for a polysilicon gate etch. The ellipsometer was used for robust endpointing, process modeling, fault detection, and run-to-run supervisory control. The methodology for each sensor application is presented. The coordination of the various applications is also discussed and implementation issues are covered. The goal of the controller for polysilicon gate etch is to achieve a target mean etch rate, while maintaining a spatially uniform etch. This process suffers from machine aging, which degrades the etch rate and final film uniformity. Experimental results demonstrating that the controller compensates for process drift are shown. Implementation of this system resulted in a 36% decrease in standard deviation from the target for the mean etch rate. All of the wafers processed with feedback control met the specifications on nonuniformity, while some of the wafers processed without control did not.

J	MARSEGUERRA, M; ZIO, E				MARSEGUERRA, M; ZIO, E			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS VIA NEURAL NETWORKS - THE BOLTZMANN MACHINE	NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							SYSTEM	The Boltzmann machine is a general-purpose artificial neural network that can be used as an associative memory as well as a mapping tool. The usual information entropy is introduced, and a network energy function is suitably defined. The network's training procedure is based on the simulated annealing during which a combination of energy minimization and entropy maximization is achieved. An application in the nuclear reactor field is presented in which the Boltzmann input-output machine is used to detect and diagnose a pipe break in a simulated auxiliary feedwater system feeding two coupled steam generators. The break may occur on either the hot or the cold leg of any of the two steam generators. The binary input data to the network encode only the trends of the thermohydraulic signals so that the network is actually a polarity device. The results indicate that the trained neural network is actually capable of performing its task. The method appears to be robust enough so that it may also be applied with success in the presence of substantial amounts of noise that cause the network to be fed with wrong signals.

J	MARTIN, KF				MARTIN, KF			A REVIEW BY DISCUSSION OF CONDITION MONITORING AND FAULT-DIAGNOSIS IN MACHINE-TOOLS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article								The main theme of the paper is a description of the activity around the world in the way of research, development and application of techniques for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of machine tools. The paper initially discusses the necessity for planned maintenance, the extension of this into condition based maintenance and the necessity for condition monitoring. It then discusses some definitions relating to this field of activity and in particular differentiates between hard and soft faults and the reason the latter can be used for prediction, whereas the former is easier to diagnose. The paper endeavours intentionally to restrict itself to the condition monitoring and fault diagnostics of the machine tool itself. Thus there is no real discussion of research into tool or process monitoring-although many areas of this type of work cut across that of the machine itself. For this reason there are notes on area of tool condition monitoring where these have techniques and expertise which lend themselves to the machine itself. There is a discussion on on-line and off-line monitoring followed by a brief survey of the automatic monitoring presently available on machine tools. Much of this is related to hard fault diagnostics but there are signs that soft faults are now being monitored. The paper then describes methods for the choice of parameters for condition monitoring and their data acquisition. Two large sections then follow on fault monitoring and diagnosis of both hard and soft faults where much reference is made to recently completed research under contracts ESPRIT 504 and SERC GR/E/12818. These sections also include references to ongoing research and EC contracts, including application of neural networks, expert systems and fuzzy logic. The paper concludes that the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is being seen as of increasing importance. All available techniques have their drawbacks, all are not absolute and there is a plea for more information as to how real faults develop and exhibit themselves in measured parameters.

The procedure involves the use of an inductive inference theory-based classification program called ''Snob''. The program objectively divides frequency spectra, generated from force measurements, into classes representing different cutting tool conditions. The estimated description length of each spectrum, which is used for classification, can also be used to detect the early stages of cutting tool deterioration. The procedure was tested using frequency spectra representing various stages of wear development in cutting tools during both accelerated wear rate and normal wear rate cutting tests. It is shown that the inductive inference theory-based spectra classification procedure allows early detection of cutting tool deterioration.

J	MORRISON, DL; UPTON, DM				MORRISON, DL; UPTON, DM			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Review							HUMAN RELIABILITY; HUMAN-PERFORMANCE; COGNITIVE-STYLE; KNOWLEDGE; TASKS; TECHNOLOGY; SKILL	This paper examines one aspect of human interaction with computer-integrated systems, that of fault diagnosis or troubleshooting. The complexity (and attendant unreliability) of the new manufacturing systems has meant that fault diagnosis has become an increasing proportion and an integral part of operators' jobs. Establishing and maintaining high levels of diagnostic accuracy and efficiency is important for a variety of reasons. One is that equipment downtime is expensive, another is that errors of diagnosis might, under some circumstances, be a threat to both safety and quality. As yet there has been little research into human fault diagnosis in CIM. This paper draws on research from other industries, such as power generation and chemical production and explores the application of that work to faultfinding in computer-integrated discrete production systems. The focus is on the factors that influence individual fault-finding behaviors and efficiencies. Where possible, the aim is to identify critical human-machine interaction design principles and to highlight research questions yet to be addressed in contemporary manufacturing environments, with respect to the diagnosis of system failures.

The CVM is suitable for implementation in triple modular redundant systems for industrial process control applications operating in hazardous areas. Assembling the VLSI components with the electronic instruments, computers and actuators into fault-tolerant system, we achieve a fault-detection recovery and failure isolation far exceeding non-VLSI implementations. The fundamental idea is to design and partition the logical elements so that effective fault detection, identification of the faulty source, and synchronization can be done by a novel method, which places the detection responsibility inside the VLSI chip. The CVM allows an asynchronous data transfer between the redundant system's modules and is implemented as a Moore sequencer.

Given the description of a system to be diagnosed and the observations on the system when it works, the need for diagnosis arises when the observations are different from those expected. The objective of diagnosis is to identify the malfunctioning components in a systematic and efficient way. The four approaches discussed are based on fault-tree, rule, model, and qualitative model. Early diagnosis systems used fault-tree and rule-based approaches. These are efficient in situations where an expert is able to provide the knowledge in the form of associations between symptoms and faults. Model-based and qualitative model-based approaches overcome many of the deficiencies of the earlier approaches. Model-based approaches can take care of situations (faults) not envisaged a priori. Also, one can cater to minor variations in design using the same set of components and their interconnections. This paper discusses in each case, how the knowledge is represented and what diagnosis technique is to be adopted, and their relative advantages and disadvantages. Implementation of each method is also discussed.

Also such an approach is dependent on the transmission path. On the other hand, cepstrum analysis accurately identifies harmonics and sideband families and is a better technique available for fault diagnosis in gears, bearings, and turbine blades of ships and submarines. Cepstrum represents the global power content of a whole family of harmonics and sidebands when more than one family of sidebands are present at the same time. Also it is insensitive to the transmission path effects since source and transmission path effects are additive and can be separated in cepstrum. The concept, underlying theory and the measurement and analysis involved for using the technique are briefly outlined. Two cases were taken to demonstrate advantage of cepstrum technique over the spectrum analysis. An LP compressor was chosen to study the transmission path effects and a marine gearbox having two sets of sideband families was studied to diagnose the problematic sideband and its severity.

The application of neural network is helpful to identify the orbits of shaft centerline, and the discrete cosine transform is helpful to reduce the input dimension of neural network. The paper discusses the method of combining the discrete cosine transform technique with the neural network, to compress the input data whiie the resolving power of input network is improved, so as to keep the input dimension of neural network invariant. The feasible of improved back-propagation algorithm which makes the convergence faster is proved.

In recent years, there are many studies about this issue by means of model based approach, probabilistic method, knowledge based approach and Neural Networks based approach et al. With the progress of the study of biology, evolutionary thought has extended into engineering problems solving. More interests have been shown in this field. The investigation will describe two unsupervised clustering paradigms, they are Kohonen's Self-Organizing Scheme and Genetic Algorithm (GA) based heuristic searching for machine fault classification. In case study, a multiple faults classification problem has been attacked. Solutions generated from the GA based system are compared with that from Self-Organization Neural Networks, and the result is given. And the case study has shown that the proposed approaches are flexible enough to be used in practical fault diagnosis.

The Hough Transform, used in image processing to extract geometrical primitives from image data, has been adapted to extract linear trend features from monitored data. The predictive maintenance system uses the extracted trend features to diagnose incipient fault conditions. It then predicts the time for the system to reach a critical fault condition. The transform provides an early warning of a developing fault allowing operating staff to anticipate the types of maintenance required before secondary damage and complete breakdown occurs. It can also deal robustly with noisy data, including impulsive noise. It is proposed that logistic curves may be useful for the empirical description of wear failure. A multi-point generalisation of the Hough Transform (Flint et al, 1992) was developed for extracting logistic features from developing fault signatures. The new generalisation of the Hough Transform differs from earlier generalisations by incorporating early data fusion to reduce the size of previously large cumbersome arrays. A brief description is given of the Hough Transform's application to two predictive maintenance case studies. The first case study is the uni-feature problem of providing predictive maintenance decisions for a diesel-engine lubricating oil system. The subject of the second case study is a pneumatic sliding-door system. Here a multivariate generalisation of the Hough Transform is required. The proposed generalisation involves the accumulation of vector rather than scalar votes in an array.			FLINT, AD (corresponding author), UNIV HUDDERSFIELD,HUDDERSFIELD HD1 3DH,ENGLAND.

Under this circumstance, the condition-based predictive maintenance (CbPM) is more appropriate where the system condition can be monitored from the surface of running machinery, and maintenance is performed only when needed as the failure prognosis dictates. This paper presents a cost optimal prognostic criterion for CbPM using a multiple logistic function of risk variables to be monitored, which fluctuate randomly according to a certain probability distribution. A numerical example demonstrates the procedure and utility of the method.			PARK, KS (corresponding author), KOREA ADV INST SCI & TECHNOL,DEPT IND ENGN,TAEJON 305701,SOUTH KOREA.

Sandy and light loamy soils cover more than 50 per cent of the arable land in Poland. About 58 per cent of soils are acid (pH<5.5) in the surface layer and 25 per cent in the layer from 100 to 150 cm. About 51.3 per cent of soils are very vulnerable to pollution. According to a BIGLEB-SOWEP prognosis, in the year 2000 about 13 per cent of soils will be seriously at risk from chemical degradation. Acidification will proceed due to increases in the emission of SO2 and NO(x), and the end of liming.

Generally, these procedures require the assumption of a specific motor speed. The electrical operating parameters are then calculated using a model developed for this purpose. These models normally allow an arbitrary number of winding deterioration processes to be simulated on the stator and/or rotor. Forms of deterioration might include high- or low-impedance leakage between phases, between coils in a single phase, or between a phase and ground. In this paper, experimental data for a three-phase, wound rotor induction motor with stator deterioration is compared with the predictions of a specific model of that motor. Procedures are then developed for the prediction of deterioration trends in classes of motors. One application of such an analysis would be in the generation of data bases required to design and develop performance monitoring, deterioration detection, or deterioration classification systems for critical motor installations without the need to develop a predictive model for each motor type.

In this paper two different approaches to machine learning in medical applications are compared: the system for inductive learning of decision trees Assistant, and the naive Bayesian classifier. Both methodologies were tested in four medical diagnostic problems: localization of primary tumor, prognostics of recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosis of thyroid diseases, and rheumatology. The accuracy of automatically acquired diagnostic knowledge from stored data records is compared, and the interpretation of the knowledge and the explanation ability of the classification process of each system is discussed. Surprisingly, the naive Bayesian classifier is superior to Assistant in classification accuracy and explanation ability, while the interpretation of the acquired knowledge seems to be equally valuable. In addition, two extensions to naive Bayesian classifier are briefly described: dealing with continuous attributes, and discovering the dependencies among attributes.

J	ARSLAN, TS; BOTTACI, L; TAYLOR, GE				ARSLAN, TS; BOTTACI, L; TAYLOR, GE			A FAULT DICTIONARY BASED EXPERT-SYSTEM FOR FAILURE DIAGNOSIS IN A MULTIPLE-PCB ENVIRONMENT	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						PCB TEST; DIAGNOSIS; FAULT DICTIONARY		This paper describes a failure-diagnosis expert system for printed circuit boards which exploits functional test data. The data is output from automatic test equipment which is used to test every board subsequent to manufacture. The use of a conventional machine-learning technique produced only limited success due to the very large search space of failure reports. This also ruled out the use of a conventional knowledge-based approach. In addition, there was a requirement to track changes in printed circuit board design and manufacture which also ruled out a conventional knowledge-based approach. The investigations led to the development of a system which tracks changes by learning in a more restricted search space derived from the original space of reports. The system performs a diagnosis by matching a failure report with information about previously seen reports. The matching rules used are heuristic. The system uses basic circuit connectivity information in conjunction with the matching procedure to improve diagnostic performance, especially in cases where matching fails to identify a unique component.

The key idea is to replace the conventional residual evaluator of the fault diagnosis system based on crisp logic, by both a decision maker with fuzzy logic for residual pre-evaluation and the human operator to make the final decisions using his natural intelligence, experience and common sense. The purpose of the employment of fuzzy logic for residual pre-evaluation is to release only weighted alarms instead of yes-no decisions, so that (by definition) no false alarms can be produced; besides this, the man-machine interaction becomes much easier. In contrast to the conventional expert system approach, the proposed concept leaves the final yes-no decisions to the natural intelligence, capability and responsibility of the human operator which are still superior to the artificial intelligence and decision making capabilities of an expert system.

OPTIMUM VIBRATION SIGNAL LENGTHS	BRITISH JOURNAL OF NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING			English	Article								Parametric model-based spectral estimation techniques are known to allow detailed frequency spectra to be generated using short length data sets. However, the question of how short is too short,for a given application, still remains. There is no way of knowing without using,a trial and error approach. This paper provides details of the tests carried out to determine the optimum length of vibration signal (time) to be used when generating frequency spectra for use in fault detection, condition trending and fault diagnosis in rolling element bearings. Tests were carried out on vibration signals collected from low speed (60 RPM) and moderate speed (almost-equal-to 1500 RPM) rolling element bearings. The goal was to reduce the vibration signal length used as much as possible and still be able to produce detailed and repeatable frequency spectra. The results show that the length of vibration signal needed to produce repeatable frequency spectra depends largely on the speed of the equipment being monitored. A rule of thumb is therefore proposed which refers to the number of shaft rotations rather than time.			MECHEFSKE, CK (corresponding author), MONASH UNIV,MELBOURNE,VIC 3004,AUSTRALIA.

J	ARFI, T; BAHR, B				ARFI, T; BAHR, B			DEVELOPMENT OF DECISION-SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR TOOL WEAR DIAGNOSIS	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper deals with the problems faced by small and medium sized metal cutting industries, with the perspective of tool monitoring. In a small or medium sized metal cutting industry employing major metal cutting processes, one of the primary problem is that of tool monitoring and wear diagnosis. The problem is of immediate concern especially in those industries where the processes or operations employed are flexible and production depends entirely on orders from customers. Due to a flexible manufacturing setup, almost all major metal cutting processes need to be carried out. However, it becomes increasingly difficult for such small or medium sized metal cutting industries to employ skilled manpower for each operation as well as expert technicians to supervise the operation, and carry out fault diagnosis and tool monitoring. Also, the problem associated with tool monitoring is that human operative carrying out the monitoring has to rely either on observation such as ceasing of tool, rise in temperature, generation of fumes, noisy operation, vibrations, considerable change in shape etc, or by monitoring the quality of the finished product. Also, there can be instances where the operator does notice a symptom but does not have the expertise to identify the cause of the trouble. Errors in tool monitoring can lead to considerable damage both to the machine as well as the workpiece. On the other hand, if the tool is replaced before it reaches its useful life expectancy, it leads to unnecessary additional cost. A Decision Support Knowledge Based System (DSKBS) has therefore been developed in this paper with the above considerations. The DSKBS provides the user with a friendly environment to diagnose a particular tool wear and obtain the necessary repair or replacement instructions. The goal is to increase productivity, decrease cost of operation and enhance total quality and reliability of the operation.

J	ABDULNOUR, G				ABDULNOUR, G			ON SOME FACTORS AFFECTING THE JUST-IN-TIME PRODUCTION SYSTEM OUTPUT VARIABILITY - A SIMULATION STUDY USING TAGUCHI TECHNIQUES	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The main objectives of this research were to analyze the effect of different maintenance policies, machines unreliability, and some other factors on the Just-In-Time (JIT) production system output variability or stability. Maintenance policies of type I and II which were introduced by Proshan and Hunter, and maintenance policy III, which was introduced by Makabi Hajime et al., were considered in this study and their effect on the JIT production system were analyzed. In this research, mathematical predictive and integrative models were developed to demonstrate the effects of different maintenance policies (A), machine unreliability (B), ratio of preventive maintenance time to processing time (D), production line size (C), processing time variability (E) and ratio of minimal repair time to preventive maintenance time (F) on the production line output variability (PLV) in a JIT production system environment. Functional relationship between the dependent variable PLV and die independent variables A, B, C, D, E and F were developed. Using the Taguchi approach in this experimental design all main factors used in this experiment were tested at three levels each using on L27 orthogonal plan, then all main factors and their first order interactions were tested using an L32 orthogonal plan of experiment. Discrete-event simulation, using the GPSS/H simulation language, was employed in order to collect the needed data. The analysis of the data showed that under different situations, different maintenance policies do not have the same effect on the production line performance. With regard to the PLV, maintenance policy III led to a higher variation than policy II, except at the level where the number of machines is less than or equal to 5. The results of this study also demonstrate that the production line performance under policy II is more sensitive to the change on the ratio of minimal repair time to preventive maintenance time when under policy III the same production line performance is more sensitive to production line size. Therefore, the results of this study should help the user in choosing a maintenance policy as a function of the production process parameters in order to decrease production line output variability and improve productivity and stability.

It is shown that a modelling of the asynchronous machine taking into account each bar and each portion of ring of the cage allows to consider the influence of a rupture upon the expression to the instantaneous electromagnetic torque. It has been put up an instrumentation permitting the measurement of this tor que. The spectral analysis of the parameter leads to the diagnostic of a cage rupture by discriminating this fault from other faults, particularly mechanical ones. It is also observed that ruptures influence greatly the electromagnetic torque. The peak variation of the significant spectral lines is so important that it allows the detection of a first rupture without the need of a very sophisticated instrumentation.

This paper examines the use of a relatively new technology, Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), to assess the machine condition through vibration signals. The vibration signal is first compressed with an Autoregressive (AR) technique in order to reduce the amount of information which the ART neural network is to deal with. The theoretical foundation of the fault classification system is discussed, followed by a brief case study.

The project effectively implemented a multi-model approach to diagnosis in manufacturing environments, exploiting structural, functional, behavioural and heuristic models. Among other things, particular emphasis has been placed on the plant behavioural model, which can be derived from the software code running on the PLCs which control an automated manufacturing facility. The existing diagnostic system is now operational at an SNIA plant in Italy, fully integrated with the factory environment and able to support different levels of users through distributed man-machine interfaces. The paper provides an insight into the theoretical background of the project and describes the adopted methodology, with special attention given to the knowledge acquisition problems arising in the development of the various knowledge models included in the diagnostic system. Furthermore, the architecture and functionalities of the existing system are described, along with the achieved benefits and further exploitation potential. Both IT and user perspectives are considered in the paper.

J	ISERMANN, R				ISERMANN, R			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS OF MACHINES VIA PARAMETER-ESTIMATION AND KNOWLEDGE PROCESSING - TUTORIAL PAPER	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						FAULT DETECTION; SUPERVISION; MONITORING; SAFETY; PARAMETER ESTIMATION; KNOWLEDGE BASE; DIAGNOSTICS; FAULT TREES; INFERENCE MECHANISM, FORWARD AND BACKWARD CHAINING, FEED DRIVE; MACHINES	PROCESS MODEL KNOWLEDGE	For further improvement of the reliability and safety of machines the automatic early detection and localization of faults is of high interest. The conventional approach is to monitor some important variables like temperature, pressure, vibration and to generate alarms if certain limits are exceeded. However, developing internal faults are in this way only detected at a rather late stage. By applying static and dynamic process models and common process input and output measurements the inherent relationships and redundancies can be used to detect faults earlier and to localize them better. Changes in process and signal parameters are very well suited for fault detection. The paper describes a general methodology for machines and other processes by using few measurements, dynamic process and signal models and parameter estimation to generate analytical symptoms. Heuristic symptoms observed by the operator or based on, e.g. the process history are another source for fault diagnosis. Both kinds of symptoms are weighted by confidence measures and are fed into a knowledge based fault diagnosis procedure. The diagnosis is performed by forward and backward chaining according to causal fault-symptom trees. The considered machines consist of a motor, a drive chain and a working process or load. They may be electrical motor or combustion engine driven pumps, fans or machine tools with gear or belt drive chains. As one example, experimental results are shown for a DC motor powered feed drive of a machine tool. A summary of practical results with other machines is also given.

The application of powerful automation techniques has enabled complex processes to be safely and efficiently operated, bringing numerous economic benefits for mankind. However, the development of the so called modern automation systems represents one of the most challenging tasks that faces the developing and the under developed countries from the point of selection for the appropriate type of technology. Despite increased automation, the human in the loop is more important than ever before. Deficiencies in the process can cause automatic control systems to fail to meet the requirements of the operation thus demanding intervention by operators and control engineers to keep them working. Shortcomings always occur because performance requirements and the plant characteristics are unconfirmed at the design stage. The performance requirements, plant characteristics and controller parameters change when a control system is designed and when it is commissioned. However activities such as controller tuning, fault detection, diagnosis, start-up, shut-down etc. which can occupy significant part of an operator or engineer's time, should be automated allowing them to utilize their skills on more productive activities. Progress in Information Technology and Microprocessor power has enriched and enhanced the capabilities of the Integrated Control System (ICS). The Instrumentation and Control (I&C) equipment form the nerve system of the plant and so is placed very high up in order to achieve the desirable goals. This paper deals with some practical issues, problems and challenges faced by developing and underdeveloped countries in the wake of rapid advances, theoretical developments and technological innovations in automation. The discussion is centered on the following aspects with particular reference to power and desalination plants in the Gulf region: Functions and hierarchical structures of control systems, Man-machine interface, Integrated control systems, Distributed control systems, Fault tolerance, and Manpower training. In the interest of clarity and completeness, certain essential terms in the highly specialized field of automation are briefly introduced and explained in the text.

It involves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns in engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the development of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with interpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for employing machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to contextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by normalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was developed and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine in a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers, gathered over a 12-second interval. There were eight classes of observations: seven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared two approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and instance-based learning. We have three main results. (1) For the given problem, instance-based learning works better than linear regression. (2) For this problem, contextual normalization works better than other common forms of normalization. (3) The algorithms described here can be the basis for a useful software tool for assisting technicians with the interpretation of sensor data.

These changes involve (a) the switch from a streamfunction to a surface pressure formulation in the barotropic equations, (b) the splitting off of the Coriolis terms from the barotropic equations to produce a symmetric surface pressure equation, which then permits (c) the use of a preconditioned conjugate-gradient method for the solution of this equation. The switch to a surface pressure formulation (a) eliminates global equations associated with island boundary conditions and therefore improves performance as well as allows an unlimited number of islands, (b) reduces sensitivity to rapidly varying bottom topography and therefore obviates the need for smoothing the topography, and (c) makes the surface pressure a prognostic variable, thus potentially making it easier to assimilate surface altimetry data. Care is taken to retain the energetic consistency built into the original model. The nine-point operator for the pressure equation is found necessary to maintain energy consistency, in contrast to the streamfunction formulation where both nine-point and five-point operators are usable. Computational results closely resemble those of the original model, but with significantly improved performance. The barotropic part of the calculations in the surface pressure formulation is nearly three times faster than in the streamfunction formulation, and the full calculation involving both barotropic and baroclinic parts is nearly two times faster. These changes are described and details of the performance of the new formulation on the CM-2 are given.

J	Wang, C; Schwartz, M				Wang, Clark; Schwartz, Mischa			Fault Detection with Multiple Observers	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING			English	Article								There is a pressing need for network management systems capable of handling faults. In this paper, we propose to use a set of independent observers to detect faults in communication systems that are modeled by finite-state machines. An algorithm for constructing these observers and a fast real-time fault detection mechanism used by each observer are given. Since these observers run in parallel and independently, one immediate benefit is that of graceful degradation-one failed observer will not cause collapse of the fault management system. In addition, each observer has a simpler structure than the original system and can be operated at higher speed. This approach has the potential to be incorporated into the fault management system for a high-speed communication system.

Since European settlement in 1788, 71 species of native mammals have been recorded in the Division, seven more have been documented only as sub-fossils, and a further 15 species occur within 100 km of the Division boundary. At least 27 of the original species have become regionally extinct, and a further 11 have declined in distribution. As in other regions of Australia, species losses have been greatest for rodents and marsupials in a critical weight range of 35 5500 g, and least for bats. However, percentage losses among the terrestrial fauna are high relative to other regions, and probably reflect both the early settlement of New South Wales and the marginal distribution in the Division of 49% of the original fauna. Feral cats are implicated in the regional extinction of up to ten species of native mammals prior to 1857. Subsequent extinctions and range reductions are attributed to combinations of causes, including predation from cats Felis catus and red foxes Vulpes vulpes, competition and habitat degradation from rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, stock and other introduced herbivores, clearing of trees, changes in fire regimes and human persecution. We identified 28 species of particular conservation concern in the Division based on low abundance, distribution or survival prognosis. Nine species are of national significance, four of state, and 15 of regional, significance. The major current threats to these species are from grazing by stock, interference from feral mammals and clearing. Further land reservation is an important conservation measure, but must be complemented by more effective management of non-reserved land and by broad-scale management of feral species and other threatening processes if the current species diversity is to be maintained. Long-term fauna surveys should be initiated throughout the Western Division to provide feedback on the effectiveness of management measures, and species reintroductions should be considered in situations where threats have been removed.

It has played an important role in increasing productivity and reducing costs. This paper presents a methodology which is built upon parametric modelling and neural network technology for automatic detection and identification of machine faults. An adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network architecture is used to identify machine faults from the parameters of a parametric model of the vibration signal. The experimental results indicate that the ART 2 neural network is capable of classifying a fault correctly and rapidly by using the parameters of the parametric model of process signals.

The effect of machine faults and failures on factory productivity is an important concern for manufacturing industries. Economic effects relating to machine availability and reliability, as well as corrective (reactive) maintenance costs, have prompted facilities and factories to improve maintenance techniques and operations to monitor machine degradation and detect faults. This paper presents an innovative methodology to change maintenance practice from breakdown reaction to breakdown prevention, thereby reducing maintenance costs and improving productivity. To analyze machine behavior quantitatively, a pattern discrimination model (PDM) based on a cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC) neural network was developed. A PUMA 560 robot was used to study the feasibility of the developed technique. Experimental results have shown that the developed technique can analyze machine degradation quantitatively. This methodology can help operators set up machines for a given criterion, determine whether the machine is running correctly, and predict problems before they occur. As a result, maintenance hours can be used more effectively and productively.

We show that early identification of process anomalies by means of a separate fault detection module paves the way for a fast and accurate follow-up diagnosis. The diagnosis task is dramatically simplified because the diagnostic inferences can be performed at the soonest possible time: when the detection module first spots deviations between its calculated reference points and the corresponding measurements from the process. The approach taken has proved to be a successful division of work between the detection and diagnosis tasks in a large, complex process. The fault detection module, Early Fault Detection (EFD), has been implemented in our man-machine laboratory equipped with a PWR simulator and installed at the Loviisa nuclear power plant in Finland. The diagnosis modules, comprising the Detailed Diagnosis (DD) system, are currently running in our laboratory, where both DD and EFD are integrated within the cooperating supervision and control environment concept called ISACS.

Such an algorithm localizes the faulty transition in the system, once an error has been detected. It generates, if necessary, additional test cases which depend on the observed symptoms and which permit the location of the detected faults. The algorithm guarantees the correct diagnosis of any single or double faults (output and/or transfer) in at most one of the transitions of a system which is represented by an observably non-deterministic finite state machine (ONFSM). A simple example is used to demonstrate the different steps of the algorithm.			GHEDAMSI, A (corresponding author), UNIV MONTREAL,DIRO,CP 6128,SUCC A,MONTREAL H3C 3J7,PQ,CANADA.

It describes an extension of the technique by 'normalising' the frequency spectra of the faulty bearing with respect to the healthy bearing. This is shown to give much greater sensitivity to the detection of defect frequencies. Earlier work on a test machine was first used to adequately define the envelope technique. After successful demonstration on that machine, the technology was transferred to the main spindle of a milling machine.

This paper discusses the Connection Machine implementation of the model and its performance, as well as major changes that were made in the algorithms and numerical methods. In order to increase the parallel efficiency, we reformulated the barotropic equations to solve for the surface-pressure field rather than the volume-transport streamfunction. In addition to being more efficient, this method has several other advantages over the streamfunction formulation: (1) any number of islands can be included in the computational grid at no extra cost; (2) the model can handle steep gradients in the bottom topography; and (3) the free-surface height is a prognostic variable, which simplifies assimilation of altimetric data into the model. We have also developed a new parallelizable preconditioning method for the solution of the elliptic equation for the surface-pressure field. In order to use a standard conjugate gradient algorithm, an approximate-factorization technique is used to split off the Coriolis terms and obtain a symmetric operator. We then apply a symmetric local approximate-inverse operator as a preconditioning matrix, which is very effective in accelerating convergence to a solution,			SMITH, RD (corresponding author), LOS ALAMOS NATL LAB, LOS ALAMOS, NM 87545 USA.

The Navy is vitally interested in applications of neural nets. This is reflected by the fact that six different Navy laboratories, numerous universities, and many commercial companies are currently pursuing naval applications of neural networks as diverse as acoustic signal detection, active acoustic signal detection and classification, real-time, on-line machinery fault detection and analysis, image processing and identification, intelligent control for autonomous underwater vehicles, and automatic target recognition. This paper summarizes many of the highlights and accomplishments of ONR's neural network basic research programs and shares a bit of the historical perspective that serves as a source of pride in the world of Navy science and technology-the long term support and resulting payoff of Navy sponsored research in the broad field of neural networks. In addition, we will survey the significant challenges that must be overcome before neural network applications will become widely available to the Navy community.

In this paper, we present a new fault-tolerant modular architecture for binary trees. The number of nodes in each module can be adjusted to compromise between area overhead and reliability (or yield). Since each module is constructed by clustering nodes at the same level, it can be used for non-homogeneous trees where each level of the tree is made up of homogeneous nodes. The structure can be layed out using H-tree method. A fault diagnosis algorithm utilizing the topological property of the modular tree architecture is also proposed. The structure is inherently useful in implementing a concurrent fault detection/location scheme. A dictionary machine is used to illustrate the fault location scheme.

We describe an integrated environment, in which a diagnostic problem is decomposed through the use of Least Exception Logic (LEL) and the solution to the resulting problem is obtained using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). A causal modelling procedure further enumerates the solution to verify whether the assumptions made in formulating the problem are consistent with the solution. The procedure cycles with an advanced set of assumptions (derived as a cumulative result of previous diagnostic cycles) each time to generate more solutions in case no fault can be isolated. The developed system is used in diagnosis of CNC machines.

J	BUBLIN, S; KASHYAP, RL				BUBLIN, S; KASHYAP, RL			GENERATING FAULT HYPOTHESES WITH A FUNCTIONAL-MODEL IN MACHINE-FAULT DIAGNOSIS	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Traditional experiential knowledge-based diagnostic systems have suffered in their application to real-world problems due to their inability to handle unanticipated situations. Subsequently, diagnostic reasoning approaches have been developed that rely on a model of the device's normal operation to mitigate these shortcomings; these systems are called model-based diagnostic systems. The models of model-based systems are primarily a representation of the actual components of the device, which each have a defined behavior, along with a description of the topology of the device. The behavior of the device is simulated by introducing values into the device's inputs and propagating their effects throughout the interconnected components. Model-based systems often require an excessive amount of computation and data to arrive at a solution, primarily because information about any component in the model can only be utilized to make additional inferences about the components which are physical proximal to it in the device. The main focus of this article is a model of device operation that can be utilized to evaluate efficiently the ability of each component to account for a deviation in the device's state variables. The model presented here encodes the various constituents of the device at multiple levels of detail and abstraction, which are centered around the function or purpose of each concept.

This is particularly the case for switch-gear which is required to interrupt fault current safely and to close and latch safely for the maximum peak current, including any DC offset, when closing onto a fault. Historically, within switchgear specifications contributions from synchronous machines have formed the basis for this duty. In these specifications, the relationship between make and break duty is given by a factor of 2.55 or, more recently, 2.5, and in the calculation of the break duty an allowance may be made for any current decrement in the time interval between the initiation of a fault and the instant of contact parting. It has been realised that large three-phase induction motors make a contribution to both break and make duty and that, due to the rapid decrement of their contribution, the 2.55 factor is inadequate. It is shown by means of calculation and test results that even small single-phase induction motors make a contribution to switchgear make duty. For the present, it is necessary to calculate both the make and break duty, but it is suggested that, for the longer term, the relationship between break and make should be raised, possibly to a factor of 3. Failure to allow for the higher make duty may lead to dangerous conditions on a system.

J	VICENTE, KJ; RASMUSSEN, J				VICENTE, KJ; RASMUSSEN, J			ECOLOGICAL INTERFACE DESIGN - THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Review							INFORMATION INTEGRATION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; REPRESENTATION; KNOWLEDGE; DISPLAYS; COMPUTER; MODEL; TASK; ACQUISITION	A theoretical framework for designing interfaces for complex human-machine systems is proposed. The framework, called ecological interface design (EID), is based on the skills, rules, knowledge taxonomy of cognitive control. The basic goal of EID is twofold: first, not to force processing to a higher level than the demands of the task require, and second, to support each of the three levels of cognitive control. Thus, an EID interface should not contribute to the difficulty of the task, and at the same time, it should support the entire range of activities that operators will be faced with. Three prescriptive design principles are suggested to achieve this objective, each directed at supporting a particular level of cognitive control. Theoretical foundations of the framework are laid out. Particular attention is paid to presenting a coherent deductive argument justifying the principles of EID. In addition, three sources of converging support for the framework are presented. First, a review of the relevant psychological and cognitive engineering literature reveals that there is a considerable amount of research that is consistent with the principles of EID. Second, an examination of other approaches to interface design indicates that EID has a unique and significant contribution to make. Third, the results of an initial empirical evaluation also provide some preliminary support for the EID framework. Some issues for future research are outlined.

A fault may occur in at most m out of n interfaces, where n > 3m + 1. A method of reaching agreement about information is proposed. The method ensures that the agreed information is equal to the initial information in the presence of transient faults and is equal across computers in the presence of persistent faults. The method also ensures coordinated detection and identification of faults that arise in the process of reaching agreement about information.

This will be achieved by using technologies of knowledge-based support systems and cognitive engineering. Human-centred design approaches are needed for building such advanced automation systems for process supervision and control. Appropriate function and task allocations between human operators and computers as well as between computer control and computer support have to be found. A conceptual structure and a mathematical framework for describing the human-automation synergism in future technical systems are proposed in this paper. The conceptual structure differentiates between the general task categories of controlling and problem solving for both human and automation. It is further based on the structure of an extended User Interface Management System (UIMS) which suggests a separation into presentation, dialogue, user or operator model, application model, and tasks to be performed. Human operator behaviour, supervision and control, decision support (both application and operator oriented), and man-machine interfaces (with presentation and dialogue) are related to each other on different levels. Four examples from recent projects demonstrate the applicability of the human-centred approach towards advanced automation. Heuristic control of industrial processes as well as diagnosis of causes of technical failures in power plants are explained as examples for application oriented functionalities. Human error detection and flexible automation in aircraft guidance as well as procedural support for information search are described as possibilities for human operator oriented support.

The algorithm is intended for use in a supervisory control and data acquisition system as part of a learning expert system which could be implemented on-line. Possible power system applications include alarm processing and electrical fault diagnosis. An evaluation was carried out on circuit breaker trip sequences produced by a distribution system simulator. The algorithm was trained on a number of fault locations, and then tested on both seen and unseen faults. The results are promising.

J	OIKONOMOU, KN				OIKONOMOU, KN			ABSTRACTIONS OF FINITE-STATE MACHINES AND IMMEDIATELY-DETECTABLE OUTPUT FAULTS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						ABSTRACTIONS (LUMPINGS); APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS; CONCURRENT FAULT DETECTION; FINITE-STATE MACHINES; LIMITED INTERFACES; NP-COMPLETENESS; SET-PARTITIONING PROBLEMS		A general way to make a smaller model of a large system, or to represent the fact that the observations possible on it are limited, is to apply an abstraction A to it. Supposing that the system is modeled by a finite-state machine M, the ion consists of three partitions, one for each of the state, input, and output sets. States, inputs, or outputs lumped together in one block by the partition are indistinguishable from each other, resulting in a nondeterministic machine M(A). An observer of M(A), whose task is to detect erroneous behavior in M due to changes in its next-state or output maps ("faults"), is prevented by the abstraction from seeing some of these faults. Thus, the problem of choosing the abstraction optimally for the observer arises. This problem was considered previously from the viewpoint of undetectable faults in M's output map, and it was shown that the number of these faults can be minimized by an appropriate choice of just the partition of M's outputs. Here we investigate the choice of an abstraction optimal with respect to immediately-detectable faults in the output map. We show that this requires solving an NP-complete "set-partitioning" problem, of which the undetectable fault minimization problem is a special case. However, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding an approximately optimal partition of either the states or the inputs of M, together with a way to check the goodness of the approximation. This algorithm also solves the undetectable fault minimization problem exactly, and in polynomial time. Numerical experiments on random instances of the general set-partitioning problem suggest that the algorithm performs satisfactorily on the average. In conjunction with the mentioned results on undetectable faults, we now have a way of choosing optimally two of the three components of an abstraction for a finite-state machine M.

J	ERIKSSON, H; LARSES, P				ERIKSSON, H; LARSES, P			ALF-A - A KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION TOOL FOR TROUBLESHOOTING OF LABORATORY EQUIPMENT	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							SYSTEMS	Expert systems can be used to support troubleshooting of technical equipment, such as laboratory instruments. A critical factor and bottleneck in the development of such knowledge-based systems is the acquisition of relevant knowledge for the task. Computer-based knowledge acquisition (KA) tools can support knowledge elicitation from domain experts by transforming structures elicited from or entered by nonprogrammers into knowledge bases. A KA tool (ALF-A) that supports the development of expert systems for fault diagnosis in DNA sequencing machines has been developed. Different categories of experts can use the tool directly (i.e., without an intermediate knowledge engineer) to enter their knowledge according to a predefined model of troubleshooting.

The main components of ENGEXP are the user interface, the expert system core, the feedback and knowledge acquisition tool, and a help facility for the user. As usual, the expert system core contains the inference engine, the knowledge base(s) and the explanation subsystem. A particular feature of the inference engine is that it can resolve situations with multiple causes. The knowledge is organized into three layers as is done by the human experts. The qualitative analysis of the results obtained in a large sample of applications showed a remarkable performance, while the quantitative analysis showed a success rate over 95%. The response time is very good (always less-than-or-equal-to 2 sec., in many cases less-than-or-equal-to 0.5 sec.) despite the overhead caused by the user-friendly user interface.

J	KRISHNAMURTHI, M; PHILLIPS, DT				KRISHNAMURTHI, M; PHILLIPS, DT			AN EXPERT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK FOR MACHINE FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								This research focuses on two major issues related to the design, development, and implementation of machine fault diagnosis expert systems: (1) investigation of the actual cognitive process of human diagnostic experts, and (2) analysis of the current practices in the development of machine fault diagnosis expert systems. The investigation of the human diagnostic reasoning process has resulted in the abstraction and capturing of the human ability to learn, understand, and diagnose different machinery belonging to a particular class. The captured abstractions of human diagnostic expertise have been integrated with the expert system development expertise of knowledge engineers to provide a customized expert system shell for developing machine fault diagnosis expert systems. The designed machine fault diagnosis shell reduces the development time, effort and skill making use of generalized modules for knowledge acquisition, knowledge verification, application system generation, learning, explanation, and eliminates the burden of designing and developing each application diagnosis expert system separately. The developed shell has been validated by generating a prototype fault diagnosis expert system for a Cincinnati Milacron 786 robot.

J	MILLER, RE; PAUL, S				MILLER, RE; PAUL, S			GENERATING CONFORMANCE TEST SEQUENCES FOR COMBINED CONTROL AND DATA-FLOW OF COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS	IFIP TRANSACTIONS C-COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article								Using a limited version of Estelle, from which a specification can be represented in terms of an Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM), we develop a technique to generate conformance tests which test both the data flow as well as the control flow. From the EFSM, we generate a Finite State Machine (FSM) with several transitions corresponding to a single transition of the EFSM. Moreover, the input and output parameters are also modified so that an ''equivalent'' FSM is obtained. The data flow graph (DFG) is constructed directly from the ''equivalent'' FSM. Test segments axe obtained from the data flow graph as well as from the control flow graph and are combined ''carefully'' to generate an executable test sequence. Test data for the above sequence is chosen using a mutation technique to guarantee detection of specific kinds of faults in the data flow. Control flow is tested in the conventional way.

Protocol testing methods have profited from experience in hardware and software testing; in addition, much recent work considers testing based on finite state machine models. This paper points out the similarities between testing of hardware, software and communication protocols in the context of a general testing framework and the use of fault models. Fault models not only provide a basis for the definition of test coverage measures, but also lead to methodologies for test suite design and test result analysis for diagnosis. While the principles of fault models are essentially the same in the different areas of hardware, software and protocols, the particular fault models that can be applied depend on the specification formalism used to describe the implementation under test. The paper presents various fault models corresponding to hardware, software, finite state machines and several other modelling techniques, including Formal Description Techniques.

J	KURZ, E				KURZ, E			EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR FAULT-DIAGNOSIS ON CNC MACHINES	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								The development of CNC machines has brought along a rise in complexity and automation. The efficiency of such systems depends strongly on their reliabilty and availability in the production process. Thus, the cause of a break-down of a machine should be detected by the user and in most cases be repaired immediately. We have developed a diagnosis system prototype which runs on the machine control and reasons about 200 fault possibilities. The architecture of this system is divided into the development environment on a UNIX based, graphic workstation for entering the expert's knowledge and the target environment on the machine control. The expert system tool on the development environment is written in COMMONLISP and the system on the target environment is written in C.

J	CHOW, MY; MANGUM, PM; YEE, SO				CHOW, MY; MANGUM, PM; YEE, SO			A NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH TO REAL-TIME CONDITION MONITORING OF INDUCTION-MOTORS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article								Induction motors are subject to incipient faults which, if undetected, can lead to serious machine failures. Incipient fault detection methods applied in large induction motors of greater than 100 hp are often too costly or physically impractical for use on small- and medium-size induction motors. This paper develops a neural network-based incipient fault detector for small- and medium-size induction motors. The neural network-based incipient fault detector avoids the problems associated with traditional incipient fault detection schemes by employing more readily available information such as rotor speed and stator current. The neural network design is evaluated in real time in the laboratory on a 3/4-hp permanent magnet induction motor. The results of this evaluation indicate that the neural network-based incipient fault detector provides a satisfactory level of accuracy, greater than 95%, which is suitable for real-world applications.

J	MILLER, DP				MILLER, DP			FUSION - A PLAN FOR DEVELOPING A FAMILIAR USER SYSTEM INTERFACE FOR THE IC FABRICATION INDUSTRY	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPONENTS HYBRIDS AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								In spite of the best efforts of designers and the power of today's computer workstations, many user system interfaces (USI's) found in IC fabrication equipment are not very user friendly. Hence, for many complex IC fabrication machines, extensive training programs, thick user manuals, and operator confusion have become a way of life. Since many users must interact with several machines or several types of machines, interequipment inefficiencies arise due to negative transfer of training. This paper discusses the concept of developing a set of industry guidelines for a familiar USI for IC fabrication equipment called Familiar User System Interface OperatioN (FUSION). A familiar USI across the industry would allow process engineers, operators, and service technicians to learn only one set of interface conventions. Successful standardization would lead to reduced training time and operational errors, faster recipe editing, more rapid fault diagnosis and repair, and reduced personnel specialization. This paper addresses the need and potential benefits of FUSION, identifies some of the major technical challenges to developing such an interface, and proposes a developmental approach that would systematically create, test, and validate candidate designs. The author hopes that this paper will also stimulate spirited discussion of the FUSION concept within the industry.

The on-line incipient fault detector is composed of two parts : (1) a disturbance and noise filter artificial neural network to filter out the transient measurements while retaining the steady-state measurements, and (2) a high-order incipient fault detection artificial neural network to detect incipient faults in single-phase squirrel-cage induction motors based on data collected from the motor. Simulation results show that neural networks yield satisfactory performance for on-line detection of incipient faults in single-phase squirrel-cage cage induction motors. The neural network fault detection methodology presented in this paper is not only limited to single-phase squirrel-cage motors (used as prototype) but can also be applied to many other types of rotating machines, with the appropriate modifications.

Prerequisites for fault tolerance in multiprocessor sytems are an ability to detect and locate node and link failures, detection and prevention of system deadlocks and, algorithms for distributed checkpointing, rollover and rescheduling of the various program modules. This paper deals with these issues in the context of an alternative multiprocessing system, namely, the dynamic dataflow system. The machine described in this paper employs a localised switching protocol, a special arbiter called the batching arbiter and a new bus structure. Several novel actors have also been implemented to deal with the various issues of fault tolerance in the system. It is shown in the paper that our machine offers a considerable degree of fault tolerance when compared with most other dataflow systems proposed and/or built.

J	LEWIS, WS				LEWIS, WS			VIBRATION ANALYSIS IS THE CORNERSTONE OF PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE	TAPPI JOURNAL			English	Article								Vibration analysis is an important part of a total predictive and preventive maintenance program. The analysis of vibration signals transmitted from rotating equipment can be a great help in determining the equipment operating condition and the nature of a problem. Turning vibration into an electrical signal is the job of three types of transducers-displacement probes, velocimeters, and accelerometers. Such transducers can turn vibration into an electrical signal, which is then measured by a vibration analyzer. Most machinery vibration problems can be solved with only a real-time analyzer, a length of cable with necessary connections, and an assortment of vibration transducers. An effective analysis format will include surveys of paper machines and auxiliary equipment, and historical information on all equipment. Lewis discusses the analysis formats that can be used, depending on what kind of problem is being investigated. Vibration analysis can detect resonance, beating, imbalance, misalignment, mechanical looseness, fluid-film bearing damage, pump vane pass, gear problems, electric motor problems, antifriction bearing defects, inner bearing race problems, corrosion, and locked-up bearings.

A number of methods are known for the selection of a test suite based on the specification of the implementation under test, assumed to be given in the form of a finite state machine. This paper presents a new method which provides a logical link between several of the known methods. Called the "partial W method," it has general applicability, full fault-detection power, and yields shorter test suites than the W method. The second part of the paper discusses various other issues which have an impact on the selection of a suitable test suite. This includes the consideration of interaction parameters, various test architectures for protocol testing, and the fact that many specifications do not satisfy the assumptions made by most test selection methods, such as complete definition, a correctly implemented reset function, a limited number of states in the implementation, and determinism.

The qualitative methods currently in use for the study of wear particle morphology are time consuming and require substantial expertise in this area. If numerical parameters could be used to characterize wear particle morphology, the analysis of such particles would become much simpler and not require specialized expertise. In this paper fractal descriptors are applied to wear particle boundaries. The morphology of a wear particle depends greatly on its surface characteristics. These characteristics are not always effectively represented by a fractal dimension derived from the boundary profile. Here a fractal descriptor characterizing the surface characteristics of particles is introduced. When used in conjunction with established fractal methods, more precise particle characterization is obtained.

Both of these techniques are based on design diversity and employ multiple software versions for the same problem. Due to the different methods employed for error detection by the two techniques, one may be better suited than the other for certain applications. We describe an environment that supports execution of programs using both N-version programming and recovery blocks in a uniform manner. The basic unit of fault tolerance supported by this system is at the procedure or function level. Each such program unit can be packaged as its own task, and different fault tolerance techniques can subsequently be employed, even within the same application. The environment also allows versions to be written in different programming languages, and executed on different machines. This enhances the independence between the different versions, making the fault tolerance techniques more effective.

J	GODDEN, TJ				GODDEN, TJ			A HOSPITAL APPROACH TO COPING WITH RADIATION INCIDENTS	NUCLEAR ENERGY-JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH NUCLEAR ENERGY SOCIETY			English	Article								In a radiation incident, there is a possibility that radioactive exposure or contamination may involve human casualties. Such incidents can occur wherever radiation is used, and they may conveniently be divided into incidents originating within a hospital and those occurring elsewhere. Outside the hospital environment, possible sources of irradiated casualties include accidents at nuclear installations and NAIR incidents. Since 1989 health authorities have been required by the Department of Health to lay down plans for their response to such incidents, and these rely on good communications between different specialties, including medical physics departments. Within hospitals themselves, there is potential for unnecessary irradiation both of patients and of staff. In diagnostic X-ray departments, this may arise from inefficient imaging systems. In radiotherapy departments, over-exposure of patients can arise from an incorrect treatment plan, a treatment machine fault or an error in calibration. One much publicized incident of the oatter type was revealed during a survey by radiotherapy physicists involved with the Institute of Physical Sciences in Medicine. This Paper summarizes the general approach of a hospital to the above scenarios.

(Testability, in the present context, refers to the ability to generate tests. Testable synthesis guarantees high fault coverage by using an automatic test generator.) In the first approach, we develop a partial scan method in which scan flip-flops are selected to break up the cyclic structure of the sequential circuit. In the second approach, we present a novel state assignment method that results in reduced feedback or pipeline-like structure. The third approach, also applicable to finite state machines, embeds a suitably designed test machine in the given specification before synthesis.

An alternative method is proposed in the paper for condition monitoring and diagnostics of reciprocating machines. A modified LMS (least mean square) algorithm is proposed in order to model the impulse-like signals with non-stationarity. Convergence of the algorithm is investigated. The approach presented is suitable to real-time monitoring during the process of working operation and fault diagnostics of reciprocating machines.

J	TUNDISI, JG				TUNDISI, JG			PERSPECTIVES FOR ECOLOGICAL MODELING OF TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL RESERVOIRS IN SOUTH-AMERICA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article							BRAZIL; PHYTOPLANKTON	In this paper, the author identifies and describes some basic characteristics of tropical and subtropical reservoir in South America and the necessary modelling effort. Many reservoirs in South America have a wide geographical distribution within a latitudinal gradient that ranges from tropical rainforest to subtropical regions. The 'baseline' environment is considered the reservoir area and the hydrographic basin, including the region downstream. For the modelling effort it is necessary to establish a conceptual framework based on the following characteristics: morphometry and compartments; retention time; hydrological cycle and flow requirements; reservoir thermal stratification and circulation patterns; quantification of submerged forest biomass and its degradation in reservoirs located in the tropical rainforest; dissolved-oxygen consumption; potential for eutrophication and loading capacity; pulses in forcing functions; and suspended-material transport. In the region downstream it is necessary to consider river recovery capacity, water uses and flow regime requirements. Most reservoirs in this latitudinal gradient follow a significantly different path from the reservoirs in temperate zones, including effects of forcing functions, decomposition rats, and seasonal circulation periods. The size, volume and dimension of these large artificial ecosystems justify the implementation of several methodological approaches useful for modelling, including oceanographic techniques and intensive use of satellite images. In necessitates also a strong background on ecological processes. Rates of processes in tropical ecosystems are not well known, and such input from experimental limnology will be an important step as a basis for the modelling effort. The organization of a data bank for these reservoirs is in progress, and such a system is also fundamental for the modelling procedure. The modelling effort for tropical reservoirs is mainly due to the need for evaluation of effects, prediction of eutrophication, prognosis for possible deterioration of water quality in reservoirs with inundated forest, and introduction of management techniques for multiple uses including upstream/downstream environments. Management techniques include exploitation of spatial heterogeneity, regulation of retention time and optimal biomass production.

J	BOENNING, RA				BOENNING, RA			MISSION RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENT BY MARGINAL CHECKING	PROCEEDINGS ANNUAL RELIABILITY AND MAINTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM			English	Article						INCIPIENT FAILURE; CRITICAL PARAMETER; DEGRADATION; MARGINAL CHECKING (MC); ELECTRONIC PROGNOSTICS; CABLES AND CONNECTORS		Current weapon systems contain very complex electronic subsystems that must perform properly on demand. Improved MTBF will increase reliability in general, but it does not assure improved performance of specific items. The probability of satisfactory next-mission performance can be significantly enhanced if incipient failures can be recognized. Westinghouse ILSD is nearing completion of an investigation, sponsored by the Rome Air Development Center, to determine the operational feasibility of detecting incipient electronic system failures; incipient failure detection is termed "marginal checking" (MC). Laboratory experiments and accelerated life testing of selected subsystems/components were performed to identify and quantify changes in critical parameters that are indicative of incipient failure. Practical aspects of marginal checking concerning on-equipment and off-equipment implementation, as well as cost effectiveness, were considered. Results of this investigation indicate that operational detection of incipient failures appears to be feasible for certain classes of critical subsystems and components.
