It deals with dual communication i.e. one originating from the sensors and relayed to various reception centers and the other originating from an Intelligent Prognostics Engine (IPE) being fed back to the control mechanism (Manual/Automated) of the machinery. The paper presents the feasibility of deploying agents in embedded and supervisory controllers for collating, managing and communicating information. The conceptual design and prototype model establishes the efficacy of the agent framework in diagnostics as well as prognostics. The framework is developed using Java Agent Development Framework (JADE). This paper concentrates on development of peer agent communication, communication ontologies; agent behaviors based on messaging performatives, integration issues and graphical user interfaces for diverse agents and human interfaces. It also evolves a conceptual Agent framework for manufacturing environment. The work can potentially improve reliability: reduce equipment downtime by using intelligence and contextual information from sensors and events. It facilitates the timely availability of the critical data for real-time monitoring and corrective signals, as well as a transparent and rapid configuration mechanism for intelligent monitoring.

In this paper we demonstrate the success of statistical learning theory-based support vector machine (SVM) and sparse Bayesian learning-based relevance vector machine (RVM) to perform reliable predictions. The prognostic capability of SVM and RVM will be utilized to achieve high level inference. The plausibility of these techniques is shown by their superior performance in forecasting soil moisture providing exogenous knowledge.

An important issue in such effort is the modelling of the induction machine including rotor bar and end-ring faults, with a minimum of computational complexity. In this paper, a simpler method is employed In the simulation and analysis of an induction motor with rotor asymmetries.

C	Kral, C; Kapeller, H; Pirker, F; Pascoli, G			IEEE	Kral, C; Kapeller, H; Pirker, F; Pascoli, G			Discrimination of rotor faults and low frequency load torque modulations of squirrel cage induction machines by means of the Vienna Monitoring Method	2005 IEEE 36th Power Electronic Specialists Conference (PESC), Vols 1-3	IEEE POWER ELECTRONICS SPECIALISTS CONFERENCE RECORDS		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual IEEE Power Electronic Specialists Conference (PESC 05)	JUN 12-16, 2005	Recife, BRAZIL	IEEE			SYSTEM; MOTORS	Electrical rotor asymmetries such as broken rotor bars give rise to well known side band currents in the vicinity of the fundamental as well as double slip frequency torque modulation. An externally caused low frequency load torque modulation may therefore also cause similar effects such as side band currents and modulation of the electromechanical torque. It is therefore a challenge to clearly distinguish these cases. In this paper rotor fault detection is performed by means of the Vienna Monitoring Method. This fault detection technique is based on a two model approach. Two mathematical induction machine models are used to calculate certain state variables such as flux and torque. From the difference of the calculated torque values a rotor fault indicator is derived. Measuring results were obtained from a 18.5 kW four pole induction machine with three broken bars. The Vienna Monitoring Method was applied to the faulty machine with and without load torque oscillations in order to study the ability of the discrimination of externally caused torque modulations and torque modulations due to rotor faults.

Addressing diagnostic techniques based on current signatures analysis (MCSA), the anomalous components introduced by a specific fault in the current spectrum are investigated and diagnostic procedure is able to correlate the amplitude of these components to the fault extent. In this paper, the impact of feedback control on asymmetric rotor cage induction machine behavior is presented. The diagnostic variables usually used for open-loop operation are no longer effective under closed-loop operation. Simulation results show that signals already present at the drive have suitable features that can lead to an effective diagnostic procedure.

Experiments on supervised learning algorithms for text categorization	2005 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-4	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2005	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				Modern(1,2) information society is facing the challenge of handling massive volume of online documents, news, intelligence reports, and so on. How to use the information accurately and in a timely manner becomes a major concern in many areas. While the general information may also include images and voice, we focus on the categorization of text data in this paper. We provide a brief overview of the information processing flow for text categorization, and discuss two supervised learning algorithms, viz., support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares (PLS), which have been successfully applied in other domains, e.g., fault diagnosis Error! Reference source not found.. While SVM has been well explored for binary classification and was reported as an efficient algorithm for text categorization, PLS has not yet been applied to text categorization. Our experiments are conducted on three data sets: Reuter's-21578 dataset about corporate mergers and data acquisitions (ACQ), WebKB and the 20-Newsgroups. Results show that the performance of PLS is comparable to SVM in text categorization. A major drawback of SVM for multi-class categorization is that it requires a voting scheme based on the results of pairwise classification. PLS does not have this drawback and could be a better candidate for multi-class text categorization.

Prognostics and health management technology provides the opportunity to eliminate some of the physical redundancy (and associated weight) through implementation of accurate remaining useful life (RUL) algorithms. Consideration of this subsystem design approach upfront during the conceptual design process(1,2) rather than downstream during the detailed design phase of the air vehicle system may produce a more optimal air vehicle configuration with regard to reliability and weight. Results are presented for an unmanned air vehicle design optimization which included RLTL algorithm confidence, control surface actuator redundancy and control surface configuration as optimization variables. Optimization constraints included landing dispersion, mission reliability and mission availability. Reductions in air vehicle weight were achieved with reasonable RUL accuracy requirements.

Thermal gradient cycling occurs during system operation which eventually results in thermo-mechanical fatigue induced failure. Such failures can result in immediate electronic system shutdown with no advanced fault or warning signals; thus preventing the use of conventional fault-to-failure detection approaches as a means of predicting maintenance need. This NAVAIR sponsored SBIR project uses state-of-the-art material modeling to predict degradation of circuit board elements as a means for "simulated fault detection." This effort has been focused on the specific aspect of solder fracture and fatigue since electronic industry statistics have attributed this failure issue as a driving factor in system reliability. This project will demonstrate feasibility for using conventional, off-the-shelf sensing, to predict solder degradation due to thermal cycling as a means to prognosticate electronic device reliability.(12)	VEXTEC Corp, Brentwood, TN 37027 USA		Nasser, L (corresponding author), VEXTEC Corp, 750 Old Hickory Blvd,Bldg 2,Suite 270, Brentwood, TN 37027 USA.

Stringent Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Health Management capability requirements are being placed on new applications, like the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), in order wenable and reap the benefits of revolutionary Autonomic Logistic support concepts. While fault detection and fault isolation effectiveness with very low false alarm rates continue to improve on these new applications; the prognostics requirements are even more ambitious and present very significant challenges to the system design teams. This paper(1,2) will explore some of these design challenges and issues; discuss the various degrees of prognostic capabilities; and draw heavily on lessons learned from previous prognostic development efforts.

However, these techniques are developed in isolation and generally a single technique can not address the diagnostic problems in complex systems. In this paper, we will investigate a hybrid approach, which combines different techniques to obtain better diagnostic performance than the use of a single technique alone, and demonstrate it on an Anti-lock Brake System. In this approach, we first combine the parity equations and nonlinear observer to generate the residuals. Statistical tests, in particular Generalized Likelihood Ratio tests (GLRT), are used to detect a subset of faults that are easier to detect. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used for fault isolation of less-sensitive parametric faults. Finally, subset selection for improved parameter estimation is used to estimate fault severity.

C	Liu, J			IEEE	Liu, Jun			Optimal task ordering for troubleshooting systems faults	2005 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-4	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2005	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				(1,2) Automated troubleshooting of system faults is an essential element of modern aerospace equipment. The increased efficiency and accuracy helps in dramatically lowering maintenance costs. The Prognostic Health Management (PHM) group at Pratt & Whitney is responsible for developing automated systems for fault detection, isolation, and accommodation for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system. A fundamental question that arises in this context is the following: Given a list of suspected components that have been identified a priori as possible causes for failure symptom (s), what is the optimal troubleshooting task assignment strategy? This paper introduces a novel approach to optimal task ordering. We show that the correct strategy is to order the tasks based on an easily calculated metric-which we call the mean utility function-that takes into consideration the mean troubleshooting time, or cost, or a combination of the two, depending on what is considered to be most critical. A mathematical proof is given for this. The approach shown in the paper can also be applied, as a troubleshooting strategy, for any other machinery health management system.

We briefly discuss the traditional viewpoint that many people hold of machinery repairs as well as the apparent disconnect between a dynamic Reliability initiative and the normal approach to equipment repairs. In bridging this gap, we will explore a shift in viewpoints that research the value that a Reliability approach to the Repair process offers. Some of the topics discussed in this "Business-based Maintenance Philosophy" will be: Traditional views on motor repair Implementing a comprehensive Motor Management initiative The role that proper Repair Specifications should play in the Repair process The role that Root Cause Analysis should play in the Repair process Optimizing Preventive, Predictive and Corrective interval frequencies Managing equipment health Achieving the true partnership relationship that must exist between the plant and their outside motor repair provider(s).										0	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1079-9931		0-7803-9107-1	IEEE CEM IND TECH CO			2005							104	114					11	Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Manufacturing	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BDJ05	WOS:000233679500008					2022-02-14

Extending the fault detection and diagnosis into predictive maintenance increases the value of this technology. The traditional diagnosis can be viewed as a single diagnostic agent having a model of the whole system to be diagnosed. This becomes inadequate when the system becomes. large and distributed as on the electric ships. For such systems, the software multi-agents may offer a solution. This paper first presents a brief review on the traditional fault diagnosis method with an emphasis on its application to electric motors as important components on the all-electric ship. The software agent technology is then introduced. The discussion is made about how this technology supports the drastic manning reduction requirements for the future navy ships. Examples are given on the existing naval applications of diagnostic and prognostic software agents.

Early detection of CD/PD will enable better coordination and planning of resources such as maintenance personnel, ordering of parts, etc. Most importantly, one can prevent catastrophic failures during normal operations. In decades, on-line PD measurement has been used to find loose, delaminated, overheated, and contaminated defects before these problems lead to failures. As a result, on-line PD monitoring has become an important tool for planning machine maintenance. Many methods are available to measure the PD activities in the operating machines. The electrical techniques usually measure the currents by means of a high frequency current transformer at neutral points or detect the PD pulses via high voltage capacitors connected to the phase terminals. Those methods are generally expensive and easy to be interfered by the noise due to the considerations of the high frequency and low signal levels. Instead of using high frequency analysis, this paper extracts the low frequency characteristics of PD/CD faults and develops a low cost PD/CD on-line health monitoring system for motors. The system employs an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple sensors inputs for PD/CD diagnostic task. The proposed algorithms and circuits are implemented and tested in the laboratory environment. Results show that the system is sensitive and accurate.

The IPS comprises several generic embedded devices (GEDs) and a remote host. The GED can be easily embedded into various types of equipment to acquire equipment-engineering data and meet the specification requirements of Interface A for supporting semiconductor industry e-diagnostics. Furthermore, the. GED has an open-standard application interface offering any pluggable and customized intelligent-maintenance applications. With this feature, intelligent-maintenance tasks can be distributed and localized releasing the factory network burden and enhancing equipment reliability and maintainability. This work also develops two typical Pluggable Applications: the predictive maintenance scheme (PMS) for equipment fault detection, and the quality prognostics scheme (QPS) for virtual metrology and product quality prediction. Integrating the PMS into the IPS and the QPS into the IPS are respectively accomplished using the conveyor equipment and the sputtering equipment of a TFT-LCD factory. These two illustrative examples clearly demonstrate that IPS is versatile, configurable, and effective.

It is assumed that the plant can be modelled as a TDES, the faults are permanent, and that a diagnosis system is available that detects and isolates faults with a bounded delay (expressed in clock ticks). Thus, the combination of the plant and the diagnosis system, as the system to be controlled, has three modes: normal, transient and recovery. Initially, the plant is in the normal mode. Once a fault occurs, the system enters the transient mode. After the fault is detected and isolated by the diagnosis system, the system enters the recovery mode. This framework does not depend on the diagnosis technique used, as long as lower and upper bounds for diagnosis delay are available. A modular switching supervisory scheme is proposed to satisfy the system specifications. The design consists of a normal-transient supervisor, and multiple recovery supervisors each for recovery from a particular failure mode. The issue of the nonblocking property of the system under suprevision, and also supervisor admissibility (controllability), in particular coerciveness, are studied. The proposed approach is applied to a manufacturing cell consisting of two machines and two conveyors. A modular switching suprevisor is designed to ensure the specifications in the normal mode are met. In cases of failure, the supervisor sends appropriate recovery commands so that the cell can complete its production cycle.

Moreover, based on this model, an innovative bank of interpolated LTI Kalman filters is synthesised to allow sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI). The advanced control law has been successfully applied to a winding machine. Also, software sensor fault has been generated to improve the accuracy of FDI algorithm in winding machine.

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms are now extending its frontier and bringing new challenge to power electronic engineers. As the technology is advancing, the applications of power electronics are proliferating in industrial, commercial, residential, aerospace, military, transportation and utility systems. Power electronics is destined to play key role in global industrialization and energy conservation trends of the 21(st) century. In the environmentally clean renewable energy systems, such as wind, PV and fuel cells, the role of power electronics is significant. Power electronics is helping efficient energy utilization in the ever-increasing energy demand of the world, and thus conserving our dwindling fossil fuel energy reserve and helping environmental pollution control. The importance of power electronics will be similar to information technology that is currently causing revolution in our society. The half-day advanced and state-of-the-art tutorial is designed to give a comprehensive overview and recent advances of power electronics and motor drives with emphasis on industrial applications. Starting with historical evolution, importance and energy saving aspects of the technology, the tutorial will review advances and trends on power semiconductor devices, converter topologies, machine drives and control. The application features in renewable energy systems (wind, PV and fuel cells) will be covered. There will be some emphasis on recent fuzzy logic and neural network applications in power electronics. Finally, a broad conclusion and future prognosis of the technology will be outlined.

An improved model of the induction machine dedicated to faults detection - Extension of the modified winding function	2005 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology - (ICIT), Vols 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	DEC 14-17, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			AIR-GAP; ECCENTRICITY	This paper deals mainly with the modelling of induction machine inductances by taking into account all the space harmonics, the introduction of the skewing rotor bars effects and linear rise of MMF across the slot. The model is established initially in the case of symmetric machine, which corresponds to the case of a constant air-gap. Then in other cases where the machine presents a static or dynamic eccentricity, an axial or radial eccentricity. This objective would be achieved by exploiting an extension in 2-D of the modified winding function approach (MWFA). Moreover, the theoretical aspects are presented and the stator current spectra analysis proves the effectiveness of this approach in case of eccentricity.

A model of double star induction motors under rotor bar defect for diagnosis purpose	2005 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology - (ICIT), Vols 1 and 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	DEC 14-17, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; VOLTAGE-SOURCE INVERTER; BROKEN BARS; STATOR; FAILURES; MACHINE; FAULTS	This paper investigates the modelling of a double star induction motor when this one operates under rotor fault. A special attention is paid only to the rotor defect. The use of double star induction motors or six-phase induction motors is increasing and we can find it in high power process. Its main advantage lies in most reliability in case of a normal operating system. In order to monitor a huge power process, we have to focus our attention on signals given the state of health of an electromechanical axis in the whole. Consequently, an appropriated model is proposed allowing the quantification of the severity of the fault when rotor bars are defected. This is made thanks to the most widespread approach: the spectral analysis of the stator current using the well know method named Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA).

Once a distinct change is discovered, the information can be further used for diagnosing the reason for the system malfunction. The proposed computational strategy consists of several steps. First of all, two different Radial Basis Function (RBF) Network models are learned based on given operation data from the system during two different time periods. Then these models are used to predict the respective outputs on the even grid of the input space. Finally, the difference between the two models outputs is used as new data set for generation of the fuzzy rules by a specially proposed algorithm. These rules show in a fuzzy manner how much is the difference of the system performance in each area of the input space. Three original algorithms combined into two learning strategies for the type of Normalized RBF network models are first given in the paper and then evaluated on a test example. The proposed computational strategy is applied to evaluation and detection of changes in real operation of a diesel engine for a hydraulic excavator. Three different sets of data have been examined in order to discover the degree of difference between the respective three operation periods.

Neural Networks (NN) is capable of monitoring unset of faults, however, complexity of the many possible failure modes and various levels of intensity may deteriorate the accuracy of NN. This paper presents Malleable Neural Networks architecture for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of a subsystem of a machining centre. A central NN is trained with faulty status of operation at the core stage which is then able to discern between healthy and all possible faulty states. NNs are then modulated to learn each failure mode with their different intensity levels. Diagnostic is initially made by the central module, then, the network is reconfigured by an interprocess call to adapt to an appropriate topology and knowledgebase to detect the severity level of the fault. The monitoring system uses steady state values of sensitive parameters of current and pressure transducers. If the parameters are out of a predefined healthy range, a non-destructive test will be initiated, which produces a transient response as input pattern to the NNs. Testing the NN based monitoring system with 395 failure modes showed that in 99.2% of cases the network was successful to accurately identify the cause and severity of the failures.

Synchronous Signal Averaging (SSA) technique is used to enhance the measured vibration signal. The response of gear due to some internal and external excitations can be modelled as the superposition of gear meshing components and the non-harmonic additive noise. The ICA-based signal processing can accurately estimate the gear meshing components and simultaneously reduce the effect of noise. The time-frequency analysis is applied to the estimated gear meshing components. The health condition of the gear is diagnosed by characterizing the time-frequency transforms. The proposed technique is supported by the numerical simulation.

These cracks originated at the blend between the gear post and the plate and later diagnosed as low cycle fatigue. Cracks on the planet carrier plate are a very serious but rare type of fault that may require the redesign of this critical part. In this paper, an investigation of the problem is attempted using experimental data from ground and aircraft tests. Two features based on the signal energy are used to distinguish the faulty from the healthy plate using the signals from four one-dimensional accelerometers. A data analysis based on the Time Synchronous Averaging signal transformation, tends to indicate that besides any machining error or material fault that may have initiated the crack, there is evidence of a non-rotating fault. A possible explanation of this fault is a deformation of the ring gear, or a considerable non-uniform distribution of forces among the planet gears that may have been generated by the presence of the crack and or may have promoted its rapid development.

The proposed approach determines whether the FSM under consideration is faulty or not by observing (part of) its output sequence. The input sequence applied to the FSM does not need to be fully observable but an a priori probabilistic description of the input sequence is assumed to be available. Given the (partially) observed output sequence of the FSM, we compute the a posteriori probability that this sequence was produced by the fault-free FSM and compare it to the a posteriori probability that it was produced by the faulty one. We also discuss how the approach in the paper relates to the more general problem of observation and fault diagnosis in stochastic discrete event systems in (hidden) Markov models.

Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is used for the detection of the electrical and the mechanical faults of an induction machine to identify rotor bar faults. Also, the calculation of machine inductances (with and without rotor defects) is carried out by the tools of software MATLAB before the beginning of simulation under Software SIMULINK.

In fact, going by the number of occurrences, the position of stator faults is only second to bearing related faults. Third harmonic line currents have been reported to increase under stator fault conditions. It has been shown in this paper that they are primarily due to the interaction of saturation caused permeance wave and reverse rotating field caused due to stator faults or voltage unbalance and machine structural imbalance (usually small). Thus, voltage unbalance cannot be distinguished from stator faults. The third and the other triplen related harmonics are however found to be a very decisive indicator of the fault, if measured in the machine terminal voltages just after switch-off. The fault detection technique is independent of machine parameters and supply unbalances. Simulation as well as experimental results are presented with very few shorted turns.

Even though, many researchers dealt with the bearing fault diagnosis of induction motors by using traditional and soft computing approaches, the application of these techniques for predicting the remaining life time of electrical equipment is not seen much in the literature. Moreover, individual Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques suffer from their own drawbacks, which can overcome by forming a hybrid approach combining the advantages of each technique. Hence, in this paper an attempt has been made to combine neural networks and fuzzy logic and forming a Fuzzy Back Propagation (Fuzzy BP) network for identifying the present condition of the hearing and estimate the remaining useful time of the motor. The results obtained from Fuzzy BP network are compared with the neural network, which show that the hybrid approach is well suitable for assessing the present condition of the bearing and the time available for the replacement of the bearing.

We describe here the application of the modified Morlet based WNN to the fault detection of rotating machinery. The activation functions of the wavelet nodes in the hidden layer are derived from a modified Morlet mother wavelet. In this paper, the wavelet network architecture for intelligent fault detection is first introduced. Then an optimization method of neural network and a training algorithm is developed. Finally, feedforward backpropagation neural network (BP) and wavelet neural networks are compared for fault detection. The aim of this study is to examine the effective of the modified Morlet WNN model for fault detection. Experiment results shows that the modified Morlet WNN has advantages of rapid training, generality and accuracy over feedforward backpropagation neural network.

In this paper, a novel intelligent system is presented for real-time detection and diagnosis of the fault signals. The model consists of wavelet packet analysis (WPA) unit and support vector machines (SVMs) unit. When signals are decomposed in wavelet packet space, different frequency bands are processed from original signals adequately. WPA can improve abilities of feature extraction than conventional WT. We use a large number of samples to compare the accuracy rate of three kinds kernel function of SVMs, the results indicate that accuracy of Gaussian kernel is higher than polynomial kernel and multilayer perceptron (MLP) kernel. No matter whether the data set is small or huge, accurate classification rate of SVMs is better than RBF and BP neural network methods for normal and exceptional subjects.

Up to now, system designers have primarily considered hardware-only and software only fault-detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate the deleterious effects of transient faults. These two fault-detection systems, however are extremes in the design space, representing sharp trade-offs between hardware cost, reliability, and performance. In this paper we identify hybrid hardware/software fault-detection mechanisms as promising alternatives to hardware-only and software-only systems. These hybrid systems offer designers more options to fit their reliability needs within their hardware and performance budgets. We propose and evaluate CRAFT, a suite of three such hybrid techniques, to illustrate the potential of the hybrid approach. For fair quantitative comparisons among hardware, software, and hybrid systems, we introduce a new metric, Mean Work To Failure, which is able to compare systems for which machine instructions do not represent a constant unit of work. Additionally, we present a new simulation framework which rapidly assesses reliability and does not depend on manual identification of failure modes. Our evaluation illustrates that CRAFT and hybrid techniques in general, offer attractive options in the fault-detection design space.

The sensing technology is based on application of guided waves such as plate (Lamb waves) or surface waves (Rayleigh waves) for direct material interrogation that can be performed over long range and on geometrically complex components. Signal processing such as Wavelet analysis of recorded signals from a single test enables assessments of the material condition. Experimental results demonstrate that such testing techniques can perform the inspection from only one side of the structure and have potential to estimate elastic modulai of the material. Such ultrasonic sensing configurations make nondestructive test technology feasible to support structural integrity, assessment and life service inspections of metal, bonded or composite based structures.

The ultrasonic signals measured on these materials contain echoes which are very similar to fault echo. These echoes arise from grains which are contained in material. For detection of flaw various methods for suppressing of echoes from grains have to be used. In this work we used the method for filtering of ultrasonic signal based on discrete wavelet transform. For classification of ultrasonic signals in A-scan we used pattern recognition method called support vector machines. In this study we classify signals with fault echo, echo from weld and back-wall echo. Ultrasonic signals were measured on material used for constructing airplane engines. The experimental results indicate the performance of the proposed approach.

Various mechanical defects of rotary machines can be reflected in altered acoustic signatures. Such phenomena can be often perceived by skilled human operators who can also explain the type of defect merely based oil slightly changed acoustic signature. The proposed method is based on psychoacoustic modeling of human auditory perception. For the purpose of machine fault detection, the gammatone filterbank is applied in preprocessing of acoustic signals. Filtered signals are their rectified, and features are calculated as mean values of rectified signals. A set of features represents oil extracted machine signature. In order to evaluate the current machine state, extracted features are compared to the database of normal machine states. if values of the extracted features exceed statistically determined upper and lower margins, a possible machine fault is indicated. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study, where the quality of commercially produced compressors is predicted. Compressor states are estimated based oil acoustic emission during operation, and features are extracted by psychoacoustic filtering as described above. Results show that major faults, that occur in a production, can be reliably detected.

The anomaly detection algorithm relies on symbolic time series analysis and is built upon concepts from automata theory, information theory, and pattern recognition. Early detection of slow time-scale anomalous behavior is achieved by observing time series data at the fast time-scale of machine operation.

In the centralized scheme, the information from several sources is combined to construct an input space. In the distributed schemes, the input space is constructed corresponding to each information source and the multi-class support vector machine is used for modeling each source. The distributed data fusion strategies are applied to combine these multi-class support vector machine models. It is taken into account that a SVM classifier realizes classification by finding the optimal classification hyperplane with maximal margin. The proposed methods are demonstrated with the fault diagnosis of a diesel engine. The experimental results show that most of the proposed approaches can largely improve the diagnostic accuracy. The robustness of diagnosis is also improved.

The MPSVM is designed by mapping the outputs of standard support vector machines into a calibrated posterior probability using a learned sigmoid function, and then combining these learned probability support vector machines. The Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is used to combine these learned MPSVMs. Two schemes of combination are composed. One of the schemes takes into account the prior information. Our proposed method is applied to the fault diagnosis of a diesel engine. The experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis can be improved significantly.

The proposed scheme consists of three main components including principal component analysis (PCA), hidden Markov model (HMM), and an adaptive stochastic fault prediction model. The principal signal features extracted by PCA are utilized by HMM to generate a component health/degradation index, which is the input to an adaptive prognostics component for on-line remaining useful life prediction. The effectiveness of the scheme is shown by simulation studies using experimental vibration data obtained from a bearing health monitoring testbed.

Our framework consist of two phases: an approximated diagnosis on the first phase and a refined diagnosis on the second phase. On the first phase the system behavior is modelled with a Dynamic Bayesian Network that generates a subset of most likely faulty components. In this phase the structure and parameters of the Dynamic Bayesian Network are learned off-line from raw data (discrete and continuous). On the second phase a Particle Filter algorithm is used to monitor suspicious components and extract the faulty components. The feasibility of this approach has been tested in a simulation environment using several interconnected electrical machines.

A general framework is adopted, in which a fuzzification module is linked to an inference module that is actually a neural network adapted to the recognition of the dynamic evolution of process variables and related faults. Process data is fuzzified in order to reason rather on qualitative than on quantitative values. The fuzzified attributes feed the neural network. Two different network topologies are tested over data simulated by a commissioned simulator of a nuclear reactor: a feed-forward topology and a recurrent topology, where the additional network inputs are considered as delayed activation of output units. The later approach shows better generalization performance for the detection and isolation of a number of security related faults.

We present specific results from MWM-Array fatigue monitoring demonstrations, temperature measurement and dynamic stress monitoring, along with IDED methods for age degradation monitoring. We also describe the use of such sensor networks as part of an ADT framework, as well as for generation of real damage standards (e.g., real cracks without starter notches), and for prognostics model validation.

The basic method is introduced in detail. The energy spectrum is applied in the research of the faults diagnosis for the ball bearing of machine tool. Firstly, the analyzed vibration signals are separated into a series of intrinsic mode function using the empirical mode decomposition. Then, the energy spectrum is applied to the intrinsic mode function. The experimental results show that this method based on Hilbert-Huang transformation and energy spectrum can effectively diagnosis the faults of the ball bearing.

These methods represent important characteristics of a signal in both time and frequency domain. In this way, essential features of the signal can be viewed and analyzed in order to understand or model the faults characteristics. Historically, Fourier spectral analyses have provided a general approach for monitoring the global energy/frequency distribution. However, an assumption inherent to this method is the stationary and linear of the signal. As a result, Fourier methods are not generally an appropriate approach in the investigation of faults signals with transient components. This work presents the application of a new signal processing technique, empirical mode decomposition and the Hilbert spectrum, in analysis of vibration signals and gear faults diagnosis for a machine tool. The results show that this method may provide not only an increase in the spectral resolution but also reliability for the gear faults diagnosis.

Enhanced independent component analysis (EICA), which has enhanced generalization performance, operates in a reduced principal component analysis (PCA) space. SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm, which is rooted in statistical learning theory, SVM has demonstrated high generalization capabilities in many pattern recognition problems. In this paper, we integrate EICA with SVM and apply this new method to the leak detection problem in oil pipelines. In features extraction, EICA produces EICA features of the original pressure images. In classification, SVM classified the EICA features as leak or non-leak. The test results based on real data indicate that the method can detect many leak faults from a pressure curve, and reduce the ratio of false and missing alarm than conventional methods.

The method of basic probability assignment is proposed according to the probabilistic output and performance of the PSVM. The outputs of all the binary-class PSVMs comprising an MPSVM are represented in the frame of Dempster-Shafer theory. A Dempster-Shafer theory based multi-class SVM (DSMSVM) is constructed by using the combination rule of evidences. To deal with the distributed multi-source multi-class problem, the DSMSVM is trained corresponding to each information source, and then the Dempster-Shafer theory is used to combine these learned DSMSVMs. Our proposed method is applied to fault diagnosis of a diesel engine. The experimental results show that the accuracy and robustness of fault diagnosis can be improved by using our proposed approach.

When all variables are collected for fault diagnosis, it results in poor fault classification because there are too many irrelevant variables, which also increase the dimensions of data. A novel optimization algorithm, based on a modified binary Particle Swarm Optimization with mutation (MBPSOM) combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is proposed to select the fault feature variables for fault diagnosis. The simulations on Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) show the BMPSOM can effectively escape from local optima to find the global optimal value comparing with initial modified binary PSO (MBPSO). And based on fault feature selection, more satisfied performances of fault diagnosis are achieved.

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and gradient descent algorithm (GD), and is thus called HGDPSO. The Particle Swarm Optimizer has previously been used to train neural networks and generally met with success. The advantage of the PSO over many of the other optimization algorithms is its relative simplicity and quick convergence. But those particles collapse so quickly that it exits a potentially dangerous property: stagnation, which state would make it impossible to arrive at the global optimum, even a local optimum. HGDPSO was proposed for neural network training to avoid premature and eliminate stagnation in PSO. The effectiveness of the HGDPSO based WNN is demonstrated through the classification of the fault signals in rotating machinery. The simulated results show its feasibility and validity.

This paper presents a study that uses self-organizing maps to realize feature selection and reduce dimensionality of the raw feature space for machine faults classification. By means of evaluating the responses of every dimensional feature in SOM networks neurons weights to the input data, the feature sets having the main responses and being sensitive to pattern recognition are selected. Industrial gearbox vibration signals measured under different operating conditions are analyzed using the method. The experimental results indicate that the method selects sensitive feature sets effectively for gear faults classification and recognition, and has a good potential for application in practice.

In this method, firstly, relationships between the fault causations and fault symptoms are established by fuzzy logics. Then the Rough Set Theory (RST) is applied to obtain a minimal sufficient subset of features, which is helpful to simplify the structure of neural network. Next, the 2-dimension output mapping of the standard fault samples (training samples) is obtained by a self-organizing neural network. Finally, we input some simulation samples (testing samples) and gain the reasonable conclusions by comparison between the two output mappings. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method and its nice prospect of applying to rotating machinery fault diagnosis.

This information is usually obtained from a resolver or encoder. If this sensor fails, the drives ceases working although the machine is still fine. For applications where fault-tolerance is more important than high precision, the described combination of an encoder with the INFORM system offers an elegant solution. After an introduction to the INFORM system, the control scheme is presented. It shows how the two position acquisition systems are connected. Test results show the applicabilty of this system.

In the immunotronic system, the generation of tolerance conditions corresponds to the generation of antibodies in the biological immune system. In this paper, the principle of antibody diversity, one of the most important concepts in the biological immune system, is employed and it is realized through symbiotic evolution. Symbiotic evolution imitates the generation of antibodies in the biological immune system more than the standard genetic algorithm(SCA) does. It is demonstrated that the suggested method outperforms the previous immunotronic methods with less running time. The suggested method is applied to fault detection in a decade counter (typical example of finite state machines) and MCNC finite state machines and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the computer simulation.

The aim of this architecture is to research, develop and test advanced diagnostic and decision support tools for maintenance of complex machinery. Artificial Intelligence based diagnostic approach has been proposed with particular reference to Dynamic Case-Based Reasoning (DCBR). This system refines an asynchronous stream of symptom and repair actions into a compound case structure and efficiently organizes the relevant information into the case memory. Diagnosis is carried out into two steps for fast and efficient solution generation. First the situation is analyzed based on observed symptoms (textual descriptions) to propose initial diagnosis and generate corresponding explanation hypothesis. Next, based on the generated hypothesis relevant sensor data is collected and corresponding data analysis modules are activated for data-driven diagnosis. This approach reduces the computational demands to enable fast experience transfer and more reliable and informed testing. This system also tracks the success rates of all possible hypotheses for a given diagnosis and ranks them based on statistical evaluation criteria to improve the efficiency of future situations. Since the system can interact with multiple vehicles it learns about several operating environments resulting in a rich accumulation of experiences in relatively very short time. A distributed and generic architecture of this system is outlined from technical implementation point of view which can be used for widespread applications where both qualitative and quantitative observations can be gathered. Further, a concept of expanding this architecture for carrying out prognostic tasks is introduced.

Multiresolution nanoscale sensor-based circuit board testing	AUTOTESTCON 2005	IEEE Autotestcon		English	Proceedings Paper	AUTOTESTCON 2005 Conference	SEP 26-29, 2005	Orlando, FL	IEEE				This paper describes a novel approach to printed circuit board testing capable of providing unprecedented failure detection and prognostic capabilities. In contrast to today's bulky automatic test equipment (ATE) and expensive test program sets (TPSs) that perform simple parametric testing, this approach utilizes nanoscale sensor technology in conjunction with novel molecular electronics-based computational capabilities to sense the physical and chemical bi-products of electronic component degradation and failure directly at the circuit board itself, combined with terahertz sensing to localize defect parameters within the circuit board and electronic components. This approach lends itself to the detection and prediction of entire classes of anomalies, degraded performance, and failures that are not capable of being detected using the latest state-of-the-art ATE or other test equipment performing end-to-end diagnostic testing of individual signal parameters. This greater performance comes with a price tag that is smaller in non-recurring development and recurring maintenance costs.

Recent changes in weapons platform acquisition and support requirements has spurred renewed interest in electronics PHM, revealing possible applications, accessible data sources, and previously unexplored predictive techniques. The approach, development, and validation of electronic prognostics for a radio frequency (RF) system are discussed in this paper. Conventional PHM concepts are refined to develop a three-tier failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA). The proposed method identifies prognostic features by performing device, circuit, and system-level modeling. Accelerated failure testing validates the identified diagnostic features. The results of the accelerated failure tests accurately predict the remaining useful life of a COTS GPS receiver to within 5 thermal cycles.

One can use these comprehensive snapshots of biological activity to infer regulatory pathways in cells, identify novel targets for drug design, and improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning for those suffering from disease. However, the amount of data this new technology produces is more than one can manually analyze. Hence, the need for automated analysis of microarray data offers an opportunity for machine learning to have a significant impact on biology and medicine. Probabilistic Principal Surfaces defines a unified theoretical framework for nonlinear latent variable models embracing the Generative Topographic Mapping as a special case. This article describes the use of PPS for the analysis of yeast gene expression levels from microarray chips showing its effectiveness for high-D data visualization and clustering.

Central to the goal of designing and evaluating prognostic and control systems for enterprise computing platforms is first the ability to simulate telemetric signals and computer system degradation events with real-time models in an interactive computer environment. This paper describes the development and implementation of a Telemetric Parameter Simulation System (TPSS) that employs Fourier-based decomposition and reconstruction methodology with the capability to efficiently decompose any signals into their deterministic and stochastic components, then reconstruct new, simulated signals that possess exactly the same statistical noise idiosyncrasies as the original telemetry variables. The TPSS has become an indispensable tool in Sun's ongoing development of innovative diagnostic techniques for telemetry operability surveillance and other electronic prognostic applications in enterprise in Sun's present and future computer platforms.

An important objective of many autonomic systems used for proactive fault monitoring is to detect and quantify trends in the monitored health metrics over time. These trends can signify the onset or incipience of symptoms of potential problems, allowing corrective action to be taken automatically well before these problems lead to more catastrophic consequences. The challenge for detecting trends in signals is compounded by the fact that many high end enterprise computer servers in the marketplace today use 8-bit sample-and-hold analog-to-digital (A/D) converters for almost all physical transducers throughout the system. This results in the signal values being severely quantized. A drift detector module for computer systems with quantized signals has been developed that uses the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT), which provides early annunciation of the onset of degradation in noisy process variables that are supposed to be stationary with time, which includes very many voltage signals inside computer servers. The SPRT has been selected for drift detection because it has quantitative bounds on the false alarm and missed alarm probabilities, thereby allowing formal reliability analysis to be per-formed on a monitoring system that uses the SPRT. In this paper, we use large-scale Monte Carlo simulation to fine tune the drift detector sensitivity parameters and to quantitatively evaluate sensitivity in terms of three important criteria: maximum time-to-annunciation for subtle anomalies, false alarm probability and missed alarm probability. Values of these important model performance metrics are assessed over a wide range of independent variables for the SPRT. We also test a variation of the SPRT-based drift detector for a new and improved sampling technique to mitigate quantization effects in signal values. The results from the simulation studies help us in determining the detector performance improvement for the new sampling technique. The Monte Carlo simulation engine presented here has become a critical component in the on-going 247 development of electronic prognostic systems at Sun for real-time surveillance, proactive fault detection, and automatic diagnosis of high-end computer systems.

To support this new role, the maintenance concept has undergone through several major developments to lead to proactive considerations mainly based on prognosis process allowing normally to select the best maintenance action to carry out. In this paper the extension of a prognosis process by means of the integration of maintenance alternative impacts is proposed. The deployment of this extended prognosis process follows a methodology based both on probabilistic and event approaches. The feasibility and added value of this new prognosis is experimented on the manufacturing TELMA platform supporting the unwinding of metal bobbins.

In the first place an auto-associative neural network (AANN) is used to obtain the relationship among the TSA signals from several channels. During training the AANN is used to map a data vector with itself so in this way the net provides practically the same output that arrives at the input and the non-linear relationship between channels is embedded in net weights and bias. In order to avoid a direct mapping between input and output, one of the hidden layers must have a lower dimension than the input vector. Once the AANN is trained it is used with new data registers as a linear prediction error filter. If the new register contains the same data structure as the training set the prediction error will be lower and the machine is working properly. Otherwise, when the new register differs from the training set, as a consequence of a fault, prediction error will be increased in each channel. At the end the product of the error signal derivative for each channel is calculated using the resulting vector for detection and diagnostic purposes. The possibility of generalizing the net prediction capabilities using a training data set which contains several load cases is also explored. The technique is validated using experimental data taken on a laboratory gear set simulating several faults. An example is presented in order to show the advantages of the application of the proposed procedure comparing it with the most traditional gear processing tools based on TSA as residual and regular signals.

However, conventional methods have to work with explicit motor models and cannot be used for vibration signal case because of their non-adaptation and the random nature of vibration signal. In this paper, a neural network method is developed for induction machine fault detection, using FFT. The neural network model is trained with vibration spectra and faults are detected from changes in the expectation of vibration spectra modeling error. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach in detecting a wide range of mechanical faults is demonstrated through staged motor faults, and it is shown that a robust and reliable induction machine fault detection system has been produced.

In addition, more maintenance funds are directed to rotating apparatus, such as electrical generators, process drives, compressors and supporting motors. This is necessary due to the added wear associated with rotating machinery versus stationary electrical distribution equipment. The need for maintenance on electrical distribution equipment, such as air and liquid-filled power distribution transformers, low and medium voltage circuit breakers, starters and motor-control centers still exists, but is subject to greater cost constraints within all facilities. A new approach, termed performance based maintenance, can utilize past and ongoing equipment maintenance records to prioritize electrical distribution equipment with greater detail. This allows for applying maintenance dollars to the electrical distribution equipment with the greatest need for maintenance, and also redirecting limited funds to more effective predictive practices or capital improvements.

The focus is on generators rated in the 10 MW to 100 MW range, manufactured in the 1950's and 1960's. Many of these machines are at or near the end of their life, and they should be reconditioned to provide additional extended service.

Insulation condition indicators such as capacitance, dissipation factor (tan delta), and AC insulation resistance are calculated on-line based on the differential leakage current measurements for each phase. A model for a 3 phase AC machine insulation system is derived and analyzed for both off-line and on-line testing. Guidelines for interpreting the measured indicators for determining the 1) overall condition and 2) significant degradation for the individual GW and PP insulation for each phase of the stator are given based on the analysis. Experimental results on a 15hp induction motor under intentional GW and PP insulation degradation conditions show that incipient insulation degradation can be detected and classified with high sensitivity.

The machine stator current can be analysed to observe the side-band harmonics around the fundamental frequency. In this case, it is necessary to take a very long data sequence to get high frequency resolution. This is not always possible due to the hardware and software limitations. The proposed algorithm can be considered for solving high frequency resolution problem without increasing the initial data acquisition size. The ZFFTA is applied to detect incipient rotor fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine by using both stator current and stray flux sensors.

Actuators in the aerospace and transportation industries are examples of this kind of operation. Diagnostics of faults in such applications is, however, challenging. A novel method using windowed Fourier ridges is proposed in this paper for the detection of rotor faults in BLDC motors operating under continuous non-stationarity. Experimental results are presented to validate the concept and depict the ability of the proposed algorithm to track and identify rotor faults. The proposed algorithm is simple and can be implemented in real-time without much computational burden.

Electrical faults cause asymmetries in the phase impedances, producing a zero sequence voltage in wye-connected machines and a zero sequence current in delta-connected machines. The proposed measurement method identifies these well defined components in the zero sequence voltage/current and uses them to provide reliable information on the condition of the machine, with low sensitivity to the load level of the machine or variations in the phase voltage. The method can be used for the diagnosis of stator winding faults and broken rotor bars, and is valid both for line-connected and inverter-fed machines.

Kurtosis is a measure of the impulsiveness of a signal, and spectral kurtosis (SK) gives an indication of how the kurtosis (of a bandpass filtered signal) varies with frequency. This not only gives an indication of the frequency bands to be processed, but can also be used to generate a filter to extract the most impulsive part of a signal. The first step in calculating SK is to perform a time/frequency decomposition of the signal, and then calculate the kurtosis for each frequency line. The paper compares the original STFT (short time Fourier transform) with wavelet analysis for the time/frequency decomposition, and for determining the optimum combination of centre frequency and bandwidth for maximizing the SK. The paper also describes how the SK can be enhanced by "prewhitening" the signal using an autoregressive (AR) model, this sometimes revealing an incipient fault. at a much earlier stage.

Modulation and non-stationarity existing in the signal generated by a faulty gearbox present challenges to effective fault detection. Hilbert transform has the ability to address the modulation issue. This paper outlines a novel fault detection method called Hilbert & TT-transform (HTT-transform) which combines Hilbert transform and TT-transform obtained from the inverse Fourier transform of the S-transform. The principle of the proposed method is to analyze the modulating signal created by a faulty gear using a time-time representation. The method has the advantage of providing a new way of localizing the time features of the modulating signal around a particular point on the time axis through scaled windows. It is verified with simulated signals and real gearbox vibration signals. The results obtained by CWT, S-transform, TT-transform, and HTT-transform are compared. They show that utilizing the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of gearbox fault detection.

The data mining technique described in this paper was used for steam turbine fault diagnostics based on continuous data measurements. The classification rules are based on standardized vibration frequency data for steam turbines and field experts' analyses of turbine vibration problems. The expert knowledge enables the steam turbine fault diagnosis system to be more powerful and accurate. The system can identify twenty types of standard steam turbine faults. The system was developed using 2000 simulated data sets. The data mining methods were then used to identify 20 explicit rules for the turbine faults. The method was also used with actual power plant data to successfully diagnose real faults. The results indicate that data mining can be effectively applied to diagnosis of rotating machinery by giving useful rules to interpret the data.

The method consists of two stages. In the first stage, intrinsic mode components are obtained with EMD from original signals and converted into fuzzy feature vectors, and then the mechanical fault can be detected. In the second stage, these extracted fuzzy feature vectors are input into the multi-classification SVM to identify the different abnormal cases. The proposed method is applied to the classification of a turbo-generator set under three different operating conditions. Testing results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed model is greatly improved compared with the multi-classification SVM without feature extraction and the multi-classification SVM with extracting the fuzzy feature from wavelet packets, and the faults of steam turbo-generator set can be correctly and rapidly diagnosed using this model.

In this paper, a method based on genetic algorithms to detect the rubbing location is presented. The finite element model of the rubbing rotor is established with the rubbing location, the stator stiffness, the clearance between stator and rotor, the damping coefficient and the friction coefficient as the fault parameters, and the rubbing location determination is transferred into the parameter identification problem. The genetic algorithm is then utilized to search the solution. Using genetic algorithms avoids some of the weaknesses of traditional parameter identification methods such as local minimum problem in nonlinear system identification. The experimental results suggest that the rubbing location can be effectively determined when the rubbing occurs.

But in some cases the equivalent loads smeared over many nodes, and make it hard to identify accurate fault location and transient fault force. In this paper, the fault location is identified using least squares fitting approach by the system's vibration shape when the fault signal is periodic or quasi-periodic. And after the fault location is ascertained, the transient fault forces can be identified by transient residual vibration using simple matrix multiplications and additions. Numerical simulations and experiment on rotor to stator rub are used to test the method, which proved the efficiency of the method.

At the moment the alarm is sounded, it's sometimes too late to prevent the failure. There is no alert provided that looks at degradation over time. If we could monitor degradation, then we would forecast upcoming situations, and perform maintenance tasks when necessary. In our research we chose to focus on intelligent maintenance system, which is defined as the prediction and forecast of equipment performance. Predictive maintenance, on the other hand, focuses on machine performance features. Data come from two sources: sensors mounted on the machine to gather the machine feature information, and information from the entire manufacturing system, including machine productivity, past history and trending. By correlating data from these sources - current and historical - predictions can be made about future performance. In this article case study of coal mining machinery health prediction is presented. Health of water pumping unit was considered. Such units placed in old mine shafts are crucial to avoid flooding working ones. As an effect of predictive maintenance it can be possible to improve safety and reduce costs incurred from accidents.

When all variables are collected for fault diagnosis, it results in poor fault classification because there are too many irrelevant variables, which also increase the dimensions of data. A novel optimization algorithm, based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Tabu search (TS) combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is proposed to select the fault feature variables for fault diagnosis.

It is necessary to identify domains of equipment and decide which maintenance policy suits each domain of equipment. Usually, it is assumed that maintenance managers are capable of achieving this job. This assumption however is practical, relies on the human factor, which as known to humans, could involve mistakes and hence may lead to implementing the wrong maintenance strategies. Money losses would eventually result. This paper presents a tool that deals with equipment as machine parts domains, where the domain is the group of the similar machine parts which undergo the same conditions. The suggested tool consists of a dual criteria categorisation grid, which through historical data, experts' knowledge and mathematical formulation selects the most suitable maintenance policy for each machine part (domain) individually. The implementation of this tool should guarantee the execution of the appropriate maintenance policy with each and every machine part; therefore it should result in a more economical production function and a more efficient maintenance function. Examples from industry are given to further clarify the proposed tool applications.

The technique uses existing machine signals namely; spindle speed and spindle load for the purpose of data acquisition, analysis and decision making thus avoiding the use of any additional sensors. The paper discusses the evolution of this time domain technique, starting from signal acquisition, hardware filtering, the application of moving average for software filtering before going on to explore the signal's variations for different tool conditions. The acquired data is analysed in terms of the energy per tooth. The strength of an energy index in the acquired signals under various cutting conditions can then be used for fault diagnosis and prognosis. The software and hardware system architectures and the test application on a Kondia B500 vertical axis milling machine are described.

Specifically, bearing diagnostics have seen an extensive research in the field of fault detection and diagnosis. In this paper we present two automatic diagnosis procedures -a fuzzy classifier and a neural network which deal with different implementation questions: the use of a priori knowledge, the computation cost, and the decision making process. The challenge is not only to be capable of diagnosing automatically but also to generalize the process regardless of the measured signals. Two actions are taken in order to achieve some kind of generalization of the application target: the use of normalized signals and the study of Basis Pursuit feature extraction procedure.

The prediction of each unit's remaining life is based on the identification of "peer" units, i.e. vehicles with similar utilization and maintenance records that are expected to behave similarly to the unit under consideration. With these peers, we construct local predictive models to estimate the unit's remaining life. We use evolutionary algorithms (EA's) to develop the criteria for defining peers and the relevance of each criterion in evaluating similarity with the unit. Each individual in the EA's population fully characterizes an instance-based fuzzy model that is used to predict the unit, s remaining fife. The precision of the selection of units with best-expected life provides the fitness value. We analyzed the performance of the evolutionary approach over two years of operation and maintenance data for a fleet of 1100 locomotives. The results illustrate the high accuracy and robustness of this approach. In the conclusion, we highlight the implications of this approach for supporting the lifecycle of the fuzzy models.

Due to the observation of sharp interfaces on which biochemical degradation of the contaminants takes place, a, reliable and accurate prognosis requires high spatial resolution of the considered subsurface domain and/or the application of higher order discretization methods. A successfull realization of these simulations can only be provided by parallel computer systems with high computing power and memory availability.

It is difficult for system to obtain a complete list of all possible anomalous situations in large and complex system. In this paper, a new method of fault diagnosis in system operations is proposed, which is based on the immune evolutionary algorithm. The immune-based fault diagnosis system is able to recognize and response the new fault that never occurs before. The structure uses learning, memory, and associative retrieval to solve pattern recognition problems. It is applied to fault diagnosis for machinery. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms are feasible and promising for fault diagnosis.

In most conditions, normal signals are acquired easily but fault samples are difficult to be gained. Because of lacking enough fault samples, the machine diagnosis meets difficulties. Support vector data description (SVDD) is a single classifier and it can distinguish the normal and fault condition just using normal samples. In this paper we first describe the basic algorithm of SVDD. The statistical index of vibration signals of bearings are used as the input of SVDD classifier. In order to select the most efficient parameter for classification, genetic algorithm is used to optimize the available input parameters and the parameters of SVDD. Through this method, we got high classification to recognize the condition monitoring of bearings.. Compared neural network (ANN) with SVDD, the experiment result represents that in the environment which lacks of enough fault samples condition monitoring, SVDD has better classification than ANN.

To overcome these shortfalls and exploit advantages of different approaches, an integration of different methods or hybrid schemes are highly recommended. With the latest development in Internet and Intranet technologies, especially with the development of the Grid computing, it is now possible to provide different algorithms as individual services and combine these services dynamically to generate a 'virtual organization' for fault diagnostic purposes. Therefore, the main idea of this paper is to build an integrated fault diagnosis system on the computational grid structure and the preliminary implementation of this integration for the complex electromechanical equipments fault diagnosis is discussed.

Therefore, the diagnostic technology of this type of machine is mainly considered and proposed from industry and scientist academia. Several studies show that approximately 30-40% of induction machine faults are stator faults. The fault diagnosis of electrical machines has progressed in recent years from traditional to artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This paper presents a general review of the principle of AI-based diagnostic methods first. It covers the recent development and the system structure, about expert system (ES), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic system (FLS), and combined structure, like Neural-Fuzzy, based fault diagnostic strategies. Finally, a Neural-Fuzzy technique is used in this paper to perform the stator fault diagnosis for induction machine. The simulation results verified the technique proposed.

Safety, reliability, efficiency and performance are some of the major concerns of induction motor applications. Due to high reliability requirements, and cost of breakdown, the issue of condition monitoring of induction motors and diagnosis is of increasing importance. For these reasons, there has been a continually increasing interest and investigations into the fault detection and diagnosis of induction motors. This paper describes the utility of online monitoring technique for detection of various faults that can be applied to existing motors without dismantling or shut down. The technique presented here is based on the monitoring of the current when the machine is normally operated and analyzing the same in frequency domain for detection of the faults. The technique can detect online the presence of various faults such as broken bar in the rotor cage of induction motor, Bearing faults, Eccentricity faults and stator turn to turn short, by monitoring and analyzing the line current. These different faults within induction motor are simulated in the laboratory and they are detected by online monitoring of current and analyzing same in frequency domain.

These two faults usually occur simultaneously, since most installed induction motors have a small inherent eccentricity. In this paper a detailed investigation of the possibilities for Induction Motor Fault Diagnosis based on Wavelet analysis of the Current Space Vector is provided. The main objective is to formulate a method for enhanced diagnosis of broken rotor bars in induction motors by applying wavelet analysis to the motor current space vector. To this purpose, a detailed wavelet analysis of stator current space vector is implemented. The analysis is at first performed through simulation of a faulty asynchronous machine in Matlab-Simulink. Subsequent to the simulation results analysis, experimental tests were conducted. Characteristic results are presented and briefly discussed.

The cage motor rotor winding fault characteristic is affected by speed fluctuation and load inertia, thus the accuracy of the fault diagnosis is reduced. The fault of rotor winding leads to rotor's speed fluctuation with double slip frequency, this fluctuation decreases the magnitude of the left sideband, causing the underestimate of fault degree. The degree of this kind of affection is also closely related to the load inertia. Through utilizing the measured value of (1+2s)f1, correction of rotor winding fault characteristic can be performed and the actual value of the fault characteristic can be obtained. This kind correction not only basically eliminates the impact of speed fluctuation on the fault characteristic but also helps to minimize the impact from load inertia, thus it contributes to enhance the accuracy of fault diagnosis of machine's rotor winding.

But it is difficult to detect the fault signals due to the faintness of the fault signals and the background noise for the low speed machine. The properties of the SW and its transmission law in the large-scale wind turbine were studied in this paper. Firstly, the three-diniension contact model of the bearing was set tip. The defects which occurred on the outer race and the inner race were simulated in the model. According to the model, the stress, the strain and the contact stress distribution was computed. Then, the stress and strain distribution law and the contact stress distribution law of the interface on good and fault bearing were compared. In the real-world testing, fault signals were acquired using stress wave transducer. Fault characteristic parameters were extracted and the background noise was reduced using wavelet analysis. Both simulation and real-world testing result obtained indicate that SW and wavelet transform can be the effective method in the fault diagnosis of large-scale wind turbine bearing.

The fault characteristic torque frequency variation during the startup can be extracted using the wavelet ridge, which can be used to identify rotor broken bars fault. The wavelet coefficients modulus indicate the signal energy of the corresponding scale, so the wavelet coefficients modulus of the fault characteristic ridge will give us the magnitude variation law of the fault characteristic torque. According to these, the wavelet ridge energy spectrum is defined. Using the wavelet ridge energy spectrum of the fault characteristic torque as the fault severity index, the number of adjacent broken rotor bars can thus be given. Experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed fault diagnosis method.

However, fault detection using analytical method is not always possible because it requires perfect knowledge of a process model. A neural network based expert system was proposed for diagnostic problems of the induction motors using vibration analysis. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) was used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals, and the neural network was trained and tested using the vibration spectra. The efficiency of the developed neural network expert system was evaluated. The obtained results lead to a conclusion that neural network expert system can be developed based on vibration measurements acquired on-line from the machine.

But RSW suffers from a major problem of inconsistent quality from weld to weld. The major problem is the complexity of the basic process that may involve material coatings, electrode force, electrode wear, fit up, etc. Therefore weld quality assurance 14 is still a big challenge and goal. Electrode displacement has proved to be a particularly useful signal which correlates well with weld quality. This paper introduces a novel auto-body spot weld quality monitoring system which uses electrode displacement as the quality parameter. This system chooses the latest laser displacement sensor with high resolution to measure the real-time electrode displacement.

However, there are many undesirable problems arising in the machine operation of industrial plants. It is desirable for early detection and diagnosis of incipient faults for online condition monitoring, product quality assurance, and improved operational efficiency of induction motors. In this paper, a high-performance residual-based novel method is developed for induction machine fault detection, using Fourier-based signal processing for steady-state vibration signals. The proposed approach uses only motor vibration measurements without the nameplate information. The reference model in spectra is obtained statistically to represent the healthy condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting a wide range of mechanical and electrical faults is demonstrated through staged motor faults, and it is shown that a robust and reliable induction machine fault detection system has been produced.

The sum of the amplitudes of these two components can be used as a reliable diagnostic index. A further step is the quantification of the fault severity, ie. the definition of an asymmetry factor, able to link the diagnostic index to the number of contiguous broken bars. The quantification of the fault severity is a key item, that is not yet fully established Several machine models were used to this aim: dynamic deep models for faulty cage machines, like mesh rotor models, d-q or symmetrical instantaneous components models. The latter is preferred as it requires a lower number of parameters. Moreover if system constraints don't allow speed ripple as a consequence of the torque unbalance due to rotor asymmetry, only the component at frequency (1-2s)f appears and steady-state forward-backward models can be used in order to compute this component. In this case analytical relationships can be developed under suitable assumptions. A simple asymmetry factor may be the definition of an equivalent additional resistance Delta R, linked to the number of contiguous broken bars. In this paper some proposals reported in the literature about the quantization of Delta R, or about the diagnostic index are reviewed and compared with reference to the case of one broken bar. Experiments prove the effectiveness of the authors' proposal.

Likewise, signal injection on induction machines is a well-known technique on sensorless; motor control fields to find out the rotor's position. Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA) is the most widely used method for identifying faults in Induction Motors. MCSA focuses its efforts on the spectral analysis of stator current. Motor faults such as broken rotor bars, bearing damage and eccentricity of the rotor axis can be detected. However, the method presents some problems at low speed and low torque, mainly due to the proximity between the frequencies to be detected and the small amplitude of the resulting harmonies respectively. In both cases, the problem of frequency accuracy is very tricky since the sideband harmonic is close to the fundamental harmonic. This paper proposes injecting an additional voltage into the machine under test at a frequency different from the fundamental one, and then studying the resulting harmonics around the new frequencies appearing due to the composition between injected and main frequencies.

Low frequency and high frequency characteristic side-band harmonics are usually monitored in the stator current spectrum to detect the existence of air-gap eccentricities. However, in these techniques, only a single phase stator current spectrum is analyzed even though all three phase supply currents are usually available in the motor control center. In this paper, for the first time, the negative sequence components in supply currents due to the presence of a static eccentricity are proposed as a fault indicator. This paper also proposes a new technique to separate the negative sequence components from their positive sequence counterparts using qd-axis current spectra in a newly selected rotating reference frame. Analysis shows that in this way the oscillating load torque effect can be completely eliminated from the eccentricity effect. Based on an elementary, 2-pole, 3-phase induction motor model with sinusoidal winding distributions, all motor inductances are analytically derived and analyzed. Simulation and experimental results validate the existence of negative sequence fundamental component in supply currents resulting from a static air-cap eccentricity. The variation of magnitudes and phase angles associated with these negative sequence components are also investigated. By monitoring the magnitude of negative sequence components, one could determine the degree of static eccentricity in the presence of a mixed eccentricity. Therefore, the capability and reliability of online condition monitoring or induction machines are improved.

Numerous cases of faults diagnosis and prognosis solutions show that, for a complex machine like a WMR, model-based methods that utilize analytical models of the system are desirable because analytical models can well represent the nominal behaviours of the system. On the other hand, data-driven methods are not practical for WMRs since they require a lot of failure cases and data that are too costly, if possible at all, to obtain. Fault prognosis for a system in general and for WMRs in particular is still at the preliminary stage. System models can also be used to predict the remaining useful life of the system.

Several frequency estimation techniques have been developed and are used to help the induction machine fault detection and diagnosis and it is still necessary to test new methods. This paper presents a technique to improve the diagnosis by using the well known MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) method. This method is a powerful tool extracting meaningful frequencies from the signal and it has been largely used in different areas included electrical machines, In this application, fault sensitive frequencies have to be found in both the stator current and the stray flux signatures. They are often numerous in a given frequency range and they are affected by the signal-to-noise ratio. Then, the MUSIC method takes a long computation time to rind more frequencies by increasing the order of the frequency signal dimension. To solve this problem, an algorithm based on zooming in a specific frequency range is proposed with MUSIC in order to improve the diagnosis performances to extract frequencies. The proposed method has been applied to detect incipient broken bar rotor fault in a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine.

To motivate this topic, experimental results are provided that illustrate how the act of removing and replacing test bearings drastically alters the machine vibration and stator current spectral characteristics. Based on this observation, a method is developed that employs an externally applied shaft current to initiate and progress a hearing fault in an accelerated timeframe. This experimental method begins with a new, undamaged bearing and progresses it throughout its entire lifecycle in situ. The test machine is a standard induction motor that can be interfaced with any load and operate at any arbitrary speed or load level throughout the bearing failure process. Data generated by this experimental method can then be used to evaluate the performance of various bearing condition monitoring schemes.

Unlike traditional fault tolerance schemes, which rely heavily-particularly for dynamic systems operating over extended time horizons-on the assumption that the error-correcting mechanism is fault free, we are interested in the case when all components of the implementation are fault prone. The paper starts with a paradigmatic fault tolerance scheme that systematically adds redundancy into a discrete-time dynamic system in a way that achieves tolerance to transient faults in both the state transition and the error-correcting mechanisms. By combining this methodology with low-complexity error-correcting coding, we then obtain an efficient way of providing fault tolerance to k identical unreliable LFSMs that operate in parallel on distinct input sequences. The overall construction requires only a constant amount of redundant hardware per machine (but sufficiently large k) to achieve an arbitrarily small probability of overall failure for any prespecified (finite) time interval, leading in this way to a lower bound on the computational capacity of unreliable LFSMs.	Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA		Hadjicostis, CN (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1406 W Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.

J	Saavedra, PN; Gonzalez, JA				Saavedra, PN; Gonzalez, JA			New revolution-order transform for analysing non-stationary vibrations	INSIGHT			English	Article							SIGNALS	Vibration analysis in all types of industry is an integral part of modern predictive maintenance programmes and fault diagnosis systems for rotating machinery. The basic technique on which they are based is the classical Fourier Transform approach, FFT However, for machinery operating in non-stationary conditions, with variable load and/or speed, the FFT approach is not directly applicable for analysis. Presently, two techniques are used: Order Tracking Spectral Analysis (OTSA) and Time-Frequency Transform (TFT). OTSA is used to avoid a spread of the spectral components of a spectrum obtained from variable speed machinery, however, it presents the disadvantage of averaging the amplitude of the spectral components during acquisition time. The TFT are three-dimensional functions that allow to visualise the frequency and amplitude variations of the spectral components. However, when the analysed vibration is composed of many spectral components and with large changes of the machine speed during measurement, they become very difficult to analyse. The present paper presents a new transform called Revolution-Order Transform, which uses the advantages of both OTSA and TFT techniques. Basically, the technique involves changing the signal sampled at constant time increments to a signal sampled at constant angular increments and then processes it using any TFT Both the classical and the new proposed method are evaluated and compared using simulated numerical signal and experimental data.

LDB selects a complete orthogonal basis from a wavelet packet library of bases, which best discriminates the given classes, based on their time-frequency energy maps. An appropriate normalization method in both data and wavelet coefficient domains, and a neural network classifier during the identification phase are used to enhance the classification. By applying LDB to a real-world machine data the accuracy of the algorithm in machine fault diagnosis and classification is shown.

This data holds the key to performing periodic maintenance on an as-needed basis, rather than on a schedule. Soft computing techniques such as neural networks can allow the engineer to use this data to detect the need for maintenance. This paper discusses useful tools to accomplish the above goal and describes the results of proof-of-principle experiments which prior to the receipt of actual data, which will eventually lead to prototype testing on the actual semiconductor fabrication systems.

Two algorithms of polynomial complexity in the number of states were proposed later for checking their diagnosability. In this paper, we present an algorithm of polynomial complexity in the number of nodes for computing a sufficient condition of diagnosability of discrete event systems modeled by Petri nets. In other words, our algorithm is more efficient than previous ones since no state enumeration is necessary. This gives us an advantage to solve large real-world problems. Our algorithm is formulated as a linear programming problem, which is well-known to be of polynomial complexity in the worst case. Examples are given in the paper to illustrate our approach.

In this paper, a new method of obtaining maintenance information has been proposed. By integrating traditional reliability modelling techniques with a real-time, online performance estimation model, machine reliability information such as hazard rate and mean time between failures can be calculated. Essentially, this paper presents an innovative method to synthesise low level information (such as vibration signals) with high level information (like reliability statistics) to form a rigorous theoretical base for better machine maintenance.

J	Dey, S; Stori, JA				Dey, S; Stori, JA			A Bayesian network approach to root cause diagnosis of process variations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						process monitoring; process diagnosis; fault diagnosis; Bayesian belief network	TOOL WEAR ESTIMATION; TIME-SERIES; FAILURE; IDENTIFICATION	This paper addresses the challenges inherent in root cause diagnosis of process variations in a production machining environment. We develop and present a process monitoring and diagnosis approach based on a Bayesian belief network for incorporating multiple process metrics from multiple sensor sources in sequential machining operations to identify the root cause of process variations and provide a probabilistic confidence level of the diagnosis. The vast majority of previous work in machining process monitoring has focused on single-operation tool wear monitoring. The focus of the present work is to develop a methodology for diagnosing the root cause of process variations that are often confounded in process monitoring systems, namely workpiece hardness, stock size, and tool wear variations. To achieve this goal, multiple sensor metrics have been identified with statistical correlations to the process faults of interest. Data from multiple sensors on sequential machining operations are then combined through a causal belief network framework to provide a probabilistic diagnosis of the root cause of the process variation.

In order to accurately extract the fault characteristic in stator-steady current, frequency subdivision is used to enhance the frequency resolution of the signal and self-adapting filtering is used to enhance the magnitude resolution of the signal. Particular frequency component in the starting current is used for fault diagnosis, this greatly simplify the fault diagnosing technique based on starting current and make it applicable. Residual voltage after AC dump of the stator winding is used for fault diagnosis, this can effectively eliminate the effects caused by unsymmetrical source, load fluctuation, and iron saturation. The application of all these techniques can effectively diagnose the incipient faults of high voltage induction machine. Finally this paper introduces the basic structure and the main performance of the realized high voltage machine fault diagnosis system.

The conclusions of the analysis are as the follows: the rotor winding faults will cause stator current, electromagnetic torque and rotating speed to fluctuate; their fluctuating frequencies are the same and their magnitude will increase with the rise of the severity of the faults; the load inertia has a big impact on the torque and speed fluctuation; with the increase of the inertia, the fluctuation of the torque will rise, while the corresponding speed fluctuation will decline obviously. Besides, this paper applies the fluctuating components of the torque and speed to the fault diagnosis of the machine's rotor winding.

Principal component analysis (PCA) has been successfully as a multivariate statistical process control tool for detecting faults in processes with highly correlated variables. PCA and other statistical techniques, however, have difficulties in differentiating faults correctly in complex chemical process. Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel approach based on statistical learning theory, which has emerged for feature identification and classification. In this paper, an integrated method is applied for process monitoring and fault diagnosis, which combines PCA for fault feature extraction and multiple SVMs (MSVMs) for identification of different fault sources. This approach is verified and illustrated on the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process as a case study. Results show that the proposed PCA-MSVMs method performs good diagnosis capability and overall diagnosis correctness rate.

This paper describes some steps taken towards this goal. Work currently carried out is focused on developing a generic machinery off-line intelligent diagnostic system based on vibration data. Here, neurofuzzy techniques are shown to be applicable for diagnosing common faults such as unbalance, misalignment and various types of bearing faults, with both single and multiple fault scenarios and in the presence of varying levels of noise.

Two-class classification classifies the given samples x to class 1 and class 2, but the object of one-class classification is classifying the given samples x to belonging to this class or not. In order to solve the problem of insufficient fault samples in intelligent monitoring and diagnosis for machinery, a new method of one-class classification of mechanical faults-support vector data description (SVDD) was proposed. With this method, the outlier objects can be distinguished from target objects if the information of the target class is available without knowing the outlier class. Applying this method to mechanical. condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, machine condition can be monitored only using normal condition signals. It is unnecessary for this method to pre-process the signals to extract their features. The experimental results show that this method has stronger classification ability and higher efficiency than conventional classification method of neural network.

Moreover, when the faults take place in the machine, owning to the strong nonlinear characteristic, the vibration signals include many frequency components, and the spectrum is continuous. Thereafter, the practically measured signals are non-stationary signals, this kind of signals is difficulty to find useful information if only in the frequency domain. This paper introduces fractal theory into the fields of non-stationary vibration signals of the mechanical facilities. The result proves the method in this paper to describe the non-stationary signals is applicable, and is effective in the fault diagnosis and condition monitoring of machine facilities.

Firstly, separate the series data to components with different time scale, i.e., using WT, then filter out the high frequency noise, distill the characteristic frequency of the measuring signals. Secondly, original signals are reconstructed by using the coefficients. Finally, use PDF to recognize each data for the fault diagnosis. The method eliminates the influence of interference signals and improves the discriminating precision of PDF. In this paper, a blower of an Iron & Steel Corporation was measured and analyzed by the combined method. 4 points of the bearing seat were chosen as monitoring points. Acceleration data were picked up by KISTLER accelerometer, the data acquisition was performed by 16 channels DEWEtron2010. The analysis of the experiment data indicates that the combined method is feasible and effective for fault testing of rotating machinery.

This paper aims at a new strategy of APS for wheel loader based on the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program). The APS adopts AMT mode, consists of a central controller and a gearbox from ZF in Germany. The central controller of system uses DSP TMS320LF2407A from TI as the main hardware workbench, and the Embedded Real-time Multitask Operating System mu c/os-II as the software workbench. And there is a LCD monitoring real-timely the machine state by CANbus. This article presented briefly the hardware structure of the micro-control system, then placed emphasis upon the strategy of automatic gear shifting based on embedded software system and the mechanism of fault diagnosis. We realize the APS by the gear state shifting, after acquiring the condition of road, state of vehicle and the wills of the operator In addition, when the machine cannot shift gear normally, the program can acquire the transmission oil pressure continuously on requested, and can return the data to server for diagnosis. The system has been applied on certain new-style wheel loader All the operator has to do is select forward, reverse or kick-down, and APS automatically selects the right gear, depending on road status, engine revs, speed and the mode selector.

Statistic learning theory is especially used to deal with little sample conditions. Support vector machine (SVM) is preferably to solve little sample learning problem. The theory of SVM is based on the ideal of structural risk minimization (SRM), that is, through minimize the upper boundary of the risk to obtain the best generalization. In this paper, a fault diagnosis model based on FSVM has been studied. The model is designed to distinguish between normal and abnormal states. Through applying fuzzy membership to each input sample and weighting different contribution to the learning of decision, the FSVM learn and give optimal decision hyperplane from training points. One application of the FSVM model is to reduce the false alarm rate of BIT for certain radar equipment. We also discussed the possibility of the fault forecast at the end.

Today, they are mainly deployed for environmental monitoring - e.g. for "smart building" control, water quality monitoring, and botanical studies. In the future, it is clear they have a huge potential for industrial applications such as machinery monitoring, shop instrumentation, and process control. Wireless sensor nodes can be mounted on various parts of machinery and plant to promote early fault detection and analysis. Their small size and autonomy enables their placement in locations that are usually difficult to access. In addition, it is also possible, with minimal changes to the machine configuration, to deploy sensors on the machinery after it has been installed. The sensor nodes cannot only monitor their own output but also collaborate With neighboring nodes to determine the health of the overall machines and provide early warnings of potential failure. We study, in this paper, the benefits of using wireless sensor networks in machine tools and plant equipment. We discuss the uses of these networks and the issues that must be addressed in order for these implementations to be successful. We also present two case studies for machinery and machine too monitoring.

Yet, many low-cost complex computer controlled systems are mass-produced without the concurrent provision of precise physics based models. We wish to utilize new developments in machine learning coupled with model based reasoning methods to address this deficiency. In particular, we shall demonstrate that for an important class of these systems, the extremely large number of mass produced, complex engine systems which power vehicles and small power generation plants, effective means of providing MBR for condition based maintenance exists. It will be recognized that the methodology also has much broader applicability. We will show that a class of dynamic neural networks can be used to provide high-fidelity models of these complex systems that permit an analysis of differences between predicted normal behavior and actual plant behavior to be analyzed to detect deviations from nominal behavior which will be shown to be valuable in estimating time-to-failure for such systems. The realization of this capability is dependent upon the development of extremely efficient and powerful training algorithms for these dynamics neural networks. While many simple training schemes have been in use for many years, they generally fail to provide the needed model accuracy when they are applied to training the relatively "large" multi-layered dynamic networks that are needed to precisely mimic plant behavior over all operating conditions. Our approach has several advantages over these simpler, but less effective methods. Three major improvements are the rate at which learning proceeds, the provision of a means to optimize the learning rate through-out the process, and the dramatic improvements observed in learning in the final stages of training when the error feedback from training examples are extremely small and the associated error covariance matrices almost vanish. We shall demonstrate with data drawn from production vehicles, that for several important problems in analyzing system performance in these vehicles, sufficient model fidelity can be attained to meet the requirements on detection efficiency, false alarm immunity and alarm response time which are required for effective diagnostics and prognostics. Finally we shall discuss the manner in which the deviations are analyzed to not only identify that a failure has been detected but also the means by which the probable root cause may be isolated.

Diagnostics methods are used to quickly identify faults during the process, whereas product quality is assessed at the final inspection stage, after the process is completed. The large amount of data that is collected to enable the on-line diagnostics, however, can be used to predict the product quality before the part is measured at the final inspection stage. This predicted quality can be used as feedback to a control system that improves the process quality by adjusting the process inputs. In this paper we propose a predictive inspection based process control solution for a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is modelled as an input-output system with the machine settings as inputs and two kinds of outputs: diagnostic data and quality. This model is obtained from off-line experiments using a combination of process inputs and external disturbances. In the online implementation the predictive process model is updated with the diagnostic data collected during run-time and quality is improved by using a two-loop control strategy, on a part-to-part or run-to-run (R2R) basis. The proposed approach is applied to and developed for an end milling operation and simulation and experimental results are presented.

IPS is used to extract feature frequencies of each machine state from measured vibration signals for distinguishing faults by relative crossing information. Excellent symptom parameters for detecting faults are automatically generated by the GP. The excellent symptom parameters generated by GP can sensitively reflect the characteristics of signals for precise diagnosis. The method proposed in this paper is verified by applying it to the fault diagnosis of a rolling bearing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our work is based on a residual generation scheme, where the output of a model for process normal behavior is compared against actual process values. The residuals indicate the presence of a fault. The model consists of a general statistical inference Engine operating on discrete spaces. This model represents the maximum entropy joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probabilities. The joint pmf is a rich model that, once learned, allows one to address inference tasks, which can be used for prediction applications. In our case the model allows the one step-ahead prediction of process variable, given its past values. The relevant past values for the forecast model are selected by learning a causal structure with an algorithm to learn a discrete bayesian network. The parameters of the statistical engine are found by an approximate method proposed by Yan and Miller. We show the performance of the prediction models and their application in power systems fault detection.

There are vast opportunities for development of the AE technique on various forms of rotating machinery, including gearboxes. This paper reviews some recent developments in application of AE to gear defect diagnosis. Furthermore, an experimental investigation that examines the effectiveness of AE for gear defect identification is presented. It is concluded that application of the AE technique to seeded gear defect detection is fraught with difficulties. In addition, the viability of the AE technique for gear defect detection from non-rotating components of a machine is called into question. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These laser diodes are characterized by a low density of dislocations (8(.) 10(4)- 1.10(5) cm(-2)) and thus they possibly have the best crystalline quality ever reported for this type of nitride devices. Previously, we demonstrated that these lasers are able to emit a very high optical power under pulse operation. In the present paper we will demonstrate the details of their room temperature CW operation, giving good prognostics for the further development of these devices. Preliminary estimation of the internal losses indicated a very low internal absorption in the range of 5 cm(-1). The characterization of the aged devices did not reveal any dark lines or facet degradation. A correlation between the device lifetime and p-type layers growth methods will be suggested here.

These techniques were originally developed for the area of optical tensiographic data mining and analysis but have a more general application in data mining. These developments have recently been augmented with the engineering of a software toolkit called TraceMiner. Although the toolkit was originally devised for tensiography it was developed to perform as a generic data mining and analysis application with PCT, PCD-S and a range of other data mining algorithms implemented. To date the toolkit has been utilised in its main application area, tensiography, but has also been applied to UV-visible spectroscopy. This work presents a critical investigation of the general utility of PCT, PCD-S and the toolkit for data mining and analysis. A new application of PCT and the TraceMiner software toolkit to Raman spectroscopy is presented with discussion of the relevant measures and the information provided by the toolkit. This provides more insight into the generic potential of the techniques for data mining. The analysis performed on theoretical Raman data is augmented with a study of experimental Raman data. Raman spectroscopy is used for composition and fault detection analysis in semiconductor surfaces. Finally, the utility of the PCT technique in comparison with traditional Raman spectroscopy methods is considered together with some more general applications in the field of imaging and machine vision.

The algorithm is based on a probabilistic model where individual node fails with an a priori probability p. The assumptions concerning test outcomes are the same as in the PMC model, that is, fault-free testers always give correct test outcomes and faulty testers are totally unpredictable. The parallel diagnosis algorithm was implemented and simulated on randomly generated large systems. Simulations results are provided showing that the parallel diagnosis did improve the efficiency of the evolutionary diagnosis approach, in that it allowed faster diagnosis of faulty situation, making it a contribution to present techniques.

The WT is used to extract feature signal of each machine state from measured vibration signal for high-accurate diagnosis of states. The decision method of optimum frequency area for the extraction of feature signal is discussed using real plant data. We also propose the diagnosis method by using "Partially-linearized Neural Network (PNN)" by which the type of faults can be automatically distinguished on the basis of the probability distributions of symptom parameters. The symptom parameters are non-dimensional parameters which reflect the characteristics of time signal measured for condition diagnosis of plant machinery. The knowledge for the PNN learning can be acquired by using the Rough Sets (RS) of the symptom parameters. The practical examples of diagnosis for rotating machinery are shown to verify the efficiency of the method.

This paper deals with KFD for two multi-class fault recognition examples. One example is to recognize faults on different bearing elements; another is to recognize four different severities of the ball faults. The time-domain vibration signals of normal bearings, bearings with different faults have been used for feature extraction. The features are obtained from direct processing of the signal segments using simple preprocessing. The classification results demonstrate that KFD method is effective on the examples. Furthermore, in terms of classification performance, KFD method competes with support vector machines.

It is necessary for manufacturing enterprises to detect the states of production process in real time, in order to rind the early faults in machines, so that the losses of production failure and investments of facility maintenance can be minimized. This paper proposes a new fault diagnosis model, which extracts multi-dimension features from the detected signal to supervise the different features of the signal simultaneously. Based on the model, the method of inductive learning is adopted to obtain the statistical boundary vectors of the signal automatically, and then a normal feature space is built, according to which an abnormal signal can be detected, and consequently the faults in a complicated system can be found easily. Furthermore, under the condition of without existing fault samples, the precise results of fault diagnosis can also be achieved in real time. The theoretical analysis and simulation example demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

In essence, fault diagnosis is a pattern classification and recognition problem of judging whether the operation status of the system is normal or not. Support vector machines (SVMs), well motivated theoretically, have been introduced as effective methods for solving classification problems. However, the generalization performance of SVMs is sometimes far from the expected level due to their limitations in practical applications. Ensemble learning of SVMs provides a promising way for such cases. In this paper, a new ensemble learning method based on genetic algorithm is presented. Genetic algorithm is introduced into ensemble learning so as to search for accurate and diverse classifiers to construct a good ensemble. The presented method works on a higher level and is more direct than other search based ensemble learning methods. Different strategies of constructing diverse base classifiers are also studied. Experimental results on a steam turbine fault diagnosis problem show that the presented method can achieve much better generalization performance than other methods including single SVM, Bagging and Adaboost.M1 if the strategies used are appropriate for the practical problem.

A problem with diagnostic techniques is that they require constant human interpretation of the results. Fuzzy neural networks show good ability of self-adaption and self-learning, wavelet transformation or analysis shows the time frequency location characteristic and multi-scale ability. Inspired by these advantages, a wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) is proposed for fault diagnosis in this paper. This fuzzy neural network uses wavelet basis function as membership function whose shape can be adjusted on line so that the networks have better learning and adaptive ability. An on-line learning algorithm is applied to automatically construct the wavelet fuzzy neural network. There are no rules initially in the wavelet fuzzy neural network. They are created and adapted as on-line learning proceeds via simultaneous structure and parameter learning. The advantages of this learning algorithm are that it converges quickly and the obtained fuzzy rules are more precise. The results of simulation show that this SWFNN network method has the advantage of faster learning rate and higher diagnosing precision.

In most conditions, normal signals are acquired easily but fault samples are difficult to be gained. Because of lacking enough fault samples, the machine diagnosis meets difficulties. Support vector data description (SVDD) is a single classifier and it can distinguish the normal and fault condition just using normal samples. In this paper we first describe the basic algorithm of SVDD. 5-cross validation is used as model selection to optimize the parameter of SVDD. Extracting two-dimension spectrum entropy of signals as the input of the SVDD classifier, we got high classification. Compared neural network (ANN) with SVDD, the experiment result represents that in the environment which lacks of enough fault samples condition monitoring, SVDD has better classification than ANN.

Bearing defects on rotating machinery constitute a problem for manufacturers who aim to predict those faults and potential engine breakdowns. The diagnosis verdict should be given after a processing step of the signals recorder by an array of sensors judiciously placed on different positions on the engine, in order to capture the contribution of the bearing fault towards its propagation through rotating, among other, elements. In this paper, we apply recent signal processing techniques based on the Independent Component Analysis mathematical tool, in order to identify the bearing element presenting the defect.

It is an established fact that these imperfections or faults are nearly invisible to sensors measuring the shaft whirl and vibration. This paper demonstrates that a synchronous excitation such as created by unbalance forces does not contribute to the detection of rotating imperfections while non-synchronous excitation such as exerted by active magnetic bearings has the capability to detect and quantify such imperfections. The theory of parametric excitation can be used to find an optimal excitation pattern that reveals small imperfections in a manner that was not possible before. The availability of an external forcing device (active magnetic bearings) and a mathematical model of fault related response is being use to inject speed-dependent fault-tuned forces that make any mass or stiffness asymmetry evident and thus allow for early warnings. A dedicated model of a flexible rotor is developed for which a mathematical expression of the required forcing pattern is shown. A numerical simulation and an experimental rig are presented showing a practical implementation can be realised.

For this purpose, the basic theories on CWT and statistics are reviewed. The analysis on the CWT transform shows that the CWT is capable of separating the signal transients and noise. The signal feature is computed by computing the sum of the square of the coefficients and its neighbor coefficients, then, Gaussianity test is adopted to localize the transients in the feature space. This transient detection is utilized in the transient detection of gearbox vibration signals for fault diagnosis. The detected transients show the condition of the gearbox in a more distinct way than the original signal; the reconstructed transients in time plane are also effective in showing the gearbox condition. The extracting method of transients based on CWT and Guassianity test is effective in gearbox condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Though many associated researches have been done by some specific methods, none satisfied results have been obtained. Artificial neural network is a rapidly developing area in the recent years, and has demonstrated a great application in manufacturing process monitoring. However, standard bp neural network has disadvantages of slow convergence rate, long period of learning time and low accuracy. Thus in this paper, the mathematical model of network is established, and an improved algorithm for bp neural network is presented, meanwhile how to decide the number of units in hidden layer is also discussed. The advantages of improved bp algorithm are confirmed with the help of simulation. Simulation results show that tool wear monitoring method based on improved bp neural network is applicable and effective.

This paper presents an adaptive Modular Neural Networks System (MNN) for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. In designing the system, steady state values of sensitive parameters of current, voltage and pressure transducers are continuously monitored. Deviation of two out of three sensors causes an alarm for a possible malfunction. To detect the cause of malfunction a rapid non-destructive test, which generates a transient signal is carried. This signal is tested by the knowledge base of the MNN which is trained with ensemble of transient patterns of the known failure modes of the system tinder test. The MNN design is capable of detecting faulty/unfaulty conditions, and if faulty it detects the degree of deterioration of the system. MNN is trained with separate input (transient patterns of faults)-target (causes and levels of faults). Initially, MNN detects cause of malfunction and an interprocess communication up-loads the appropriate trained weight vector to test and detect the level of deterioration. Test result on over 350 cases indicated a fault detection accuracy of more than 99%.

C	Su, H; Chong, KT			IEEE	Su, H; Chong, KT			Condition monitoring for electrical failures in induction machine using neural network modelling of vibration signal	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2005 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications	JUL 20-22, 2005	Messina, ITALY	IEEE		neural network; electrical fault; condition monitoring; induction motors		Condition monitoring is desirable for increasing machinery availability, reducing consequential damage, and improving operational efficiency. Many of these faulty situations in three phase induction motors have an electrical reason. Vibration signal analysis is found to be sensitive to electrical faults. However, the conventional methods require detailed information on motor design characteristics, and cannot be applied effectively for vibration diagnosis because of their non-adaptation and the random nature of vibration signal. This paper presents the development of an online electrical fault detection system that uses neural network modeling of induction motor in vibration spectra. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to process the quasi-steady vibration signals to continuous spectra so that the neural network model can be trained. The electrical faults are detected from changes in the expectation of modeling error. Based on the experimental observations, the effectiveness of the system is demonstrated, while minimizing the impact of false alarms resulting from power supply imbalance, and it is shown that a robust and automatic electrical fault detection system has been produced.

And it is of great significance to find out which parts are liable to faults as well as their real discharge characteristics. By using an ultra-wideband partial discharge detecting system, the discharge signal from disk-type spacer in key part of 110kV GIS is acquired and studied. These key parts are the part nearby PT, the part nearby CT, the part nearby CB, the part nearby bus, the part nearby the LA. According to the different machine structure and electromagnetic field non-uniform distribution, these disk-spacers have different partial discharge characteristics. It is found that spacers in different parts of GIS have their own partial discharge characteristics, and their discharge frequencies concentrate below 300MHz, which provide numerical reference for the on-line monitoring of GIS.

When carrying out circular interpolation, the displacements of two involved axes are sampled as two independent time series. We adopt SVD algorithm to process the sampled data. A special matrix called attractor is constructed. By applying the Singular Value Ratio (SVR) spectrum, we have proposed the similarity ratio and then the similarity of two series is compared.

Machine fault detection using neuro-fuzzy inference system and genetic algorithms	Proceedings of the ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference 2005, Vol 3, Pts A and B			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conference/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	SEP 24-28, 2006	Long Beach, CA	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div			DIAGNOSTICS; NETWORKS; GEAR	A study is presented to show the performance of machine fault detection using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and genetic algorithms (GAs), termed here as GA-ANFIS. The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective gears are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to GA-ANFIS for two class (normal or fault) recognition. The number and the parameters of membership functions used in ANFIS along with the features are selected using GAs maximizing the classification success. The results of fault detection are compared with GA based artificial neural network (ANN), termed here as GA-ANN. In GA-ANN, the number of hidden nodes and the selection of input features are optimized using GAs. For each trial, the GA-ANFIS and GA-ANN are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The trained GA-ANFIS and GA-ANN are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a gearbox. The results compare the effectiveness of both types of classifiers (ANFIS and ANN) with GA based selection of features and classifier parameters.

The full spectrum cascade analysis of rotating machine vibrations, which has important information association with vertical horizontal, and diagonal relationships, is an efficient method that enables the symptoms of some special types of fault (especially for rub) to be clear detected. Some typical rubs that caused by different malfunctions have been simulated through experiments in this study; Acceleration signals have been received by experimental apparatus and analyzed by full spectrum. The abrupt changes in surging acceleration signals of rotor malfunctions can be detected and its fault feature spectra are shown in full spectrum cascade plots. The results indicate that the potential and feasibility of this approach as the diagnosis of rotor malfunctions. The full spectrum cascade diagram can enrich the feature information for the knowledge base of the rotating machinery rub fault diagnosis system and is of great significance to rub diagnose faults in rotor more accurately.

A machine degradation process is known to be stochastic instead of deterministic. Recognizing the degradation pattern needs helps from stochastic and probabilistic models. Among various stochastic approaches, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been proven to be very effective in modeling both dynamic and static signals [1]. In this paper, aiming to providing a guideline of how to effectively and efficiently use the HMMs to assess degradation for various machinery prognostic applications, three different approaches of applying the HMMs are reviewed and compared. It demonstrates that depending on the varieties of applications, available prior knowledge, and characteristics of degradation processes, those three implementation approaches perform differently. A full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each deployment approach is extremely important in order to effectively utilize this powerful tool for system degradation assessment.

It has become a standard for data representation and exchanging over the Internet. This paper introduces the application of XML on a remote machine monitoring and fault diagnostic system through Internet and mobile communication, such as mobile phones and PDAs. The remote monitoring system takes XML as a core and uses it to encode diagnostic data. The capabilities provided by XML on Internet and mobile communication include the display of different contents in a XML file based on different requirements; the enquiry of current running conditions of an inspected machine via an Internet connected PC, or a mobile phone, or a PDA; the import of diagnostic data to a remote client program by using the XML based structure. Using XML makes all these capabilities become possible. Indeed, XNIL makes the sharing of data between different applications and the broadcasting of diagnostic data easier. It also uplifts the expandability and sustainability of the remote monitoring system.

In past, the machine operators would recognize the machine condition by touching the machine or hearing the machine operating sound. However, this is too subjective and not effective for inexperienced operators. In fact, most modem machineries are so complex that many components may run together, making the operator impossible to distinguish the difference between a normal and anomalous machine. Although more scientific fault diagnostic systems are available, they are expensive and difficult to use without comprehensive learning. Therefore, there is a need from industry to have an economy and efficient machine fault diagnostic system. The occurrence of fault must be identified as early as possible to avoid fatal breakdown of machines'. The aim of developing the Smart Asset Maintenance System (SAMS) is to provide a portable and comprehensive but low-cost and simple-to-use solution for the industry to perform equipment maintenance effectively.

However applications of GP in the area of machine condition monitoring and diagnostics is very recent and yet to be fully exploited. In this paper, a study is presented to show the performance of machine fault detection using GP. The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective gears are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to GP for two class (normal or fault) recognition. The number of features and the features are automatically selected in GP maximizing the classification success. The results of fault detection are compared with genetic algorithm (GA) based artificial neural network (ANN)- termed here as GA-ANN. The number of hidden nodes in the ANN and the selection of input features are optimized using GAs. Two different normalization schemes for the features have been used. For each trial, the GP and GA-ANN are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The trained GP and GA-ANN are tested using the remaining set of data.

Any loss in production and service due to equipment malfunction is unacceptable. The use of Web-based maintenance helps to detect defective machine in its early stage and thus avoid costly failure. It provides an easy way for the operator to evaluate the performance of the distant located machines. The architecture of our proposed Web-based maintenance has been redesigned to reduce the burden of the main server. The heavy loading situation which often occurs in the main server can be avoided. Beside architecture, several crypto mechanisms have been added to the system. With the aids of those crypto mechanisms, the security of the Web-based maintenance has been significantly enhanced. The data can be transferred safety and the accuracy of the results can be verified. Our Web-based maintenance is well equipped with Web-enabled and advanced fault diagnostic tools. It works more effectively and securely as compared to conventional Web-based maintenance.

A new processing procedure is proposed which uses the information from several acquisition channels. The approach is based on the assumption that there is a non-linear relationship among the instantaneous vibration magnitude registered for each measurement location. This relationship is captured in the connection weight matrix of an Autoassociative Artificial Neural Network (AANN), which is trained to provide an output vector equal to the input one. In this work, the time synchronous average signal (TSA) for each channel corresponding to the no fault condition is used to train an AANN. Once the AANN is trained, it is used with new data registers as a linear prediction error filter. If the new register contains the same data structure as the training set the prediction error will be low and the machine is working properly. Otherwise, when the new register differs from the training set, as a consequence of a fault, prediction error will be increased in each channel. In this way the information from not only one channel but more than one is used for fault detection and diagnosis as the error signal depends on the TSA signal from all channels. The proposed approach provides a new tool for gear fault detection that is compared on the basis of experimental registers with the most traditional gear processing tools based on TSA such as residual and regular signals. The possibility of generalizing the net prediction capabilities using a training data set that contains several load cases is also explored.

The vibration data of a milling process is used in an experimental work to demonstrate the suggested methodology. Fourier Transformation and Wavelet are used for data analysis.

The rotor is modeled with five degrees of freedom, and the bearings are modeled with nonlinear forces arising from Hertzian contact stresses. Then we introduce a defect into the roller bearings with a controllable parameter, and analyze the effect of the growth of this defect on the dynamic response of the system using several signal processing tools such as spectrum, cepstrum and envelope methods. Numerical results are obtained for a screw compressor rotor. We examine these results with the idea of potential application towards the development of automated condition assessment tools for machinery diagnostics and prognostics. It appears from the results that no single tool is ideal, and that a combination of existing tools could possibly lead to a good strategy.

It is the purpose of the paper to develop the approach of identifying new fault and self-learning for diagnosis based oil non-linear fractal theorem. It has been generally accepted that the vibration series has obvious fractal feature, which call reflect the essential characteristics of new fault. When the novel fault is taken place in the system, a related sub-net is increased to the system and trained with this sample. We have verified experinientally that the fractal dimensions of the same class faults are distributed approximately around a definate value that can represents the dimension of the standard sample for the novel fault. Based on non-linear theorem, the approach of identifying new fault and self-learning for diagnosing is put forward..

The orbit is a 2-D image and can be described by moment invariants, the shape property of 2-D image, which is a description with translating-, rotating-, and scaling-invariants for 2-D image. The descriptive method of orbit image is investigated and an automatic orbit shape recognition based on artificial neural network (ANN) with moment invariants is proposed in this paper. The ANN of orbit shape recognition is trained by the training patterns generated by computer simulation for plenty of orbit shapes. It is shown that the trained ANN is of good recognition performance and generalization capability when applied to recognition of the measured orbits. This method can be used to the intelligent expert system of fault diagnosis to obtain automatically online orbit symptom in shafts vibration monitoring of turbine generator, which will improve the automatization of obtaining fault symptom and the automatic diagnosis in the expert system.

Decision-makers are thus faced with the need to define the best strategy in order to achieve the best possible performance while meeting all regulatory requirements. EDF R&D is therefore deeply involved in developing advanced decision-making support tools so the EDF Engineering and Generation Divisions can optimize the long-term management of NPP components. In this paper we wish to provide the reader with an overview of how advanced information processing techniques such as signal and image processing algorithms and knowledge-based information systems recently contributed to the improvement of in-service inspections, condition-based maintenance, and asset management. First we focus on how multi-dimensional image reconstruction techniques increase component durability as they dramatically improve defect positioning and sizing when applied to radiographic data or ultrasonic data. We then detail current research work regarding the development of next generation prognostics systems which allow condition-based maintenance to take simultaneously into account monitoring data (for early fault detection), time-dependent aging models (for degradation kinetics), expert opinion as well as a quantified evaluation of the impact (on reliability and costs) of every potential decision. Lastly we describe how knowledge-based systems can help top level decision-makers get a transverse, long-term view on how a life-management investment strategy translates into plant availability, avoided costs and improved component durability.

Improved quality assessment for turbine engine components with potential applications to ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials	Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo 2005, Vol 1			English	Proceedings Paper	50th ASME Turbo-Expo	JUN 06-09, 2005	Reno, NV	Amer Soc Mech Engineers		ceramic matrix composites; CMC; turbine engine components; prognostics/diagnostics; nondestructive inspection; quality assessment; manufacturing		Demand for improved power from turbine engines has resulted in the development of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials that can withstand extreme temperature environments and maintain the damage tolerance required for space vehicles and next generation turbine engines. CMC components allow higher temperature operation and increased power over nickel-based superalloy components due to their reduced weight and temperature stability. The use of CMCs allows a potential increase in turbine engine temperatures to above 1400 degrees C. This temperature increase results in improved performance, which translates into increased efficiency, better power to weight ratios, and improved reliability with both significant fuel savings and reduced life cycle costs. Evaluating CMC component quality is difficult due to variations in the fiber/matrix properties and variations in fabrication related parameters. Further, there is limited information on operational and remaining life characteristics. These factors produce significant challenges to existing inspection methods. Determining the reliability of CIVIC components is a complex process and requires an understanding of both manufacturing variability and damage effects that can occur throughout the life of the component. Consequently, a nondestructive inspection capability is required that can reliably evaluate CIVIC components during manufacturing, provide acceptance/rejection criteria for determining "fitness for use" and be useful for assessing operational damage effects.

With the recent advances on pervasive computing, prognostics can be easily embedded in any devices and systems. When smart machines are networked and remotely monitored, and when their data is modeled and continually analyzed with sophisticated embedded systems, it is possible to go beyond mere "predictive maintenance" to intelligent "prognostics", the process of pinpointing exactly which components of a machine are likely to fail, and when and autonomously trigger service and order spare parts. This paper addresses the paradigm shift in modem maintenance systems from traditional "fail and fix" practices to "predict and prevent" methodology. Recent advances on prognostic technologies and tools are discussed. In addition, case studies are used to validate f these developed technologies and tools.

DT-CWT has the advantage of approximate shift invariance while the decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) does not have and Continuous Wavelet Transform spends too long computing time although it has. Signal with N sampling points is decomposed into log(2)N levels by DT-CWT, and the 2-norm of the wavelet coefficients is computed at each of these levels. These 2-norms constitute the feature vector of the signal, which is regarded as the input parameter of SVM. In our experiment, 3 kinds of states on a gearbox, including normal, pitting and broken teeth, are adopted. As one of 4 cases, the recognized accuracy reaches 93.33% when using the presented method, while only 46.67% according to the DWT extracting corresponding feature vectors with the same parameter. The experimental results indicate that the proposed feature extraction and classification method can extract significant feature sets from signal, and can accurately distinguish early fault pattern.

Hence, it is necessary and advantageous that fault diagnosis be based on acoustic signal in rotor. The application of higher-order statistics is studied for extraction of rotor malfunction features. The analytical signals are acquired by means of Hilbert transformation of the original signals. The enveloped signals are calculated from the analytical signals. The higher-order cumulants of the enveloped signals are estimated. A method of acoustic signal fault diagnosis based on envelope analysis and support vector machine is put forward to solve the problem in development of rotating machinery transient fault intelligent diagnosis due to needing many fault data samples. Rub and abrupt unbalance have been carried out by experiments. The experimental results indicate the potential and feasibility of this approach as the diagnosis of rotor malfunctions.

In this paper, a new method for fault diagnosis based on fusion of multi-channel observations by sensors with independent component analysis and mutual information (MI) was proposed, by which redundancy among observations by sensors (vibrations or acoustical signals) can be reduced, high dimensional fault features can be compressed, and, feature extraction can be made simpler and faster. By means of such characteristics as redundancy reduction of ICA and higher statistic than second order of MI, two-step fusion and compression of multi-channel observations by sensors were implemented. Firstly, multi-channel observations were inputted into an ICA processing unit, by which additive noise and interference were removed, and information embedded into observations was re-adjusted. Then, a procedure for feature extraction named MI based Wavelet was used for capturing higher statistical features than second order. Finally, by means of clustering analysis of the fused feature vectors, capacity of the new method in classification for different fault patterns was tested. Results of experiment showed that multi-channel observations by sensors were fused sufficiently, dimension of observations was reduced remarkably, and, at the same time, good performance in classifying different fault patterns was obtained. Thus, it is possible to construct an on-line and real-time fault classifier by the application of this new method to fault diagnosis of a complex machine.

In order to solve the problem of insufficient fault samples in intelligent monitoring and diagnosis for machinery, one-class classification-Support vector data description (SVDD) is proposed. It is only trained by the healthy data, also known as target data and never sees the "unhealthy" and can distinguish normal and abnormal condition effectively. In this paper we describe the basic algorithm of SVDD and use the experimental vibration data of bearings as the input of SVDD classifier. In order to select the most efficient parameter for classification, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the available input parameters and the parameters of SVDD. Through this method, we got high classification to recognize the fault condition of bearings. Compared neural network (ANN) with SVDD, the experiment result represents that in the environment which lacks of enough fault samples, SVDD has better classification than ANN.

Tracking the health state of a machine, even if the machine is working properly, is very critical for detecting, identifying, and localizing the failure (i.e., diagnosis) and estimating the remaining-useful-life of the component/machine (i.e., prognosis) for carrying out proper maintenance. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) present us an opportunity to estimate these unobservable health states using observable sensor signals. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical fashion, providing functionality beyond a HMM for modeling complex systems. Implementation of HMM based models as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) facilitates compact representation as well as additional flexibility with regard to model structure. Regular and hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate on-line the health state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. In the case of regular HMMs, each HMM (that is part of a committee) competes to represent a distinct health state and learns through competitive learning. In the case of hierarchical HMMs, health states are represented as distinct nodes in the top of the hierarchy. Detailed results from regular and hierarchical HMMs are very promising and are reported in this paper.

Until now, the machine parameters are estimated using crude motion technology supported with motion sensing techniques. However, the motion sensing technology is expensive and difficult to maintain. Furthermore, the sensing technology is still not mature enough to estimate machine system parameters of a complex inter-dependent motion axis. The need for a better low-cost technique for machine parameter estimation motivates the development of a real-time predictive maintenance system. This paper describes a neural network based novel real-time predictive maintenance system for machine systems. The neural network approach is used for the prediction of the machine system parameters using tire motion current signature. Unlike many neural network based condition monitoring systems, this approach is validated in an off-line proof of concept procedure, using data front an experimental test rig similar to a production machine. The experiment aimed to classify five distinct motor loads using the motion current signature, irrespective of changing tuning parameters. Comparison of the predicted and actual loads showed good agreement. The success of the proof of concept motivates the development of the real-time predictive maintenance system with additional parameters like friction and external torque. An application of the real-time predictive maintenance system to a clinical micro-drilling process, for example a stapedotomy procedure, is presented in this paper. The drilling in such processes is controlled using the drilling inertia. Therefore, the real-time predictive maintenance system is used to estimate tire drilling inertia front tire motor current signature, hence providing a mechanism of manipulating the drilling process in a stapedotomy procedure by the surgeons.

Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) is a nonlinear PCA developed by using the kernel method and is used for feature extraction. This paper proposes the applications of KPCA to SVM in machine fault diagnosis. Statistical indexes are selected from vibration signal of roll bearings, and then compose original feature volume. Principal components are achieved based on KPCA theory from the statistical indexes and used as the inputs of SVM to perform the classification. The experimental result shows that very high classification rate can be obtained using KPCA/SVM. Compared with PCA/SVM, the former performs better. It also indicates that the combine of KPCA and SVM recognize the fault pattern effectively and has good applied foreground in the field of machine fault diagnosis.

As reported in the literature, these cavitation signals are used for quantifying water stress status of plants, analyses of water stress phenomena and also for practical applications in irrigation control. This paper deals with long time observations on cut roses during postharvest phase and analyses of cavitation profiles as a prognosis component for vase life. Roses with good vase life potential often show four different phases in their cavitation profile. During the first phase, i.e. immediately after harvest and/or an adequate storage for up to 2-3 days, only few acoustic emissions are detectable. The second phase typically shows a high amount of signals and expressed light/dark rhythms. Decrease of intensity and frequency of emissions during day and increase of emissions during night is characteristic for phase 3 during which often wilting of petals, first leaf wilting and with susceptible cultivars also bent neck can be observed. Phase 4 marks the end of vase life, then often a strong increase of acoustic emissions is detectable, possibly caused by mechanical degradation of fibres and vessels and not by cavitations. Such profiles are probably of high interest for studying water relations of cut flowers and the influencing factors, but for the use as a prognosis component information results too late and due to a high variance is not reliable enough for practical applications. In contrast to that, characterization of the endogenous water stress management (testing of stomata function at fluctuating light/dark phases and the refilling potential of vessels at short time de- and rehydration experiments) seems to have a better perspective for the application of cavitation profiles in prognosis of vase life.

This paper focuses on improving fault tolerance through testing. Moreover, it concentrates on the memory faults: how to access the editable part of a process memory space and bow this part is affected. A special Software Fault Injection Technique (SFIT) is proposed for this purpose. This is done by sequentially scanning the memory of the target process, and trying to edit maximum number of bytes inside that memory. The technique was implemented and tested on a group of programs in software packages such as jet-audio, Notepad, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Outlook. The results from the test sample process indicate that the size of the scanned area depends on several factors. These factors are: process size, process type, and virtual memory size of the machine under test. The results show that increasing the process size will increase the scanned memory space. They also show that input-output processes have more scanned area size than other processes. Increasing the virtual memory size will also affect the size of the scanned area but to a certain limit.

It uses discernibility matrices and discernibility functions to calculate the core and all reduction sets. With these reduction sets a nodes network model is built. To every network node of the model, the diagnosis rules that have suitable confidence degree are acquired. The method can effectively eliminate the redundant fault attributes and acquire the correct diagnosis rules. Simulation results for fault diagnosis of the rotating machines show that the proposed method is effective.

In order to keep headstock safe and reliable, and to provide reliable data for the dynamic design or modification of a headstock, dynamic characteristic of the headstock has to be obtained. In the paper, the method based on the combination of calculation mode and the experiment mode is proposed to analyses the dynamic characteristic of the headstock. The modal parameters and the mode shapes are calculated through ANSYS7.1 program. According to these FEM calculating results, the experiment parameters in the process of experiment modal analysis can be selected correctly. The modal parameters of the headstock, which is the main component of it to bear moment, have to be computed and identified precisely. On the basis of these modal parameters, the faults of the headstock are shown and its weak points of the design are illustrated. The reason for deformation. is analyzed and relevant measures employed to reduce faults are proposed. By these improvements in question, a guarantee of the headstock working normally has been available.

If the required parameters are properly chosen, all approaches can simulate similar plumes for a particular given time step. The differences of contaminant concentrations in the plumes are small and would not attract attention in a natural aquifer. On long term prognoses the kinetics result in very different plumes: A complex Monod approach considering microbial growth prognoses a further spreading of the plume, compared to a first order rate law, which results in a short and early stationary plume. Other approaches show plumes between these two extremes. On the other hand, the forecasts for plumes assuming Monod kinetics are similar, even if different values for parameterization are chosen. The reason for this insensibility is, that degradation is not limited by microbial kinetics in the simulation, but by dispersive mixing. Simplifying approaches may have few and well determinable parameters, but they are not suited for proper prognoses if they neglect the prerequisite, that contaminant and electron acceptor have to be present for a reaction.

Necessary for success are proper design) of the ultrasonic testing methods, robust transducer Mounting techniques, and real-time signal processing for determining the state of the structure. It is also highly desirable for the overall system to be self-calibrating with built-in diagnostics in order to detect and compensate for sensor degradation or failure. Self-calibrating ultrasonic techniques are applied for monitoring of cracks initiating and propagating from the inaccessible inner diameters of rivet holes where the transducers are mounted on the accessible specimen surface. Angle beam ultrasonic methods are utilized that ire suitable for detecting Small defects in critical local regions of high stress. Results,ire presented for aluminum coupons subjected to low cycle fatigue and demonstrate ultrasonic tracking of crack growth.

The data fusion model is a system of matrix inequalities of the rough sets covariances. Rough sets variance allows to explicitly assess only health degradations assuring increased signal-to-noise ratio, thus high accuracy of processing. The matrices of inequalities fuse measured health degradation levels and influences on these degradations. Adaptations mechanisms are by a new machine learning approach determining weights of the terms of the inequalities at the time of key events found in the historical data. Prognostic is always time-sequenced, therefore methods based on time sequences are incorporated, e.g. a new data fusion model exploiting time-dependency of events, assuring high quality of prediction. Deterministic prognostic is by estimating the pattern of health degradation in question, finding the match with degradation pattern in historical data, and then tracing this historical degradation pattern up to its conclusion. The model is hierarchical: the right sides of the data fusion expressions substitute for endogenous variables of higher-level expressions.

The method integrates the ability of variable precision rough set on reduction of diagnosis information system and that of neural network for fault classification, Typical faults of rotating machinery were simulated in our rotor test-bed. The power spectrum data are used as rotating machinery fault diagnosis signal. For inconsistent data and noise data in power spectrum, variable precision rough set model allows a flexible region of lower approximations by precision variables. By attribute reduction based on variable precision rough set, redundant attributes are identified and removed. The reduction results are used as the input of neural network. The diagnosis results show that the proposed approach for input dimension reduction in neural network is very effective and has better learning efficiency and diagnosis accuracy.

A number of methods are known for the development of a test suite based on a formal specification given in the form of a finite state machine. Well-known methods are called the W, Wp, UIO, UIOv, DS, H and HIS test derivation methods. These methods have been extensively used by research community in the last years; however no proper comparison has been made between them. In this paper, we experiment with these methods to assess their complexity, applicability, completeness, fault detection capability, length and derivation time of their test suites. The experiments are conducted on randomly generated specifications and on a realistic protocol called the Simple Connection Protocol.

Advances in radio-frequency (RF) technology from simple two-way personal communications to smart, independent, sensor command, and control units has greatly expanded the applications domain. In the past four years, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) scientists and engineers have developed smart sensor tags (health tags) for the Army to monitor environmental conditions of high value assets over their lifetime (10 yrs). These field tested health tags uniquely identify individual assets, record and store data, run diagnostic and prognostic protocols, identify asset performance status (GO, CAUTION, NO-GO), and provide all this information over a wireless RF link to a portable, hand held reader. Leveraging the innovation achieved for health monitoring tags, the next generation active sensor tag has been developed (FlexiTag (TM)) providing reduced tag size and manufacturing cost, greater sensor interface capabilities, and a flexible substrate for surface mount conformity. The design has a greatly reduced part count due to the use of newly available, highly integrated RF chip sets. In addition to asset health monitoring, the new tag platform opens up additional application areas such as TTL (tagging, tracking, and locating), real-time machine fault monitoring, and ad-hoc sensor networking. This paper will compare and contrast the FlexiTag (TM) to its predecessors and discuss the current application areas it is being applied to.

J	Pennacchi, P; Vania, A				Pennacchi, P; Vania, A			Diagnosis and model based identification of a coupling misalignment	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article						rotor dynamics; coupling misalignment; diagnostics; fault identification	VIBRATION ANALYSIS; FAULT-DETECTION; ROTOR; ACCURACY	This paper is focused on the application of two different diagnostic techniques aimed to identify the most important faults in rotating machinery as well as on the simulation and prediction of the frequency response of rotating machines. The application of the two diagnostics techniques, the orbit shape analysis and the model based identification in the frequency domain, is described by means of an experimental case study that concerns a gas turbine-generator unit of a small power plant whose rotor-train was affected by an angular misalignment in a flexible coupling, caused by a wrong machine assembling. The fault type is identified by means of the orbit shape analysis, then the equivalent bending moments, which enable the shaft experimental vibrations to be simulated, have been identified using a model based identification method. These excitations have been used to predict the machine vibrations in a large rotating speed range inside which no monitoring data were available. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of identification of coupling misalignment and prediction of the consequent machine behaviour in an actual size rotating machinery. The successful results obtained emphasise the usefulness of integrating common condition monitoring techniques with diagnostic strategies.

Real-time health monitoring and fault diagnosis is essential for reliable and uninterrupted operation of these systems. Existing fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) schemes for HVAC systems are only suitable for a single operating mode with small numbers of faults, and most of the schemes are system-specific. A generic real-time FDD scheme, applicable to all possible operating conditions, can significantly reduce HVAC equipment downtime, thus improving the efficiency of building energy management systems. This paper presents a FDD methodology for faults in centrifugal chillers. The FDD scheme compares the diagnostic performance of three data-driven techniques, namely support vector machines (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least squares (PLS). In addition, a nominal model of a chiller that can predict system response under new operating conditions is developed using PLS. We used the benchmark data on a 90-ton real centrifugal chiller test equipment, provided by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), to demonstrate and validate our proposed diagnostic procedure. The database consists of data from sixty four monitored variables under nominal and eight fault conditions of different severities at twenty seven operating modes.

A new set of these SL structures with minimized conduction band offset was designed and recently tested. A new technology of surface protection in MBE growth leads to a significantly reduced heat-cleaning temperature. At these lowered cleaning temperatures, the thermal degradation of the working structure parameters is avoided. As a result a polarization P of up to 91% at corresponding quantum efficiency (QE) of 0.3% was achieved at room temperature. A 50% increase in the photocathode lifetime has been achieved with Sb coverage.

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) along with its university research partners has launched a large-scale, multi-disciplinary program that to develop and integrate advanced embedded sensing technology, tera-scale predictive modeling capabilities for damage evolution, and techniques for correlation-based data compression to address the problem of damage prognosis in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering systems. These Damage Prognosis solutions realize information fusion between a robust, densely populated sensing array and a system-specific predictive modeling capability derived from benchmarked high-fidelity tera-scale models. This paper will provide an overview of the project and the current proof of principal experiments being conducted at LANL. The application discussed is the prediction of the delamination growth of composite laminate panels that have been impacted by a projectile.

From the viewpoint of safety and security, fault detection schemes are essential for automation in industry, since quick alarms help to prevent the subsequent occurrence of complete failure of industrial machines and plants. Fault detection schemes based on subspace identification are promising since subspace identification algorithms are known as powerful tools for system identification. In this chapter, two fault detection schemes are briefly reviewed. One is to observe changes in system parameters by two recursive parameter estimation algorithms based on subspace identification in parallel. The other is a stochastic whiteness test on the so-called residual which is generated by a recursive subspace identification algorithm.

We show that even considering only a single fault in a finite state machine there are some situations when the exact diagnosis of the fault cannot be assured. We give an algorithm for fault diagnosis. If it is possible the procedure exactly locates a single fault, and in case exact localization is unfeasible it provides the set of all potential differences between the implementation and the specification.

To cope with its size and complexity and to make the network reliable and scalable hierarchical network has been proposed with new features to support the information infrastructure. However, the network hierarchy adds more complications to the network design and implementations and that hampers the network reliability and quality of services. Conformance testing is known to be a powerful tool for network fault detection yet most of the works in the published literature are on networks without hierarchy. We present probabilistic algorithms for testing hierarchical networks along with the added features. Based on a formal model of the networks, we provide a formal analysis that shows that our probabilistic algorithms guarantee a high fault coverage with a feasible number of tests.

Most of the classifiers performed well for the data having same number of features as the number of samples. But gene expression data have very few samples as compare to the number of genes or features. We use Class Prediction (CP) with Compound Covariant Predictor (CCP), Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (DLDA), k-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Nearest Centroid (NC) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to create multivariate predictor to determine the class of a given data sample. In this paper, CP has been used to classify the tumor groups from the microarrays dataset taken from breast cancer patients. The paper presents comparative results to determine the accuracy of a cancer gene classification based on six multivariate classifiers. Our results have shown that CCP has performed best with an accuracy of 100%, 85% and 86% among three tumor groups. Accurate analysis and classification of gene expression profiles could lead to more reliable tumor classification, better prognostic prediction and selection of more appropriate treatments.

In this paper, an integrated approach is proposed to develop cause-effect models from engineering knowledge and to conduct associated statistical analysis of the measurement data. First, a cause-effect diagram and predicted symptom vectors (PSV) are formulated to recognize the cause-effect relationship between process variables and product qualities. Then factor analysis and factor rotating technique are employed to extract the symptoms reflected from measurement data. Finally the potential process faults are identified by comparing predicted symptoms and extracted symptoms. A case study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

The research demonstrates that rotor winding faults will result in the decrease of the starting torque, great increase of harmonic torque, slowdown of the rise of the starting rotational speed, increase of starting time, difficulty in starting, deformation of the stator and rotor starting current, and decrease of the rate of decay, and it also indicates that one of the frequency components of the stator current will produce the peak value twice during the start-up. Some of the conclusions of the transient analysis may be applied to rotor winding fault diagnosis.

Hence, huge volumes of data are being generated in attempt to detect incipient faulty conditions and avoid abnormal process behavior. Most widely used techniques in fault detection and diagnosis are based on exploiting linear correlations in multidimensional data. Unfortunately, in situations where higher-order correlations play an important role, these methods are less effective. The problem of fault detection is discussed from a machine learning perspective using kernel methods. The fault detection problem is formulated to solve what is formulated as a quantile estimation problem. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed that extends the one-class problem to a related fault diagnosis problem, an issue that has received little attention in this context. Simulated data will be used to illustrate the methodology.

If the time domain signals are effectively separated or decomposed, the useful components are extracted, and the interference from other components are restrained, the signal to noise ratio and the quality of diagnostic information will be improved. Aiming at large rotating machinery independent component analysis (ICA) and Hilbert-Huang transformation (HHT) are applied to separate and decompose the vibration signals of mechanical equipment. Firstly, the mixture vibration signals are separated into different independent components according to different vibration source by ICA, and then decompose each independent component by EMD to several intrinsic mode functions. With the Hilbert transform, the IMFs yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time that give sharp identifications of imbedded structures. The final presentation of the results is an energy-frequency-time distribution, designated as the Hilbert-Huang spectrum. The combined ICA-HHT method is applied in the monitoring and fault diagnosis of large rotate machine. The results show that this method can extract the fault information from mixed vibration signals, thereby providing an effective technology for condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment.

First, the InfoMax concept is employed to build a neural network. The neural network is used for independent component analysis to identify the source (input) that causes malfunctions (output). To demonstrate the new method, two application examples were included. First, tool breakage detection in an end milling process. The monitoring signal is the current of the feed-motor, which is used to detect the change of the cutting force and accordingly, to detect tool breakage. Second, is the monitoring of a water pump. In this example, seven acceleration signals were simultaneously acquired and used to identify the location of the fault (bearing crack). The experiment results indicate that the new method is effective.

J	Malhi, A; Gao, RX				Malhi, A; Gao, RX			PCA-based feature selection scheme for machine defect classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						defect classification; feature selection; neural networks; principal component analysis (PCA)	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	The sensitivity of various features that are characteristic of a machine defect may vary considerably under different operating conditions. Hence it is critical to devise a systematic feature selection scheme that provides guidance on choosing the most representative features for defect classification. This paper presents a feature selection scheme based on the principal component analysis (PCA) method. The effectiveness of the scheme was verified experimentally on a bearing test bed, using both supervised and unsupervised defect classification approaches. The objective of the study was to identify the severity level of bearing defects, where no a priori knowledge on the defect conditions was available. The proposed scheme has shown to provide more accurate defect classification with fewer feature inputs than using all features initially considered relevant. The result confirms its utility as an effective tool for machine health assessment.

At first, a performance model is established by taking advantage of logistic regression analysis with maximum-likelihood technique. Two kinds of application situations, with or without enough historical data, are discussed in detail. Then, real-time performance is evaluated by inputting features of online data to the logistic model. Finally, the remaining life is estimated using an ARMA model based on machine performance history; degradation predictions are also upgraded dynamically. The results such as current machine running condition and the remaining useful life, are output to the maintenance decision module to determine a window of appropriate maintenance before the machine fails. An application of the method on an elevator door motion system is demonstrated.

J	Tse, PW; Yang, WX; Tam, HY				Tse, PW; Yang, WX; Tam, HY			Machine fault diagnosis through an effective exact wavelet analysis	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SIGNAL REPRESENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSFORMS	Continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) are widely recognized as effective tools for vibration-based machine fault diagnosis, as CWTs can detect both stationary and transitory signals. However, due to the problem of overlapping, a large amount of redundant information exists in the results that are generated by CWTs. The appearance of overlapping can smear the spectral features and make the results very difficult to interpret for machine operators. Misinterpretation of results may lead to false alarms or failures to detect anomalous signals. Moreover, as conventional CWTs only use a single mother wavelet to generate daughter wavelets, the distortion of the original signal in the resultant coefficients is inevitable. Obviously, this will significantly affect the accuracy in anomalous signal detection. To minimize the effect of overlapping and to enhance the accuracy of fault detection, a novel wavelet transform, which is named as exact wavelet analysis, has been designed for use in vibration-based machine fault diagnosis. The design of exact wavelet analysis is based on genetic algorithms. At each selected time frame, the algorithms will generate an adaptive daughter wavelet to match the inspected signal as exactly as possible. The optimization process of exact wavelet analysis is different from other adaptive wavelets as it considers both the optimization of wavelet coefficients and the satisfaction of the admissibility conditions of wavelets. The results obtained from simulated and practical experiments prove that exact wavelet analysis not only minimizes the undesirable effect of overlapping, but also helps operators to detect faults and distinguish the causes of faults. With the help from exact wavelet analysis, sudden shutdowns of production and services due to the fatal breakdown of machines could be avoided. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Normal conditions included perfect and imperfect commutations as well as noisy operation. Faulty operation was considered an open-circuit fault on one phase of the stator windings. Current waveform of the motor-DC link is monitored and processed using continuous wavelet transform to derive suitable diagnostic indices. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is trained based on indices extracted under various operating conditions in order to automate the diagnosis process. The developed ANFIS yielded a perfect diagnosis of the fault. A good agreement between simulation and experimental results is achieved.

It is shown that previously recognised methods for dealing with shorted turns do not work for larger bar-wound machines, and a new method for protecting the windings against single turn faults is therefore proposed. The new method depends on rapid detection of the fault and injection of a current (of appropriate magnitude and phase) into the faulted winding. The paper gives a theoretical analysis supported by finite element simulations of the fault conditions and illustrates these with a case study taken from the aerospace industry.

Plant devices, sensors, actuators and diagnostic tests are described as stochastic finite-state machines. A formal composition rule of these models is given to obtain: 1) the set of admissible fault signatures; 2) their conditional probability given any fault; and 3) the conditional probability of a fault given a prescribed signature. The modularity and flexibility of this method make it suitable to deal with complex systems made by a large number of components. The method is used in an industrial automotive application, specifically the diagnosis of the throttle body and of the angular sensors measuring the throttle plate angle is described in detail.

It has been shown that by feeding the machine with special excitation signals such as discrete interval binary sequence (DIBS) and multisine, it is possible to excite with low-frequency resolution the faulty modes by analyzing the stator current and the stray flux measured by an external flux sensor. This method can be used for quality control just after manufacturing the rotor and mounting it within the stator frame. The proposed technique is fully general and can be applied to a three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine at standstill. Experimental measurements are made both on healthy and faulty machines and the comparison gives a difference in the external flux and stator current signatures which are basically the most commonly used methods for rotor fault detection.

Web-based maintenance is one of the most efficient methods for optimising maintenance. The Web-based maintenance system that we have developed uses virtual instruments, to provide remote sensing, monitoring, and on-line fault diagnosis for equipment, together with a collaborative maintenance platform for international experts to interactively share their experiences in maintenance. Moreover, Web-based maintenance is suitable for multi-tasking and multi-user types of industrial work environments. In this paper, we summarise the methods used for Web-based remote sensing and monitoring, the design and implementation of Web-enabled virtual instruments, the architecture of the collaborative maintenance platform, and the design for the mini-servers. Each mini-server is equipped with a conventional mini-Web-server and a data acquisition (DAQ) server. With the help of Web-based maintenance, local companies can be transformed into global companies providing services to their customers anywhere and at anytime.

J	Antoni, J; Bonnardot, F; Raad, A; El Badaoui, M				Antoni, J; Bonnardot, F; Raad, A; El Badaoui, M			Cyclostationary modelling of rotating machine vibration signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							PERIODIC WAVEFORMS; EXTRACTION; GEAR; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS; FAULTS	This paper is dedicated to modelling rotating machine signals as cyclostationary processes, with strong emphasis on the peculiarities and pitfalls that this issue implies. The objective is to demonstrate that machine signals require specific processing that are much more subtle than for communication signals from which the paradigm of cyclostationarity was originally issued from and developed for. First, different types of cyclostationarity embracing a multitude of rotating machine signals are distinguished. In particular, the importance of considering pure rather than impure cyclostationarity is stressed out. Next, the relationships between angle and time cyclostationarity are investigated and some useful results are derived. It is shown that vibration signals exhibit cyclostationarity if and only if the random speed fluctuation of the machine is periodic, stationary or cyclostationary. Finally, a comprehensive methodology is proposed for processing actual cyclostationary signals: three typical examples dealing with vibration signals of an IC engine, a gearbox and a rolling element bearing are presented, each of them being characterised by a different type of cyclostationarity. The methodology proposed in this paper is general enough and may serve as a guideline for modelling and analysing other types of rotating machine signals, such as pressure signals, electric signals, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

It is clinically desirable to predict the axillary lymph node status from data from the mammary cancer specimen. In the study, the axillary lymph node status, routine histological parameters and flow-cytometric data were retrospectively obtained from 1139 specimens of invasive mammary cancer. The ten variables: age, tumour type, tumour grade, tumour size, skin infiltration, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa, pT4 category, percentage of tumour cells in G2/M- and S-phases of the cell cycle, and ploidy index were considered as predictor variables, and the single variable lymph node metastasis pN (0 for pN0, or 1 for pN1 or pN2) was used as an output variable. A stepwise logistic regression analysis, with the axillary lymph node as a dependent variable, was used for feature selection. Only lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour size proved to be significant as independent predictor variables, the other variables were non-contributory. Three paradigms with supervised learning rules (multilayer perceptron, learning vector quantisation and support vector machines) were used for the purpose of prediction. If any of these paradigms was used with the information from all ten input variables, 73% of cases could be correctly predicted, with specificity ranging from 82 to 84% and sensitivity ranging from 60 to 63%. If only the two significant input variables were used, lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour diameter, the prediction accuracy was no worse. Nearly identical results were obtained by two different techniques of cross-validation (leave-one-out against ten-fold cross validation). It was concluded that: artificial neural networks can be used for risk stratification on the basis of routine data in individual cases of mammary cancer; and lymphangiosis carcinomatosa and tumour size are independent predictors of axillary lymph node metastasis in mammary cancer.

J	Debray, K; Bogard, F; Guo, YQ				Debray, K; Bogard, F; Guo, YQ			Numerical vibration analysis on defect detection in revolving machines using two bearing models	ARCHIVE OF APPLIED MECHANICS			English	Article						predictive maintenance; ball bearing; FEM; spectral analysis; defect detection; sensor positioning	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; BALL	Monitoring by vibration measurement and analysis is largely used in the industry for detection of defects in revolving parts of machines. The determination of good sensor positions is one of the main research goals in the field of predictive maintenance. This paper proposes a numerical methodology based on the FEM and spectral analysis in order to find the optimum sensor positions. Bearings are key components in the vibration propagation from moving parts to immobile ones. Two existing nonlinear models of bearings are recalled and implemented in a FE code. The obtained tangent stiffness matrices of bearings are then put in the global system to study the dynamic behaviour. The dynamic response of the whole system under defect excitations is used to determine the optimum sensor placements for the defect detection in the predictive maintenance.

J	Hadjicostis, CN				Hadjicostis, CN			Periodic and non-concurrent error detection and identification in one-hot encoded FSMs	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						fault tolerance; finite-state machines; logic controllers; fault detection and identification; error recovery	FAULT-TOLERANCE; REDUNDANCY; DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	State-transition faults in digital sequential systems, such as finite-state logic controllers, have traditionally been handled by embedding the given system into a larger one, in a way that preserves the state evolution of the original system while enabling an external mechanism to concurrently perform checks to detect, identify and correct errors. In this paper, we develop a methodology for systematically constructing embeddings of one-hot encoded finite-state machines (FSMs) in a way that allows the external mechanism to capture transient state-transition faults via checks that are performed in a non-concurrent manner (e.g., periodically). More specifically, by employing coding techniques over finite fields, we completely characterize an appropriate class of redundant FSM embeddings and its corresponding non-concurrent error-detecting/identifying capabilities. These embeddings can be used to construct a redundant version of the given one-hot encoded FSM so that the external mechanism can detect and identify errors due to past state-transition faults based on an analysis of the current, possibly corrupted FSM state. As a result, the proposed error detection and identification approach relaxes the stringent requirements on the reliability of the checker and avoids the slowdown associated with concurrent checking.

J	Stack, JR; Harley, RG; Habetler, TG				Stack, JR; Harley, RG; Habetler, TG			An amplitude modulation detector for fault diagnosis in rolling element bearings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						amplitude modulation (AM); bearings (mechanical); bispectrum; condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; vibration	MOTORS	The purpose of this research is to identify single-point defects in rolling element bearings. These defects produce characteristic fault frequencies that appear in the machine vibration and tend to modulate the machine's frequencies of mechanical resonance. An amplitude modulation (AM) detector is developed to identify these interactions and detect the bearing fault while it is still in an incipient stage of development (i.e., to detect the instances of AM when the magnitude of the characteristic fault frequency itself is not significant). Use of this detector only requires machine vibration from one sensor and knowledge of the bearing characteristic fault frequencies. Computer simulations as well as machine vibration data from bearings containing outer race faults are used to confirm the proficiency of this proposed technique.

J	Hountalas, DT; Kouremenos, DA; Sideris, M				Hountalas, DT; Kouremenos, DA; Sideris, M			A diagnostic method for heavy-duty diesel engines used in stationary applications	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								The diesel engine is used for power generation in stationary applications especially in isolated areas not connected to the main distribution network due to its relatively high efficiency, durability, and flexibility compared to alternative power sources. The diesel engine can easily follow power fluctuations. For this reason it is widely used for power generation in Islands in Greece. The diesel engine is a complex machine and requires intensive maintenance to insure proper and efficient operation. This is amplified by the interaction between the engine and the exhaust gas turbocharger. The present work describes an advanced troubleshooting method, based mainly on thermodynamics, for stationary engine monitoring and fault detection. The method is based on the processing of measured engine data using a simulation model and provides the current engine condition and its tuning. An application of the method on a slow speed diesel engine used for power generation is presented. The method is applied in the field and the results reveal the condition of the engine and its subsystems. Furthermore, proposals are made to improve engine performance. The method is most useful since it is possible to detect faults at their initial stage that may in the,future result in serious problems and limit the availability of the engine.

The method is being used for identification of dislocations and deformations of transformer windings. This paper presents a novel application regarding possibilities of the frequency response analysis method in electrical machine windings. Of special importance is the early detection of winding failures in electrical machines, both during the manufacturing process and in operation.

J	Bruzelius, K; Mba, D				Bruzelius, K; Mba, D			An initial investigation on the potential applicability of Acoustic Emission to rail track fault detection	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Acoustic Emission; condition monitoring; rail track diagnosis	SPEED ROTATING MACHINERY; FRICTION	In light of recent accidents in the rail industry, the assessment of the mechanical integrity of rail-track is of vital importance. This encompasses the integrity of the track due to rolling contact fatigue and surface wear. Whilst numerous techniques are employed for crack detection, several defects have clearly been missed. In Europe, more than 100 rails are broken each year and rail maintenance costs within the European Union is estimated at 300-million Euros annually [Inst Mech Engrs 216 (2001) 249]. The derailment of a train at Hatfield in October 2000 is a tragic example of a fractured rail going undetected. This paper presents an experimental study on the applicability of Acoustic Emissions (AE) for rail-track defect diagnosis. An experimental test-rig was employed for this programme. This allowed for a surface defect to be seeded onto the test-rig. The investigation presented is part of an on-going attempt to develop the non-destructive technique of AE for assessing the surface integrity of rail-track. The AE technique is not new but the application in this particular instance is unique. It is concluded that the AE technique offers a complementary tool for rail track defect detection.

In order to understand the generation mechanism of these human errors in the circumstances of disturbances and equipment failures, we have developed a cognitive information-processing model incorporating the operator's physical and mental states. The operator model is installed on a PC and connected to a boiler plant simulator for training through a human-machine interface model that we also developed. Using this simulation environment we examine perceptual error in the monitoring mode and cognitive error in fault diagnosis during malfunctions. The simulation results coincide well qualitatively with observations of actual plant operations and simulator training. This operator model can be used to analyze the generation mechanism of various types of human errors from the viewpoint of cognitive information processing. Accordingly, we can study how to prevent human errors and evaluate the effects of various measures by running simulations. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An observer for estimation of synchronous generator damper currents is designed and implemented. The observer-estimator is used in a Graphic User Interface (GUI) application. Possible internal machine fault conditions can be detected and remedial action can be applied. Noise filtering and bad data detection and rejection are implemented to increase the reliability of the estimates. Saturation of the synchronous generator inductances is also considered. Secondary objectives include calculation of the error characteristics of the estimation, development of an index of confidence, study of the observability of generator parameters, and evaluation of alternative GUI features.

J	Nandi, S				Nandi, S			A detailed model of induction machines with saturation extendable for tault analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	38th Annual Meeting of the Industry-Applications-Society	OCT 12-16, 2003	SALT LAKE CITY, UT	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		induction machine; modified winding function approach (MWFA); saturation model	MOTORS; ECCENTRICITY; SIMULATION	A review of the literature suggests that modeling of induction machines with saturation has received considerable attention. Most of these models are very application specific. None of them, however, seems to be completely adequate for the purpose of fault diagnosis. This is because for a noninvasive detection technique such as Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA), one has to detect different frequency components in the line current of the machine. Incorporation of saturation in the induction machine model will help in identifying and analyzing harmonics in the line current spectra that may arise due to the interaction of saturation with a specific fault. The present paper attempts to create such a model. The model uses modulation of air-gap permeance in order to emulate saturation. Modified winding function approach (MWFA) has been used to model the induction machine with saturation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, certain high-frequency harmonics that can be predicted theoretically are shown to be present in the line current of the simulated machine. Experimental results also confirm the presence of these harmonics. The author plans to extend this model in the future for fault analysis.

The algorithm is able to extract the amplitude, phase and frequency of a single sinusoid embedded in a nonstationary waveform. The algorithm is applied to the detection of broken rotor bars in induction machines during startup transients. The fundamental component of current, which varies in amplitude, phase, and frequency, is extracted using the algorithm. The residual current is then analyzed using wavelets for the detection of broken rotor bars. This method of condition monitoring does not require parameters such as speed or number of rotor bars, is not load dependent and can be applied to motors that operate continuously in the transient mode, e.g., wind generators or motor-operated valves.

J	Ganesan, R; Das, TK; Venkataraman, V				Ganesan, R; Das, TK; Venkataraman, V			Wavelet-based multiscale statistical process monitoring: A literature review	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Review							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT; DYNAMIC DATA RECTIFICATION; SENSOR FAULT-DETECTION; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; THRESHOLD RULES; CONTROL CHARTS	Data that represent complex and multivariate processes are well known to be multiscale due to the variety of changes that could occur in a process with different localizations in time and frequency. Examples of changes may include mean shift, spikes, drifts and variance shifts all of which could occur in a process at different times and at different frequencies. Acoustic emission signals arising from machining, images representing MRI scans and musical audio signals are some examples that contain these changes and are not suited for single scale analysis. The recent literature contains several wave let-decomposition-based multiscale process monitoring approaches including many real life process monitoring applications. These approaches are shown to be effective in handling different data types and, in concept, are likely to perform better than existing single scale approaches. There also exists a vast literature on the theory of wavelet decomposition and other statistical elements of multiscale monitoring methods, such as principal components analysis, denoising and charting. To our knowledge, no comprehensive review of the work relevant to multiscale monitoring of both univariate and multivariate processes has been presented to the literature. In this paper, over 150 both published and unpublished papers are cited for this important subject, and some extensions of the current research are also discussed.

J	Sun, R; Tsung, F; Qu, LS				Sun, R; Tsung, F; Qu, LS			Combining bootstrap and genetic programming for feature discovery in diesel engine diagnosis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						bootstrap; genetic programming; classification; fault diagnosis		This paper considers feature discovery in fault diagnosis using bootstrap processing and genetic programming. Bootstrap is one of the powerful computer-simulated statistical techniques. It integrates classical statistics with the numerical calculations of a computer. This paper uses bootstrap to preprocess the operational data acquired from a running machine. Then, genetic programming evolves with the preprocessed data samples. The main aim is to discover an efficient tree-like structure on the basis of a group of simple initial candidate features. The best compound feature found by genetic programming can discriminate among the four kinds of commonly operating statuses of the machine. This novel approach is demonstrated by fault diagnosis of the fuel system in a diesel engine.

By analyzing error (fault) behavior of users and fault-diagnostic relationships of these errors, the authors identified patterns that could be exploited to provide electronic diagnostic assistance. This analysis showed that (a) error behavior differs considerably across end-users; and (b) individual end-users tend to make the same errors over time because they have difficulty identifying the causes of their errors. When viewed in light of the literatures on human-computer interface design and human error/diagnostic behavior, this analysis lead to some general conclusions about how diagnostic systems could be designed to provide better advice. Specifically, the empirical results suggest that diagnostic systems with firing rules based solely upon the aggregated behavior of all users will often provide individual users with poor advice. In contrast, diagnostic support systems could be improved by using user-specific data in the knowledge base. Such a deviation from conventional ideas about knowledge-base development seems consistent with other diagnostic situations, such as medical and machine diagnosis.

J	Mangasarian, OL; Shavlik, JW; Wild, EW				Mangasarian, OL; Shavlik, JW; Wild, EW			Knowledge-based kernel approximation	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						function approximation; regression; prior knowledge; support vector machines; linear programming	BREAST-CANCER DIAGNOSIS; REGRESSION; PROGNOSIS	Prior knowledge, in the form of linear inequalities that need to be satisfied over multiple polyhedral sets, is incorporated into a function approximation generated by a linear combination of linear or nonlinear kernels. In addition, the approximation needs to satisfy conventional conditions such as having given exact or inexact function values at certain points. Determining such an approximation leads to a linear programming formulation. By using nonlinear kernels and mapping the prior polyhedral knowledge in the input space to one defined by the kernels, the prior knowledge translates into nonlinear inequalities in the original input space. Through a number of computational examples, including a real world breast cancer prognosis dataset, it is shown that prior knowledge can significantly improve function approximation.

The observer concepts are based on the mathematical model of the affected structure and can estimate unknown forces with impact character or, for example, friction forces acting on a system. The methods do not need a model of the acting force and can be used, for example, for fault detection, contact model validation, estimation of nonlinear effects or control. In this contribution, the observers are used for fault detection. The methods can detect contacts between rotating and fixed parts by estimating the acting forces on the system. The performance of the observer techniques is shown in simulation and experimental results.

J	Wang, L; Hope, AD				Wang, L; Hope, AD			Bearing fault diagnosis using multi-layer neural networks	INSIGHT			English	Article								This paper presents an investigation into bearing fault diagnosis on centrifugal pumps which can be applied to the waste water industry. After the establishment of a vibration monitoring system in a pumping station, signals were recorded regularly to build up a vibration database for future monitoring. Conventional methods were used to analyse the vibration signals and some bearing defects were successfully detected. However, the major challenge for this project was to use a vibration monitoring system to predict pump bearing faults automatically instead of by analysing the data off-line. This paper proposes a solution based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which is a powerful technique for pattern recognition and can be applied to the classification of pump faults. Due to the long period of time required to obtain essential information from the pumping station for neural network training, a test-rig pump was established in the laboratory to simulate the common pump faults, including typical bearing defects. Bearing faults were simulated by generating pit marks on the bearings using electrical discharge machining (EDM.). Vibration signals in the time-domain were collected and pre-processed to act as the inputs to neural networks. The neural networks were then trained and their classification accuracy rates evaluated. In this study neural network models were designed using the Matlab Neural Network Toolbox and the models which successfully classified the vibration signals were chosen for pump fault diagnosis.

The choice of communication system widely determines the capability and productivity of a factory as a whole. Moreover, in the implementation of CIM systems, the costs associated with the interconnection of the individual CIM components are very important. In CIM, communication is largely used to control programmable manufacturing equipment. Here, the time requirements are high, and error-free data transmission is a necessity. Fieldbuses are special form of local area network dedicated to applications in the field of data acquisition and the control of sensors and actuators in machines or on the factory floor. Many fieldbus standards exist in the market today. Each of them has been invented at different periods by different companies and for different purposes. Controller area network (CAN) is one of the most popular fieldbuses. The highest advantages of CAN are its low cost, abundance of silicon technology, and reliability in networking multiple real-time systems. CAN is a multimaster bus topology and has shown to be very efficient medium for error detection and fault tolerance. CAN's technical specifications are defined in the ISO/OSI network layer spans just two layer of the model. CAN specifies, in many innovative ways, the physical signaling over the media, data formats, timing, error recovery, protocols and arbitration. It does not define the media itself and its connectors, and also the upper layers (usually software) of the model.

The rotating machinery of the Refinery of Milazzo (Italy) was analyzed. A new procedure, incorporating neural networks, was designed and realized to evaluate the vibration signatures and recognize the fault presence. Neural networks have replaced the traditional expert systems, used in the past for the fault diagnosis, because they are a dynamic system and thus adaptable to continuously variable data. The disadvantage of common neural networks is that they need to be trained by real examples of different fault typologies. The innovative aspect of the new procedure is that it allows us to diagnose faults, which are not considered in the training set. This ability was demonstrated by our analysis; the net was able to detect the presence of imbalance and bearing wear, even if these typologies of faults were not present in the training data set.

In this study learning vector quantization (LVQ) of adaptive neural networks has been used to identify faults by relating patterns of fault signatures to their causes. The fault detection system is designed to operate based on steady state and transient responses obtained by monitoring sensitive parameters of an industrial machine. The steady state signal acts as a stimulus. When the signal exceeds a predetermined threshold it will initiate a non-destructive test on the machine during which a transient response of a second sensitive parameter will be captured. This transient pattern will be compared with the database of the patterns of fault signatures. The closest match will determine the cause of fault. The technique has been applied to a computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining centre. The diagnostic system is shown to be capable of first deciding whether the system is healthy or faulty; if faulty, it then decides whether one of the known faults or a novel fault, not seen before, is occurring. Having made the decision that one of the common faults is occurring it is then capable of deciding, from four different levels, the approximate severity level of the fault. In this approach, the use of LVQ significantly reduces the training time period of the network by about 90 per cent as compared to other learning methods such as back propagation (BP).

J	Chiang, LH; Kotanchek, ME; Kordon, AK				Chiang, LH; Kotanchek, ME; Kordon, AK			Fault diagnosis based on Fisher discriminant analysis and support vector machines	COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; support vector machines; fisher discriminant analysis; classification		The proficiencies of Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA), support vector machines (SVM), and proximal support vector machines (PSVM) for fault diagnosis (i.e. classification of multiple fault classes) are investigated. The Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) simulator was used to generate overlapping datasets to evaluate the classification performance. When all variables were used, the datasets were masked with irrelevant information, which resulted in poor classification. With key variables selected by genetic algorithms and the contribution charts, SVM and PSVM outperformed FDA and demonstrated the advantage of using nonlinear technique when data are overlapped. The overall misclassification for the testing data using FDA dropped from 38 to 18%; while those using SVM and PSVM dropped from 44-45 to 6%. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is increased in PSVM by saving significant computation time and memory requirement, while obtaining comparable classification results. For auto-correlated data, the incorporation of time lags into SVM and PSVM improved classification results. The added dimensions decreased the degree to which the data overlap and the overall misclassification for the testing set using SVM and PSVM decreased further to 3%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pennacchi, P; Vania, A				Pennacchi, P; Vania, A			Accuracy in the identification of a generator thermal bow	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Model-based diagnostic techniques can be used to identify the faults that affect rotating machines. In general, the most important faults and malfunctions can be modelled by means of a suitable set of equivalent excitations that are applied to the nodes of a finite element model of the machine rotor train. Weighted least-squares error methods can be used to identify the set of forces and moments that minimize the error between experimental transient vibrations and the rotor system response obtained with the simulating model. However, the accuracy of the fault identification can be significantly influenced by the adequacy of the fault model as well as by the accuracy of the rotating machine model. This paper shows some methods, based on basic statistics, which enable the accuracy of the fault identification to be evaluated. The capabilities of the proposed methods have been proved by the results of the identification of the shaft thermal bow of a power unit generator that exhibited abnormal vibrations during machine coastdowns. The accuracy with which the location and the severity of the fault have been estimated is analyzed. In addition to this, the results obtained by the identification of the actual faults have been compared with those provided by the identification of false faults that cause similar symptoms.

This knowledge is applied to the fault diagnosis of such machines as engines, gearboxes, rolling element bearings, and so on. The development of an effective impulse detection technique is necessary and significant for evaluating the working condition of these machines, diagnosing their malfunctions, and keeping them running normally over prolong periods. With the aid of wavelet transforms, a wavelet-based envelope analysis method is proposed. In order to suppress any undesired information and highlight the features of interest, an improved soft threshold method has been designed so that the inspected signal is analyzed in a more exact way. Furthermore, an impulse detection technique is developed based on the aforementioned methods. The effectiveness of the proposed technique on the extraction of impulsive features of mechanical signals has been proved by both simulated and practical experiments.

Therefore, many surveillance schemes determine the Fourier spectrum of a single line current in order to monitor the motor condition. Mechanical imbalances give rise to two first-order current harmonies. Due to the interaction of the currents and voltages, both these current harmonics are also reflected by a single harmonic component in the frequency spectrum of the electric power. This single component is easier to assess than both the current harmonies. The technique proposed in this contribution evaluates this imbalance-specific modulation of the electric power. The proposed approach does not determine the Fourier spectrum of a time-domain signal, though. First, the imbalance specific oscillation of the electric power is extracted by a bandpass filter. Then, the averaged pattern of this component is determined by means of an angular data clustering technique. In that way, the oscillation of the electric power in the time domain becomes mapped into a discrete waveform in an angular domain. The amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of these discrete data serves as the imbalance indicator of the proposed scheme. This technique, therefore, overcomes small load and slip fluctuations. Measured results of a mechanically unbalanced machine and a case of combined static and dynamic eccentricity are presented.

Both stator winding fault and broken rotor bar detection is covered. Measurement of the resulting high-frequency negative-sequence current is shown to be capable of detecting both types of faults at their incipient stage. Though sharing similar physical principles to techniques applied to line-connected machines, the use of a high-frequency signal is shown to provide important advantages for inverter-fed machines, such as providing the same performance and drastically reduced sensitivity to the working condition of the machine, i.e., torque and flux levels, and fundamental excitation frequency.

J	Wang, WQ; Golnaraghi, MF; Ismail, F				Wang, WQ; Golnaraghi, MF; Ismail, F			Prognosis of machine health condition using neuro-fuzzy systems	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						machine fault prognosis; neuro-fuzzy predictor; recurrent neural networks; wavelet reference function		A reliable machine fault prognostic system can be used to forecast damage propagation trend in rotary machinery and to provide an alarm before a fault reaches critical levels. Currently, there are several techniques available in the literature for time-series prediction. Among the most promising methods are recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and neuro-fuzzy (NF) systems. In this paper, the performance of these two types of predictors is evaluated using two benchmark data sets. Through comparison it is found that if an NF system is properly trained, it performs better than RNNs in both forecasting accuracy and training efficiency. Accordingly, NF system is adopted to develop an on-line machine fault prognostic system. In order to facilitate the automatic monitoring process, reference function approach is proposed here to enhance feature representation. The performance of the developed prognostic system is evaluated by using three test cases including a worn gear, a chipped gear, and a cracked gear, as well as using data sets from previous studies corresponding to a gear pitting damage and a shaft misalignment. From these tests, the NF prognostic system is found to be a very reliable and robust machine health condition predictor. It can capture the system dynamic behaviour quickly and accurately.

J	Hall, LD; Mba, D				Hall, LD; Mba, D			Acoustic emissions diagnosis of rotor-stator rubs using the KS statistic	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Acoustic emission (AE) measurement at the bearings of rotating machinery has become a useful tool for diagnosing incipient fault conditions. In particular, AE can be used to detect unwanted intermittent or partial rubbing between a rotating central shaft and surrounding stationary components. This is a particular problem encountered in turbines used for power generation. For successful fault diagnosis, it is important to adopt AE signal analysis techniques capable of distinguishing between various types of rub mechanisms. It is also useful to develop techniques for inferring information such as the severity of rubbing or the type of seal material making contact on the shaft. It is proposed that modelling the cumulative distribution function of rub-induced AE signals with respect to appropriate theoretical distributions, and quantifying the goodness of fit with the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic, offers a suitable signal feature for diagnosis. This paper demonstrates the successful use of the KS feature for discriminating different classes of shaft-seal rubbing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, JD; Huang, CW; Huang, RW				Wu, JD; Huang, CW; Huang, RW			An application of a recursive Kalman filtering algorithm in rotating machinery fault diagnosis	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; order tracking; adaptive Kalman filter	PROCESS MODEL KNOWLEDGE; REDUNDANCY; SYSTEMS	In this paper, an application of adaptive order tracking fault diagnosis technique based on recursive Kalman filtering algorithm is presented. Order tracking fault diagnosis technique is one of the important tools for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Conventional methods of order tracking are primarily based on Fourier analysis with reference to shaft speed. In this study, a high-resolution order tracking method with adaptive Kalman filter is used to diagnose the fault in a gear set and damaged engine turbocharger wheel blades. The adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm can overcome the problems encountered in conventional methods. The problem is treated as the tracking of frequency-varying bandpass signals. Ordered amplitudes can be calculated with high resolution after experimental implementation. Experiments are also carried out to evaluate the proposed system in gear-set defect diagnosis and engine turbocharger wheel blades damaged under various conditions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective in fault diagnosis of both cases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Instead of following the conventional approach of observing the rotor swings or comparing the critical energy and transient energy at fault clearing time, a new instability detection criterion based on the examination of the line potential energy along post-fault trajectory is developed. The main advantage of this method is that only local dynamic measurements of transmission line variables (power and phase angle differences) are required for detecting first- or multi-swing transient instability. Case studies on the 10 machine 39 bus IEEE test system showed that the proposed method is very effective and opens up new possibilities of studying transient stability and control using local transient network energy.

J	Chow, TWS; Hai, S				Chow, TWS; Hai, S			Induction machine fault diagnostic analysis with wavelet technique	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fault diagnostic; induction machine; narrow filter banks; wavelet analysis	IDENTIFICATION	A wavelets-transform-based method was developed for diagnosing machine faults operating at different rotating speeds. This paper shows that machine fault diagnosis can be effectively performed when an appropriate narrow-band filter is used to extract the required spectra components. A wavelets-transform-based technique is used to design specified narrow filter banks. This enables effective machine fault diagnostic analysis to be performed in the frequency domain. Gaussian-enveloped oscillation-type wavelet is employed. By matching the wavelet basis functions with the associated faulty signals, the required narrow filter banks are obtained. As a result, the detection and diagnosis of machine faults operating at different rotating speeds are made possible. The proposed technique was thoroughly tested at different rotating speeds.

The ability of a neural network to learn non-linear mapping functions has been used for the prediction of machine system parameters using the motion current signature. This approach avoids the need for costly measurement of system parameters. Unlike many neural network based condition monitoring systems, this approach is validated in an off-line proof of concept procedure, using data from an experimental test rig providing conditions typical of those used on production machines. The experiment aims to classify five distinct motor loads using the motion current signature, irrespective of changing tuning parameters. Comparison of the predicted and actual loads shows good agreement. Generation of data covering all anticipated machine states for neural network training, using a production machine, is impractical, and the use of simulated data, generated by an experimentally validated simulation model, is effective.

The most important ingredient in any expert system is knowledge. The current knowledge acquisition method is slow and tedious and there exist substantial difficulties in acquiring the knowledge for complex processes. An approach is proposed that makes use of the machine learning technique, C4.5, to generate a decision tree. The decision tree is translated into rules that are implemented into the expert system shell, G2. The rules are tested using a sensitivity analysis of the system. The approach works well, but depends on both the quality and quantity of available training data.

A common type of outcome prediction is binary or discrete outcome prediction, as found in medical diagnosis and firm bankruptcy prediction. The prediction problem studied in this paper is outcome time prediction, or prognosis. Prognosis in medicine refers to a prediction of probable outcome of a disease for a patient. Patient data used as the basis for disease prognosis are usually censored because some of the patients have not experienced the outcome of the disease at the time of prognosis. A mathematical-programming approach, called isotonic prediction, is developed for the purpose of such prognosis tasks. The proposed technique is different from well-known statistical survival analysis methods, such as Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation and Cox's regression, in that it predicts individual patients' survival time frame. Two medical applications are presented to show the applicability of the proposed isotonic prediction technique.

J	Yesilyurt, I				Yesilyurt, I			The application of the conditional moments analysis to gearbox fault detection - a comparative study using the spectrogram and scalogram	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						time-frequency analysis; spectrogram; scalogram; gear fault; instantaneous energy; mean frequency; median frequency; bandwidth	FREQUENCY; DEMODULATION; AMPLITUDE; FAILURE; LOAD	Time-frequency methods, which can lead to the clear identification of the nature of faults, are widely used to describe machine condition. Capabilities of time-frequency distributions in the detection of any abnormality can further be improved when their low-order frequency moments (or time-dependent parameters), which characterise dynamic behaviour of the observed signal with few parameters, are considered. This paper presents the applications of four time-dependent parameters (e.g. the instantaneous energy, mean and median frequencies, and bandwidth) based upon the use of spectrogram and scalogram, and compares their abilities in the detection and diagnosis of localised and wear gear failures. It has been found that scalogram based parameters are superior to those of a spectrogram in the detection and location of a local tooth defect even when the gear load is small, as they result in equally useful parameters in the revelation of gear wear. Moreover, the global values of these time-dependent parameters are found to be very useful and provide a very good basis for reflecting not only the presence of gear damage, but also any change in operating gear load.

Microarray technology has been particularly successful because of its relatively low cost and high genome coverage. Consequently to our ability to monitor the expression of a significant proportion of an organism genome, our understanding of the molecular dynamics behind cell differentiation and cell response has greatly improved. Molecular signatures associated to immune cells have provided important tools to investigate the molecular basis of diseases and have been often associated to diagnostic and prognostic markers. The availability of such large collection of data has stimulated the application of complex machine learning techniques in the attempt to link molecular signatures and cell physiology. Here we review the most recent developments in the analysis of molecular signatures in the immune system.

J	Chen, CZ; Mo, CT				Chen, CZ; Mo, CT			A method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; neural networks; wavelet transform; feature extraction	NEURAL NETWORKS; RECOGNITION	This paper presents an intelligent methodology for diagnosing incipient faults in rotating machinery. In this fault diagnosis system, wavelet transform techniques are used in combination with a function approximation model to extract fault features. Wavelet neural networks are also constructed. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, a wavelet theory based on a nonlinear adaptive algorithm is developed for an excitation function approximation of neural networks.

The proposed method is based on the computation of the stator and rotor current spectra. An experimental setup for an 11-kW induction machine was developed in order to get numerical data for voltages and currents from the stator side. The comparison between the analytical computation, the simulation, and the experimental results, shows the model capability to reproduce the electromagnetic phenomena in the induction machine with mixed time and space harmonics.

This has lead to the common practice of categorizing bearing faults according to fault location (i.e., inner race, outer race, ball, or cage fault). While the ability to detect the four characteristic fault frequencies is necessary, this approach neglects another important class of faults that arise in many industrial settings. This research introduces the notion of categorizing bearing faults as either single-point defects or generalized roughness. These classes separate bearing faults according to the fault signatures that are produced rather than by the physical location of the fault. Specifically, single-point defects produce the four predictable characteristic fault frequencies while faults categorized as generalized roughness produce unpredictable broadband changes in the machine vibration and stator current. Experimental results are provided from bearings failed in situ via a shaft current. These results illustrate the unpredictable and broadband nature of the effects produced by generalized roughness bearing faults. This issue is significant because a successful bearing condition monitoring scheme must be able to reliably detect both classes of faults.

Current-based condition monitoring offers significant economic savings and implementation advantages over vibration-based techniques. This method begins by filtering the stator current to remove most of the significant frequency content unrelated to bearing faults. Afterwards, the filtered stator current is used to train an autoregressive signal model. This model is first trained while the bearings are healthy, and a baseline spectrum is computed. As bearing health degrades, the modeled spectrum deviates from its baseline value; the mean spectral deviation is then used as the fault index. This fault index is able to track changes in machine vibration due to developing bearing faults. Due to the initial filtering process, this method is robust to many influences including variations in supply voltage, cyclical load torque variations, and other (nonbearing) fault sources. Experimental results from ten different bearings are used to verify the proficiency of this method.

J	Yang, BH; Suh, CS				Yang, BH; Suh, CS			Interpretation of crack-induced rotor non-linear response using instantaneous frequency	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							DECOMPOSITION; AMPLITUDE; SIGNALS	Instantaneous frequency was introduced to describe the dependency of frequency components on time for non-stationary signals. A powerful alternative to the Fourier-based spectral analysis that provides insufficient resolution for the temporal progression of all frequency components, the concept of instantaneous frequency has rarely been applied to machine monitoring and diagnosis. The confusing fact that instantaneous frequencies determined could occasionally be negative and the associated amplitudes could be infinite for certain types of vibration signals inevitably limits the adaptability of the concept to fault detection as a result. Significant insight into the applicability of instantaneous frequency is gained through re-examining the fundamentals upon which the concept was first defined. It is found that the Hilbert-transform-based definition of instantaneous frequency is applicable only to signals of monocomponent, thus implying the need for separating a multicomponent signal into its monocomponent subsets. Misuse of the definition to multicomponent signals would result in the individual instantaneous frequency associated with each inherent monocomponent being averaged and thus obscure the underlying characteristics of the signal. A mathematically complete decomposition scheme effective in resolving a multicomponent signal into an orthogonal space spanned by its intrinsic monocomponents is explored. Several examples are considered to show that the scheme not just enables the removal of the difficulties commonly encountered in applying instantaneous frequency but also imparts valid renditions to the interpretation of fault-induced bifurcation and dynamic instability.

J	Ocak, H; Loparo, KA				Ocak, H; Loparo, KA			Estimation of the running speed and bearing defect frequencies of an induction motor from vibration data	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								This paper presents two separate algorithms for estimating the running speed and the bearing key frequencies of an induction motor using vibration data. Bearing key frequencies are frequencies at which roller elements pass over a defect point. Most frequency domain-based bearing fault detection and diagnosis techniques (e.g. envelope analysis) rely on vibration measurements and the bearing key frequencies. Thus, estimation of the running speed and the bearing key frequencies are required for failure detection and diagnosis. The paper also incorporates the estimation algorithms with the most commonly used bearing fault detection technique, high-frequency demodulation, to detect bearing faults. Experimental data were used to verify the validity of the algorithms. Data were collected through an accelerometer measuring the vibration from the drive-end ball bearing of an induction motor (Reliance Electric 2HP IQPreAlert)-driven mechanical system. Both inner and outer race defects were artificially introduced to the bearing using electrical discharge machining. A linear vibration model was also developed for generating simulated vibration data. The simulated data were also used to validate the performance of the algorithms. The test results proved the algorithms to be very reliable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Samanta, B				Samanta, B			Gear fault detection using artificial neural networks and support vector machines with genetic algorithms	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							VIBRATION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES	A study is presented to compare the performance of gear fault detection using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SMVs). The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective gears are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to both classifiers based on ANNs and SVMs for two-class (normal or fault) recognition. The number of nodes in the hidden layer, in case of ANNs, and the radial basis function kernel parameter, in case of SVMs, along with the selection of input features are optimised using genetic algorithms (GAs). For each trial, the ANNs and SVMs are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The trained ANNs and SVMs are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a gearbox. The roles of different vibration signals, obtained under both normal and light loads, and at low and high sampling rates, are investigated. The results compare the effectiveness of both types of classifiers without and with GA-based selection of features and the classifier parameters. For most of the cases considered, the classification accuracy of SVM is better than ANN, without GA. With GA-based selection, the performance of both classifiers are comparable, in most cases, with three selected features. However, for SVMs with six features, 100% classification success is achieved in all test cases. The training time of SVMs is substantially less compared to ANNs in all cases considered. The present classification accuracy compares well with the results reported in a recent work, (Mech. Systems Signal Process. 16 (2002) 373), though the data and the feature sets are different.

J	Yang, BS; Han, T; An, JL				Yang, BS; Han, T; An, JL			ART-KOHONEN neural network for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						artificial neural network; fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; vibration signal; feature extraction	RECOGNITION	In this paper, a new neural network (NN) for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery which synthesises the theory of adaptive resonance theory (ART) and the learning strategy of Kohonen neural network (KNN), is proposed. For NNs, as the new case occurs, the corresponding data should be added to their dataset for learning. However, the 'off-line' NNs are unable to adapt autonomously and must be retrained by applying the complete dataset including the new data. The ART networks can solve the plasticity-stability dilemma. In other words, they are able to carry out 'on-line' training without forgetting previously trained patterns (stable training); it can recode previously trained categories adaptive to changes in the environment and is self-organising. ART-KNN also holds these characteristics, and more suitable than original ART for fault diagnosis of machinery. In order to test the proposed network, the vibration signal is selected as raw inputs due to its simplicity, accuracy and efficiency. The results of the experiments confirm the performance of the proposed network through comparing with other NNs, such as the self-organising feature maps (SOFMs), learning vector quantisation (LVQ) and radial basis function (RBF) NNs under the same conditions. The diagnosis success rate for the ART-Kohonen network was 100%, while the rates of SOFM, LVQ and RBF networks were 93%, 93% and 89%, respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Parlos, AG; Kim, K; Bharadwaj, RM				Parlos, AG; Kim, K; Bharadwaj, RM			Sensorless detection of mechanical faults in electromechanical systems	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; neural networks; electric motors; wavelet signal processing	INDUCTION MACHINES; SPEED MEASUREMENT	Practical early fault detection and diagnosis systems must exhibit high level of detection accuracy, while exhibiting acceptably low false alarm rates. Further, it is desirable not to make use of add-on sensors, and require minimal information regarding the specific machine component parameters and design. In this paper the development and experimental demonstration of a sensorless detection and diagnosis system is presented for incipient faults in electromechanical systems, such as electric motors. The developed system uses recent developments in dynamic recurrent neural networks and wavelet signal processing. The signals utilized are only the motor currents and voltages, whereas the transient mechanical speed is estimated from these measurements using a recently developed speed filter. The effectiveness of the fault diagnosis system is demonstrated by detecting a wide range of mechanical faults at varying levels of deterioration. Furthermore, the ability of the diagnosis system to discriminate between false alarms and actual incipient failure conditions is demonstrated. Experimental test results from small machines, 2.2 kW, and large machines, 373 and 597 kW, are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach to scale-up with motor power rating.

J	Randall, RB				Randall, RB			State of the art in monitoring rotating machinery - Part 2	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							PHASE DEMODULATION; BEARING FAULTS; VIBRATION; SIGNALS; MODEL; GEAR	In the last thirty years there have been many developments in the use of vibration measurement and analysis for monitoring the condition of rotating machinery while in operation. These have been in all three areas of interest, namely fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis. Of these areas, diagnosis and prognosis still require an expert to determine what analyses to perform and to interpret the results. Currently much effort is being put into automating fault diagnosis and prognosis. Major economic benefits come from being able to predict with reasonable certainty how much longer a machine can safely operate (often a matter of several months from when incipient faults are first detected). This article discusses the different requirements for detecting and diagnosing faults, outlining a robust procedure for the former, and then goes on to discuss a large number of signal processing techniques that have been proposed for diagnosing both the type and severity of the faults once detected. Change in the severity can of course be used for prognostic purposes. Most procedures are illustrated using actual signals from case histories.

An observer for estimation of synchronous machine damper currents is designed. The observer-estimator is used in a graphical user interface (GUI) application. Possible internal machine fault conditions can be detected and remedial action can be undertaken. It is desired that an algorithm be developed such that it will enable bad measurement detection and rejection so as to increase the reliability of the results. Secondary objectives include calculation of the error characteristics of the estimation; development of an index of confidence; study of which machine parameters can be estimated, and which cannot; and evaluation of alternative GUI features.

In the case of helicopter gearboxes, there is a very wide range of shaft frequencies between input and output, and the associated gearmesh frequencies cover the whole audio frequency range. Techniques have thus been developed to separate the gear signals from the bearing signals, based on their different statistical properties. Other techniques have been developed to separate gear and bearing effects even when they are combined multiplicatively rather than additively. The techniques are illustrated using case history data obtained from the US Navy, from faults in three helicopter gearboxes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a SIFT environment used to oversee spaceborne applications as part of the Remote Exploration and Experimentation (REE) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The SIFT environment is built around a set of self-checking ARMOR processes running on different machines that provide error detection and recovery services to themselves and to the REE applications. An evaluation methodology is presented in which over 28,000 errors were injected into both the SIFT processes and two representative REE applications. The experiments were split into three groups of error injections, with each group successively stressing the SIFT error detection and recovery more than the previous group. The results show that the SIFT environment added negligible overhead to the application's execution time during failure-free runs. Correlated failures affecting a SIFT process and application process are possible, but the division of detection and recovery responsibilities in the SIFT environment allows it to recover from these multiple failure scenarios. Only 28 cases were observed in which either the application failed to start or the SIFT environment failed to recognize that the application had completed.

The proposed method has the advantage of dealing with complicated signatures, such as those present in the vibration signals of rolling element bearings with and without defects. The signature varies with the location and severity of bearing defects, load and speed of the shaft and different bearing housing structures. More specifically, the the proposed technique contains effective feature extraction, good learning ability, reliable feature fusion, and a simple classification algorithm. Examples with experimental testing data were used to illustrate the idea and effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Jung, JC; Chang, YW; Seong, PH				Jung, JC; Chang, YW; Seong, PH			Application of an integrated power line signal analysis methodology to the detection of major rotating machine abnormalities in nuclear power plants	NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN			English	Article							INDUCTION MACHINES; FAULT-DETECTION	An integrated and improved method to detect and identify the abnormality of motor driven rotating machinery in nuclear power plants (NPPs) using power line signal analysis is suggested in this work. The primary goal of this work is to improve the motor current signature analysis (MCSA) method that has been used as an alternative or supplement of the conventional vibration monitoring system (VMS). Through this work, the integrated system using both modulated flux density model (MFDM) and rotating flux model (RFM) is proposed. The MFDM is based on the fact that the major mechanical vibration of rotating machines can be normalized to the motor air-gap eccentricity and the modulation of air-gap flux density. Therefore, if the major defect such as bearing defect or the shaft deformation is present, it is identifiable through the power line signal resulting from the modulated magnetic density. Moreover, the broken rotor bar state or rotor eccentricity due to electrical imbalance can be analyzed using the RFM. The other important feature of this system is an automated abnormality detection and diagnosis algorithm. It is possible to diagnose the abnormality without relying on experts in NPPs. The verification is done through varying load/torque test experiment as well as via computer simulation in this work. The experimental results show that they are in good agreement with the simulated results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chu, YH; Qin, SJ; Han, CH				Chu, YH; Qin, SJ; Han, CH			Fault detection and operation mode identification based on pattern classification with variable selection	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MONITORING BATCH PROCESSES; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PERFORMANCE; CHARTS	A novel method is proposed for fault detection and operation mode identification in processes with multimode operations. The proposed method employs the support vector machine as a classification tool together with an entropy-based variable selection method to deal with normal data clusters corresponding to multiple operational modes and abnormal data corresponding to faults. The use of the classification method in fault detection and operation mode identification allows us to build decision boundaries among the data clusters without the assumption of normal distribution. In addition, selection of variables by minimizing the total entropy of training data ensures superior generalization performance in classification. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the traditional PCA-based fault detection method using test data where class information is already known. While the existing method has produced considerable error rate (1.9% by T-2 chart and 24.2% by Q chart) in detecting faults, the proposed method has shown no error in this example in either fault detection or operation mode identification. Despite these outstanding results, it should be noted that the performance of the proposed method depends critically on the quality of the training data.

J	Molla, M; Waddell, M; Page, D; Shavlik, J				Molla, M; Waddell, M; Page, D; Shavlik, J			Using machine learning to design and interpret gene-expression microarrays	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							OLIGONUCLEOTIDE ARRAYS; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY	Gene-expression microarrays, commonly called gene chips, make it possible to simultaneously measure the rate at which a cell or tissue is expressing-translating into a protein-each of its thousands of genes. One can use these comprehensive snapshots of biological activity to infer regulatory pathways in cells; identify novel targets for drug design; and improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning for those suffering from disease. However, the amount of data this new technology produces is more than one can manually analyze. Hence, the need for automated analysis of microarray data offers an opportunity for machine learning to have a significant impact on biology and medicine. This article describes microarray technology, the data it produces, and the types of machine learning tasks that naturally arise with these data. It also reviews some of the recent prominent applications of machine learning to gene-chip data, points to related tasks where machine learning might have a further impact on biology and medicine, and describes additional types of interesting data that recent advances in biotechnology allow biomedical researchers to collect.

The time domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to all three ANN classifiers: MLP, RBF, and PNN for two-class (normal or fault) recognition. The characteristic parameters like number of nodes in the hidden layer of MLP and the width of RBF, in case of RBF and PNN along with the selection of input features, are optimized using genetic algorithms (GA). For each trial, the ANNs are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions. The ANNs are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a rotating machine with and without bearing faults. The results show the relative effectiveness of three classifiers in detection of the bearing condition.

However, various faults can occur, such as stator short-circuit and rotor failures. We focus our study on the latter since the unknown evolution of currents in the squirrel cage makes the detection of the rotor's failures very difficult. In this paper we first present the effects of the rotor failures by means of a finite element model. In the second part we, present our strategy of monitoring for this kind of fault. We synthesize a so-called 'reduced-order extended high-gain observer' which follows the on-line evolution of an equivalent rotor resistance using a Park model. It provides an on-line alarm. However, this parameter is not enough to indicate the presence of an actual fault, thus we synthesize an extended Kalman filter to survey the three rotor resistances of a three-phase model. This provides an off-line analysis by verifying the balanced state of the rotor resistances. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

When the motor is disconnected from the supply no currents flow in the stator windings and the voltages measurable at its terminals are due to flux produced by rotor currents. When the rotor is healthy, the voltages measured at motor terminals are almost sinusoidal because of the symmetry of rotor windings. When there are broken rotor bars, the magnetomotive force generated by rotor windings is distorted, and some particular harmonics, contained in the voltages induced in the stator windings, increase their amplitudes. The diagnostic technique is based on monitoring these voltage harmonics and analyzing the space vector of the voltages induced in the stator windings via MUSIC pseudospectrum and short-time MUSIC (STMUSIC) time-frequency pseudorepreentation. The MUSIC algorithm is based on the eigen analysis of the autocorrelation matrix, and permits us to evidence the principal harmonic frequencies of the signal and decrease the noise influence, thus allowing a better detection of the broken rotor bars. The results obtained using MUSIC and STMUSIC algorithm have been compared experimentally with those obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and short-time FFT, respectively, and two different sized induction motors have been tested, to demonstrate the superiority of the former approach. Differently from most of the diagnostic techniques already proposed in the technical literature, the proposed approach is effective regardless of the load condition of the machine, source characteristics, and iron saturation.

In this technique, stator currents and voltages are used as inputs to compute and subsequently observe the rotor magnetic field orientation, which has a more significant "swing-like" pendulous oscillation in case of broken-bar faults than in healthy operation. It will be shown here that the range of this "pendulous oscillation" is a function of the number of broken bars. Also in this technique, it was found that an inter-turn shorted stator-winding fault, which exhibits similar pendulous oscillation, could be distinguished from rotor broken-bar faults through the use of a variance index. In order to validate this method, experimental evidence is given here for several broken-bar cases in a 2-hp three-phase two-pole squirrel-cage induction machine.

J	Huang, WZ; Kong, ZY; Ceglarek, D; Brahmst, E				Huang, WZ; Kong, ZY; Ceglarek, D; Brahmst, E			The analysis of feature-based measurement error in coordinate metrology	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; VARIATION REDUCTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; COMPENSATION	Coordinate measurement systems (CMSs) dominate the dimensional control and diagnostics of various manufacturing processes. However, CMSs have inherent errors caused by the lack of a tracing ability for some of the measured part features. This is important for product inspection and process variation reduction in a number of automated manufacturing systems, such as for example the automotive body assembly process. The lack of a feature tracing ability means that instead of measuring a given feature, the CMS may actually measure the area around the selected feature. In this paper, a principle for the part feature tracing ability and the resultant feature-based measurement error analysis are developed to estimate the aforementioned deficiencies in the CMSs. The impact of feature type and part(s) positional variation on the feature-based measurement error is explored. The proposed approach is applicable to both contact and non-contact CMSs including both mechanical and optical coordinate measuring machines. An analysis of the error for different measurement algorithms is presented. We show that the developed feature-based measurement error can have a significant impact on the measurement accuracy and hence on process control and the diagnostic algorithms currently used in manufacturing. A feature-based error map and error compensation approach are also developed and presented. Simulations, experimental results and two industrial case studies illustrate the proposed method.

It is, therefore, difficult to detect directly the generation of grinding faults such as chatter vibration and burning. In this paper, to achieve the development of an intelligent diagnostic technique for chatter vibration and burning phenomena on grinding process, acoustic emission signals were processed and signal parameters of the acoustic emission were also determined. In addition, a neural network was used as a diagnostic technique of the grinding state. A momentum coefficient, learning rate, and structure of the hidden layer were determined during the iterative learning process and the performance of the diagnostic technique was evaluated.

The normal breakdowns of marine machinery and the frequency of planned maintenance are based mainly on the operators who ensure that such breakdowns are minimized. To achieve such objectives an optimum maintenance goal must be adopted using various types of computer software for expert systems with high processing speed which have been developed to aid fault or failure diagnosis. Such systems are at different stages of application. In this paper, a typical expert system for condition monitoring, budgeting, and spare part management to enhance the optimum management of a marine power plant is presented. The use of this technique with known models will substantially reduce downtime and fully utilize the technical crew onboard and ashore. From the author's experience in the management of ferries, there is an optimum amount of maintenance effort for any given condition.

J	Peng, ZK; Chu, FL				Peng, ZK; Chu, FL			Application of the wavelet transform in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics: a review with bibliography	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review							FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CRACK DETECTION; VIBRATION SIGNALS; DAMAGE DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TRANSIENT VIBRATION; ROTATING MACHINERY; DENSITY-ESTIMATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; ROTOR SYSTEM	The application of the wavelet transform for machine fault diagnostics has been developed for last 10 years at a very rapid rate. A review on all of the literature is certainly not possible. The purpose of this review is to present a summary about the application of the wavelet in machine fault diagnostics, including the following main aspects: the time-frequency analysis of signals, the fault feature extraction, the singularity detection for signals, the denoising and extraction of the weak signals, the compression of vibration signals and the system identification. Some other applications are introduced briefly as well, such as the wavelet networks, the wavelet-based frequency response function, etc. In addition, some problems in using the wavelet for machine fault diagnostics are analysed. The prospects of the wavelet analysis in solving non-linear problems are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vania, A; Pennacchi, P				Vania, A; Pennacchi, P			Experimental and theoretical application of fault identification measures of accuracy in rotating machine diagnostics	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Model-based diagnostic techniques can be used successfully in the health analysis of rotormachinery. Unfortunately, a poor accuracy of the model of the fully assembled machine, as well as errors in the evaluation of the experimental vibrations caused only by the impending fault, can affect the accuracy of fault identifications. This can make difficult to identify the type of the actual fault as well as to evaluate its severity and its position. This paper shows some methods that have been developed to measure the accuracy of the results obtained with model-based techniques aimed to identify faults in rotating machines. The testing of the capabilities of these methods is carried out using both machine response simulated with mathematical models and experimental data on a real machine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The usually imprecise boundaries of the equipments' operational envelope provide opportunities for two major improvements in the operations and maintenance (O&M) of process machinery: (a) the actual versus intended machine environment can be understood and brought into much better alignment and (b) the end goal can define O&M strategies in terms of life cycle and economic management of plant assets. Scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have performed experiments aimed at understanding and controlling aging of both safety-specific nuclear plant components and the infrastructure that supports essential plant processes. In this paper we examine the development of aging precursor metrics and their correlation with degradation rate and projected machinery failure. Degradation-specific correlations have been developed at PNNL that will allow accurate physics-based diagnostic and prognostic determinations to be derived from a new view of condition-based maintenance. This view, founded in root cause analysis, is focused on quantifying the primary stressor(s) responsible for degradation in the component of interest and formulating a deterministic relationship between the stressor intensity and the resulting degradation rate. This precursive relationship between the performance, degradation, and underlying stressor set is used to gain a first-principles approach to prognostic determinations. A holistic infrastructure approach, as applied through a conditions-based maintenance framework, will allow intelligent, automated diagnostic and prognostic programming to provide O&M practitioners with an understanding of the condition of their machinery today and an assurance of its operational state tomorrow.

J	Randall, RB				Randall, RB			State of the art in monitoring rotating machinery - Part 1	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							BEARING	In the last thirty years there have been many developments in the use of vibration measurement and analysis for monitoring the condition of rotating machinery while in operation. These have been in all three areas of interest, namely fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis. Of these areas, diagnosis and prognosis still require an expert to determine what analyses to perform and to interpret the results. Currently much effort is being put into automating fault diagnosis and prognosis. Major economic benefits come from being able to predict with reasonable certainty how much longer a machine can safely operate (often a matter of several months from when incipient faults are first detected). This article discusses the different requirements for detecting and diagnosing faults, outlining a robust procedure for the former, and then goes on to discuss a large number of signal processing techniques that have been proposed for diagnosing both the type and severity of the faults once detected. Change in the severity can of course be used for prognostic purposes. Most procedures are illustrated using actual signals from case histories. Part 2 of this article will appear in the May 2004 issue of SV.

J	Moster, PC				Moster, PC			Gear fault detection and classification using learning machines	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								This article demonstrates that a machine can learn to distinguish different types of faults in gear motors after being shown only a few examples. Simulated cracks were introduced into the gear trains of a group of identical gear motors, and each was instrumented with an accelerometer. Pairs of motors had cracked gears installed in the same position in their trains, allowing one motor to be used as an example, while the second motor was used to test the success in learning. Demodulation techniques were applied to the accelerometer signals, then the modulation frequency spectra were used as input to a learning machine. First, we show the machine the spectra of a set of motors with damaged gears installed at several different positions in the motor's gear train, then demonstrate that it correctly classifies a different set of motors with damaged gears in the same positions. Next, we train the machine with a small set of motors with no gear damage, then show that it accurately distinguishes motors with no gear damage from those with gear damage in any position.

J	DeVantier, L; Alcala, A; Wilkinson, C				DeVantier, L; Alcala, A; Wilkinson, C			The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea: Environmental and socioeconomic status, future prognosis and ameliorative policy options	AMBIO			English	Article							MARINE RESERVES; CORAL-REEFS; BIODIVERSITY; RECOVERY; IMPACTS; OCEAN; FISH	The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea, with neighboring Indonesian Seas and South China Sea, lies at the center of the world's tropical marine biodiversity. Encircled by 3 populous, developing nations, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Sea and its adjacent coastal and terrestrial ecosystems, supports ca. 33 million people, most with subsistence livelihoods heavily reliant on its renewable natural resources. These resources are being impacted severely by rapid population growth (> 2% yr(-1), with expected doubling by 2035) and widespread poverty, coupled with increasing international market demand and rapid technological changes, compounded by inefficiencies in governance and a lack of awareness and/or acceptance of some laws among local populations, particularly in parts of the Philippines and Indonesia. These key root causes all contribute to illegal practices and corruption, and are resulting in severe resource depletion and degradation of water catchments, river, lacustrine, estuarine, coastal, and marine ecosystems. The Sulu-Sulawesi Sea forms a major geopolitical focus, with porous borders, transmigration, separatist movements, piracy, and illegal fishing all contributing to environmental degradation, human suffering and political instability, and inhibiting strong trilateral support for interventions. This review analyzes these multifarious environmental and socioeconomic impacts and their root causes, provides a future prognosis of status by 2020, and recommends policy options aimed at amelioration through sustainable management and development.

J	Nait-Said, N; Nait-Said, MS; Bouguechal, N				Nait-Said, N; Nait-Said, MS; Bouguechal, N			Rotor resistance estimation of an induction motor to detect broken bars fault using H-H method	ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						induction motor; broken bars; rotor resistance estimation; reactive power; H-G diagram; H-H method		This paper presents a new approach, using a new technique we have called "H-H method," for on-line broken bars detection in induction motors based on rotor parameters estimation from reactive power processing. The hypothesis, on which the detection is based, is that the apparent rotor resistance increases when a rotor bar breaks. To detect broken bars, the processing of reactive power, which is evaluated from the stator terminal measurements, gives by means of H-H method, very quite satisfactory on-line information on rotor parameters evolution. Therefore, the estimated rotor resistance is instantly increased in real time and we can have two values of resistances after and before bar breakage. The proposed method is simpler with a good robustness, and it requires less computing time than the methods based on the observers conducted from induction machine modeling such as the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) approach. Since it is only based on the reactive power analysis, its main advantage is that it gives always solution on broken bars information even for an unloaded induction motor. Computer simulations, carried out for a 4 kW four-pole squirrel cage induction motor, provide an encouraging validation of the proposed on-line broken bars detection method.

An efficient condition monitoring scheme is capable of providing warning and predicting the faults at early stages. The monitoring system obtains information about the machine in the form of primary data and through the use of modern signal processing techniques; it is possible to give vital information to equipment operator before it catastrophically fails. The suitability of a signal processing technique to be used depends upon the nature of the signal and the required accuracy of the obtained information. Therefore, in this paper, signals obtained from monitoring system have been processed using wavelet transform (WT) with suitably modified algorithms to extract detailed information for induction machine fault diagnosis. The results of this investigation depict that the application of WT for processing and analysis of the vibration signal to different frequency regions in time domain improves the extraction of the information that can enhance the ability of the system for diagnosis.

J	Eltabach, M; Charara, A; Zein, I				Eltabach, M; Charara, A; Zein, I			A comparison of external and internal methods of signal spectral analysis for broken rotor bars detection in induction motors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; induction motors; Kalman filtering; observers; spectral analysis; state estimation		Like all mechanical devices, motors are subject to failures, which can sometimes lead to the shutting down of an entire industrial process. This paper looks at failure predictions in three-phase line-operated induction machines through spectral analysis of electric and electromagnetic signals. Fault characteristics frequencies generated in the estimated and the measured signal spectrum, as a result of mechanical abnormalities such as broken rotor bars, are analyzed. Spectral analyses of simple stator current, of the current's Park vector modulus, and of total and partial instantaneous electric powers are considered as external diagnosis. Internal methods of diagnosis are usually based on it mathematical model of the motor. This requires knowledge of the motor's electrical parameters, which are affected by a number of physical phenomena such as temperature variations, skin effects, core losses, and saturation. As internal diagnosis, we examine different approaches to the spectral analysis of electromagnetic torque computed by stator and rotor flux estimation. To this end, the open loop method, the Luenberger observer and the Kalman filter are employed. Finally, experimental results enable us to draw up a table of comparison of internal and external methods in the detection of, rotor imperfections, using two criteria under different load levels.

J	Wu, ST; Chow, TWS				Wu, ST; Chow, TWS			Induction machine fault detection using SOM-based RBF neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						cell-splitting grid (CSG); extent of fault; machine fault detection; radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network; self-organizing map (SOM)	DIAGNOSIS	A radial-basis-function (RBF) neural-network-based fault detection system is developed for performing induction machine fault detection and analysis. Four feature vectors are extracted from power spectra of machine vibration signals. The extracted features are inputs of an RBF-type neural network for fault identification and classification. The optimal network architecture of the RBF network is determined automatically by our proposed cell-splitting grid algorithm. This facilitates the conventional laborious trial-and-error procedure in establishing an optimal architecture. In this paper, the proposed RBF machine fault diagnostic system has been intensively tested with unbalanced electrical faults and mechanical faults operating at different rotating speeds. The proposed system is not only able to detect electrical and mechanical faults, but the system is also able to estimate the extent of faults.

The selection of measurements in Multi-station machining systems is currently a slow and error-prone process based on expert human knowledge. In this paper, we propose systematic procedures for synthesizing measurement schemes that carry the most information about the root causes of dimensional machining errors. The amount of root cause information conveyed by a given set of measurements was assessed using the recently introduced formal methods for quantitative characterization of measurement schemes in multi-station machining systems. The newly proposed measurement scheme synthesis procedures were applied to devising measurement schemes in an automotive cylinder head machining process. It was observed that the measurement scheme synthesis procedure based on a genetic algorithm robustly outperformed the synthesis procedures based on the heuristics of successive measurement removal.

J	Shao, Y; Nezu, K				Shao, Y; Nezu, K			Extracting symptoms of bearing faults in the wavelet domain	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Improving the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio is one of the classic machinery failure diagnostic problems. A new failure detection procedure using a wavelet-based estimator is proposed for extracting the symptoms of bearing faults under environmental noise conditions. The paper discusses the relationship between de-noising efficiency and S/N ratio under different threshold values and wavelet decompositions. Efficient ranges of wavelet coefficients and levels of wavelet decomposition for extracting the symptoms of bearing faults are obtained. A comparison of the failure detection capabilities of an envelope detector and a wavelet-based estimator under significant environmental noise is performed and the results show that the wavelet-based estimator is an effective method for extracting the symptoms of a bearing fault under such conditions.

Several MBTG approaches extract a Finite State Machine (FSM) from a given model, and use structural (mostly transition) coverage of the extracted FSM as a test selection criteria. In this paper, we demonstrate inadequacy of structural coverage criteria, and propose a set of test selection criteria for extracted FSMs. Our models are described in terms of operations provided by the system under test (SUT). Each operation is specified as a set of possible results each with a guard condition and a set of update actions on its parameters and the system state. The proposed test selection criteria are based on (1) mutations of guard conditions and update actions, (2) concept of a session, which targets errors of SUT not committing the updated system state to persistent storage, and (3) 2-Way coverage of Independent operations available in a given FSM state. We describe an Al Planning based algorithm for finding a sequence of operation invocations to satisfy our proposed test selection criteria. We illustrate our test selection criteria, and report results of a case study which compares fault detection capability of our proposed test selection criteria with that of structural criteria.

Such prediction models are especially beneficial for large-scale systems, where verification experts need to focus their attention and resources to problem areas in the system under development. This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting fault prone modules, based on random forests. Random forests are an extension of decision tree learning. Instead of generating one decision tree, this methodology generates hundreds or even thousands of trees using subsets of the training data. Classification decision is obtained by voting. We applied random forests in five case studies based on NASA data sets. The prediction accuracy of the proposed methodology is generally higher than that achieved by logistic regression, discriminant analysis and the algorithms in two machine learning software packages, WEKA [32] and See5 [5]. The difference in the performance of the proposed methodology over other methods is statistically significant. Further the classification accuracy of random forests is more significant over other methods in larger data sets.

We aim at detecting faults that manifest themselves as permanent changes in the next-state transition functionality of the FSM. Fault diagnosis is performed by an external observer/diagnoser that functions as an FSM and which has access to the input sequence applied to the system but has only limited access to the system state or output. In particular, we assume that the observer/diagnoser is only able to obtain partial information regarding the state of the system at irregular time intervals that are determined by certain synchronizing conditions between the system and the observer/diagnoser. By adopting a probabilistic framework, we analyze ways to optimally choose these synchronizing conditions and develop adaptive strategies that achieve a low probability of aliasing, i.e., a low probability that the external observer/diagnoser incorrectly declares the system as fault-free.

First.. a simplified rotator (electric machinery) is represented by a differential equation model. The equation can express the various types of unusual or fault conditions of rotator by selecting parameter values. Next, two high resolution time-frequency representations (prescribed minimum square error criteria and minimum cross-entropy criteria) obtained by a set of multiple windows of discrete-time short-time Fourier transform are shown. By implementing as Madab/SimuLink software systems. various conditions of rotator such as misalignment bearing are analyzed by the high resolution time-frequency methods. Further. the actual pump is diagnosed to show the effectiveness of our method.

Two specific techniques that can be used to extract knowledge and rules for fault prediction are discussed. These techniques are based on the analysis of historical data gathered by the MDS. The paper further elaborates on knowledge based real-time failure prediction and recommends a diagnostics-to-prognostics approach that enables traditional reactive MDS to be transformed into proactive health management (PHM) systems.

But the main difficulty is to detect the characteristic frequency component specific to the defect. Many technics are devoted with the spectral analysis but the most commun problem is the spectral resolution in term of frequency. Classically, the motor has to operate under steady state and under nominal conditions. In order to get rid of these constraints, we proposed in this paper a practical approach for the detection of rotor fault in induction motor. This method is based both on the double analysis of the stator current and of the voltage induced in case of rotor defect. Both the current and voltage distortion show up significant information about the squirrel-cage quality. Several experimental results coming from tests are presented and highlight the effectiveness of this approach.

Also, some compact modelling approaches are described such as the electrical and thermal behavior models used for the parameter estimation diagnosis method, and the pattern recognition approach. These different modelling and diagnosis methods are tested in the case of the broken rotor bars fault.

C	Curry, T; Behbahani, A			ieee	Curry, T; Behbahani, A			Propulsion directorate/control and engine health management (CEHM): Real-time turbofan engine simulation	2004 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 06-13, 2004	Big Sky, MT	Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE				As the interest in intelligent engine technology increases so does the demand for advanced methods of engine model simulation. Undoubtedly, this element is very cost effective, in that, it can decrease test and experimentation hours significantly. In order to extract more meaningful information for analysis, model simulation must be conducted in a real-time environment. The Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (MAPSS) is a generic turbofan engine simulation derived from FORTRAN-based coding developed at NASA Glenn Research Center. It is a non-real time, multi-rate system composed of the Controller and Actuator Dynamics (CAD) and Component Level Model (CLM) modules, representing the digital controller and engine, respectively. This paper discusses the implementation and simulation of the MAPSS model in a real-time environment. The controller and engine are loaded on two separate simulators with data transfer between the two systems via a set of electrical cables. This analysis platform encompasses all of the aspects of a real-time environment with plant and sensor noise. The real-time implementation is validated against the non-real time simulation through transient and steady-state conditions. Key parameters of comparison are the three states of the engine, low pressure spool speed (XNL), high pressure spool speed (XNH), and core metal temperature (TMPC), and burner fuel flow (WF36) and net thrust (FN). It is observed with each parameter that the average percent error is less than 1%. Thus, a successful real-time implementation is achieved while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. The model's behavior now approximates a real gas turbine and provides an ideal test bed for observing faults and failures, engine parameter variations, and degradation over time. This in turn provides a valuable tool in observing the symptoms of failure, developing diagnostics routines, and improving prognostic algorithms.

In the case of mechanical systems undergoing progressive failures such as fatigue, the dynamic range of phenomena is vast (e.g. from 10(-3)s to 10(6)s). Therefore, the connectivity manifests itself in the dynamics of the degradation process. Our analysis of this process distinguishes two distinct forms of coupling: cascade coupling, in which one part triggers the failure of another, and feedback coupling, in which two parts mutually affect the degradation of each other. We present a simple model which captures these effects on the failure prognosis for coupled systems, which is appropriate for on-line use in PHM systems. The model governs the evolution of the stochastic, hybrid "damage" state of each subsystem (i.e. a combination continuous and discrete state). The discrete states are represent the dynamic regimes of the well-known "bathtub curve" for failure. The continuous state represents a overall damage metric for the device. Within a regime, the degradation dynamics are linear system with stochastic inputs, and coupling dynamics which switch with the discrete states of other subsystems. The coupling sensitivity parameters must be obtained via experimentation or modeling. The model possesses a number of useful features including failure time statistics remarkably similar to those in real systems as typically fit with a Weibull distribution. Further, the hybrid model structure separates the effect of coupling from the effects of the part in isolation, making it possible to use unit tests to tune many of the model parameters. An example of using this model to represent the coupled failures within a gearbox is outlined.

C	Wegerich, SW			ieee	Wegerich, SW			Similarity based modeling of time synchronous averaged vibration signals for machinery health monitoring	2004 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-6	IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 06-13, 2004	Big Sky, MT	Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, IEEE				Monitoring rotating machinery is often accomplished with the aid of vibration sensors. The vibration sensor signals contain a wealth of complex information that characterizes the dynamic behavior of the machinery. Transforming this information into useful knowledge about the health of the machine can be challenging due to the presence of extraneous noise sources and variations in the vibration signal itself. This is particularly true in situations in which the rotating machinery is monitored under varying loads and/or speeds. In order for any gained knowledge or insight into the health of machinery to be useful, it must be actionable. This is achieved by detecting incipient faults as early as possible. A novel approach to vibration monitoring that employs a multivariate similarity-based modeling (SBM) technique to characterize the expected behavior of time synchronous averaged spectral features is shown to enable the detection in rotating machinery. This in tum facilitates the assessment of machine health and enables fault diagnostics and ultimately prognostics. SBM has been applied successfully to a variety of nonvibration related multi-sensor, health monitoring applications. Our new approach builds off of these experiences and a combination of signal processing algorithms to expand the overall applicability of SBM into single sensor vibration monitoring. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to gearbox fault monitoring using vibration data and SBM. This new approach is described in detail and is applied to actual H-60 gearbox vibration data acquired from seeded fault tests conducted by U.S. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) at the Helicopter Transmission Test Facility (HTTF) in Patuxent River, MD in 2001 and 2002.

Boeing's role as a system integrator has motivated this effort to reduce the development and integration cost of VHM systems and to achieve a higher level of performance that includes totally integrated diagnostics and prognostic capabilities. The development of this architecture was begun by an industry consortium lead by Boeing under a Navy Dual Use Science and Technology program. This program was entitled Open System Architecture for Condition Based Maintenance (OSACBM), and it has been continued under the auspices of the Machinery Information Management Open Systems Alliance (MIMOSA). The rewards and challenges of introducing this VI-IM open architecture into the system development and business processes are described.

We present a new computational method for outcome prediction. Our idea is to use an informative subset of original training samples. This subset consists of only short-term survivors who died within a short period and long-term survivors who were still alive after a long follow-up time. These extreme training samples yield a clear platform to identify genes whose expression is related to survival. To find relevant genes, we combine two feature selection methods - entropy measure and Wilcoxon rank sum test - so that a set of sharp discriminating features are identified The selected training samples and genes are then integrated by a support vector machine to build a prediction model, by which each validation sample is assigned a survival/relapse risk score for drawing Kaplan-Meier survival curves. We apply this method to two data sets: diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and primary lung adenocarcinoma. In both cases, patients in high and low risk groups stratified by our risk scores are clearly distinguishable. We also compare our risk scores to some clinical factors, such as International Prognostic Index score for DLBCL analysis and tumor stage information for lung adenocarcinoma. Our results indicate that gene expression profiles combined with carefully chosen learning algorithms can predict patient survival for certain diseases.

Thus, we have been developing a robust multi-parameter, multi-scheme knowledge-based optimization system that integrates the strengths of statistics, pattern-recognition, and support vector machines (SVM). The optimization logic identifies optimal cancer signature genes by utilizing different analysis models based on unsupervised and supervised clustering.

The proposed algorithm uses the stator current and motor speed as inputs. Fast Fourier Transform is utilized to obtain the frequency spectrum of the current signal. An efficient algorithm is then used to extract suitable features out of the frequency spectrum of the signal. The relevance of the features for the purpose of fault detection is investigated and verified. A neural network classifier is then developed and applied to distinguish different motor conditions. A series of data collected from experiments on a three phase 3 hp cage induction machine performed in different load and fault conditions are used to provide data for training and then testing the classifier. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for detection of broken bar faults.

This approach takes advantage of system structure to reduce computational complexity. Here, the system model is broken into simpler substructures called D-holons. A diagnoser is constructed for each D-holon. At any given time, only a subset of the diagnosers are active, and as a result, instead of the entire model of the system, only the models of D-holons associated with active diagnosers are used for diagnosis. Furthermore, a set of sufficient conditions is provided under which the diagnosis process becomes semi-modular. The ozone generation plant under study, consisting of two units, is modeled as an HFSM. It is shown that a proper choice of sensors results in modular diagnosis (one diagnoser for each unit). Following the proposed framework, a hierarchical fault diagnosis system is designed for the plant. It is shown that the proposed approach significantly reduces the complexity of constructing and storing the diagnosis system.

This model is based on the coupled magnetic circuits theory. The system of differential equations describing the induction machine behavior in presence of inter-turn short circuits in the stator windings is given. The machine inductances expressions are carried out using the airgap magnetic energy which is determined by means of the winding functions method. In addition, the magnetic circuit saturation is taken into account by including the fundamental saturation harmonic in the inductances calculation. The proposed model allows the authors to study precisely the inter-turn short circuits signature. Finally, the simulation results of the proposed model are validated by means of a 4 kW specially rewound induction motor which is loaded by a DC generator.

Different signals can be used: voltage, current, flux and power. This paper is a comparative analysis of two different diagnosis methods that are used to detect and localize failures in induction motors. The first one is based on leakage flux measurement and the second one is a diagnosis method based on current, electrical power measurement and pattern recognition. A synthesis of two methods will be developed. It mainly concerns rotor faults.

In this paper, it is proved that a simple external leakage flux sensor is more efficient than a stator current sensor to detect intern-turn short circuit in three-phase induction machines. The new result is that, even in presence of power supply harmonics, it is possible to detect easily the stator winding faults in the low frequency range of the leakage flux spectrum with low frequency resolution.

This parameter must be maintained between limits in order to produce knitted fabric without faults. However, YIT is not the only parameter to control and monitor for preventing faults. The knitting elements and the knitting machine itself should be monitored to improve productivity and quality. The monitoring of the YIT can be used to detect the faults and at the same time controlled inside tight limits to prevent machine's premature stop due to yarn break. This paper will present the recent developments made for monitoring and control the YIT. A surveillance system will be presented, a low cost force sensor will be suggested to substitute the present industrial solutions, and a new actuator for control of the YIT will be introduced.

In general, this practice consists of two parts: extracting appropriate features from sensor signals and recognizing possible faulty patterns from the features. In order to cope with the complex manufacturing operations and develop a feasible system for real-time application, we proposed three approaches. By defining the marginal energy, a new feature representation emerged, while by real-time learning algorithms with support vector techniques and hidden Markov model representations, a modular software architecture and a new similarity measure were developed for comparison, monitoring, and diagnosis. A novel intelligent computer-based system has been developed and evaluated in over 30 factories and numerous metal stamping processes as an example of manufacturing operations. The real-time operation of this system demonstrated that the proposed system is able to detect abnormal conditions efficiently and effectively resulting in a low-cost, effective approach to real-time monitoring in manufacturing. The related technologies have been transferred to industry, presenting a tremendous impact in current automation practice in Asia and the world.

Aiming to overcome the drawbacks, this paper presents a new fault diagnosis method using a newly developed method, support vector machines (SVM). First, the basic theory of SVM is briefly introduced and new intelligent fault diagnosis system is presented. Next, three common SVM algorithms - v-SV, Lagrangian, and Hyper-kernel - are employed for the proposed multiple faults diagnosis system. In comparison, the trade-offs among these three methods are discussed resulting in a general guideline of selecting appropriate learning algorithm for various applications. Then, the methods are applied for diagnosing vibration signals of a typical electromechanical system, elevator door. The real-time tests on 10 faulty conditions demonstrate that the proposed method is effectively and efficiently. In addition, the feature of only few training samples required and fast in calculation allow the method have a big potential in real-world applications.

A diagnostic observer is developed based on the available dynamic model of the AUV. Compensation of unknown dynamics, uncertainties and disturbances is achieved through the adoption of a class of neural interpolators (Support Vector Machines, SVMs) trained off line. On the other hand, interpolation of unknown actuator faults is performed by adopting a Radial Basis Function (RBF) network, whose weights are adaptively tuned on line. The effectiveness of the approach is tested in a simulation case study developed for the NPS AUV II (PHOENIX) vehicle.

A machine learning technique is used to extract, from simulated data, models representing regularities in system behavior. A heuristic based on the degree of coverage of the model on the data is then applied to isolate faults. To test tolerance to incomplete models, our simulation model only requires i/o functions of relevant system processes that can be observed. We view our approach as an incremental filtering process which is useful for diagnosis of large scale systems. To illustrate the approach, we describe experiments in two examples including a well known three-tank system. Preliminaiy results show that, on the average, different locations such as a leaked tank and a blocked pipe can be isolated effectively more than 99% at a time. Results are promising but more in-depth study is required.	Texas Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Abilene, TX USA		Hewett, R (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Abilene, TX USA.

The methodology is based on the theory of Fault Detection and Diagnosis of Discrete Event Systems. The paper deals with optimization of the algorithms of fault detection to alleviate the problem of state explosion based on symbolic techniques like "Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams" and "Abstraction". With the help of these algorithms a CAD tool has been developed that can provide a fully automated flow for design of circuits with on-line test capabilities and can handle generic digital circuits with cell count as high as 15, 000 and about 2(500) states. Further, this methodology provides the designer with a wide range of tradeoffs in detector design: fault coverage and detection latency vs. area and power overhead.

The optimal network architecture of the RBF network is determined automatically by our proposed cell-splitting grid (CSG) algorithm. This facilitates the conventional laborious trial-and-error procedure in establishing an optimal architecture. In this paper, the proposed RBF machine fault diagnostic system has been intensively tested with unbalanced electrical faults and mechanical faults operating at different rotating speeds. The proposed system is not only able to detect electrical and mechanical faults, but the system is also able to estimate the extent of faults.

Main ways to achieve this cost reduction are the use of remote access to on-line condition monitoring of equipment, and a shift from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance. Thanks to the evolution of monitoring systems, maintenance and operation people can concentrate their activity on tasks with high added value. Ethernet can transport the information from the substation to every PC connected to the customer Intranet. This paper describes advanced solutions already implemented covering all type of primary equipment in the substation. Starting from the strict point of view of monitoring it will then proceeds forward with the presentation of diagnostics, prognosis and the challenges posed by the development of such tools. Integration into customer information system will be also discussed. As a last step, we will cast a look on future developments such as complete on-line services.

This is done through the use of a Time-Series Data Mining technique which identifies and extracts hidden and inherent patterns (characteristics) in the machine phase currents, that can be used for fault identification. This technique can effectively detect and determine the severity of stator inter-turn faults in motors by analyzing the extracted fault signatures of these faults in comparison with the healthy performance signatures. In addition, it will be seen from the experimental results that the proposed technique is immune to motor "non-idealities" such as inherent manufacture-based motor asymmetry due to motor structural imperfections, performance measurement imperfections, and supply voltage unbalances, which result in departure of performance results from those of an ideally balanced 3-phase machine. In this paper, the case-study under investigation is a 230-volt, 60-Hz, 2-pole, 2hp, squirrel-cage three-phase induction motor-drive system. The experimental results will demonstrate the soundness and robustness of this technique for reliable fault diagnostics.

In this paper, we target the problem of online detection of disruptions through a generic external entity called Monitor that is able to observe the exchanged messages between the protocol participants and deduce any ongoing disruption by matching against a rule base composed of combinatorial and temporal rules. The Monitor architecture is application neutral, with the rule base making it specific to a protocol. To make the detection infrastructure scalable and dependable, we extend it to a hierarchical Monitor structure. The infrastructure is applied to a streaming video application running on a reliable multicast protocol called TRAM installed on the campus wide network. The evaluation brings out the scalability of the Monitor infrastructure and detection coverage under different kinds of faults for the single level and the hierarchical arrangements.

There is need for methods and processes which will allow interrogation of complex systems and sub-systems to determine the remaining useful life prior to repair or replacement. This capability of determination of material or system state is called "prognosis". In this paper, a methodology for prognosis-of-electronics has been demonstrated with data of leading indicators of failure for accurate assessment of product damage significantly prior to appearance of any macro-indicators of damage. Proxies for leading indicators of failure have been developed including - micro-structural evolution characterized by average phase size and interfacial stresses at interface of silicon structures. Structures examined include electronics package, MEMS Packages and interconnections on a metal backed printed circuit board typical of electronics deployed in harsh environments. Since, an aged material knows its state the research presented in this paper focuses on enhancing the understanding of material damage to facilitate proper interrogation of material state. Mathematical relationship has been developed between phase growth rate and time-to-1-percent failure to enable the computation of damage manifested and a forward estimate of residual life.

Allis-Chalmers already developed a fuel cell tractor in the 1950s. Since then, many attempts failed due to a lack in competitiveness to mechanical drives. But today, with the increasing power-to-weight ratio of electric machines and a continuing improvement of (power) electronics, electric drives become a reasonable alternative. Released in 1998, the Schmetz "Eltrac" tractor is the first agricultural machine which can be indicated to use up-to-date electric technology for the wheel drive system, being propelled by a diesel engine via an electric transmission. Starting 1996, basic tests to optimise an electric drive for tractors were made at Technical University in Dresden. The University of Hohenheim set up a project to evaluate the use of electric motors in agricultural machinery by equipping a combine harvester with an electric transmission in 2000. This paper presents a classification of mobile agricultural machines using electricity within their main drive system. It shows the history and the state-of-the-art of these machines with special emphasis on the most recent developments. In the end, a prognosis on future developments in the field of electrically drivel? agricultural machinery is made.

So its vibration monitoring and fault diagnosis plays an important role in guaranteeing product quality and productivity. This paper builds an on-line vibration monitoring system for spindle bearings in which the complex shifted Morlet wavelet is adopted to realize the envelop demodulation and feature extraction so as to identify the type of fault. The main advantage of this method is that the center frequency and bandwidth are obtained not by user according to experience value manually, but by calculating for vibration signal. Therefore, it is very suitable for on-line monitoring and automatic fault diagnosis. The analysis of typical fault signal of rolling elements bearing shows that it can diagnose the fault accurately.

First, features extraction is the key of improving diagnosis efficiency and correct rate. Secondly, fault diagnosis method based on rule reasoning has a wide application, but rule acquisition is one of the bottlenecks. Thirdly, rule modification is a key question of solving the real-time rule acquisition in the dynamic environments, and a primary question of knowledge base modification of expert system, etc. In this paper, Rough Set Theory (RST) was used to solve the key problems of machinery fault diagnosis, and a Rough Set Data Analysis System (RSDAS) was developed. RSDAS was used to implement rule generation automation & rule modification based on RST such as indiscernibility relation and knowledge reduction method, depicted importance of different attributes in knowledge representation, and reduced knowledge representation space. The method of fault diagnosis using RSDAS was summarized. The experiment results approved the feasibility and the high precision of RSDAS. Therefore, we can use RADAS to machinery fault diagnosis.

These faults may cause serious machine accidents and bring great production losses. In order to detect faults and distinguish fault type at an early stage, this paper proposes a diagnosis method by using "Partially-linearized Neural Network (PNN)" by which the type of structural faults can be automatically distinguished on the basis of the probability distributions of symptom parameters. The symptom parameters are non-dimensional parameters which reflect the characteristics of time signal measured for diagnosis of rotating machinery. The knowledge for the PNN learning can be acquired by using the Rough Sets of the symptom parameters. The practical examples of diagnosis for rotating machinery are shown to verify the efficiency of the method.

A wide range of computational tools are needed to effectively and efficiently process large amounts of data being generated as a result of recent technological innovations in biology and medicine. A number of computational tools have been developed or adapted to deal with the experimental riches of complex and multivariate data and transition from data collection to information or knowledge. These include a wide variety of clustering and classification algorithms, including self-organized maps (SOM), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy logic, and even hyphenated techniques as neuro-jazzy networks.

Studies have been published predicting tumor type, estrogen receptor status, and prognosis using a variety of AI algorithms. The performance of intelligent computing decisions based on gene expression signatures is in some cases comparable to or better than the current clinical decision schemas. The goal of these tools is not to make clinicians obsolete, but rather to give clinicians one more tool in their armamentarium to accurately diagnose and hence better treat cancer patients. Several such applications are summarized in this chapter, and some of the common pitfalls are noted.

The proposed algorithm uses the stator current and motor speed as input. Several features are extracted from the frequency spectrum of the current signal resulting from FFT. A Rough Sets based classifier is then developed and applied to distinguish between different motor conditions. A series of experiments using a three phase 3 hp cage induction machine performed in different load and fault conditions are used to provide data for training and then testing the classifier. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for detecting the existence and severity of broken bar faults.

The complexity of present day aircraft systems and the increased demands on their reliability motivate the need for more capable diagnostic and control systems that not only detect component/system degradation but can estimate the capabilities of the degraded system and adapt system controls to maximize the overall performance. This paper discusses the bond graph modeling approach and its application to aircraft fuel systems and reconfigurable control that has demonstrated such capabilities. Our approach enables fault diagnosis, isolation, and system reconfiguration as well as system prognostics. The system described has the ability to dynamically update the system or component model and continue to track the system characteristics, providing important feedback information to reconfigurable control processes, and predictive performance estimators. Example aircraft fuel systems that were analyzed and evaluated with our technique are presented.

Specifically, schema diagrams in formal Z notation are used to specify an integrated set of black box PM operations devoid of implementation details. The schema diagrams describe the input-output behavior of the PM operations and employ high-level abstract mathematical data types. In total, the PM operations serve as a framework upon which to base the implementation of a provably correct PM software system. This highly-assured system would add substantial value to automatic test equipment and test program sets by providing the capability to 1. Detect anomalies and incipient failures and isolate existing/impending failures of a unit-under-test (UUT) based on system-level data, 2. Forecast remaining useful life of a UUT based on system-level data, 3. Reduce substantially the number of false alarms attributed to automatic test equipment and test program sets, and 4. Enable condition-based and prognostic-based maintenance and inventory process decision triggers based on the outcomes of 1 - 3. During implementation of the PM software system, Floyd-Hoare logics can be used to verify whether particular algorithms meet the finished black-box PM specifications. This paper also presents the state transition diagram that corresponds to the framework.

By efficient co-operation any problem areas can quickly be identified and solved as well as plant operations developed. A systematic remote performance and condition monitoring program is a valuable tool that can help the plant owners and operators meet their major objectives, i.e. high availability and efficiency with optimised operation and maintenance costs. The use of performance and condition monitoring brings total cost savings by improved machinery reliability and operation. Condition monitoring information is used to focus the maintenance to the right components at the correct time, thus reducing the risk of additional damage. The remote support makes early detection of incipient failures possible and provides decision-making support at short notice. Combination of the local site knowledge with technical and expert support ensures that the right conclusions are drawn from all the available data, and that I his is done in a well-planned and cost-effective way. Key elements of remote support include a multidisciplinary approach to cover several areas of expertise like thermal condition monitoring, vibration diagnostics and water chemistry monitoring. A Diagnostic Engine concept is being used to enable and automate the utilisation of data in both for early fault detection and trouble-shooting in the Remote Support Centre.

In this article, we present a new Bayesian-network learning algorithm which can be deployed as a tool for learning Bayesian networks, aimed at supporting the processes of prognosis or diagnosis. It is based on a maximum (conditional) mutual information criterion. The algorithm is evaluated using a high-quality clinical dataset concerning disorders of the liver and biliary tract, showing a performance which exceeds that of state-of-the-art Bayesian classifiers. Furthermore, the algorithm places less restrictions on classifying Bayesian network structures and therefore allows easier clinical interpretation.

Both stator-winding fault and broken rotor bar detection are covered. Faults in the stator windings or damaged rotor bar cause asymmetries in the phase impedances of the machine, which give rise to zero sequence voltage components. The measured zero sequence voltage is shown to contain reliable information on the condition of the machine, with little influence from the operating point or imbalances in the phase voltages. The method will be shown to be valid both for line-connected machines and inverter-fed machines.

On the other hand several solutions were proposed for the detection of rotor speed of induction motor for sensorless control. Another deeply investigated field of research is the detection of supply frequency of power lines, for the diagnosis of the distribution network. A common root of these three key topics is the need of accurately stating specific spectrum frequencies. Several techniques were presented in the literature in order to perform accurate tracking of frequencies for different purposes. They are modified versions of the traditional Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), or novel spectrum estimation techniques. This paper presents a novel procedure based on the statistical analysis of the current signal in the time domain, referred to as Maximum Covariance Method for Frequency Tracking (MCMFT), that allows to obtain high frequency resolution accuracy independently of the sampling frequency and of the time acquisition period. Therefore those spectrum lines related to supply frequency or to slip can be detected with extreme accuracy within a wide range of sampled data conditions. Then either an accurate diagnosis of the machine electric faults or sensorless control, or distribution network diagnosis can be performed. Comparison between the proposed method and the literature are reported, in order to critically analyze its performances. An induction machine with two artificially broken bars was used for the experiments.

Consistency based diagnosis allows fault detection and localization. without prior knowledge of the device fault modes. Machine learning techniques are able to induce time series classifiers that may be used to identify fault modes of a dynamic systems. The diagnostician performs fault detection and localization resorting to consistency based diagnosis through possible conflicts. Then, a time series classifier, induced from simulated examples, generates a sequence of faults modes, coherent with the result of the fault localization stage, and ordered by fault modes confidence. Finally, to simplify the diagnosis task, it is considered as a subtask of a supervisory system, who is in charge of identifying the working conditions for the physical system.

This is related to the even more general problem of detecting instances (cases, records) that are unusual compared to the bulk of the data (outliers). Examples of the problem are fault detection in chemical engineering and statistical process control. The outlier problem is ubiquitous. If specific deviations are not a priori specified, this is a type of unsupervised learning problem. The focus here is on the important, practical case for modem data environments. That is, training data with multiple (usual many) variables of mixed types (without the expedient assumptions common in statistics of multivariate normality that rarely holds in practice). An elegant technique is used to transform an unsupervised leaming problem to a supervised one. This methodology uses an artificial reference distribution. For the focus here such a specific reference distribution requires appropriate properties. Then an effective, universal, and nonparametric supervised learner (a gradient boosting machine) is applied to the transformed problem. The results are then in a sense inverted to the original problem. Extensions are mentioned as well as additional insight that becomes available. An illustrative example is presented to justify the validity of this generic and general methodology.

Machines are remotely diagnosed by the LDAs through the communication channels between the MAs and the LDAs. When faults that cannot be solved with the present knowledge base occur, the DLA can acquire new knowledge, translate it into rules using a rule builder, and update the rules into the CKB. The CKB will become mature through a continuous learning process. A prototype system has been developed and used for remote fault diagnostics of tool wear in computer numerically controlled (CNC) machining.

The goal of our approach is to find all defects in the empty water bottles. The main constraint is the real time operation as the bottles move continuously on the conveyer belt. Using images obtained from the camera, we first find the position of the bottle in the image by generalized Hough transform. Then we check the bottles for any defects or presence of alien objects using rectangular and circular areas intensity inspection. The bottles with any defects are rejected and so separated from the main stream. In the statistics obtained, our inspection system successfully rejected all the faulty or defected bottles. The good bottle rejection rate was also lower than 1% of the total number of bottles inspected. This system can be used for inspecting I any type of empty bottles for defects or presence of alien objects.

For neural networks, as the new case occurs, the corresponding data should be added to their dataset for learning. However, the 'off-line' NNs are unable to adapt autonomously and must be retrained by applying the complete dataset including the new data. The ART networks can solve the plasticity-stability dilemma. In other words, they are able to carry out `on-line' training without forgetting previously trained patterns (stable training); it can recode previously trained categories adaptive to changes in the environment and is self-organizing. ART-KNN also holds these characteristics, and more suitable than original ART for fault diagnosis of machinery. In order to test the proposed network, the vibration signal is selected as raw inputs due to its simplicity, accuracy and efficiency. The results of the experiments confirm the performance of the proposed network through comparing with other NNs, such as the self-organizing feature maps (SOFM), learning vector quantization (LVQ) and radial basis function (RBF) NNs under the same conditions.

In this procedure, the condition monitoring is performed based on the on-line vibration measurements, and further, the fault quantification is formulated into a multivariable trend analysis. The multi-variable grey model-MGM (1, n), which allows the changes in each index to be described from the views of systems, is then deployed to perform the multivariable trending of the fault development. The effectiveness and advantages of this fault forecasting procedure is shown by experiments using rolling element bearings. Finally, the range suitable for MGM (1, n) model is discussed.

To reach this aim a lot of research is being done in different fields of maintenance and computer science. An evident and classical solution is the use of the tele-operation and tele-robotics. If the tele-operation helped to solve several real and technical problems, it still remains insufficient to assure an appropriate remote diagnosis and maintenance. The use of virtual reality techniques with tele-operation can be the solution. This paper introduces an integrated methodology to remotely monitor and diagnose distant machines by a robot hand. Using a virtual reality environment and a tele-operation system, the vibration data are collected from different checking points. In order to pinpoint the faults, the collected data are analyzed and then using a fuzzy system the features extraction was performed.

The two main product end-of-life options are reuse/remanufacturing and recycling. For either option, all take-back units are treated equally because no information that tracks the conditions of a product during its useful life is available. For example, all expired PCs are treated equally; no distinction can be made about which units still have healthy hard disks. This paper discusses sensor-based monitoring and prognostic methodologies for tracking the condition of products while being used by customers and timely and targeted servicing, smart and selective disassembling and refurbishing of products with known (long) remaining lives. The paper also discusses the added benefits to product manufacturers when the time comes to redesign their products. The real-time field data on service and utilization of products are communicated to manufacturers' headquarters for further analysis.

These advantages can also be applied to consumer products but require specific solutions due to the strict resource limitations of the embedded control systems. In this paper a solution concept is presented, to show how remote diagnostics can be realized, based on established technologies by considering the technical and economic limitations of embedded systems within technical consumer products. The requirements of such systems will be identified and the concept of remote diagnostics will be derived The proof of concept will be given by a prototypical implementation of a household washer-dryer machine.

Sensor signals in both time domain and frequency domain are analyzed to show the effectiveness of the NDEKF algorithm in each domain. Comparisons of the NDEKF algorithm with other popular neural network training algorithms such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and backpropagation (BP) will be discussed in the paper through a system identification problem. First, the simulation results reveal the comparison of outputs from actual system and trained neural network. Secondly, the ability of diagnosing a system with one normal condition and three known fault conditions is demonstrated. Thirdly, the robustness of the machine condition monitoring when the inputs to the system vary is shown. The proposed technique works even when there is noise in sensor signals as well.

Modified Recursive Least Square is used to estimate the model parameters for an ARX model of the induction motor. Variations in estimated parameters show the occurrence and amount of mixed eccentricity in this motor.

Though such criteria have the advantage of being systematic, little is known on how cost effective they are and how they compare to each other. This article presents a precise simulation and analysis procedure to analyze the cost-effectiveness of statechart-based testing techniques. We then investigate, using this procedure, the cost and fault detection effectiveness of adequate test sets for the most referenced coverage criteria for statecharts on three different representative case studies. Through the analysis of common results and differences across studies, we attempt to draw more general conclusions regarding the costs and benefits of using the criteria under investigation.

The technique generates machine learning models of program properties known to result from errors, and applies these models to program properties of user-written code to classify and rank properties that may lead the user to errors. Given a set of properties produced by the program analysis, the technique selects a subset of properties that are most likely to reveal an error. An implementation, the Fault Invariant Classifier, demonstrates the efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs. Preliminary experience suggests that most of the fault-revealing properties do lead a programmer to an error.

The application of a method able to detect a rotor defect at no load condition is thus advantageous especially for quality management systems in the manufacturing process where a high number of machines have to be tested with minimum consumption of electrical power an without coupling the machines using a test rig or additional moment of inertia. The method proposed in this paper is based on a modulation of the machines rotor flux magnitude in different directions of the rotor and a determination of the magnetizing/demagnetizing time constant. It thus does not depend on any kind of load. For high power machines this offers the additional benefit of a reduced inverter power rating in the quality management line as only the magnetizing current of the machine has to be supplied. Moreover the method may be applied in safety critical applications for maintenance purposes, even in line-fed drives. Simulations as well as measurement results will be presented to show the applicability of the method.

Supply unbalance and load influence of the machine however affect the negative component and they may cause the failure of the diagnostic procedure, Recently, deceleration test that may remove some drawbacks of MCSA, has been proposed for rotor and stator fault diagnosis. In this paper it is shown that the Residual Voltage Signature Analysis (RVSA) obtained by the deceleration test provides, once removed the intrinsic manufacturing asymmetry, a diagnostic index directly related to the percentage of shorted turns. The main advantage of RVSA is that any influence caused by the supply unbalance and load is masked. Therefore a new diagnostic index is presented that is the residual voltage negative sequence component. The novel index performances have been proofed thanks to a simplified model of the faulted machine and experimentally validated by a special test motor that allows the introduction of different short circuits. This novel index can be used to confirm the MCSA-based diagnostic procedure developed by the same authors.

This quality prognostics scheme is composed of a conjecture model and a prediction model, The conjecture model itself can also be applied for the purpose of virtual metrology. With this two-tier arrangement, the quality prognostics scheme becomes more applicable. The algorithms adopted by the conjecture model can be various and exchangeable. Basically, numerous algorithms of artificial intelligence and statistics may be applied. The selection criteria are based on the physics of the equipment and the property of the measured parameters. The prediction algorithms used in the prediction model are weighted moving average, neural network, or any algorithm with prediction capability. Besides, the quality prognostics scheme possesses a self-searching mechanism and a self-adjusting mechanism. Upon the new conjecture or prediction algorithm being selected, the self-searching mechanism will be activated. The self-searching mechanism will not stop until the best combination of various parameters/functions used by the conjecture algorithm or prediction algorithm is found. Then, the conjecture or prediction model enters the normal running mode. After a period of time, if the prediction accuracy exceeds an acceptable bound or the equipment properties are altered due to scheduled maintenance or part change, the self-adjusting mechanism is launched to tune the system parameters to bring the prediction accuracy within the acceptable bounds.

Among them, the permanent magnet synchronous machines are more and more used because of their high power to weight ratio, their great efficiency and the recent affordability of magnet materials. Permanent magnet synchronous machines are also more and more envisaged in high power applications (railway applications for instance). In this context, these machines can be submitted to external and internal stresses, and degradation can occur in their electrical and mechanical parts. The adoption of permanent magnet synchronous machines in applications such as electric propulsion has been hindered by concerns about special risks posed by short-circuit faults in these machines This is why industry is interested in adopting monitoring and diagnosis techniques to assess and evaluate condition of these machines. The modelling of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines with stator faults takes place in this context. A rich and flexible model of surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous machines with stator faults is proposed here. A coupled magnetic circuits approach is used and very few restrictive assumptions are made. All parameters are calculated from the actual geometry and winding layout of the machines rather than from transformed or equivalent variables. The detailed depiction of the procedure needed to implement this model with simulation results is the subject of this paper.	[Abdallah, A.

Loss in production due to equipment failure was no longer affordable due to the increasing demand. In the cement industry, maintenance is a costly and at the same time controllable expense. The initial concept of equipment maintenance was reactive maintenance. Scheduled or preventive maintenance replaced reactive maintenance, resulting in better equipment availability. Even with scheduled preventive maintenance unprecedented failures occur. Now the focus in the industry is shifting from scheduled maintenance to the new technology of constantly observing machine condition and predicting the condition in advance. This is predictive maintenance. The source of equipment abnormality is identified and corrected which prevents the failure in the future. This is reliability based maintenance. More concentration is focused on providing advance warning of signs of trouble to prevent sudden failure. Predictive maintenance is the current trend in the manufacturing Industry. Condition monitoring through vibration monitoring and oil analysis is the latest technique of maintenance to achieve higher equipment availability. Holcim has evolved in last decade from preventive maintenance to reliability centered maintenance through condition monitoring. Condition based maintenance is the center of maintenance activity at the Holcim Portland Plant in Florence, Colorado. The plant has been in operation since May 2002. As part of the condition monitoring program, the plant has installed online vibration monitoring systems on all critical equipment. The online transducers are connected to the centralized control room through PLC's. The equipment has settings for alarm and shutdown in case of excessive vibration. Another vibration monitoring tool being utilized by the plant is an online surveillance system. This combines both continuous monitoring as well as Fast Fourier Transform analysis. The plant also has offline vibration monitoring routes where the data is collected manually by field technicians and then analyzed. This technical report presents information about the function of online and offline vibration monitoring. Brief information is presented about the current vibration monitoring system being used at the Plant. A case study is presented to show the cost justification analysis of implementing a vibration program. The report gives a brief comparison between online and offline monitoring showing the advantages and limitations of both.

In previous works, it has been shown that the interbar currents exist in healthy and faulty squirrel-cage induction motors. The majority of techniques detecting bar failures depend on detecting twice the slip-frequency modulation harmonic in the speed, torque, or stator current by analyzing the appropriate frequency spectrum and neglecting the interbar currents. However, the interbar currents create axial fluxes through, the rotor shaft. In this paper, a three-dimensional magnetic equivalent circuit method is presented for the analysis of this phenomenon. Effects of the interbar currents on the broken rotor bar currents, and transient behavior of induction motor are also presented. Theoretical findings have been verified through experiments.

The currently recorded data set for this engine has several limitations in its quality, which results in the lack of information required for the incipient fault detection and wide coverage of failure modes. Using the residuals of core speed, exhausted gas temperature and fuel flow, the developed system is designed to diagnose the failures related to combustor liner, bleed band, and exhausted gas temperature (EGT) sensor rake. The fault diagnosis system reports not only the machine condition but also the belief factor convincing the diagnostic decisions. In this work the actual flight data collected in the field is used to develop and validate the system, and the results are shown for the test on five engines which had experienced three different failures. The presented system is implemented in the form of web-based service and has demonstrated its robustness by isolating the failures successfully in the field.

In this paper, the health of the spindle positioning drive (Z axis) on a Proteo D/94 precision machining center is investigated using time, frequency and time-frequency techniques. Investigated is a cogging phenomenon produced as a result of the DC servomotor brushes sticking due to poor design. This incipient fault reduces the accuracy and controllability of the machine tool, and always leads to total drive failure. Thus, it is important to determine the fault signature of the drive so that corrective action may be taken before failure can occur, permanently damaging both the motor and the workpiece. The vibratory signatures of both a healthy and a faulty spindle during translation are analyzed. It is shown that a spindle under fault conditions behaves differently from a healthy one, and that time and time-frequency domain methods provide useful information on the status of the system. This paper lays the groundwork for the development of a future machine condition monitoring system, which can be easily retrofitted to any machine tool system.

This system examines the signals in real-time, determines the quality of the signature for the entire set of signals and evaluates the error states of these signal combinations or signatures. This approach of continually evaluating quality of signals allows for predictive maintenance of the manufacturing system. The signals from the manufacturing system are obtained in a standard, optically isolated interface, the signals into this Remote Observation Manufacturing Equipment (ROME) system is processed and evaluated in real-time and history of these signals is stored. This system allows for the monitoring of signals in a continuous manner and these signals are recorded till a fault occurs. The graphical user interface provides user visualization control of the full family of signals at various time instants. These analog, and digital signals are synchronized with the color images from two cameras and can be viewed with this GUI. The user can review both error and normal condition state using this interface.

To provide reliable and effective maintenance support, it is important for the airline companies to utilise previous repair experience with the aid of advanced decision support technology. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a machine learning method that adapts previous similar cases to solve current problems. To effectively retrieve similar aircraft maintenance cases, this research proposes using a CBR system to aid electronic ballast fault diagnosis of Boeing 747-400 airplanes. By employing genetic algorithms (GA) to enhance dynamic weighting and the design of non-similarity functions, the proposed CBR system is able to achieve superior learning performance as compared to those with either equal/varied weights or linear similarity functions.

This system can serve as teaching equipment for mechatronics students in the area of data acquisition, sensors and actuators, signal processing and vibration monitoring to aid students' understanding on these subjects. Since vibration fault signals and their causes are important for fault detection and diagnosis, a vibration faults simulation system is developed to gain good understanding of such signals. To achieve this a vibration faults simulation rig (VFSR) is designed and developed to simulate and study most common vibration fault signatures encountered in rotating machines. A Lab VIEW-based data acquisition system is used to acquire and analyze the fault signals. The complete system has been developed and tested and the fault signals were compared with normal signals so as to ascertain the condition of the machine under investigation. VFSS has been successfully used to demonstrate some vital concepts in the teaching of DSP, sensor and actuators and mechanical vibration since data are acquired from the physical system and are analyzed to derive information on the system under investigation. This approach further allows students to gain insight into effects of noise on measurements and how such effects can be combated.

J	Chinnam, RB; Baruah, P				Chinnam, RB; Baruah, P			A neuro-fuzzy approach for estimating mean residual life in condition-based maintenance systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATERIALS & PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						mean residual life; degradation signal; prognostics; reliability estimation; neural networks; fuzzy logic	RELIABILITY PREDICTION; REAL-TIME; DEGRADATION	This paper presents a framework for online reliability estimation of physical systems utilising degradation signals. Most prognostics methods promoted in the literature for estimation of mean-residual-life of individual components utilise trending or forecasting models in combination with mechanistic or empirical failure definition models. In the absence of sound knowledge for the mechanics of degradation and/or adequate failure data, it is not possible to establish practical failure definition models. However, if there exist domain experts with strong experiential knowledge, one can establish fuzzy inference models for failure definition. This paper presents a neuro-fuzzy approach for performing prognostics under such circumstances. The proposed approach is evaluated on a cutting tool monitoring problem. In particular, the method is used to monitor high-speed-steel drill-bits used for drilling holes in stainless steel metal plates.

A simplified mathematical model in d-q-0 axes, able to simulate the behavior of the motor in the presence of stator faults, allowed the development of some analytical relations between the d-q-0 current components in different reference frames. The use of the stationary reference frame, clockwise and counterclockwise synchronous reference frames, allows the extraction and manipulation of the information contained in the three motor supply currents in a way that the effects introduced by the fault are isolated and measured. A severity factor is defined, and simulation and experimental results demonstrate its high independence in relation to the working conditions of the motor such as the load level and unbalances in the voltage supply system.

Several features of vibration signals are compared as indicators of broken rotor bar of a 35 kW induction motor. Regular fast Fourier transform (FFT) based power spectrum density (PSD) estimation is compared to signal processing with higher order spectra (HOS), cepstrum analysis and signal description with autoregressive (AR) modelling. The fault detection routine and feature comparison is carried out with support vector machine (SVM) based classification. The best method for feature extraction seems to be the application of AR coefficients. The result is found out with real measurement data from several motor conditions and load situations.

J	Stefanoiu, D				Stefanoiu, D			Fault diagnosis by fuzzy-statistical reasoning	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article								This article aims to introduce a non-conventional method for extracting, decoding and classifying the information regarding defects that could appear and develop in components of rotating machinery (e.g. in bearings). Such an information is encoded by vibrations and regards the type and the severity degree of possible defects. Though vibration is not as complex as speech or seismic signals, decoding this information is not easy. Unlike many Signal Processing applications, where the noise is attenuated or compensated, one focuses here on the noisy component of vibrations, where defects are encoded. The classification of defects is based upon some statistical and fuzzy concepts described within the article. A succinct comparison between Fuzzy-Statistical and Envelope Analysis Methods is performed as well.

J	Chelidze, D; Cusumano, JP				Chelidze, D; Cusumano, JP			A dynamical systems approach to failure prognosis	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article							DAMAGE EVOLUTION TRACKING; FAULT-DETECTION	In this paper, a previously published damage tracking method is extended to provide failure prognosis, and applied experimentally to an electromechanical system with a failing supply battery. The method is based on a dynamical systems approach to the problem of damage evolution. In this approach, damage processes are viewed as occuring in a hierarchical dynamical system consisting of a "fast,directly observable subsystem coupled to a "slow," hidden subsystem describing damage evolution. Damage tracking is achieved using a two-time-scale modeling strategy based on phase space reconstruction. Using the reconstructed phase space of the reference (undamaged) system, short-time predictive models are constructed. Fast-time data from later stages of damage evolution of a given system are collected and used to estimate a tracking function by calculating the short time reference model prediction error. In this paper the tracking metric based on these estimates is used as an input to a nonlinear recursive filter the output of which provides continuous refined estimates of the current damage (or, equivalently, health) state. Estimates of remaining useful life (or equivalently, time to failure) are obtained recursively using the current damage state estimates under the assumption of a particular damage evolution model. The method is experimentally demonstrated using an electromechanical system, in which mechanical vibrations of a cantilever beam are dynamically coupled to electrical oscillations in an electromagnet circuit. Discharge of a battery powering the electromagnet (the "damage" process in this case) is tracked using strain gauge measurements from the beam. The method is shown to accurately estimate both the battery state and the time to failure throughout virtually the entire experiment.

One of the main maintenance efforts is to detect fault occurring in the electrical machines. Some of these faults are slowly developing faults and early detection of these faults is crucial to prevent machine breakdown. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of a fault detection and diagnosis system using adaptive neuro fuzzy inferencing system (ANFIS) on a simulated three-phase induction motor. Several parameters of the induction motor are adjusted to represent faulty conditions. The experimental results obtained show that the algorithm has good fault detection and diagnosis ability.

Many various inspection devices for textile industry were developed. However, rope-producing textile company has come with demand of intelligent inspection device that is able to detect faults in finishing process. The winding speeds are 50 200 m/min. Nowadays commercial devices are focused on textile fabrics (weaving or knitting) and they are only able to detect basic faults (holes, dirty and oil spots). Considering textile structure faults are possible to find in several research papers, however, for specific types of textiles or for slow processes only. The inspection device, which has been developed in our laboratory, is able to work with high winding speeds of rope. The device is based on fast line-scan camera with Camera-Link interface. The goal of the project was to search three basic structure faults: missing strand, strands pulled tight and stitch irregularity. The principle of fault detection is based on gathering the most suitable symptoms that are used for recognition methods. These methods are very successful for speech recognition and using them even bring us better results than using neural networks. This paper shows the way of finding the most suitable symptoms, their statistical evaluation and decision making algorithms. The most important step is reducing the problem from time-consuming image processing to one-dimensional signal processing.

First, the basic theory of the SVM is briefly reviewed. Next, a fast implementation algorithm is given. Then the method is applied for the fault diagnosis in sheet metal stamping processes. According to the tests on two different examples, one is a simple blanking and the other is a progressive operation, the new method is very effective. In both cases, its success rate is over 96.5%. In comparison, the success rate of the popular artificial neural network (ANN) is just 93.3%. In addition, the new method requires only few training samples, which is an attractive feature for shop floor applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantitative analysis of these and other parameters from ventriculograms is infrequently performed due to the expense of manual segmentation. We present a method for semi-automatic segmentation of ventriculograms based on a two-stage boosted decision-tree pixel classifier. The classifier determines which pixels are inside the ventricle at key end-diastole and end-systole frames. The classifier is semi-automatic, requiring a user to select 3 points in each frame: the endpoints of the aortic valve and the apex. The classifier uses about 90 feature images, computed from the raw ventriculogram image frames, including simple per pixel gray-level statistics (e.g. median brightness) and image geometry (e.g. coordinates relative to user supplied 3 points). Border pixels are determined from segmented images using dilation and erosion. A curve is then fit to the border pixels, minimizing a penalty function that trades off fidelity to the border pixels with smoothness. Volumes and ejection fraction are estimated from border curves using standard area-length formulas. On independent test data, the differences between automatic and manual volumes (and ejection fractions) are similar in size to the differences between two human observers.

For this reason, it is more important than ever to count with reliable and secure generation systems. In this way, the use of on-line diagnostic techniques in the maintenance schemes can be useful. This paper is about on-line condition monitoring in induction generators for small hydro stations and wind farms. In particular, stator winding fault diagnosis is analyzed. Currently, there are diagnostic techniques that are used in induction motors, but they could be used in generators as well. This paper analyzes the induction generator characteristics and describes the appropriate diagnostic techniques. These techniques depend on the machine voltage. As most of the induction generators are low voltage machines, the diagnosis of stator winding faults will be based on the detection of inter-turn short circuits. Most of the inter-turn short circuit diagnostic techniques are noninvasive as they are based on voltage and line current monitoring.

The most important advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches such as radial-basis function network and support vector machines is that our classifier has locally tuned response characteristics and the misclassification rate of faulty product images can be controlled as small as needed by turning two parameters of the GZC function while the correct rate can be influenced to some extend. The experimental results on a real-world fault diagnosis problem of industrial images indicate that the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The relevant fault signatures of the magnetic fluxes are issued directly from measurements and from numerical electromagnetic field simulations at steady state. These signatures are then analyzed and compared to deduce the most appropriate quantity for the detection of a specific fault. A particular interest is paid to the experimental verification for some of the "virtual" measurement signals provided by the numerical electromagnetic field simulations. The research for evaluating the ability of the chosen parameters in detecting a specific fault is performed on a squirrel-cage induction motor of 35 W. The experimental tests are designed to evaluate the faults at different internal and external motor search coil locations.

Detection of broken rotor bars in induction machines through the study of the startup transient via wavelet decomposition	OPTIM 04: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OPTIMIZATION OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT, VOL II: POWER ELECTRONICS, ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND DRIVES			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Optimization of Electrical and Electronic Equipment	MAY 20-22, 2004	Brasov, ROMANIA	IEEE		broken rotor bars; startup transient; fault diagnosis; wavelet analysis		This paper introduces a new method for the diagnosis of rotor bar breakages in induction machines based on the application of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to the startup stator current. Firstly, an explanation of the physical basis of the phenomenon is given; It is remarked the occurrence of a stator current harmonic with a particular frequency variation during the startup process, when a rotor bar breakage has happened. Afterwards, it is introduced a method for detecting this harmonic by means of the DWT. This method is based on the characteristic pattern produced by the harmonic on the high-level wavelet signals resulting from the startup current decomposition. This pattern is illustrated using a numerical model of an induction machine which allows the simulation of the startup process of a machine in healthy and faulty conditions. Finally, the proposed method is experimentally tested using a laboratory machine which easily allows the operation under different fault conditions.	[Riera, M.; Antonino, J.

The proposed drive system exhibits smooth torque when the machine operates either under indirect field oriented control or based on the standard volts/hertz scheme. The proposed solution requires the derivation of a symmetrical model for representing an unbalanced induction motor and the design of a control law to compensate the stator winding unbalancing. Extensive thoeretical analysis and experimental tests are provided to demonstrate the fesability of the proposed solution.

This paper applies neuro-fuzzy logic to induction motors condition monitoring. The analysis of residual features corresponding to instrumentation faults of induction motor lead to the design of faults classification system. The training set is obtained by a faulted machine dynamical model as simulator. Two neuro-fuzzy structures will be conceived to learn the exact input-output relation of the fault detection process for induction motor using measured data. The first neuro-fuzzy architecture maps the residuals into two classes: a one of fixed direction residuals and another one of faults belonging to velocity sensor. The second adaptive neuro-fuzzy network will be able to provide updated membership functions of the sets of fixed oriented residuals that better describe the fault diagnosis map. The preliminary results show that neuro-fuzzy logic can be used for accurate induction motors fault diagnosis if the input data are processed in an optimized way.

An output signal of the speed deviations of each generator of the multi-area multi-machines system is taken as the input for the wavelet analysis. The "oscillation signature" for each of the 4 machines in a 'no fault condition', 'fault' with the PSS and without the PSS is recorded at various fault locations for fault detection using Multi resolution Analysis (MRA) Wavelet Transforms. The MRA decomposes the signal into different resolutions allowing a detailed analysis of its energy content and characteristics. It is then used as a features for classes and locations of the fault. Three classifiers are used, namely the Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and the An Adaptive Network Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), to train and rind the fault location and classification and the results obtained are compared. The two-area 4-machine system with a double circuit transmission lines between the two areas is modified to include a fictitious bus for the study. To control the oscillation at various fault locations, a lookup table is devised using Simulink(R) for various values of the gain and the time constant of the conventional Power System Stabiliser.

This contribution undertakes both simulation and prediction of the residual life of the Relanex insulating material for electrical rotating machine windings. In case of simulation, the current condition of insulating material based on the input data is determined. In case of prediction, the insulation condition in the future time k+1 is predicted based on the input quantities in the times k, k-1, k-2, etc. Prediction means forecasting an output quantity in future based on the N values of this quantity and/or the other quantities measured in the past. By means of the diagnostic quantities Ba (the quantity is proportional to the effective activation energy of polarization effects), Bv (the quantity is proportional to the effective activation energy of conductive effects) and Uk (the quantity is proportional to critical voltage) and by using a fuzzy method in the form of fuzzy models and predictors, we can determine breakdown voltage. This approach determines either the current condition of insulating material, taking into account electric strength, or the life prognosis of this material. To simulate and predict a magnitude of breakdown voltage, the Sugeno type fuzzy system was applied, especially for easy setting input parameters. According to the input quantity matrix (i.e. Ba, Bv, and Uk) measured at the Relanex insulating material samples, and according to a consecutive training phase, it is possible to simulate and predict the values of breakdown voltage Ups. The values can be compared to the real measured values of breakdown voltage Up. The evaluation of the fuzzy system quality is performed on the basis of relative and absolute errors.

Feature map is one of the widely used performance assessment and degradation detection methods. By continuosly tracking the trajectories, degradation detection and prognostics in feature space can be conducted. The challenge is how to construct a feature space that can consistently exemplify, the degradation pattern. In this paper, a Self Organizing Map (SOM) neural network based method is proposed to address the problem of the construction of feature space and degradation detection. Roller bearing run-to-failure tests are conducted to generate full life cycle degradation data, by which the proposed method is validated. The results demonstrate that SOM-based performance assessment and degradation detection approach provides a means of enhancing the condition monitoring of the roller bearing. It is able to provide a comprehensible indication of current operation state. Degradation detection call be fulfilled by monitoring the trajectories. Robust and quantitative performance assessment is achieved by the Minimum Quantization Error (MQE) calculation. It provides solid foundation for the development of the rolling bearing prognostic method.

An approach is designed that predicts and controls the futural runing status of machine in time by Wavelet Neural Network. By this approach, Feature analyzes the tendency of machine fault visually with histogram. Information is first extracted from original machinery signal by Wavelet Packet Transform. Then, Feature information is put into Kohonen self-organized mapping neural network to be clustered and form some different classification spaces of runing status of machine. Lastly, analyzing correlation between feature information during different running periods to predict the futural runing status of machine. Experiment shows that the method works well in the fault diagnosis and tendency analysis of hydro-generator.

Bearing problems are one major cause for drive failures. Their detection is possible by vibration monitoring of characteristic bearing frequencies. As it is possible to detect other machine faults by monitoring the stator current, a great interest exists in applying the same method for bearing fault detection. After a presentation of the existing fault model, a new detailed approach is proposed. It is based on two effects of a bearing fault: the introduction of a particular radial rotor movement and load torque variations caused by the bearing fault. The theoretical study results in new expressions for the stator current frequency content. Experimental tests with artificial and realistic bearing damage were conducted by measuring vibration. torque and stator current. The obtained results by spectral analysis of the measured quantities validate the proposed theoretical approach.				martin.blodt@leei.enseeiht.fr; pierre.granjon@lis.inpg.fr; bertrand.raison@leg.ensieg.inpg.fr; gilles.rostaing@leg.ensieg.inpg.fr	Granjon, Pierre/AAX-1140-2021; Granjon, Pierre/G-9646-2015	Granjon, Pierre/0000-0002-9019-4798; RAISON, Bertrand/0000-0002-1843-4021			Benbouzid MEH, 2003, IEEE T ENERGY CONVER, V18, P238, DOI 10.1109/TEC.2003.811741; BOASHASH B, 1992, P IEEE, V80, P520, DOI 10.1109/5.135376; Bonaldi EL, 2002, IEEE IND ELEC, P3383, DOI 10.1109/IECON.2002.1182941; CAMERON JR, 1986, IEE PROC-B, V133, P155, DOI 10.1049/ip-b.1986.0022; CARLSON AB, 1986, COMMUNICATION SYSTEM; Donnell P.

Many studies have been available for a long time about induction motor rotor faults but few include a part for the machine under defects in the model. The aim of this paper is to have a simulation tool of induction motors with rotor broken bars which, in spite of their increasing complexity. are able to provide with useful indications for diagnostic purposes. The tool is suitable for the simulation of motors behavior under rotor defect taking into account inter-bar currents. The proposed model is based on the mesh model analysis of the squirrel cage. As low power induction motors are the larger to be used in industrial plants, we pay a special attention on them. Notwithstanding, the additional currents are due to the contact between the non-insulated bar constituting the squirrel cage to the rotor iron core, they are very important. Traditionally, the motor monitoring is made thanks to the analysis of the stator current when the motor operates under nominal load. Moreover, this one has to be observed in steady state operating system knowing that the motor is generally fed by a sinusoidal supply. Consequently, simulation results show the effectiveness of the approach proposed and the impact of inter-bar resistance both on the model and the sidebands for the diagnostic.

The emf induced in a search coil which is proportional to the axial flux derivative, is measured in order to detect, in presence of voltage source dissymmetry, incipient stator inter-turn short-circuits in working induction machines. Starting from a theoretical analysis of the axial leakage flux spectrum associated to this fault, the measurement of the corresponding emf in the search coil is examined. The proposed simplified axial flux spectrum gives directly the sensitive frequency components to study faults for both no-load and rated-load operations. This spectrum enables us to observe directly the evolution of these components during the fault conditions, materialized by the presence of a few stator inter-turn short-circuits, compared to normal operation. An experimental test-bed with a 230V/400V-50Hz-11kW three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine has been used to verify the efficiency of this tool. Finally, the performance of the proposed technique is proved experimentally.

In this condition, no current flows in the stator windings and the voltages measurable at its terminals are due to flux produced by rotor current. If there are some broken bars and the rotor symmetry is compromised, the voltages induced in the stator windings results distorted and some particular harmonics increase their amplitudes. The diagnostic technique is based on monitoring these voltage harmonics by analyzing the space vector of the voltages induced in the stator windings via Short-Time MUSIC: (STMUSIC) time-frequency pseudo-representation. The output data of MUSIC processing are fed into an unsupervised self-organizing neural network (NN) with an ABCL training algorithm that is able to successfully discriminate between data measured on healthy and faulty motors.

The knowledge of skilled engineers for diagnosing rotating machines is represented by a syndrome matrix, and production rules for both crisp and fuzzy inferences are composed based on the matrix. Membership functions for fuzzy rules are determined by using the knowledge of engineers for diagnosing rotating machines. In the method, spectrum bandwidths are introduced to allow the variations of spectra for individual machines and/or errors in measurement. A set of candidate of faults is obtained after crisp inferences based on production rules for them. Then, the confidence factor of every member in the set is determined by fuzzy inference.

In terms of the aims of structural health diagnosis, damage identification method defines four levels of damage identification as follows (Rytter, 1993): Determination that damage is present in the structure; determination of the geometric location of the damage; quantification of the severity of the damage; prediction of the remaining service life of the structure. Modem structural health monitoring system includes four aspects as follows: (1) sensing capabilities; (2) data processing; (3) baseline and quantification; (4) structural prognosis. In recent 2 decades, the vast majority of published work on monitoring civil structures has focused on developing algorithms to advance the detection and diagnosis of damage to structures. That is to say, the third and the last aspects are emphasized. From the first aspect, current monitoring systems make use of conventional cable-based sensors to transmit their measurements to a processing center. The monitoring system based on signal cables for civil structures has a higher installation costs and the signal wires are vulnerable to environment noise corruption. To improve these disadvantages, a task effort has been made towards to developing a wireless monitoring system. In this paper, a wireless unit for real-time structural response measurements has been designed and fabricated. Drawing upon advanced technological developments in the areas of wireless communications, low-power microprocessors and transmitting-incepting unit and sensing transducers, the wireless unit represents a highly-performance but lower-cost measure of monitoring performance of structures in the short-term and long-term. The wireless system consists of data acquisition unit, CPU control unit, data memory unit, wireless transmitting-incepting control unit and computer communication unit. The wireless system works as following principle: first, data acquisition unit sends the signals of vibration sensors to CPU control unit by managing and A/D converting the signal. Then, CPU control unit sends the data to data memory unit according to some logic relation. At the same time, useful data is transmitted wirelessly and the data is incepted to the computer. This system can be used in the prudent allocation of emergency response resources after earthquakes and for identification of initial damage in structures experiencing long-term deterioration. There is an economic and societal need to improve the response condition assessment capabilities immediately following earthquakes and to extend the useful life of current infrastructure. To meet this need, the research in this study aims to provide a wireless system.

Therefore, an analysis method by means of wavelet packet transform to gear vibration signal is presented. The signal decomposition and reconstruction algorithm based on orthogonal multi-resolution analysis-Mallet and its improved algorithm are presented. We derive Mallat algorithm of wavelet packet transforms followed binary form. Then three-shaft gear box 6J90T, which is open-teeth, is adopted in the experiment. Preliminary decision is that fault happens on the gear of intermediate shaft. From the result through wavelet package of the gearbox that is showed as figure 1, We can see that the impulse interval is 80ms and the position signal conforms to the time domain signal. But these impulses visibly concentrate on the 300Hz frequency band in frequency domain. So the accident happened on the gear that make intermediate shaft and output gear engage. The fault detection experiment to the gearbox proved to be effective.

The approach leads to the concept of distributed sensor networks, which are basically systems composed of connected, co-operating information sources, organized into highly structured, message-exchanging networks. The proposed DSN architecture has been designed for intelligent maintenance and diagnosis of machine performance, the detection of a normal/dangerous situations. The data fusion module is organized into three different sub-modules, each one characterized by appropriate fusion strategies. A neural tree-based approach is applied to fuse information at different levels of the DSN. Data fusion benefits from multiple attributes of neural networks. A framework of distributed sensor fusion is developed for information fusion of machine fault recognition to make the maintenance systems smarter. Neural tree methods are developed for data fusion for measuring machine intelligent maintenance. This distributed sensor networks approach-for data fusion provide the better platform for real time intelligent maintenance.

Unfortunately many of these features are either partially or completely irrelevant or redundant to the fault state. Feature selection can remove redundant features to enhance the effect of diagnosis in mechanical fault diagnosis. This paper adopts Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a fault classifier, and don't use traditionally k-folds cross-validation as an estimator of the generalization error, but takes into account the existing bounds on the generalization error for evaluation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). And applies Genetic Algorithms (GAs) comibined with Simulated Annealing (SA) to solve feature selection problem. Because the bound on the generalization error is computationally much faster than k-folds cross-validation, since we do not have to retrain times on each feature subset but just once. According to results of bearing fault feature selection example, it is proved that this method possess excellent optimization feature subset property, reduce the significant overfitting problem, leads to a better generalization performance and shows the fact of saving more time than by using cross-validation.

Computers have brought to life terms like artificial intelligence, and have played a critical role in reinvention of manufacturing industry. In continuing quest to decrease the time interval between conceptualization of a product, information technology has been fused with manufacturing practice. This paper describes the use of expert system shell to develop a rule-based expert auto wire bond machine fault diagnosis system in hi-tech semi-conductor industry. The main aim of the research is to diagnose the problem of auto wire bond machine. In semiconductor industry, production equipment and machine have depended heavily on the use of human expertise for maintenance and it is costly. Without an expert system, his/her experience is lost when human is unavailable. This human replacement' process is certainly a convenient way to be applied. With the expert system, processes or tool that implemented will be standardized and accuracy will be increased compared to the conventional way. Therefore, the quality of product that are produced will be finer and better. The constrains values for the fault diagnosis are based on design data and experience of the engineer.

These were the thread tension, hook timing, needle position and the number of fabric plies. Through a course of 2(4) factorial experiments, employing a previously developed On-line Sewing Thread Utilisation Monitoring System, the various affects, caused by the changing factors, were monitored and analysed with a high degree of accuracy without interfering with the natural stitch formation process. It was found from the experiments that by advancing the hook timing and needle position, thread consumption was reduced while the seam strength was increased, while not increasing peak dynamic tension of the needle thread. The needle thread tension and the needle thread consumption signatures were shown to be an indicator of changes made to the stitch forming elements during the experimental investigations. These correlated with changes in the seam strength. These two signatures could be used to identify seam faults due to misalignment of the stitch forming elements occurring during the normal cause of sewing.

These intelligent service networks provide a critical opportunity for companies to gain additional revenues at the same time that they reduce costs for the companies and their customers alike. Intelligent service models are emerging first in complex industries such as automotive, defense, power and aerospace. In this paper we develop a framework for real-time agent-enabled intelligent service provisioning using a new machine learning algorithm called associative memory.

The ability of such webs to deform easily, along with their complex patterns, presents a challenging problem for any machine vision system. Their pattern complexity makes it very difficult to use any global image processing or rule-based techniques for inspection, leaving direct comparison with a perfect prototype as the only choice available. Due to the elastic nature of the lace fabric, small distortions are characteristic of the product and are unavoidable. This renders sensitive direct comparison methods, such as those employed for the automatic inspection of printed circuit boards, prone to unacceptable false alarms. In the present work, the authors have exploited a mechatronic methodology, coupled with image processing techniques, to develop a high-speed inspection station for complex patterned lace webs.

An HSMM is a hidden Markov model (HMM) with temporal structures. Unlike HMM, an HSMM does not follow the unrealistic Markov chain assumption and therefore provides more powerful modeling and analysis capability for real problems. In addition, an HSMM allows modeling the time duration of the hidden states and therefore is capable of prognosis. To facilitate the computation in the proposed HSMM-based diagnostics and prognostics, new forward-backward variables are defined and a modified forward-backward algorithm is developed. The model parameters are estimated through the modified forward-backward training algorithm. The estimated state duration probability distributions can be used to predict the useful remaining life of the systems. The evaluation of the proposed methodology was carried out through a real case study: health diagnosis of hydraulic pumps. In all the tests, the recognition rates for all the states are 100%. For each individual pump, the recognition rate is increased by 29.3% in comparison with HMMs. Because of their built-in prognostic capability, it is possible to use the same HSMMs to predict the remaining useful life of the pumps.

Recently, several researchers have proposed novel applications of virtual machine technology, such as Internet Suspend/Resume [25, 31] and transparent OS-level rollback and replay [13]. Unfortunately, current VMMs do not export enough functionality to budding developers of such applications, forcing them either to reverse engineer pieces of a black-box VMM, or to reimplement significant portions of a VMM. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of muDenali, an extensible and programmable virtual machine monitor that has the ability to run modern operating systems. muDenali allows programmers to extend the virtual architecture exposed by the VMM to a virtual machine, in effect giving systems programmers the ability to dynamically assemble a virtual machine out of either default or custom-built virtual hardware elements. muDenali allows programmers to interpose on and modify events at the level of the virtual architecture, enabling them to easily perform tasks such as manipulating disk and network events, or capturing and migrating virtual machine state. In addition to describing and evaluating our extensible virtual machine monitor, we present an application-level API that simplifies writing extensions, and we discuss applications of virtual machines that we have built using this API.

Owing to this, abnormal supersynchronous vibrations of rotating machines can be ascribed to false serious faults like rotor-to-stator rubs, cracks and severe misalignments. A sensitivity analysis of a cylindrical journal bearing to the occurrence of non-linear effects has been carried out by means of a simple mathematical model. The capability of some dimensionless diagnostic indexes to highlight significant symptoms of the non-linear behaviour of journal bearings has been analysed. The results of this investigation are shown in the paper together with some results obtained with the analysis of experimental vibrations of real rotating machines.

In this regard the dynamic behaviour of a real machine has been analysed. This investigation mainly focused on the sensitivity of the coupling between lateral and torsional vibrations due to the dynamic stiffness of oil-film journal bearings. This study proved to be very useful for diagnostic purposes to predict torsional vibrations of rotating machines that in general are rather difficult to measure on real plants.

In this paper, a genetic-programming based feature extraction method is proposed to improve the performance of the fault detection and classification in rotating machinery, and reduce the number of features required as inputs to the classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of GP to discover automatically the difference between bearing conditions using features expressed in the form of non-linear functions. The GP-based approach for feature extraction is used for bearing fault detection and exhibits superior searching power over other techniques.

The use of a reliable model can increase the accuracy of the identification. Rigid supports or Jumped mass pedestals are not always enough to account for the foundation dynamics; a modal representation of the supports can improve the identification results. This method is discussed and validated using experimental data from a 320 MW steam turbogenerator. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of fault identification on real data from a large machine, where the supporting structure is accounted for by means of a modal model.

C	Adams, ML; Loparo, KA			IMechE	Adams, ML; Loparo, KA			Analysis of rolling element bearing faults in rotating machinery - experiments, modelling, fault detection, and diagnosis	VIBRATIONS IN ROTATING MACHINERY	IMECHE CONFERENCE TRANSACTIONS		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Vibrations in Rotating Machinery	SEP 07-09, 2004	Univ Wales Swansea, Swansea, WALES	IMechE, Tribol Grp & Mechatron Informat & Control Grp	Univ Wales Swansea		DEFECT	One of the most common failures in rotating machines is a rolling element bearing failure. Current bearing fault detection methods do not adequately consider the physics of bearing failures, and as a result they generally do not perform well in actual practice. Therefore the goal of this paper is to provide a physics-based foundation for rolling element bearing fault analysis. In order to achieve this goal, a detailed mechanical model of an electric motor is developed with particular emphasis on the bearings and the introduction of bearing faults. Experiments are conducted on a real motor in order to parameterize and validate the detailed model of the motor/bearing system. The model is a 29 degree-of-freedom, nonlinear, time variant representation of the motor/bearing system, including a treatment of the Hertzian contact forces between the bearing elements as well as including a flexible, user-definable method for simulating faults ranging from initial spalls to advanced surface damage. Subsequent to model parameterization and verification, multiple and distributed bearing faults (i.e. advanced surface damage) are explored computationally. The results of these system response predictions indicate that envelope analysis, an established bearing fault detection method based on the demodulation of the system's vibration response, may be employed in some circumstances not only to detect, but also to diagnose single faults, multiple faults, and distributed faults. More importantly, the relative magnitudes of the defect frequencies and especially their harmonics in the envelope spectra are shown in specific cases to indicate the nature of a particular bearing fault.

C	Bucher, I; Shomer, O; Raz, H			IMechE	Bucher, I; Shomer, O; Raz, H			Active diagnostics of rotating structures	VIBRATIONS IN ROTATING MACHINERY	IMECHE CONFERENCE TRANSACTIONS		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Vibrations in Rotating Machinery	SEP 07-09, 2004	Univ Wales Swansea, Swansea, WALES	IMechE, Tribol Grp & Mechatron Informat & Control Grp	Univ Wales Swansea			Fault diagnosis in rotating machines is often dealt with by employing model-based diagnostics procedures that attempt to relate response measurements to a specific fault. Many of the available detection methods fail because the required information is buried under much larger response signal levels. In this paper, active probing forces are being used to enhance the fault-related signal components by several orders of magnitude. It is well known that minute developing faults may have a negligible effect on measured signals under normal operating conditions. In theory, many faults do produce special features in the response giving rise to additional harmonics or modulation of the response. In practice due to the small magnitude of these signal components compared with the unbalance and normal dynamical response, faults are only detected when they are sever. The availability of an external forcing device (active magnetic bearings) and a mathematical model of fault related response is being use to inject speed-dependent fault-tuned forces that make any mass or stiffness asymmetry evident and thus allow for early warnings. A dedicated model of a flexible rotor is developed for which a mathematical expression of the required forcing pattern is shown. A numerical simulation and an experimental rig are presented showing a practical implementation can be realised.

It directly decides production safety and economy benefit of production units. If big equipment stopped working for one day, the loss would be much! The coal excavator, which is one of most important equipments used in mine, will be of thirty thousand dollar loss if stopping one hour. So it is very important to guarantee coal excavator form faults and make it work without errors in all cutting process, that is base on earlier diagnosis and earlier maintain of fault. But it is not case for faults to be earlier diagnosed, which needs actual-time measuring and testing of work characteristic of coal excavator and understanding of deep level knowledge of its model. We apply expert system and neural network to catch all kinds of information from sensors, extract feature from them to obtain accurate message of coal excavator in running process and finally carry out information fusion to achieve result of early fault intelligent diagnosis for coal excavator. Although it is designed for coal excavator, it may be used in other fields, too.

J	Hu, NQ; Wen, XS				Hu, NQ; Wen, XS			The application of Duffing oscillator in characteristic signal detection of early fault	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								This paper presents a study of application of Duffing oscillator for extracting the features of early mechanical failure signal. By analysis of global solutions and bifurcation set of Duffing equation, we conclude that the bifurcation threshold, which corresponds to the maximum orbit outside the homoclinic orbit of Duffing equation, can be used to detect weak signal, such as the characteristic signal of early machinery fault. Therefore, the Duffing oscillator is suitable to be a model for weak signal detection, although some relative aspects for practical uses should be considered carefully. In this paper, the strategies for testing whether the weak signal is exists and how to estimate its amplitude are discussed in detail. Moreover, an example is presented here to demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing the early rub-impact signal appearing in a rotor. The results show that the method is effective for early detection of fault described by specific periodic-motion components such as rub-impact fault of rotor in aeroengine.

J	Hadjicostis, CN				Hadjicostis, CN			Nonconcurrent error detection and correction in fault-tolerant linear finite-state machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						linear finite-state machines; linear coding; fault tolerance; transient faults; nonconcurrent error detection and correction; system embeddings		In this paper, we construct fault-tolerant linear finite-state machines (LFSMs) in which error. detection and correction can be performed nonconcurrently (e.g., periodically). More specifically, by jointly choosing the state encoding constraints and the redundant dynamics of the fault-tolerant LFSM we enable an external checker to detect and identify errors due to past faults based on the current, possibly corrupted state of. the LFSM. The paper presents systematic constructions of fault-tolerant LFSMs based on a characterization of nonconcurrent error detection/correction in terms of state encoding constraints and redundant dynamics. In particular, we develop a scheme that uses Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) coding and obtains fault-tolerant LFSMs that require 2D additional state variables and have the ability to correct up to D errors in any state variable at any time step in the time interval consisting of the latest N time steps of operations The construction uses the minimum possible number of additional state variables and requires an error detecting/correcting mechanism with computational complexity that is only linear in N.

J	Drineas, P; Makris, Y				Drineas, P; Makris, Y			SPaRe: Selective partial replication for concurrent fault-detection in FSMs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						concurrent test; finite state machine (FSMs)	CIRCUITS; DESIGN; AUTOMATA	We discuss SPaRe: selective partial replication, a methodology for concurrent fault detection in finite state machine (FSMs). The proposed method is similar to duplication, wherein a replica of the circuit acts as a predictor that immediately detects errors by comparison to the original FSM. However, instead of duplicating the FSM, SPaRe selects a few prediction functions which only partially replicate it. Selection is guided by the objective of minimizing the incurred hardware overhead without compromising the ability to detect all faults, yet possibly introducing fault-detection latency. SPaRe is nonintrusive and does not interfere with the encoding and implementation of the original FSM. Experimental results indicate that SPaRe achieves significant hardware overhead reduction over both duplication and test vector logic replication (TVLR), a previously reported concurrent fault-detection method. Moreover, as compared to TVLR, SPaRe also reduces the average fault-detection latency for detecting all permanent faults.

J	Lin, Y; Zhang, WJ; Watson, LG				Lin, Y; Zhang, WJ; Watson, LG			Using eye movement parameters for evaluating human-machine interface frameworks under normal control operation and fault detection situations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							ECOLOGICAL INTERFACE; PUPILLARY RESPONSES; PROCESSING LOAD; DESIGN; INDEXES; SIZE	A human-machine interface framework provides general guidelines for what information should be put on an interface display screen. The framework is thus a first step towards the design of an effective and efficient interface. This paper reports on an experimental study of two proposed frameworks: the ecological interface design framework and the function-behaviour-state framework. In order to provide an unbiased comparative evaluation for both interfaces, the same application problem is used. The interfaces, based on each of the two frameworks, are implemented with as similar look-and-feel forms as possible in the presentation of information contents. Only the normal control operation and fault detection situations are considered at this stage of the study. In addition, in this study three categories of measures are used, namely: the performance measure; the physiological measure (the eye movement measure: the eye fixation and the pupil diameter change, in particular); and the subjective (or the user-rated) measure. The major results obtained from the study includes the following: (1) the information called the abstract function in the ecological interface design framework may not positively correlate to the performance improvement yet may increase the mental workload, (2) the function-behaviour-state framework seems more agreeable with the operator's mental model, and (3) operators may perform equally well with a function-behaviour-state interface but with a reduced mental workload. It is also found that the eye fixation measure is highly consistent with the performance measure and the subjective measure. The pupil diameter measure is found not to be significantly sensitive to the mental workload information; however, it appears sensitive to the mental workload information among individual participants and shows a consistent result with the other measures used.

J	King, T				King, T			Vision-in-the-loop for control in manufacturing	MECHATRONICS			English	Article						machine vision; inspection; deformable materials; garment assembly; fault detection; faultrectification; inkjet printing; digital printing	INSPECTION	Machine vision is an invaluable component of automated manufacturing in situations where a high degree of randomness in the product, or the process, prevents the construction of a suitably structured environment for traditional automation or robotics. Case studies are presented of four mechatronic systems developed, or being researched, for quite different processes in the textile industry: garment assembly, lace cutting (scalloping), lace inspection and inkjet printing. They illustrate the potential for vision-in-the-loop in manufacturing. Although divergent in their purposes, the systems share a common theme: they each use line-scan machine vision, 'incremental' image processing rather than frame-based techniques and an integrated mechatronic design approach.

Part of their success is due to the high quality beam that is directly related to the condition of components involved in the lasing process. However, maintaining the requisite beam quality requires frequent and time-consuming intervention by maintenance operators, specifically, for dismounting, inspection, servicing, and reassembly. Preventive maintenance, targeting reduction of machine downtime by prevention of faults, is the de facto maintenance program for lasers in industry. In this work, condition monitoring and lifetime estimation have been proposed to enable predictive maintenance programs for CO2 lasers. Specifically, the cooling system of a CO2 laser is monitored to infer its health condition, which is then used to statistically predict its lifetime. A Weibull distribution has been used to model the hazard function that depends on the operating parameters and the condition of the machine. The monitoring and estimation strategy has been verified using simulation. Results of tests conducted at Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at the Pennsylvania State University to exemplify the proposed approach are also presented. (C) 2003 Laser Institute of America.

Machining errors are thus introduced, transformed and accumulated as the workpiece is being machined. This paper introduces procedures for expressing the influence of errors in fixtures, locating datum features and measurement datum features on dimensional errors in machining. These procedures are essential in the derivation of the Stream of Variation model of dimensional machining errors using the CAD/CAPP parameters of the machining process. The linear state space form of the Stream of Variation model allows for advanced control theory achievements to be employed in formal solutions to problems in multi-station machining. Modeling procedures presented in this paper were experimentally verified in machining of an automotive cylinder head.

J	Nikolaou, NG; Antoniadis, IA				Nikolaou, NG; Antoniadis, IA			Application of morphological operators as envelope extractors for impulsive-type periodic signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARING; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION SIGNALS; DEMODULATION; DEFECTS; FILTER; EEG	Impulsive-type periodic signals characterise the vibration response of machines subjected to frequent defects or wear of typical machine parts, like bearings or gears. Processing of the above signals entirely in the time domain is considered, using morphological analysis. The basic morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening, closing) are used for construction of the envelope of impulsive-type periodic vibration signals. The effect of the type of the morphological operator and of the structuring element on the shape of the envelope is examined, The basic idea is to extract information from the time-domain shape of the signal, corresponding to the initial impulse series. The procedure is evaluated using simulated impulsive signals, as well as vibration signals, measured on two defective bearings of an industrial installation, which presents, respectively, an outer race fault and an inner race fault.

J	Zhou, SY; Ding, Y; Chen, Y; Shi, JJ				Zhou, SY; Ding, Y; Chen, Y; Shi, JJ			Diagnosability study of multistage manufacturing processes based on linear mixed-effects models	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						diagnosability analysis; fault diagnosis; multistage manufacturing process; quality control; variance components analysis	VARIATION PROPAGATION; VARIATION TRANSMISSION; DIAGNOSIS	Automatic in-process data collection techniques have been widely used in complicated manufacturing processes in recent years. The huge amounts of product measurement data have created great opportunities for process monitoring and diagnosis. Given such product quality measurements, this article examines the diagnosability of the process faults in a multistage manufacturing process using a linear mixed-effects model. Fault diagnosability is defined in a general way that does not depend on specific diagnosis algorithms. The concept of a minimal diagnosable class is proposed to expose the "aliasing" structure among process faults in a partially diagnosable system. The algorithms and procedures needed to obtain the minimal diagnosable class and to evaluate the system-level diagnosability are presented. The methodology, which can be used for any general linear input-output system, is illustrated using a panel assembly process and an engine head machining process.

The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. The extracted features from original and preprocessed signals are used as inputs to the classifiers for two-class (normal or fault) recognition. The classifier parameters, e.g., the number of nodes in the hidden layer in case of ANNs and the radial basis function kernel parameter (width) in case of SVMs along with the selection of input features are optimized using genetic algorithms. The classifiers are trained with a subset of the experimental data for known machine conditions and are tested using the remaining set of data. The procedure is illustrated using the experimental vibration data of a rotating machine. The roles of different vibration signals and signal preprocessing techniques are investigated. The results show the effectiveness of the features and the classifiers in detection of machine condition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In addition to nameplate information required for the initial system. setup, the proposed fault diagnosis system uses only motor terminal voltages and currents. The effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis system in detecting the most widely encountered motor electrical and mechanical faults is demonstrated through extensive staged faults. The developed system is scalable to different power ratings and it has been successfully demonstrated with data from 2.2-, 373-, and 597-kW induction motors.

Three synthetical signals are used to evaluate and compare the classification performance of these techniques. Some related computation issues, such as characters of different TFRs and weighted window length, are discussed. Experimental case studies, joint fault diagnosis, are realized.

J	Yesilyurt, I				Yesilyurt, I			Fault detection and location in gears by the smoothed instantaneous power spectrum distribution	NDT & E INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						gear fault detection; time-frequency analysis; interference reduction		Time-frequency methods are effective tools for analysing diagnostics signals and have been widely used to describe machine condition. This paper introduces a time-frequency distribution, called the smoothed instantaneous power spectrum (SIPS) distribution, and demonstrates its use in the detection and location of local tooth defects in gears. The SIPS distribution is derived from the frequency domain definition of the instantaneous power spectrum (IPS) distribution, but has the added advantage that provides a considerable reduction in the ringing effect of the IPS transform, which results in a smoother and clearer time-frequency representation. A simulated gear vibration signal is used to show the capabilities of the proposed method over the IPS distribution and spectrogram. Healthy and faulty vibration signals monitored from a gear test rig are analysed, the results of which show that a local gear tooth defect can clearly be detected by the SIPS distribution.

Currently there are various international quality of care programs for the evaluation of IC. At the heart of such quality of care programs lie prognostic models whose prediction of patient mortality can be used as a norm to which actual mortality is compared. The current generation of prognostic models in IC are statistical parametric models based on logistic regression. Given a description of a patient at admission, these models predict the probability of his or her survival. Typically, this patient description relies on an aggregate variable, called a score, that quantifies the severity of illness of the patient. The use of a parametric model and an aggregate score form adequate means to develop models when data is relatively scarce but it introduces the risk of bias. This paper motivates and suggests a method for studying and improving the performance behavior of current state-of-the-art IC prognostic models. Our method is based on machine learning and statistical ideas and relies on exploiting information that underlies a score variable. In particular, this underlying information is used to construct a classification tree whose nodes denote patient sub-populations. For these sub-populations, local models, most notably logistic regression ones, are developed using only the total score variable. We compare the performance of this hybrid model to that of a traditional global logistic regression model. We show that the hybrid model not only provides more insight into the data but also has a better performance. We pay special attention to the precision aspect of model performance and argue why precision is more important than discrimination ability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The study involved a conventional conservative treatment, sham treatment, biphasic pulsed current, and direct current electrical stimulation. Data was collected over 10 years and suffices for an analysis with machine learning methods. So far, only a limited number of studies have investigated the wound and patient attributes which affect the chronic wound healing. There is none to our knowledge to include treatment attributes. The aims of our study are to determine effects of the wound, patient and treatment attributes on the wound healing process and to propose a system for prediction of the wound healing rate. First we analyzed which wound and patient attributes play a predominant role in the wound healing process and investigated a possibility to predict the wound healing rate at the beginning of the treatment based on the initial wound, patient and treatment attributes. Later we tried to enhance the wound healing rate prediction accuracy by predicting it after a few weeks of the wound healing follow-up. Using the attribute estimation algorithms ReliefF and RReliefF we obtained a ranking of the prognostic factors which was comprehensible to experts. We used regression and classification trees to build models for prediction of the wound healing rate. The obtained results are encouraging and may form a basis for an expert system for the chronic wound healing rate prediction. If the wound healing rate is known, then the provided information can help to formulate the appropriate treatment decisions and orient resources towards individuals with poor prognosis.

Mass spectrometry (MS) holds great promise for biomarker identification and genome-wide protein profiling. It has been demonstrated in the literature that biomarkers can be identified to distinguish normal individuals from cancer patients using MS data. Such progress is especially exciting for the detection of early-stage ovarian cancer patients. Although various statistical methods have been utilized to identify biomarkers from MS data, there has been no systematic comparison among these approaches in their relative ability to analyze MS data. Results: We compare the performance of several classes of statistical methods for the classification of cancer based on MS spectra. These methods include: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor classifier, bagging and boosting classification trees, support vector machine, and random forest (RF). The methods are applied to ovarian cancer and control serum samples from the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program clinic at Northwestern University Hospital. We found that RF outperforms other methods in the analysis of MS data.

The tritium levels within the vessel have remained sufficiently high, 6.2 g at the end of the DTE1 experiment and currently 1.5 g, such that the AGHS has been required to operate continuously to detritiate gases liberated during D-D operations and to maintain discharges to the environment to ALARP. Maintaining the system to ensure continued operation has been a key factor in guaranteeing the continued availability of the essential sub-systems. The operational history of the JET AGHS has been previously documented in a number of papers [R. Lasser et al. Proc. of the 19th SOFT Conf. 1 (1996) 227; R. Lasser et al., Fusion Eng. Des. 46 (1999) 307; P.D. Brennan, et al., 18th Symp. on Fusion Eng., 1999]. Operational downtime is minimised through well-engineered sub-systems that use high integrity components. Outage, contamination and operator dosage are minimised through pre-planned and prepared maintenance operations. The reliability of sub-system critical condition fault detection is demonstrated through routine testing of hard-wired alarms and interlocks. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Han, Y; Song, YH				Han, Y; Song, YH			Using improved self-organizing map for partial discharge diagnosis of large turbogenerators	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						fault diagnosis; neural networks; partial discharge; turbogenerator	RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION	Partial discharge (PD) classification is a powerful way to predict insulation problems of the windings of rotating machinery. While online PD tests have been carried out for over 40 years, effective diagnostic methods are still under development. In this paper, a practical diagnostic method is proposed based on an improved self-organizing map (SOM) with improved clustering indications. Three feature extraction methods are employed for the SOM implementation, including Weibull analysis, statistical operators, and fractal parameters. Experimental PD data of industrial model bars are used to validate the efficiency of using SOM for PD, classification. The method is applied to investigate the turbine generator analyzer (TGA) data obtained from a power plant of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Diagnostic results are included to demonstrate that the relationship between the new PD measurement and historical data can be visualized and more confidential diagnostic information can be provided, especially when small-size database, new class of data, and doubtful measurements are involved in a practical environment.

In the past 20 years, stray flux sensors have been used for diagnostic purposes but rarely in the presence of a complex power supply such as a voltage static inverter. In this paper, it is proved that a simple external stray flux sensor is more efficient than the classical stator current signature analysis to detect inter-turn short circuit in three-phase induction machines. The new result is that, even in the presence of power supply harmonics, it is possible to easily detect the stator winding faults in the low-frequency range of the flux spectrum with low-frequency resolution.

J	Abbaszadeh, K; Milimonfared, J; Toliyat, HA				Abbaszadeh, K; Milimonfared, J; Toliyat, HA			A novel approach to broken bar detection in induction motor via wavelet transformation	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						wavelet induction motor; broken bars; fault diagnosis		This paper presents a novel approach for the detection of broken rotor bars in induction motors based on the wavelet transformation. A multi-resolution signal decomposition based on wavelet transform or wavelet packet provides a set of decomposed signals in independent frequency bands which contain a large amount of independent dynamic information due to the orthogonality of wavelet functions. Wavelet transform and wavelet packet in tandem with some signal processing methods such as autoregressive spectrum, energy monitoring, fractal dimension, etc., can produce many desirable results for condition monitoring and the fault diagnosis of an induction motor. Broken bar detection is based on decomposing the stator currents, and then extracting the wavelet coefficients of these signals. Comparing these extracted coefficients can diagnose a healthy machine from a faulty machine. Experimental results are presented in healthy, two, three, four, and five broken bars. Deviation of wavelet coefficients in a healthy mode from a faulty mode shows the number of broken bars in the rotor cage. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method for broken rotor bar detection in squirrel cage induction motors.

The accuracy and reliability of sensor measurement is a prerequisite for reducing the uncertainty of the fusion system and accurately diagnosing system faults. The measurement error of the multisensor and the degree of reliability of the detecting system can be determined by a multisensor consistency check. In this paper, we use the "probability distance measure" to determine the compatibility of multisensor information and to ensure that the measurements represent the same target (or state). We show our experimental results, which demonstrate a good result.

J	He, Y; Chua, PSK; Lim, GH; Tan, ACH				He, Y; Chua, PSK; Lim, GH; Tan, ACH			Fault diagnosis of loaded water hydraulic actuators by Online testing with LabVIEW (R)	JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION			English	Article						fault diagnosis; online testing; water hydraulic system; LabVIEW (R); actuators		In recent years, with the development of technology in materials and machining, it is becoming possible to produce modem water hydraulic components that are made of lubricant-free and anticorrosive materials and to achieve very close tolerances to reduce internal leakage due to the low viscosity of water. As water is nontoxic, environmentally friendly, and readily available, many industries are already turning to modem water hydraulic systems to replace their oil hydraulic counterparts. As with all systems, the increasing use of water hydraulic systems by more industries will result in a greater need to monitor and maintain the systems. This paper is concerned with online testing and fault diagnosis of loaded modem water hydraulic cylinders and axial piston motors. LabVIEW(R) (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) data acquisition hardware and development software were used for data acquisition and processing. Likely real-life faults were simulated on the hydraulic actuators' internal components. The actuators also were operated to capture their unique vibration signals in their faulty states and the results compared with reference signatures of the same actuators when they were in their new or healthy states. The vibration signatures and amplitude spectra, average extension/retraction duration, and flow trending amplitude of the water hydraulic actuators versus piston seal wear, rod seal wear, piston shoe wear, and capstan surface wear under different operating conditions of simulated loads and speeds are presented and discussed. The results show that there is a distinctive variation in vibration signals, flow rate, and average stroking duration with increase in loads for both actuators.

A quantitative index, called residual is introduced to evaluate the accuracy of the performed identification. The actual developing faults taken into account are some of the most common on rotating machines such as unbalances, thermal bows, fatigue cracks and radial and angular misalignments of couplings.

In practical fault diagnosis, it is very difficult to improve the recognition rate of pattern recognition, especially when the sample data are similar. To solve these difficulties, a fault diagnosis system using fuzzy neural networks is proposed in this research. A fault diagnosis system with fuzzy neural networks is based on a series of standard fault pattern pairings between fault symptoms and fault. Fuzzy neural networks are trained to memorize these standard pattern pairs. Unlike other neural networks, fuzzy neural networks adopt bi-directional association. They make use of information from both the fault symptoms and the fault patterns, which can improve recognition rate greatly. When an unknown sample becomes the input for a trained fault diagnosis system, the fault diagnosis system can make fault diagnosis by bi-directional association of fuzzy neural networks. Through experiments with a rotor testing table and applications in monitoring and fault diagnosis of water pump sets of oil plant, it is verified that fuzzy neural networks have a well distinguished ability and are effective to perform fault diagnosis of rotary machines.

However, it is not easy to determine the fault symptoms by which all fault categories can be distinguished perfectly and automatically. In order to resolve this problem, we proposed: (1) a new fuzzy diagnosis method called "sequential fuzzy diagnosis", and (2) an identification method of the membership function of the symptom parameter by possibility theory. The efficiency of the above methods was verified by applying them to the rolling bearing diagnosis system and others. In the system of rolling bearing diagnosis, the symptom parameters are calculated by "goodness of fit" with spectrum analysis. The results of sequential fuzzy diagnosis show the correct conclusions when inputting field data to the system.

Anomalous operations caused by a broken rotor bar or a faulty stator cutting phase are analysed. Starting from a theoretical analysis of the radial field spectrum associated with these faults, the measurement of the corresponding emf in the search antenna is examined. The saturation and harmonic components of the permeance produced by the slotting effect are taken into account. Their interactions are analysed, allowing the identification of the frequencies which are of interest for the detection of stator cutting phase faults in a working induction motor.

J	Yang, WX				Yang, WX			Vibration-based diagnosis of engine valve faults	INSIGHT			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIESEL-ENGINE; KNOWLEDGE; FUZZY	Owing to the complex structure and the presence of a multiplicity of sources, the vibratory signals collected from diesel engines are always complicated in composition. The features extracted from one kind of faulty signal often overlap with those collected from other kinds of faulty signals. This phenomenon confuses the machine operators and usually misleads them into drawing a wrong conclusion. The use of effective features and the adoption of a powerful diagnostic strategy are two critical issues leading to successful diagnosis of machine faults. Both a specially designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) technique were adopted in the paper, and an effective method has been achieved for diagnosing the faults occurring on the engine valves. Five kinds of valve faults are simulated on the sixth exhaust valve of a 6135-type diesel engine. The experiments fully prove that the proposed method is effective on valve fault diagnosis and has a great potential to be more widely accepted in industry.

Besides its ability to deal with complex cutting geometry, in free-form surface machining, the method has the capability of not only detecting the presence but also estimating the magnitudes of faults, which include flute chipping, breakage and spindle/cutter axes runout. A threshold-based fault detection method is developed based oil the analysis of harmonic power distribution in the cutting force signal. A genetic algorithm approach is used to search and determine the fault pattern and magnitudes. The new approach is validated through both constant crosssection cut and free-form surface machining tests on 1018 steel.

J	Peng, Z; Kessissoglou, N				Peng, Z; Kessissoglou, N			An integrated approach to fault diagnosis of machinery using wear debris and vibration analysis	WEAR			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Wear of Materials	MAR 30-APR 03, 2003	WASHINGTON, D.C.			wear debris analysis; vibration analysis; machine condition monitoring; gearboxes	OIL	Vibration and wear debris analyses are the two main condition monitoring techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis. In practice, these two techniques are usually conducted independently, and can only diagnose about 30-40% of faults when used separately. However, recent evidence shows that combining these two techniques provides greater and more reliable information, thereby resulting in a more effective maintenance program with large cost benefits to industry. In this paper. the correlation of vibration analysis and wear debris analysis was investigated. An experimental test rig consisting of a worm gearbox driven by an electric motor was set up to examine the correlation of the two techniques under various wear conditions. Three tests were conducted under the following conditions: (a) lack of proper lubrication, (b) normal operation, and (c) with the presence of contaminant particles added to the lubricating oil. Oil samples and vibration data were collected regularly. Wear debris analysis included the study of particle number and size distribution, the examination of particle morphology and types to determine possible wear mechanisms, and the analysis of chemical compositions to assess wear sources. Fault detection in the vibration signature was compared with the particle analysis. The results front this paper have given more understanding on the dependent and independent roles of vibration and wear debris analyses in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Since machine or process breakdowns severely limit their effectiveness, methods are needed to predict products' life expectancy. Furthermore, continuous assessment and prediction of product's performance could also enable a collaborative product life-cycle management in which products are followed, assessed and improved throughout their life-cycle. Finally, information about the remaining life of products and their components is crucial for their disassembly and reuse, which in turn leads to a more efficient and environmentally friendly usage of products and resources. Development of the Watchdog Agent(TM) answers the aforementioned needs through enabling multi-sensor assessment and prediction of performance of products and machines. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Qiu, H; Lee, J; Lin, J; Yu, G				Qiu, H; Lee, J; Lin, J; Yu, G			Robust performance degradation assessment methods for enhanced rolling element bearing prognostics	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						prognostics; predictive maintenance; bearing prognostics	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET SHRINKAGE; SIGNALS	Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the inherent deficiency of the measuring mechanism often introduces a great amount of noise to the signal. In addition, the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and hence can easily become masked by noise and low frequency effects. As a result, robust methods are needed to provide more evident information for bearing performance assessment and prognostics. This paper introduces enhanced and robust prognostic methods for rolling element bearing including a wavelet filter based method for weak signature enhancement for fault identification and Self Organizing Map (SOM) based method for performance degradation assessment. The experimental results demonstrate that the bearing defects can be detected at an early stage of development when both optimal wavelet filter and SOM method are used. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper mainly summarizes some applications of information entropy in our machinery diagnostic research practice. First, we use it as a quantitative measure of equipment diagnostibility, maintainability. Second, we introduce a criterion of complexity in frequency domain to evaluate the complexity of diagnostic signal in rotating machinery. Then a new criterion called the index of orbit complexity is proposed to evaluate the dynamic quality of rotor systems during their operation. Finally the entropy distance is applied as an effective diagnostic feature to discriminate the potential faults inside the operating machinery. Practical case studies and experiments show its effectiveness. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ozbayrak, M; Bell, R				Ozbayrak, M; Bell, R			A knowledge-based decision support system for the management of parts and tools in FMS	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						FMS; DSS; tool management; part scheduling; systems diagnosis; knowledge-based systems	FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; MACHINING CELLS; ORIENTED STRATEGIES; JOB ALLOCATION; CONSTRAINTS; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN	Flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) are very complex systems with large part, tool, and information flows. The aim of this work is to develop a knowledge-based decision support system (KBDSS) for short-term scheduling in FMS strongly influenced by the tool management concept to provide a significant operational control tool for a wide range of machining cells, where a high level of flexibility is demanded, with benefits of more efficient cell utilization, greater tool flow control, and a dependable way of rapidly adjusting short-term production requirements. Development of a knowledge-based system to support the decision making process is justified by the inability of decision makers to diagnose efficiently many of the malfunctions that arise at machine, cell, and entire system levels during manufacturing. In this context, this paper proposes three knowledge-based models to ease the decision making process: an expert production scheduling system, a knowledge-based tool management decision support systems, and a tool management fault diagnosis system. The entire system has been created in a hierarchical manner and comprises more than 400 rules. The expert system (ES) was implemented in a commercial expert system shell, Knowledge Engineering System (KES) Production System (PS). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Hence, this approach can distinguish between the "fault signatures" of each of the following faults: eccentricities, broken bars, and broken end-ring connectors in such induction motors. Furthermore, the techniques presented here can extensively and economically predict and characterize faults from the induction machine adjustable-speed drive design data without the need to have had actual fault data from field experience. This is done through the development of dual-track studies of fault simulations and, hence, simulated fault signature data. These studies are performed using our proven Time-Stepping Coupled Finite-Element-State-Space method to generate fault case performance data, which contain phase current waveforms and time-domain torque profiles. Then, from this data, the fault cases are classified by their inherent characteristics, so-called "signatures" or "fingerprints." These fault signatures are extracted or "mined" here from the fault case data using our novel Time-Series Data Mining technique. The dual track of generating fault data and mining fault signatures was tested here on dynamic and static eccentricities of 10% and 30% of air-gap height as well as cases of one, three, six, and nine broken bars and three, six, and nine broken end-ring connectors. These cases were studied for proof of. principle in a 208-V 60-Hz four-pole 1.2-hp squirrel-cage three-phase induction motor. The paper presents faulty and healthy performance characteristics and their corresponding so-called phase space diagnoses that show distinct fault signatures of each of the above-mentioned motor faults.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Diagnostics for Electrical Machines, Power Electronics and Drives	SEP 01-03, 1999	ASTURIAS, SPAIN	IEEE		adjustable-speed drives; electrical machines		A simulation model of an induction-machine that enables the analysis of the influence of stator fault conditions on the machine control of inverter-fed drives is presented. Based on this model, the influence of the breakdown of the stator windings insulation on the behavior of the machine and especially on. the current control scheme is shown. A new online method to detect such asymmetries caused, for example, by an interturn insulation failure in the stator windings is proposed and investigated. This new method utilizes the influence of stator asymmetries on the inverter current control scheme. By evaluating the statistical distribution of the different inverter switching states and switching times, asymmetries in the stator can be detected and isolated. The measurements required to implement this methodare already available in modern inverter fed drives as they are used to realize the current control loop. Thus, no additional sensors are necessary. The practical realization of the fault detection algorithm is demonstrated in combination with a predictive single step current controller. Measurements performed on a drive test stand verify the applicability of the proposed online method to detect and isolate stator faults.
