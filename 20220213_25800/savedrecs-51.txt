Internal damping inherent in the rotor construction or material, or both, affects its stability. These effects will be illustrated for both linear viscous and hysterectic damping. In addition, some comments will be made about the self-excited, subsynchronous vibraton due to nonlinearities in fluid-film support bearings. The premise of the paper is that a better understanding of these effects will lead to better fault diagnosis and to more comprehensive knowledge-based maintenance for rotating machines.

The philosophy of the method requires the construction of a template for normal condition which measured patterns can be compared against: any significant departure from the template signals anomalous or fault condition. This method only provides a level 1 diagnostic in Rytter's sense and cannot show the location or severity of the fault. It has been shown recently. that by passing to networks of novelty detectors, a locating facility can be established This has been demonstrated on a synthetic truss structure and a plate. Both simulations assumed a dense sensor network which covered the structure. The object of the current paper is to establish a more practical tool by passing to a sparse sensor network. This accomplished by optimising the performance of the diagnostic on subsets of the sensor net using a Genetic Algorithm.

There is a large number of such fault classes, and their precise signatures depend on numerous parameters including variations in the motor power supply and driven load. Practical fault detection and diagnosis systems must exhibit high level of detection accuracy and acceptably low false alarm rates. They must have broad applicability, require installation of minimal extra sensors, and not require the use of detailed machine information for operation. In this paper the development and experimental demonstration of a model-based detection system for incipient electric machine faults is presented. The developed fault detection system uses recent developments in dynamic recurrent neural networks and multi-resolution signal processing. The sensors utilized are only those measuring the motor current and voltage. The effectiveness of the developed system is demonstrated by detecting stator, rotor and bearing faults at the early stages of development. Furthermore, the ability of the system to discriminate between false alarm caused by poor power quality, variations in the driven load level, and actual incipient faults is demonstrated.

This paper will discuss a virtual diagnostic tool for fault detection of rotary machinery. The diagnostic tool has been developed using FMCELL software, which provides a 3-D graphical visualization environment to modeling rotary machinery with virtual data acquisition capabilities. The developed diagnostic tool provides a virtual testbed with suitable graphical user interfaces for rapid diagnostic fault analysis of machinery. In this paper, we will discuss details of this newly developed virtual diagnostic model using FMCELL software and present our approach for diagnostics of a mechanical bearing test bed (TSU-BTB). Furthermore, we will provide some examples of how the virtual diagnostic environment can be used for performing machinery fault diagnostics. Using a frequency pattern matching superimposing technique, the model is proven to be able to detect primary faults in machines with fair accuracy and reliability.

Such techniques consider small windows of data from large data sets to give preliminary information of developing fault(s) or failure precursor(s). However, these techniques only provide information of a minute portion of a large data set, which limits the accuracy of predicting the remaining useful life of the system. Diagnosis and prognosis (DAP) techniques should be able to identify the origin of the fault(s), estimate the rate of its progression and determine the remaining useful life of the system. This research demonstrates the use of data mining and numerical visualization techniques for diagnosis and prognosis of bearing vibration data. By using these techniques a comprehensive understanding of large vibration data sets can be attained. This approach uses intelligent agents to isolate particular bearing vibration characteristics using statistical analysis and signal processing for data compression. The results of the compressed data can be visualized in 3-D plots and used to track the origination and evolution of failure in the bearing vibration data. The Bearing Test Bed (TSUBTB) is used for applying measurable static and dynamic stresses on the bearing and collecting vibration signatures from the stressed bearings.

While most of the problems related to the feedback control of AC motors have been succesfully solved, another crucial point emerged with the diffusion of induction motors: the condition monitoring and the detection of their most common faults. In this work, a novel approach to fault diagnosis of AC motors is introduced. Specifically, the architecture of a nonlinear tracking controller made of an observer and a feedback-linearizing module is exploited in order to generate residual signals to be used for fault diagnosis purposes. In the paper, both simulation and experimental results on a real AC motor are provided showing tile effectiveness of the proposed approach.

With precision machining becoming possible, very close tolerances can now be achieved to reduce internal leakage due to the low viscosity of water. Many industries are slowly but steadily turning to water hydraulic systems to replace their oil hydraulic systems. The use of water hydraulic systems will increase in future as new applications are found for this technology. As with all systems, the increasing use of water hydraulic systems by more industries will result in the need to monitor and maintain the systems. This paper is concerned with the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of loaded modem water hydraulic cylinder and axial piston motor. LabVIEW software was used for data acquisition and processing. It provides a graphical programming environment that integrates data acquisition, analysis and presentation in one system for effective analysis. Likely real-life faults were simulated on the actuator's internal components. Some results such as the vibration signatures and amplitude spectra of the water hydraulic actuators under different operating conditions of simulated loads and speeds are presented and discussed. The results show that there is a distinctive variation in vibration signals, flow rate and average stroking duration with increase in loads for both actuators. The actuators were also operated to capture their unique vibration signals in their faulty states and the results compared with reference signatures of the same actuators when they were in their new or healthy states. The results imply that LabVIEW software can be written to set warning levels and trigger an alarm when a fault is impending.

The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are inadequate, especially for manufacturing processes of highly, complicated and automated systems. Instead, multisensor-based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multisensor-based process monitoring system for an existing machining centre. The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the machining centre and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the machining centre. The general structure of the monitoring system and the implementation of the main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a more recent development, and little use has been made of them in the condition monitoring (CM) arena. The availability of a limited amount of training data creates some problems for the use of SVMs, and a strategy is offered that improves the generalization performance significantly in cases where only limited training data are available.

J	Sahinkaya, MN; Cole, MOT; Burrows, CR				Sahinkaya, MN; Cole, MOT; Burrows, CR			Fault detection and tolerance in synchronous vibration control of rotor-magnetic bearing systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						fault detection; fault tolerance; magnetic bearings; vibration control; flexible rotors		The use of magnetic bearings in rotating machinery provides contact-free rotor support, and allows vibration control using both closed-loop and open-loop strategies. One of the simplest and most effective methods to reduce synchronous lateral vibration when using magnetic bearings is through an open-loop adaptive control technique., in which the amplitude and phase of synchronous magnetic control forces are adjusted automatically to minimize the measured vibrations along the rotor. However, transducer malfunction, or faults in the signal-processing channels, may cause the controller to adapt incorrectly, with unwanted and possibly catastrophic effects. It is shown that an extension to the control strategy, which utilizes the variances of the measured system response and identified parameters, enables the faults to be detected and accounted for so that a modified control action can achieve continued and effective control of the synchronous vibration. The approach is extended further to identify changes in external factors, such as unbalance and rotor dynamics. Various faults and perturbations are examined experimentally, and the ability of the controller to detect and compensate for these changes is demonstrated.

The characteristic features of time domain signals of the system with normal and faulty conditions have been used as inputs to ANNs, consisting of input, hidden and output layers. The input layer consisted of nodes for features extracted from the time domain response of the coolant system with simulated faults and severity levels. The inputs were normalized within the range 0.0 and 1.0. The output layer consisted of nodes indicating the status of the system: normal or defective, with classification of faults and severity levels. Two hidden layers with different numbers of neurons were used. Two schemes were used to develop ANNs for the separate and simultaneous detection of fault type and severity level. The ANNs were trained using a back-propagation algorithm with the normalized set of extracted features for known conditions. The ANNs were tested using the data of simulated test faults of both trained and novel types. The diagnostic system detected the fault type and severity level quite accurately in both schemes. The reduced number of inputs lead to faster training, requiring far fewer iterations compared with the case of using the entire time response curve.

Most serious faults will result in an increase of vibration level before actual breakdown, and thus allow shutdown before catastrophic failure. One such machinery is a gearbox, which finds its application in many areas. Spectrum analysis helps in converting the time-domain signal from the gearbox into the frequency-domain, thus enabling identification of the troubling frequency. But this tends to become difficult as the signal becomes complicated due to the multiple gear pairs in a gearbox. Therefore, in order to get a clearer picture of the condition of the gearbox, another mathematical tool called Cepstrum is needed which separates the side bands and makes the diagnosis easy.

However, the application of these methods gives only limited information about the location of detected faults. In this paper, we propose a complementary step, which localizes the faults, once detected. It consists of a generalized diagnostic algorithm for the case where more than one fault may be present in the transitions of a system represented by communicating nondetermistic finite state machines. If existing faults are. detected, this algorithm permits the generation of a minimal set of diagnoses, each of which is formed by a set of transitions suspected of being faulty. A simple example is used to demonstrate the functioning of the proposed diagnostic algorithm. The complexity of each step in the algorithm are calculated.

The system diagnoses problems with the health of the spacecraft, and directs actions to resolve those problems. It therefore warrants a high degree of assurance as to its correctness. In this paper, we describe the use of model checking to help validate key requirements of such a FP system. The particular system we deal with is that of a genetic FP engine "networked" to the rest of the spacecraft. Its design is specified with a high degree of rigor, using state machine diagrams to define both the FP engine, and the spacecraft-specific responses that the engine directs. We describe the way we have modeled the FP engine and its operating environment so as to validate key requirements of its operation, and the influence of the above design characteristics on this effort.

We use the advantageous general parameter (GP) approach for initializing the weights of the RBFN model in the beginning of the off-line system identification phase, as well as for fine-tuning the modeling accuracy of RBFN. The GP-RBFN scheme are adaptive but still computationally efficient due to the single adaptive parameter and its simple learning rule. Fault measure is the moving average of a general parameter. In order to verify the performance of the proposed schemes, they are applied to fault detection of automobile transmission gears. As the acoustic time series is slightly nonlinear, the RBFN gives high-speed fault detection, but detection accuracy is not so high. To overcome this problem a TDNN is developed that achieves more accurate fault detection although it needs more computational time. Fault is detected through regression lines. Both methods are empirically compared in speed and accuracy for fault detection of automobile transmission gears.

In the last decade novel approaches to this field have sought inspiration from nature in the form of evolutionary and developmental forms of fault tolerance, In nature an additional inspiration axis exists in the form of learning. The body's own immune system uses a form of learning to maintain reliable operation in the body even in the presence of invaders. This has only recently been applied as a computational technique in the form of artificial immune systems (AIS). This paper demonstrates a new application of AIS with an immunologically inspired approach to fault tolerance. It is shown a finite state machine can be provided with a hardware immune system to provide a novel form of fault detection giving the ability to detect every faulty state during a normal operating cycle. We call this immunotronics.	Univ York, Dept Elect, York, N Yorkshire, England		Bradley, DW (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Elect, York, N Yorkshire, England.

J	Brosowski, W; Schnatz, R; Kimmeyer, L				Brosowski, W; Schnatz, R; Kimmeyer, L			Examination of the wear behaviour of abrasive bulk materials and possibilities to prognosticate wear in grinding plants	ZKG INTERNATIONAL			English	Article								Abrasive wear mainly occurs during comminution, material handling, classification and material separation in the cement industry. The individual machines and plant components are stressed by abrasive wear but also, above all, by jet wear. Not only the knowledge of some theoretical fundamentals but also an accurate prognosis of the wear effect of the raw materials as well as the intermediate and final products on the different antiwear materials are required to achieve acceptable service lives. Krupp Polysius AG carries out individual wearing tests for the different fields of application. The company has a research centre equipped with a test roller mill to prognosticate the wear of the grinding elements, testing high-pressure grinding rolls to prognosticate the wear of rolls, a rotor tester to prognosticate the wear of impact crushers, a test rig to determine the abrasive wear of grate cooler plates and, for a few years, also an experimental rig to prognosticate the jet wear. In the latter it is possible to examine material samples under different jet angles, with different jet velocities and variable loads of the carrier gas flow. The jet wear test rig is used to determine fundamentals, to classify antiwear materials and to determine the wear effect of bulk materials. In particular, the wear effect of cement raw materials to be ground on roller mills in the industry is investigated. The investigations have shown that there is no connection between the rate of abrasive wear, determined during test grinding of the test roller mill, and the rate of jet wear. Though materials of the same origin had been used for both methods of examination, it is not possible to draw conclusions neither concerning the amount nor concerning the direction of the deviation. The reason for the differing results can be explained by the different tribological systems.

J	Sawyer, JP; Rao, SS				Sawyer, JP; Rao, SS			Structural damage detection and identification using fuzzy logic	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; BEAMS	Although improved design methodologies have significantly enhanced the reliability and safety of structures in recent years, it is still not possible to build structures that are infallible. There is an increasing interest in the development of smart structures with built-in fault detection systems that would provide damage and/or failure warnings. A general methodology is presented for structural fault detection using fuzzy logic. The methodology is based on monitoring the static, eigenvalue, and dynamic responses to determine the health status of a structure or machine. Fuzzy logic coupled with principles of continuum damage mechanics is used to identify the location and extent of the damage. The proposed methodology represents a unique approach to damage detection that can be applied to a variety of structures used in civil engineering and machine and aerospace applications.

The data were analyzed with respect to the cataract, type of diabetes, retinopathy and blood-aqueous humor barrier damage. Intraocular production of IgG was detected in diabetic patients, since the IgG index values were increased in some diabetic groups (especially those with type I diabetes and retinopathy). Comparison of numerical methods and clonal IgG detection suggested that intraocular IgG patterns in diabetes are predominately polyclonal. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was pathological in serum and aqueous humor of patients with type I diabetes and to a lesser extent in the type II diabetes group. Machine learning system based on C5.0 classifier extracted 98.5% accurate rules for discrimination of the senile cataract group, diabetes group and diabetic retinopathy group. Our results confirm that the combination of immunochemical and numerical methods with a proper statistical analysis may contribute to the diagnosis of the pathologic ocular immune response and the related retinal or vascular disorders in diabetes. Significant savings in laboratory material and efforts may be obtained by means of the machine learning based optimization of the tests.

J	Desforges, MJ; Jacob, PJ; Ball, AD				Desforges, MJ; Jacob, PJ; Ball, AD			Fault detection in rotating machinery using kernel-based probability density estimation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article								In this paper, a method is presented which allows abnormal or unexpected operating conditions to be identified from measured response data. Potential applications of such a technique cover a wide range of engineering situations where a definite, early warning of an abnormal state is essential, but where classification of the particular abnormality is of lesser importance. In the technique described, unexpected operating conditions are identified by the presence of measured data which are significantly different from those known to correspond to normal operating conditions or responses. The proposed approach to the detection of such novel data is based upon probability density function (PDF) estimation using a kernel method. The theory behind this approach is presented for the multivariate case, and the need for data pre-processing in practical applications of PDF estimation is highlighted. The kernel method is demonstrated on simulated data sets. Finally, vibration response data from an electric motor with three levels of phase imbalance are used to illustrate the application of the PDF estimation method to the detection of abnormal conditions. The proposed method yields a clear indication of the existence of a fault in the AC motor, with no prior knowledge of the particular fault state.

This paper considers the use of another time-frequency distribution called the instantaneous power spectrum (IPS) in the detection of local faults in helical gears. The paper begins with a fundamental description of the IPS and then examines the capability of the technique in extracting condition indicating information from gear vibration signals and also in assessing the fault severity. The paper then further examines the ability of the IPS to detect faults under varying load conditions. It is shown that the IPS can be used to detect local faults not only under the same dynamic conditions (constant speed and load), but it can also indicate the progression of faults under varying load conditions.

J	Benbouzid, ME				Benbouzid, ME			A review of induction motors signature analysis as a medium for faults detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fault detection; induction motor; motor current signature analysis	INSTANTANEOUS POWER; CAGE ROTOR; MACHINES; STATOR; RELIABILITY; DIAGNOSIS; DRIVES; SYSTEM; BARS	This paper is intended as a tutorial overview of induction motors signature analysis as a medium for fault detection. The purpose is to introduce in a concise manner the fundamental theory, main results, and practical applications of motor signature analysis for the detection and the localization of abnormal electrical and mechanical conditions that indicate, or may lead to, a failure of induction motors. The paper is focused on the so-called motor current signature analysis which utilizes the results of spectral analysis of the stator current, The paper is purposefully written without "state-of-the-art" terminology for the benefit of practicing engineers in facilities today who may not be familiar with signal processing.

J	Filippetti, F; Franceschini, G; Tassoni, C; Vas, P				Filippetti, F; Franceschini, G; Tassoni, C; Vas, P			Recent developments of induction motor drives fault diagnosis using AI techniques	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE IECON 98 Meeting	AUG 31-SEP 04, 1998	AACHEN, GERMANY	IEEE		artificial intelligence; drives diagnostics; electrical machines	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; STATOR CURRENT; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SYSTEM; ONLINE; MACHINES; DESIGN	This paper presents a review of the most recent developments in the field of diagnosis of electrical machines and drives based on artificial intelligence (AI), It covers the application of expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques. The application of genetic algorithms is considered as well. In general, a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behavior of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase, the knowledge of well-tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault conditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterizing the faults. The fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input data set for specific AI (NNs, fuzzy logic, or neuro-fuzzy) systems, The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic held, are applied to an induction machine, utilizing as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components, A brief description of the various AI techniques is also given; this highlights the advantages and the limitations of using AI techniques. Some applications examples are also discussed and areas for future research are also indicated.

The detection mechanism is based on the hypothesis that the induction machine can be considered as a simple system, and that the action of the fault conditions are to alter the output of the system in a characteristic and predictable fashion. Further, the change in output and fault condition can be correlated allowing explicit fault identification. Using this technique, there is no requirement for a priori data describing machine fault conditions, the method is equally applicable to both sinusoidally and inverter-fed induction machines and is generally invariant of both the induction machine load and speed. The detection mechanisms are rigorously examined theoretically and experimentally, and it is shown that a robust and reliable induction machine condition-monitoring system has been produced. Further, this technique is developed into a software-based automated commercially applicable system.

The proposed fault detection technique senses the actual machine state with the help of real-time space-phasor models, The Vienna Monitoring Method compares online a voltage model output with a current model and observes the deviations in a rotor fixed reference frame. High accuracy and robustness allow the detection of a faulty rotor bar out of the switched voltage and current signals of an inverter-fed machine in an early state, The focus of this paper is the detection of a single rotor bar increase under transient speed conditions without the necessity of a clutched load, During an inverter-controlled accelerating, lasting only 200 ms, the Vienna Monitoring Method evaluates currents, voltages, and rotor position for the calculation of an indication quantity that allows for reliable detection. As only one acceleration task does not excite every rotor cage bar sufficiently, a set of acceleration and deceleration cycles has to be driven.

The focus of this paper is on the application of the techniques, not on the underlying theories. Each technique is described briefly and is accompanied by an experimental discussion on how it can be applied to classify the synthetic mechanical and electrical faults of induction machines compared with their normality. Promising results were obtained which show that the presented methodologies are possible approaches to perform effective preventive maintenance in rotating machinery.

It is shown that, as a result of the nature of the cage rotor, no new frequency components of the line current spectra can appear as a consequence of the fault, Only a rise in some of the frequency components which already exist in the line current spectra of a healthy machine can be observed, An experimental setup comprising a 3-kW delta-connected motor loaded by a generator was used to validate this approach. The experimental results obtained clearly validate the analytical and simulation results.

J	Hui, SC; Jha, G				Hui, SC; Jha, G			Data mining for customer service support	INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery in databases; customer service support; decision support; machine fault diagnosis	SYSTEM	In traditional customer service support of a manufacturing environment, a customer service database usually stores two types of service information: (1) unstructured customer service reports record machine problems and its remedial actions and (2) structured data on sales, employees, and customers for day-to-day management operations. This paper investigates how to apply data mining techniques to extract knowledge from the database to support two kinds of customer service activities: decision support and machine fault diagnosis. A data mining process, based on the data mining tool DBMiner, was investigated to provide structured management data for decision support. In addition, a data mining technique that integrates neural network, case-based reasoning, and rule-based reasoning is proposed; it would search the unstructured customer service records for machine fault diagnosis. The proposed technique has been implemented to support intelligent fault diagnosis over the World Wide Web. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Johnson, B; Maxwell, H				Johnson, B; Maxwell, H			Predictive maintenance - The effect on a company's bottom line	LUBRICATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								The true benefit of a Predictive, Maintenance program can be determined with a cost/benefit analysis. Unfortunately our industry has not standardized a method for counting a program's benefit and this has introduced wild scatter in the claims made regarding a program's effectiveness. An example of this could be the declared value of a bearing replacement recommendation that might range from the price of a new bearing to extensive production losses and the cost of replacing not just the bearing but a new machine. The true benefit of the recommendation is more likely some point between the extremes. A systematic logical approach for determining the benefit of a repair recommendation will be presented by this paper: The approach assumes that a single monetary predictive maintenance benefit can be assigned to any machine by taking the 'average' of a large set of probable failures that could occur. This approach can be globally applied to further simplify a cost benefit analysis if like machinery is grouped and then a single monetary value is used for the grouping. With this approach, only a small number of standard case studies are needed to represent a program. If a machine is in a failure mode, then the machine will fail with or without the help of predictive maintenance. The use of Predictive Maintenance technologies can not prevent a failure that is occurring. They can how ever reduce the severity or cost of the failure and repair The true cost savings (or cost avoidance) of a repair recommendation is the difference between the cost of repair assuming that a predictive program was not in place, and the cost of repair with the help of PdM. A model of failure probability along with a case study example of the model and a form that could be used to establish a generic or global economic machine failure case study will be presented Reducing the cost of a failure is important brit it may not be the most significant monetary benefit of a predictive program. Arguably, a Predicative Maintenance program's greatest benefit is in extending the mean time between failures for a given machine. A strategy will be discussed that estimates the money saved from this important aspect of a predictive program.										0	0	0	0	4	SOC TRIBOLOGISTS & LUBRICATION ENGINEERS	PARK RIDGE	840 BUSSE HIGHWAY, PARK RIDGE, IL 60068 USA	0024-7154			LUBR ENG	Lubric.

J	Bevilacqua, M; Braglia, M				Bevilacqua, M; Braglia, M			The analytic hierarchy process applied to maintenance strategy selection	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						maintenance; process plant; failure mode effect and criticality analysis technique; analytic hierarchy process		This paper describes an application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for selecting the best maintenance strategy for an important Italian oil refinery (an Integrated Gasification and Combined Cycle plant). Five possible alternatives are considered: preventive, predictive, condition-based. corrective and opportunistic maintenance. The best maintenance policy must be selected for each facility of the plant (about 200 in total). The machines are clustered in three homogeneous groups after a criticality analysis based on internal procedures of the oil refinery. With AHP technique, several aspects, which characterise each of the above-mentioned maintenance strategies, are arranged in a hierarchic structure and evaluated using only a series of pairwise judgements. To improve the effectiveness of the methodology AHP is coupled with a sensitivity analysis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lefebvre, D				Lefebvre, D			Firing sequences and firing frequencies estimation for timed Petri nets	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							FAULT	Petri nets are useful tools for the modelling and analysis of manufacturing systems. This work deals with the firing sequences estimation for transitions-timed Petri nets by measurement of the places marking. Firing durations are unknown, but not supposed to be null. In fact, the Petri net marking is measured, on-line, with a sampling period Delta t small enough such that each transition is fired, at the most, one time during Delta t. The estimation problem has exact and approximated solutions that are described. Sufficient conditions are given on the accuracy of the marking measurement, such that the estimation of the firing sequences is an exact one. If the estimation provides several solutions, the Petri net is completed in order to give one unique solution. Lastly, the firing sequences estimation is used to evaluate the transition firing occurrences and the firing frequencies. As a consequence of this, the proposed method provides the machine's occupation rate for manufacturing and assembly workshops modelled by timed Petri nets. Thus, systems performances are evaluated and can be improved with the help of these results. The firing sequences estimation is also interesting for fault diagnosis and timed Petri nets identification.

J	Constantinescu, C				Constantinescu, C			Teraflops supercomputer: Architecture and validation of the fault tolerance mechanisms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						supercomputing; fault-tolerant computing; validation; fault injection; fault/error detection coverage	DEPENDABILITY; INJECTION	Intel Corporation developed the Teraflops supercomputer for the US Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI). This is the most powerful computing machine available today. performing over two trillion floating point operations per second with the aid of more than 9,000 Intel processors. The Teraflops machine employs complex hardware and software fault/error handling mechanisms for complying with DOE's reliability requirements. This paper gives a brief description of the system architecture and presents the validation of the fault tolerance mechanisms. Physical fault injection at the IC pin level was used for validation purposes. An original approach was developed for assessing signal sensitivity to transient faults and the effectiveness of the fault/error handling mechanisms. Dependency between fault/error detection coverage and fault duration was also determined. Fault injection experiments unveiled several malfunctions at the hardware, firmware, and software levels. The supercomputer performed according to the DOE requirements after corrective actions were implemented. The fault injection approach presented in this paper can be used for validation Of any fault-tolerant or highly available computing system.

The diagnostic indexes usually used for open-loop operation are no longer effective. Simulation and experimental results show that the spectrum of the field current component i(d) in a field-oriented controlled machine has suitable features that can lead to an effective diagnostic procedure. Specifically,,in the case of stator and rotor faults the id spectrum components at frequencies 2f and 2sf, respectively, are quite independent of control parameters and dependent on the fault extent.

J	Hu, W; Starr, AG; Zhou, Z; Leung, AYT				Hu, W; Starr, AG; Zhou, Z; Leung, AYT			A systematic approach to integrated fault diagnosis of flexible manufacturing systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE			English	Article						condition monitoring; fault diagnosis; information integration; FMS	MODEL	A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is an application of modern manufacturing techniques. Like for other manufacturing equipment, the success of an FMS is very much dependent upon its trouble-free operation. It is crucial to monitor all the possible faults or abnormalities in real time and, when a fault is detected, react quickly in order to maintain the productivity of the FMS. Because of the complexity of FMSs, the functionally complete diagnosis of an FMS should be based on all the available information and various advanced diagnostic techniques so as to get a satisfactory result. This paper proposes a systematic approach to fault diagnosis of FMSs that integrates condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and maintenance planning. An intelligent integrated fault-diagnosis system is designed with a modular and reconfigurable structure. The implementation of the integrated diagnosis system is presented in detail. The system can monitor the major conditions and diagnose the major faults of an FMS, and give corresponding maintenance planning as well. The developed system has been applied to an existing FFS-1500-2 FMS in Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Plant and has achieved good results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, Y; Kurfess, TR; Liang, SY				Li, Y; Kurfess, TR; Liang, SY			Stochastic prognostics for rolling element bearings	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							FATIGUE CRACK-GROWTH; PROPAGATION	The capability to accurately predict the remaining life of a rolling element bearing is prerequisite to the optimal maintenance of rotating machinery performance in terms of cost and productivity. Due to the probabilistic nature of bearing integrity and operation condition, reliable estimation of a bearing's remaining life presents a challenging aspect in the area of maintenance optimisation and catastrophic failure avoidance. Previous study has developed an adaptive prognostic methodology to estimate the rate of bearing defect growth based on a deterministic defect-propagation model. However, deterministic models are inadequate in addressing the stochastic nature of defect-propagation. In this paper, a stochastic defect-propagation model is established by instituting a lognormal random variable in a deterministic defect-propagation rate model. The resulting stochastic model is calibrated on-line by a recursive least-squares (RLS) approach without the requirement of a priori knowledge on bearing characteristics. An augmented stochastic differential equation vector is developed with the consideration of model uncertainties, parameter estimation errors, and diagnostic model inaccuracies. It involves two ordinary differential equations for the first and second moments of its random variables. Solving the two equations gives the mean path of defect propagation and its dispersion at any instance. This approach is suitable for on-line monitoring, remaining life prediction, and decision making for optimal maintenance scheduling. The methodology has been verified by numerical simulations and the experimental testing of bearing fatigue life. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Swanson, DC; Spencer, JM; Arzoumanian, SH				Swanson, DC; Spencer, JM; Arzoumanian, SH			Prognostic modelling of crack growth in a tensioned steel band	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							BEAM	The general problem of identifying the condition of a structure or machine, and in particular its vibration signature, as a means to optimise maintenance costs and reliability is currently of great interest. This work presents a method for predicting the state of damage in the future for prognostic maintenance, rather than just identifying the current state of damage for diagnostic maintenance. Prognostics carries great economic importance because it allows the assessment of the likelihood of failure as a function of future time in terms of past and current conditions. We present an experimental example using the modal response of a notched, tensioned, steel band undergoing broadband vibration excitation to propagate cracks across the notched area until failure. The natural modes of the band are monitored during fatigue and the modal frequency shifts are used as a prognostic observable. A Kalman filter is then used track these modal frequency shifts and predict the likelihood and time when the amount of frequency shift is indicative of imminent failure. As a practical approach for prognostics of the band failure, we examine whether the modal frequencies are converging towards a stable state (such as during the break-in period), or diverging away from a stable state. A new probability density function for the remaining useful life is derived from the kinematic model. This method of using the kinematic state of a damage observable for failure prognostics can be extended to any dynamical system with observable features which correlate with damage or fatigue state.

This method of dynamic cartography is based on fiberwise comparison of data on the state of Chernye Zemli (the Kalmyk Republic, Russia) in different years and the detailed analysis of the period on which the prognosis was based. For this purpose, materials of repeated aerial and satellite photography obtained during a long period (1954-1993) were used. Comparison of maps characterizing the dynamics of Chernye Zemli between 1958 and 1993 allows prognostic electronic maps for the next 10-15 years (with a five-year interval) to be drawn and land prognosis for the next 20-30 years (1998-2023) to be obtained.

Despite their potential advantages over standard statistical methods, like their ability to model non-linear relationships and construct symbolic and interpretable models, their applications to survival analysis are at best rare, primarily because of the difficulty to appropriately handle censored data. In this paper we propose a schema that enables the use of classification methods - including machine learning classifiers - for survival analysis. To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring, we propose a technique that, for the patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times, estimates their probability of event and assigns them a distribution of outcome accordingly. Since most machine learning techniques do not deal with outcome distributions, the schema is implemented using weighted examples. To show the utility of the proposed technique, we investigate a particular problem of building prognostic models for prostate cancer recurrence, where the sole prediction of the probability of event (and not its probability dependency on time) is of interest. A case study on preoperative and postoperative prostate cancer recurrence prediction shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside modern statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data.

J	Munoz, AR				Munoz, AR			Using an autoregressive model in the detection of abnormal characteristics of squirrel cage induction motors	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						three-phase induction motors; autoregressive model; abnormal characteristics	MACHINES	The problem of failures in large electrical machines is of great concern due to its decisive influence over industrial productivity. This paper describes an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) estimation algorithm that uses as input/output data the starting current of an induction motor under test, The large current flowing in the motor may provide evidence of faults at an earlier stage in its development. In fact, during the starting period it is observed that there is an imbalance of each phase impedance, a phenomena which is incremented when the saturation level is increased. The proposed autoregressive model allows the calculation of a quality factor to compare the harmonic level during the transient and steady state regimen. This parameter and other harmonic amplitudes, call be easily determined using the model and can be considered as true representatives of the machine condition.

J	Chen, Z; Mechefske, CK				Chen, Z; Mechefske, CK			Diagnosis of machine faults based on transient vibration signals	INSIGHT			English	Article								Short signals such as transient vibration signals have not been as widely studied as stationary signals for Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM), but may well contain significant amounts of useful information. This paper investigates a method for the analysis of transient vibration signals and the application of this method in machine condition monitoring. The Prony method is a modelling technique that fits a linear combination of a series of exponentially decaying sinusoidal functions to sampled data such that the model describes the underlying process of the sampled data. Because of its exponential basis function, this method is inherently suitable for analysing transient signals. The intention of this paper is to explore the application of the Prony method to the study of transient vibration signals and th potential of this method in machine condition monitoring. This paper reports the work done to investigate this procedure as the basis of a useful machine condition monitoring and diagnostic technique. Also presented are preliminary numerical results of Prony model-based frequency analysis of computer-generated simulated vibration signals as well as experimentally-derived vibration signals.

From the point of view of machine condition monitoring and diagnosis, the sources causing abnormal vibrations of rotating machinery are varied and complex. However, taking one with another, the vibration behaviours of rotating machinery are principally influenced by the following three factors, ie, structure, operation and failures of rotor itself. Aiming at exploring the effective ways in which to realise the exact diagnosis of faults of rotating machinery, a series of experimental investigation sand field surveys had been performed respectively on these three causes. Through these researches, not only were some applied fault diagnostic methods achieved, but also many valuable conclusions, not notices before, were reached.

J	Smart, MG; Friswell, MI; Lees, AW				Smart, MG; Friswell, MI; Lees, AW			Estimating turbogenerator foundation parameters: model selection and regularization	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						system identification; run-down; turbogenerators; foundations; parameter estimation; rotor dynamics	FREQUENCY-DOMAIN; IDENTIFICATION	Estimating a model of the foundation of large machines, such as turbogenerators, is vital for tasks such as fault diagnosis and modal balancing. Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to perform a modal test on the foundations without the rotor present. This paper considers a method to estimate a foundation model using response data from a run-down, using the inherent unbalance of the rotor to excite the foundations. The method requires an accurate model of the rotor and an approximate model of the bearings. Of critical importance is the quality of the model, which may be defined as the ability of the model to predict the response to unbalance excitations that are different from that present for the identification. It is shown in this paper that correct model selection and regularization are vital, to produce a foundation model that meets this predictability criterion. The method is validated using simulated data and also experimental data from a test rig with a 4 m long rotor with four fluid film bearings.

A load trouble, like a torque dip, affects the machine supply current and consequently it should be possible to use the current pattern to detect features of the torque pattern, using the machine itself as a torque sensor. But current signature depends on many phenomena and misunderstandings are possible. At first the effect of different load anomalies on current spectrum, in comparison with other machine troubles like rotor asymmetries, are investigated. Reference is made to low frequency torque disturbances, which cause a quasistationary machine behavior Simplified relationships, validated by simulation results and by experimental results, are developed to address the current spectrum features. In order to detect on-lines anomalies, a current signature extraction is performed by the time-frequency spectrum approach. This method allows the detection of random fault as well, Finally it is shown that a Neural Network approach can help the torque pattern recognition, improving the interpretation of machine anomalies effects.

The acoustic emission (AE) signals generated during machining were analyzed to determine the relationship between grinding-related faults and characteristics of changes in signals. Furthermore, a neural network, which has excellent ability in pattern classification, was applied to the diagnosis system. The neural network was optimized with a momentum coefficient, a learning rate, and a structure of the hidden layer in the iterative learning process. The success rates of fault detection were verified.

J	Parker, BE; Ware, HA; Wipf, DP; Tompkins, WR; Clark, BR; Larson, EC; Poor, HV				Parker, BE; Ware, HA; Wipf, DP; Tompkins, WR; Clark, BR; Larson, EC; Poor, HV			Fault diagnostics using statistical change detection in the bispectral domain	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								It is widely accepted that structural defects in rotating machinery components (e.g. bearings and gears) can be detected through monitoring of vibration and/or sound emissions. Traditional diagnostic vibration analysis attempts to match spectral lines with a priori-known defect frequencies that are characteristic of the affected machinery components. Emphasis herein is on use of bispectral-based statistical change detection algorithms for machinery health monitoring. The bispectrum, a third-order statistic, helps identify pairs of phase-related spectral components, which is useful for fault detection and isolation. Tn particular, the bispectrum helps sort through the clutter of usual (second-order) vibration spectra to extract useful information associated with the health of particular components. Seeded and non-seeded helicopter gearbox fault results (CH-46E and CH-47D, respectively) show that bispectral algorithms can detect faults at the level of an individual component (i.e. bearings or gears). Fault isolation is implicit with detection based on characteristic a priori-known defect frequencies. Important attributes of the bispectral SCD approach include: (1) it does not require a priori training data as is needed for traditional pattern-classifier-based approaches (and thereby avoids the significant time and cost investments necessary to obtain such data); (2) being based on higher-order moment based energy detection, it makes no assumptions about the statistical model of the bispectral sequences that are generated; (3) it is operating-regime independent (i.e. works across different operating conditions, flight regimes, torque levels, etc., without knowledge of same); (4) it can be used to isolate faults to the level of specific machinery components (e.g. bearings and gears); and (5) it can be implemented using relatively inexpensive computer hardware, since only low-frequency vibrations need to be processed. The bispectral SCD algorithm thus represents a general methodology for the automated analysis of rotating machinery. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

This system is designed to satisfy the required high motor speed command signal and the product to product tolerance is limited to 0.1%. An innovative variable pulse generation algorithm is proposed for the activation of the motor in order to meet the stringent specifications. Because of the high speed command, software implementation of this algorithm would not be viable as this is intended to be a low cost automation system. To further enhance the system performance, an overall system architecture to incorporate a hardware solution is proposed. This new architecture comprises hardware and software functionality such that the codesign methodology is employed for the partitioning of the design procedures. Within this architecture, software development includes a user-friendly, safety and fault detection facility to improve the human-machine interface. This new precision control system meets the required performance specifications with only two-pieces of 2K gates Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Actel chips are required for the implementation.

J	Lin, J; Qu, LS				Lin, J; Qu, LS			Feature extraction based on Morlet wavelet and its application for mechanical fault diagnosis	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TRANSFORMS; DISCRETE	The vibration signals of a machine always carry the dynamic information of the machine. These signals are very useful for the feature extraction and fault diagnosis. However, in many cases, because these signals have very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), to extract feature components becomes difficult and the applicability of information drops down. Wavelet analysis in an effective tool for signal processing and feature extraction. In this paper, a denoising method based on wavelet analysis is applied to feature extraction for mechanical vibration signals. This method is an advanced version of the famous "soft-thresholding denoising method" proposed by Donoho and Johnstone. Based on the Morlet wavelet, the time-frequency resolution can be adapted to different signals of interest. In this paper, this denoising method is introduced in detail.

J	Guttler, S; Kantz, H				Guttler, S; Kantz, H			Induction motor failure detection using geometric signal separation	ELECTRIC MACHINES AND POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article							STATOR CURRENT; FAULT-DETECTION; ROTOR; DIAGNOSTICS; MACHINES	We present a new method for on-fine induction motor failure detection using stator current monitoring. The concept of geometric signal separation in feature space is introduced. A set of observations from a single phase of the stator current is transformed into a feature vector. After establishing a local metric in the feature space, close neighbors of the present vector are searched for in a database representing allowed states of the motor, which were recorded during a training period. In their absence the present state is a novelty, which is considered as a failure if if, persists for a certain time. This monitoring scheme successfully deals with varying load conditions of the motor, where also oscillating load torques can be tackled. Additionally, observations from a healthy motor, which differ considerably from any known allowed state in the database due to changes of environmental conditions can be distinguished from true failures at a significant level. We do not use expert rules or detailed knowledge about the monitored motor.

J	Molina, JM; Isasi, P; Berlanga, A; Sanchis, A				Molina, JM; Isasi, P; Berlanga, A; Sanchis, A			Hydroelectric power plant management relying on neural networks and expert system integration	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						predictive maintenance; neural networks; ART; LVQ; power plants; expert systems		The use of Neural Networks (NN) is a novel approach that can help in taking decisions when integrated in a more general system, in particular with expert systems. In this paper, an architecture for the management of hydroelectric power plants is introduced. This relies on monitoring a large number of signals, representing the technical parameters of the real plant. The general architecture is composed of an Expert System and two NN modules: Acoustic Prediction (NNAP) and Predictive Maintenance (NNPM). The NNAP is based on Kohonen Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) Networks in order to distinguish the sounds emitted by electricity-generating machine groups. The NNPM uses an ART-MAP to identify different situations from the plant state variables, in order to prevent future malfunctions. In addition, a special process to generate a complete training set has been designed for the ART-MAP module. This process has been developed to deal with the absence of data about abnormal plant situations, and is based on neural nets trained with the backpropagation algorithm.

J	Jack, LB; Nandi, AK				Jack, LB; Nandi, AK			Genetic algorithms for feature selection in machine condition monitoring with vibration signals	IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; NEURAL NETWORKS	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used successfully to detect faults in rotating machinery, using statistical estimates of the vibration signal as input features. Ln any given scenario, there are many different possible features that may be used as inputs for the ANN. One of the main problems facing the use of ANNs is the selection of the best inputs to the ANN, allowing the creation of compact, highly accurate networks that require comparatively little preprocessing. The paper examines the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most significant input features from a large set of possible features in machine condition monitoring contexts. Using a GA, a subset of six input features is selected from a set of 66, giving a classification accuracy of 99.8%, compared with an accuracy of 87.2% using an ANN without feature selection and all 66 inputs. From a larger set of 156 different features, the GA is able to select a set of six features to give 100% recognition accuracy.

J	Kuo, CH; Huang, HP				Kuo, CH; Huang, HP			Failure modeling and process monitoring for flexible manufacturing systems using colored timed Petri nets	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION			English	Article						CTPN; fault diagnosis; FMEA; PMS; SPC		The performance of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) depends on the equipment efficiency and process control. In order to increase the equipment efficiency, the failure mode analysis and fault diagnosis can be used to reduce the frequency of unexpected breakdowns of machines. In addition, the statistical process control (SPC) can be used for adjusting the process parameters to eliminate process variations. In this paper, a colored timed Petri net (CTPN) is used to model the process behavior of an FMS. In addition, the CTPN-based SPC, fault diagnosis, and failure model and effect analysis are modeled and analyzed individually, Especially, all of the modular models are integrated and linked based on the CTPN, Due to the unified CTPN modeling, the information of each modular model in the entire system can be exchanged and integrated directly and efficiently, Finally, the entire CTPN FMS models are implemented using G2 real-time expert system. Consequently, the proposed CTPN-based simulator can be acted as a real-time PMS monitor and controller through the G2 standard interface.

Generally, it is difficult to diagnose machine's fault by the conventional technique. In this research, two new fault diagnosis systems are proposed which one diagnoses a fault based on behavior of the object system, and another diagnoses a fault based on power spectrum of the object system. In the former, when an object system is a normal state, the system identification is performed by the neural networks. The diagnosis system detects a fault by finding the behavior's gap between the state of the real system and the identified normal one, and also the fault part is specified by fault diagnosis neural network. In the latter, neural network learns power spectrum of both the normal and fault states for the object. When a fault occurs, fault part is diagnosed by fault diagnosis neural network based on power spectrum. Finally, through simulation and experiment, the effectiveness of proposed fault diagnosis systems is verified.

Biochemical studies in laryngeal cancer have shown a potential prognostic significance of cathepsin D content determination. We studied immunohistochemical positivity of cathepsin D in tumor epithelium and stroma of 61 surgical specimens of squamous cell laryngeal cancer. Immunohistochemical reaction was quantitatively assessed using a PC-based image analysis system SFORM-VAMS. The results were correlated to clinical and morphological parameters and survival. Immunohistochemical positivity was noted in neoplastic cells and tumor stroma. Significant prognostic value for cathepsin D was established separately for epithelial tumor component and tumor stroma using log-rank test, the Cox proportional hazards regression model, and C4.5 machine learning system. In all groups, patients above the median cathepsin D staining showed significantly shorter survival time. C4.5 machine learning system extracted cutoff values for the decision tree that defines the probabilities of patients survival and death with high sensitivity (92.8% alive, 73.6% dead), 100% specificity, and 86.9% accuracy.

It is shown that the well-known synchronised averaging method is the expression of cyclostationarity at the first order, and that the spectral correlation function issued from the second-order cyclostationarity is an efficient parameter for the early diagnosis of faults in rotating machines. Moreover, it is shown that vibration signals measured on gear systems display second-order cyclostationarity. Application in early diagnosis of spalling in gear teeth demonstrates the power of this new parameter. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Lucifredi, A; Mazzieri, C; Rossi, M				Lucifredi, A; Mazzieri, C; Rossi, M			Application of multiregressive linear models, dynamic kriging models and neural network models to predictive maintenance of hydroelectric power systems	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Since the operational conditions of a hydroelectric unit can vary within a wide range, the monitoring system must be able to distinguish between the variations of the monitored variable caused by variations of the operation conditions and those due to arising and progressing of failures and misoperations. The paper aims to identify the best technique to be adopted for the monitoring system. Three different methods have been implemented and compared. Two of them use statistical techniques: the first, the linear multiple regression, expresses the monitored variable as a linear function of the process parameters (independent variables, while the second, the dynamic kriging technique, is a modified technique of multiple linear regression representing the monitored variable as a linear combination of the process variables in such a way as to minimize the variance of the estimate error. The third is based on neural networks. Tests have shown that the monitoring system based on the kriging technique is not affected by some problems common to the other two models e.g. the requirement of a large amount of data for their tuning, both for training the neural network and defining the optimum plane for the multiple regression, not only in the system starting phase but also after a trivial operation of maintenance involving the substitution of machinery components having a direct impact on the observed variable. Or, in addition, the necessity of different models to describe in a satisfactory way the different ranges of operation of the plant. The monitoring system based on the kriging statistical technique overrides the previous difficulties: it does not require a large amount of data to be tuned and is immediately operational: given two points, the third can be immediately estimated; in addition the model follows the system without adapting itself to it. The results of the experimentation performed seem to indicate that a model based on a neural network or on a linear multiple regression is not optimal, and that a different approach is necessary to reduce the amount of work during the learning phase using, when available, all the information stored during the initial phase of the plant to build the reference baseline, elaborating, if it is the case, the raw information available. A mixed approach using the kriging statistical technique and neural network techniques could optimise the result. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of frequency-based transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS), transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) and intracranial internal carotid artery (TCA) stenosis, Forty patients presenting with 48 intracranial stenoses of the anterior circulation were involved in the study, The stenoses mere detected in the neurovascular laboratory during routine TCD examinations. All patients underwent an additional frequency-based TCCS examination. Both the axial and coronal planes were obtained to allow the exact localization of MCA stenosis and differentiation from intracranial ICA stenosis, Angle-corrected flow velocity measurements were performed if straight vessel compartments were 20 mm or more in length. A total of 18 stenoses (44%) mere investigated additionally with DSA, According to the investigation with TCD, 20 (42%) stenoses were low-grade, 12 (25%) were moderate, and the remaining 16 (33%) were severe. Angle-corrected how velocity measurements obtained with the integrated pulse-wave Doppler device of the TCCS machine were highly correlated (0.912, p < 0.001) with those obtained with TCD, TCCS achieved a reliable differentiation of MCA main stem stenosis vs, intracranial ICA stenosis in 7 patients and vs. MCA branch stenosis in 4 patients, but TCD failed in these two subgroups. The agreement between DSA and TCCS to evaluate semiquantitatively 18 intracranial stenoses resulted in a weighted-kappa value of 0.764. The major clinically relevant advantages of TCCS over TCD in RICA stenosis are its ability to differentiate MCA trunk stenosis from terminal ICA or MCA branch stenosis reliably and to perform angle-corrected flow velocity measurements.

The prioritized modification rule for connection weights is introduced and four different procedures are studied and compared from the viewpoint of their efficiency. It is shown that the fourth procedure is more convenient for human type decision-making. The output functions of different neurons are considered as the possibility of being fault sources for different units. The system starts from a vague initial state and the connection weights are modified during the learning procedures. The simulation results of different strategies are analyzed and compared. A typical CNC machine is considered as a case study. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detection and isolation are based on different models of the process (non-linear and linear causal local models). Reasoning using real numbers is often used by human beings; fuzzy logic is introduced as a numerical-symbolic interface between the quantitative fault indicators and the symbolic diagnostic reasoning on them; it also provides an effective decision-making tool in imprecise or uncertain environments while managing model uncertainty, sensor imprecision and vague normal behavior limits. Fuzzy rules are modelled geometrically; fuzzy sets are represented as points in a description space. A prototype graphical interface with structural, causal and historical views gives complete information to the human operator.

The major theoretical principles of the Extended Park's Vector Approach are described. Both simulation and laboratory test results demonstrate how the presence of rotor cage faults can be effectively detected by the application of this new approach. These results are also correlated with the ones obtained by the conventional motor current spectral analysis and by the classic Park's Vector Approach.

J	Son, JP; Park, JH; Cho, YZ				Son, JP; Park, JH; Cho, YZ			An integrated knowledge representation scheme and query processing mechanism for fault diagnosis in heterogeneous manufacturing environments	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article						fault diagnosis; causal relation; integrated diagnosis; heterogeneous manufacturing		An integrated fault diagnosis system was developed for manufacturing complex products, e.g., automobile, that undergo a variety of production processes. The proposed global knowledge representation scheme is designed to consistently express such heterogeneous diagnostic knowledge in terms of the causal relations among relevant attributes across different processes. This scheme is unifying in that it reflects the fact that an effect for one causal relation may in turn be a cause for another along a chain of subsequent processes. In order to unify independent pieces of causal relation, specific attributes of machine-processed products in addition to the usual diagnostic signals such as noise and voltage of the machines. The accompanying probabilistic diagnosis mechanism can then produce an enhanced diagnostic accuracy over other existing schemes as it can simultaneously consider multiple causes of a fault along with their interdependency. The proposed diagnosis mechanism was implemented in a distributed computer environment to identify the functions and procedures required for its actual application. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Such a mode of support is inefficient, ineffective and generally results in high costs, long service cycles, and poor quality of service. The rapid growth of the World Wide Web technology, with its widespread acceptance and accessibility, have resulted in the emergence of Web-based help desk systems. Depending on the functionality provided by such systems, most of the associated disadvantages of the traditional help desk environment can be eliminated. This paper describes a Web-based integrated system, the WebHotLine system, that possesses Web-based retrieval, online multilingual translation capability for service records, rule-base reasoning for direct intelligent fault diagnosis by customers or service engineers, different modes of video-conferencing for enhanced customer support and network security for secure data communications.

J	Polyshchuk, VV; Choy, FK; Braun, MJ				Polyshchuk, VV; Choy, FK; Braun, MJ			New gear-fault-detection parameter by use of joint time-frequency distribution	JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER			English	Article							TRANSMISSION	A new gear-fault-detection parameter called NP4 Is introduced. This fault-detection parameter utilizes the properties of the joint time-frequency analysis given by the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and kurtosis, With the WVD, the instantaneous power of the gear-vibration signature for one complete rotor revolution call be obtained. The presence of single-gear-tooth damage can be manifested by the existence of an instantaneous power distribution with a peakedness larger than the normal distribution. The normalized kurtosis, a fourth-order statistical parameter calculated for the instantaneous power distribution, provides the gear-fault-detection parameter NP4. The developed fault-detection parameter NP4 is sensitive to gear-tooth damage, especially for damage in a single tooth. The application of this NP4 fault-detection parameter was demonstrated by experimental data obtained from a gear test rig. The results showed that the NP4 parameter, used with the WVD, can provide an accurate fault identification of gear-tooth damage. The parameter NP4 would be of help to title practitioners in the field of machine health monitoring.

J	Shibata, K; Takahashi, A; Shirai, T				Shibata, K; Takahashi, A; Shirai, T			Fault diagnosis of rotating machinery through visualisation of sound signals	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								As a method for diagnosing faults in rotating machinery, attention is being focused on changes in the sound signals generated by bearings. This provides the advantage of making it easier to set up sensors, since sound signals can be measured at a location some distance from the housing of the bearing. However, the signal-to-noise ratio is low compared with the vibration acceleration, which makes it difficult to identify any characteristic difference between the sound signals generated by normal and faulty bearings. This report describes a symmetrised dot pattern (SDP) method, which visualises sound signals in a diagrammatic representation. Using SDP to visualize sound signals measured for fans, it was possible to distinguish differences between normal and faulty bearings. Moreover, through the analysis of sound signals in the time-frequency domain and wavelet analysis, the signal component indicative of a fault was identified. When sound signals were modified by removing the above component, SDP with the modified faulty signal resembled the nun-faulty case. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Accurate detection of the part of the surface condition manufacturing ensures the fault-free manufacturing of high-quality parts , as well as helping. To address this problem, we introduce an alternative mathematical transform that has the potential to detect faults in manufacturing machines by decomposing signals into individual components. Specifically, the paper focuses on the decomposition of numerically generated data using the Karhunen-Loeve transform to study a variety of signals from manufacturing. The potential utility of the proposed technique is then discussed in the context of understanding a manufacturing process under constant development.

J	Al-Najjar, B				Al-Najjar, B			Accuracy, effectiveness and improvement of vibration-based maintenance in paper mills: Case studies	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Many current vibration-based maintenance (VBM) policies for rolling element bearings do not use as much as possible of their useful lives. Evidence and indications to prolong the bearings' mean effective lives by using more accurate diagnosis and prognosis are confirmed when faulty bearing installation, faulty machinery design, harsh environmental condition and when a bearing is replaced as soon as its vibration level exceeds the normal. Analysis of data from roller bearings at two paper mills suggests that longer bearing lives can be safely achieved by-increasing the accuracy of the vibration data. This paper relates bearing failure modes to the observed vibration spectra and their development patterns over the bearings' lives. A systematic approach, which describes-the objectives and performance of studies in two Swedish paper mills, is presented. Explanations of the mechanisms behind some frequent modes of early failure and ways to avoid them are suggested. It is shown theoretically, and partly confirmed by the analysis of (unfortunately incomplete) data from two paper mills over many years, that accurate prediction of remaining bearing life requires: (a) enough vibration measurements, (b) numerate records of operating conditions,(c) better discrimination between frequencies in the spectrum and (d) correlation of(b) and (c). This is because life prediction depends on precise knowledge of primary, harmonic and side-band frequency amplitudes and their development over time. Further, the available data, which are collected from relevant plant activities, can be utilized to perform cyclic improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, experience and economy.

One of the aspects of telecardiology known as tele-electrocardiography deploys Electrocardiography machines to transmit Electrocardiograms (ECC) over networks. Tele-electrocardiography diagnosis and ECG interpretation is simple, reliable and cost-effective. As different parts of this tele-electrocardiography system work on different computing environments, software interoperability is a major issue. Software agent technology supports heterogeneous computing environment. As this technology reacts dynamically to adverse conditions, it is suitable for development of fault tolerant distributed systems. Additionally, agent technology represents the intentions, desires and resources of the participants - so it can be effectively used in on-line healthcare application.

First used on the F22 fighter, this sensor is the only " all-metals" debris detector in production. The sensor is based on an inductive measurement technique which enables the system to detect, count and classify wear metal particles by size and type (ferromagnetic and nonferromagnetic) above a minimum particle size threshold. In night, the measured count Values are compared to preset levels to provide prognostic health information on the oil-wetted components of the engine. This paper describes the sensor design requirements, principle of operation, electronic design and mechanical design features. The results of a test program established to correlate the oil borne debris measurements to component degradation characteristics and data from actual engine bearing failures, are also presented.

This requires reliable aircraft sub-system fault monitoring, from which comprehensive, early detection and tracking data can be obtained. A review of on-line oil system monitoring identified a number of gaps, which need to be filled before such capability can be achieved. Current technology is limited in terms of early detection and the impact of using materials such as ceramics should be considered. Two sensor systems are being developed to address present and future shortcomings in aero engine oil-system monitoring. The sensor systems have undergone a number of trials including gear and bearing rig tests and full scale engine work. This paper describes the technology performance during a recent Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) funded program.

The concept of Autonomic Logistics, or the automation of previously labor-intensive, routine tasks, has been identified as the enabler of a streamlined Support Concept. JSF Prognostics & Health Management (PHM) is comprehensive system for detecting and isolating failures as well. as predicting remaining useful life for critical components. The PHM system is a hierarchical distribution of data collection and information management elements, both on-board and off-board, that make maximum use of conventional failure symptom-detecting techniques combined with advanced software modeling to achieve excellent failure detection and isolation with zero false alarms. The information processed and managed on-board the aircraft enhances the pilot's knowledge of his remaining capabilities in the event of malfunction and, at the same time, triggers the Autonomic Logistics processes by relaying failure information to the ground. The use of on-board processing resources coupled with the Autonomic Logistics System provides operations and support cost savings over legacy aircraft while providing the Warfighter with superb system management capabilities.

This Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) system (called MPROS for Machinery Prognostics/Diagnostics System) consists of MEMS and conventional sensors on the machinery, local intelligent signal processing devices (called "Data Concentrators"), and a centrally located subsystem (called the PDME for Prognostics, Diagnostics, Monitoring Engine) which is designed so that it can run under shipboard monitoring systems such as ICAS (Integrated Condition Assessment System). MPROS includes and augments periodic vibration analysis by collecting data continuously from vibration and other sensors, including temperature, pressure, current, voltage, and so on. These data streams are integrated as necessary in the Data Concentrators (data fusion). A second level of integration (knowledge fusion) occurs in the PDME. At this level, the conclusions of different diagnostic and prognostic reasoning mechanisms are fused to yield the best possible analysis. In this paper, we discuss recent progress in design and implementation of the software and hardware required to support our system.

Statistical-based anomaly detection algorithms, fault pattern recognition techniques and advanced probabilistic models for diagnosing structural, performance and vibration related faults and degradation can now be developed for real-time monitoring environments. Integration and implementation of these advanced technologies presents a great opportunity to significantly enhance current engine health monitoring capabilities and risk management practices. This paper describes some novel diagnostic and prognostic technologies for dedicated, real-time sensor analysis, performance anomaly detection and diagnosis, vibration fault detection, and component prognostics. The technologies have been developed for gas turbine engine health monitoring and prediction applications which includes an array of intelligent algorithms for assessing the total 'health' of an engine, both mechanically and thermodynamically.

Typical examples are the impulsive signals from faults in rolling element bearings, which because of slip, are cyclostationary of second order. Thus the spectral correlation diagram has discrete cyclic frequencies and integrating the spectral correlation diagram along the frequency axis produces a discrete frequency spectrum, which has thus been suggested as a simpler way of presenting the data. However, as shown in this paper, this gives the same result as a Fourier transform of the squared signal, which is much more easily produced directly. The result is then very closely related to "envelope analysis" which has long been used in the diagnostics of rolling element bearings. This paper demonstrates that the optimum results are normally obtained by analyzing the squared envelope of an analytic signal (with bandpass filtered one-sided spectrum).

Ageing of a polymer changes the electrical, physical, mechanical and morphological properties of the insulation. Using the computer aided Isothermal-Relaxation-Current-Analysis (IRC-Analysis) the depolarization after de poling of the insulation is measurable and the separation of different time dependant relaxation mechanisms is feasible. The machine intelligent diagnostic tools for the ageing classification and the residual strength prognosis of installed medium-voltage cable is described. With the calibration performed in the field at one of the major German cable manufacturers using destructive methods (voltage and water tree tests) and the development of the machine intelligent diagnostic software, a non-destructive test procedure for already installed XLPE cable systems is created. The diagnosis reliability of the IRC-Analysis based on several on-site tests is also discussed.

Models for three-phase induction motors with broken rotor bars by winding function method are developed. Current waveforms of induction motor under normal and faulty conditions are simulated. New feature coefficients for signature analysis of the stator current are proposed based on the wavelet packet decomposition. The feature coefficients are calculated for both normal and fault conditions. It is shown that for most load conditions the new feature coefficients for fault cases are distinctive from normal conditions at certain depth and nodes. The features proposed here can be used for induction motor fault detection and diagnosis.

A survey has been conducted to investigate computerised management system applications from the user perspective. The survey was designed to solicit user opinion on effective maintenance user support and the usefulness of existing IT systems to various personnel. The combined survey results and literature review are used to inform the development of a pilot maintenance information system that will be evaluated in a future study.

Sensors and instrumentation, which record variables describing performance, vibrations, and other process parameters, have granted new opportunities in the design of trend-monitoring systems. These systems can be used toward scheduling of maintenance without impacting planned production schedules. Further, by monitoring these variables to provide information about the changing life expectancy, maintenance engineers can base service on actual field conditions, rather than relying solely on standard machine life estimates. Moreover, these systems can increase the overall efficiency by reducing energy consumption. Energy conservation for any industry is critical because of the high cost of electricity and the rapid technological concern for energy efficiency in our society. Significant amounts of energy and money can be saved by proper maintenance in a mechanical drive system. There is a strong linkage between the mechanical vibration, temperature of the machine parts, mechanical efficiency, and energy consumption of a machinery. Through our international joint project, "Scheduling of Condition-based Preventive Maintenance in ANSDK Using Computer-based On-line Monitoring Network", between USA and Egypt, we extend our vibration analysis application in the end user plant.

Its goal is to reduce the number of generated states while guaranteeing the detection of certain types of faults in the system such as deadlock and unexecutable transitions. The main idea of SRA is to allow a global transition in a reachability graph to contain a set of local transitions(i.e. transitions of individual processes) such that the state reached by the global transition is independent of the execution order of the associated local transitions. In this paper we show how to apply the SRA approach to systems modeled as extended finite state machines (EFSMs) with multiple ports. Empirical results from applying our SRA algorithm to the dining philosophers problem indicate that our algorithm reduces the number of generated states and the computation time by about 90%.

Therefore, the condition of insulating systems, and the early prediction of faults and problems are of major concern to high voltage equipment's manufacturers and users. They allow corrective maintenance and planning and reduce the overall maintenance costs. Partial Electrical discharges (PD) are both a factor that can cause the degradation, ageing and breakdown of HV insulation systems, and an indicator of the actual state and condition of the insulation. Thus, reliable periodic measurement and interpretation of PD activities are of great importance to manufacturer and user of HV equipment. They can enable the detection of a range of insulation problems, which can then be addressed in order to prevent the occurrence of failure and controlled outage of equipment. The introduction of computers and digital equipment has greatly benefited the detection, measurement and identification of PDs. It has allowed better analysis and interpretation of complicated discharge distributions, and providing fast data acquisition, processing and vast amounts of memory space for data storage. An on-line partial discharge detection system has been developed by ELECO Dowding & Mills [2,3], based on more than 12 years experience of PD field tests. The system has been used over the years to monitor, and evaluate the condition of insulating used in the stator windings of HV machines. This paper discuses the relation between the discharge patterns and identification of insulation problems in high voltage stator windings, and how this can help the manufacturer and user to assess ageing and controlled outage of equipment. Practical typical examples from site tests, demonstrating this relationship, are also presented.

Vibration based monitoring has been proven the dominating diagnostic tool for predictive maintenance purposes of rotating machinery, based mainly on trending of acquired signals suitably transformed. The Acoustic Emission based method is using predetermined levels corresponding to the tendency of acquired signals to have a burst looking appearance in order to grade machine components condition. The method is very reliable and in all cases does not require trending. Next Acoustic Emission is used for condition monitoring of valves in reciprocating machinery. Monitoring of reciprocating machinery is mainly based on operator's experience and process parameters, since existing methods lack of reliability. The new method is by far the best nonintrusive method when compared to other available.

Sensors and instrumentation, which record variables describing performance, vibrations, and other process parameters, have granted new opportunities in the design of trend-monitoring systems. These systems can be used toward scheduling of maintenance without impacting planned production schedules. Further, by monitoring these variables to provide information about the changing Life expectancy, maintenance engineers can base service on actual field conditions, rather than relying solely on standard machine life estimates. Moreover, these systems can increase the overall efficiency by reducing energy consumption. Energy conservation for any industry is critical because of the high cost of electricity and the rapid technological concern for energy efficiency in our society. Significant amounts of energy and money can be saved by proper maintenance in a mechanical drive system. There is a strong linkage between the mechanical vibration, temperature of the machine parts, mechanical efficiency, and energy consumption of machinery. Through our international joint project, "Scheduling of Condition-based Preventive Maintenance in ANSDK Using Computer-based On-line Monitoring Network," between USA and Egypt, we extend our vibration analysis application in the end-user plant. ANSDK is the largest modem steel plant in Egypt. This article describes our experiences in implementing applications of predictive CMMS in ANSDK and their results.

The real domain problem was the prediction and diagnosis of product quality issues in a Steel Hot Strip Mill. The properties of the data from this environment include multimodality (several optima), poor separation between fault levels and high dimensionality (many parameters). The method to develop the Learning Classifier System technique, based on deterministic simulated data, is presented. The advances made in the technique, which enhance its functionality in this type of industrial environment, are given. The novel methods developed are core to the Learning Classifier System technique and are not 'fixes' for given problems. They address the fitness measure, encoding alphabet, population scope, phases of training, genetic operators, life limits and removal of taxation schemes. These improvements allow the industrial LCS to function correctly in the simulated domain. Encouraging results from diagnosis of real data are presented; however, further work is needed for greater accuracy and to allow the prediction function to be used on-line. Learning Classifier Systems represent a potentially useful tool that combines the transparency of symbolic approaches (such as Decision Trees) with the learning ability of connectionist approaches (such as Artificial Neural Networks) to machine learning.

The immune system has inspired work within the areas of virus protection and pattern recognition yet its application to hardware fault tolerance is untouched. This paper introduces many of the ingenious methods provided by the immune system to provide reliable operation and suggests how such concepts can inspire novel methods of providing fault tolerance in the design of state machine hardware systems. Through a process of self/non-self recognition the proposed hardware immune system will learn to differentiate between acceptable and abnormal states and transitions within the 'immunised' system. Potential faults can then be flagged and suitable recovery methods invoked to return the system to a safe state.

The research was directed at the goal of identifying interface attributes which are assumed to be crucial for fault detection and diagnosis during supervisory control. In the first study, it was assumed that due to attributes of standard P&I-interfaces it would likely that operators fail when they are confronted with unfamiliar scenarios. The results of 11 single-cases revealed that in most cases the operators registered information which was sufficient for fault diagnoses; in the case of more difficult scenarios, however, only few operators were able to integrate this information adequately On the basis of these results and taking into account cognitive psychological aspects, two different variants of the P&I-interfaces were developed and modified for the second study. Results of an experimental evaluation of these interface modifications show specific improvements of control performance and more integration of information. A comparison between the results of both interface modifications leads to the conclusion that interface attributes and control demands may interact. As a consequence, this will require more flexible support for the operator.

For low voltage machines, negative sequence impedance or currents are measured for the same Such prognosis schemes should be carefully implemented as supply voltage unbalance, manufacturing related asymmetry, etc also produce negative sequence voltages. A few motor current signature analysis (MCSA) based approaches have already been proposed to detect stator inter-turn faults. However, little or no physical insight was provided to explain the occurrence of certain harmonics in the line current or the Influence of voltage unbalance on these harmonics. Also, in at least one of there papers, a large portion of the stator winding was shorted to emulate the faults. The method proposed In this paper monitors certain rotor slot related harmonics at the terminal voltage of the machine; once it is switched off. In the absence of supply voltage, issues such as voltage unbalance, time harmonics do not influence the measurements except as initial conditions; a very desirable feature when the machine is fed from an adjustable speed drive. Satisfactory simulation and experimental results have been obtained with only about 1.5% (5/324) of the total number of turns shorted.

The scheme consists of a feed-forward neural network combined with a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) to visually display the operating condition of the machine on a two-dimensional grid. The operating point moves to a specific region on the map as a fault starts developing and can be used to alert the motor protection system to an incipient fault. This is a useful tool for commercial condition monitoring systems. Experimental results are provided, with data obtained from a specially wound test motor, to illustrate the robustness of the proposed turn fault detection scheme. The new method is not sensitive to unbalanced supply voltages or asymmetries in the machine and instrumentation.

Besides the traditional current signature analysis based on one-phase current spectrum lines at frequencies (1 +/- 2s) f, the procedures based on analysis of the Line at frequency 2sf in the spectrum respectively of electromagnetic torque, space vector current modulus and instantaneous power are considered. These last procedures have similar features and the comparison is developed on the basis of instantaneous torque. It is addressed that the speed ripple introduces two further terms in the instantaneous torque, decreasing the accuracy of the diagnosis. It is shown that there Is a link between the angular displacement of the current sideband components at frequencies (1 +/- 2s) f. This allows a more correct quantitative evaluation of the fault and to shelf the superiority of the sideband current components diagnostic procedure over the other proposed methods.

Conventional monitoring techniques are designed for the area of rated torque. Generally load torque is not available at batch test as the test sample shouldn't or can't be clutched. However, at standstill machine torque and machine currents are big enough to enable rotor monitoring. There short-circuit teats are applicable for diagnostic purpose. This application should be demonstrated by means of the Vienna Monitoring Method (VMM), which is a model based evaluation technique.

The paper is written with large turbo-machinery in view but many of the results discussed have relevance to other types of machine. The examination begins with the simplest, yet perhaps the most important, fault namely mass unbalance. The elementary procedure for locating the source of unbalance will be reviewed and procedures for balancing will be briefly summarised. The distinction between unbalance and a shaft bend will be discussed and the consequences of permanent and temporary bends will be examined. A fault which is sometimes connected with rotor bends is rubbing and the characteristics of this phenomena will be outlined including some recent developments in the theory and the classification of the different categories of rub which can occur in practice. An overview will be given of the characteristics of a cracked rotor and examples of cracks which have been detected using vibration measurements will be described. No discussion of the dynamics of large machines would be complete without a description of the effects of misalignment. Both static and dynamic types are discussed together with their consequences.

The FEM model includes the destabilizing effects of internal damping. A FEM model and a computer-based simulation were also developed for a bench-top rotor rig suspended on purpose-built AMB. The predicted results were then compared to experimental data from the rotor rig in order to establish some level of confidence in the predictions given by the gas turbine simulation. AMB can change their stiffness and damping in response to machine operating conditions and, as such, they offer the potential of converting an aircraft gas turbine into a smart machine, with real-time diagnostics, prognosis capabilities, and the ability to make on-line corrections. This potential will be discussed in light of the challenges of designing aircraft gas turbines that have higher performance, less maintenance, longer lifetimes, and enhanced safety.

In this paper, a modification of the spectral distribution function is used to derive a new parameter to detect gear tooth problems in a simple single-geared transmission system. A new wear parameter (or "health index") is presented by tracking the broad band noise component associated with vibration sensor data. This underlying broad band signal is masked by discrete tones when conventional measures are used. Results of the analysis show that clear and unambiguous signals regarding incipient problems are uncovered by this new parameter.

This paper investigates sensor placement strategy for detecting structural defects of a ball bearing. Based on an analytical study of signal propagation from the defect location to the sensors, numerical simulations using a finite element algorithm were conducted to validate the signal strength at several representative sensor locations. The results were then experimentally verified through actual measurements. The study has shown that to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio, the sensors need to be placed as closely as possible to the bearing, where signals due to structural defects are generated. The study has provided a theoretical framework for designing sensor-embedded bearings with built-in diagnostic capabilities.

The nitrogen index (NI) can be used to predict prognostic outcome: an NI <0.9 is associated with substantial wasting in HIV disease, an NI <0.8 predicts significant pathophysiology in chronic renal failure, and a low NI is predictive of neutropenia in breast-cancer patients, These findings emphasize the central importance of adequate protein stores in recovery from disease or in maintaining quality of life. Aging appears to involve a gradual loss of TBP throughout adulthood. Cross-sectional data suggest that TBP declines curvilinearly with age, such that there is an accelerated decline after 65 years of age, However, longitudinal data are scarce, and little is known about the relative loss of visceral protein, as opposed to skeletal muscle protein, More clearly-defined data are essential if the effects of aging per se are to be separated from the effects of chronic disease, A further complication is the knowledge that physical activity also declines with age. Thus sarcopenia, the loss of skeletal muscle mass, could primarily result from disuse rather than aging, The economic impact of unsuccessful aging places a pressing need for multicompartment data in longitudinal study designs.

Both, the stress-history induced structural damage evolution and the deterioration development independent on stresses are simulated. Combining nonlinear finite element simulations of concrete structures and damage models with probabilistic reliability analysis, this concept is one preliminary step to future design procedures of structural concrete. For the calculation of load-induced damage accumulation, the reinforced concrete material is modelled using approved simulation methods for constitutive concrete, steel and bond behaviour including a phenomenological fatigue model. For load-independent deterioration processes, such as corrosion of reinforcement, simple procedures are proposed and models from literature are considered. The results of the deterministic structural analysis are then processed probabilistically in order to consider the scattering character of resistance and action parameters. These probabilistic simulations are performed for different lifetime periods. Consequently the estimation of the time-variant failure probability, i.e. the failure rate, is made possible. The application of this concept will be demonstrated by means of a numerical example from bridge engineering.

Methods were developed to produce optimized test sequences for detecting faults in such systems. However the application of these methods gives only limited information about the location of detected faults. In this paper we propose a complementary step, which localizes the fault, once detected. It consists of a generalized diagnostic algorithm for the case where distributed system specifications (implementations) are given in the form of communicating non-determistic finite state machines. Such algorithm localizes the faulty transition once the fault has been detected. The Algorithm guarantees the correct diagnosis of any single (output and/or transfer)fault. Simple example is used to demonstrate the functioning of the proposed algorithm. The complexity of each step in the algorithm and hence, the overall complexity, are calculated.

The architecture of the system consists of a feature generation module and a fault inference module. Lateral vibration data are used for calculating the system features. Both continuous-time and discrete-time parameter estimation algorithms are employed for generating the features. A neural fuzzy network is exploited for intelligent inference of faults based on the extracted features. The proposed method is implemented on a digital signal processor.

The development of this system is based on four sequential steps: the first is the development of simple but realistic FE models based on dynamic simulations of the complete system. The second step is the monitoring of the real turbocharger. The third step is the accurate modelling of the foundations and the excitation from the main engine, which will be done using a robust optimisation method. In the fourth step all the possible faults of the machine are identified using the artificial neural networks (ANN). In this way we can take advantage of the ANN learning capability for the real time diagnosis of potential faults. The application of the proposed system to a real naval turbocharger with vibration data obtained on working conditions show some promising results. (C) 2000 IMACS/Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The system processed real-life medical data of 566 new-borns; 528 survived and were classified as "alive", the remaining 38 did not survive and were classified as "died". The state of each new-born was described by values of 112 attributes. The system detected five of the attributes as the best predictors for survival (asphyxia, apnoea, birth weight, reanimation and gestation age). To evaluate are the selected attributes relevant for prediction, the following procedure was used: 566 newborns were divided into two groups by random selection; 396 (70%) randomly selected new-horns formed the learning group, the remaining 170 new-borns formed the test group. The system acquired prediction knowledge by processing data of the learning group new-borns. Using the knowledge thus acquired, the system predicted survival for each new-born from the test group several times, each time using another set of attributes: once, using all 112 attributes; once, using attributes detected by the system as the best predictors; once, using remaining attributes without the best predictors. After the predictions for all new-borns from the test group had been finished, classification accuracy, sensitivity (accuracy for "alive") and specificity (accuracy for "died") were calculated as measures of prediction success with particular sets of attributes. The results have shown that the best prognostic accuracies were achieved when prediction was done using those attributes which the system detected as the best predictors for new-born survival.

SHM systems monitor real-time sensors to determine system health and performance. Performance, economics, and safety are all at stake in SHM, and the emphasis on health management technology is motivated by all these considerations. This paper describes a project focusing on condition-based maintenance (CBM) for naval ships. Condition-based maintenance refers to the identification of maintenance needs based on current operational conditions. In this project, system architectures and diagnostic and prognostic algorithms are being developed that can efficiently under-take real-time data analysis from appropriately instrumented machinery aboard naval ships and, based on the analysis, provide feedback to human users regarding the state of the machinery - such as its expected time to failure, the criticality of the equipment for current operation.

In the proposed scheme, higher order statistical (HOS) analyses are used as a pre-processing procedure applied to a machine vibration signal. Such analyses yield power spectral density, bispectrum, and bicoherence signatures for the vibration characteristics. A combination of data reduction, parameterisation and fuzzy logic procedures is then applied to the HOS signatures to enable diagnosis of the machine fault. Results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure and resulting system for diagnosing a number of induction motor faults. For comparison purposes, the performance of diagnostic Procedures developed using artificial neural network (ANN) based and conventional classification approaches are also briefly discussed.

Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed tec hniques. The results obtained indicate that it is possible to embed some fault-tolerant properties for the voltage-fed asynchronous machine drive system.				jacobina@dee.ufpb.br	De Araujo Ribeiro, Ricardo Lucio/AAH-6159-2019; Lima, Antonio/B-6625-2009; Silva, Edison/AAZ-9661-2021; Lima, Antonio Marcus Nogueira/F-9201-2014; Jacobina, Cursino B/H-6601-2015	Lima, Antonio/0000-0002-6414-0067; Silva, Edison/0000-0002-8678-228X; Lima, Antonio Marcus Nogueira/0000-0002-4568-9126; Jacobina, Cursino B/0000-0003-1111-6087; De Araujo Ribeiro, Ricardo Lucio/0000-0001-5295-340X			Blaabjerg F, 1997, IEEE T IND APPL, V33, P1241, DOI 10.1109/28.633802; DEBEBE K, 1991, CONFERENCE RECORD OF THE 1991 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING, VOLS 1 AND 2, P368, DOI 10.1109/IAS.1991.178181; KASTHA D, 1994, IEEE T IND APPL, V30, P1028, DOI 10.1109/28.297920; Mendes AMS, 1999, IEMDC'99 - IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC MACHINES AND DRIVES CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS, P704, DOI 10.1109/IEMDC.1999.769220; Peuget R, 1998, IEEE T IND APPL, V34, P1318, DOI 10.1109/28.739017; Smith KS, 1997, IEEE T IND ELECTRON, V44, P468, DOI 10.1109/41.605620; SPEE R, 1990, IEEE T IND APPL, V26, P259, DOI 10.1109/28.54251	7	25	27	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	0275-9306		0-7803-5692-6; 0-7803-5693-4	IEEE POWER ELECTRON			2000							242	247					6	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BR59K	WOS:000166883500038					2022-02-14

This paper addresses and proposes a systematic analysis for this issue based on the system sensitivity theory. The results from this study provide a guideline in choosing the optimal location to pick-up signals for residual generation in a closed-loop control system for FDI. The results have been verified by both computer simulation and a real-time implementation on a lab-scale electric machine system.

J	McDowell, DL; Clayton, JD; Bennett, VP				McDowell, DL; Clayton, JD; Bennett, VP			Integrated diagnostic/prognostic tools for small cracks in structures	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						diagnostic/prognostic integrated system; high-cycle fatigue; sensors; cracks; catastrophic failure; prognostic tools	SHORT FATIGUE CRACKS; GROWTH; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	An integrated system for diagnosis of the 'health' of a structural component subjected to high-cycle fatigue (HCF) consists of sets of embedded or emplaced sensors at various locations, extracting information related to the generation of material defects, the presence of crack-like discontinuities and their progression and changes in system dynamics that may relate to this progression. Conceptually, signals from these sensors are fed into a processing environment that can project deleterious conditions related to the onset of loss of function or propagation of cracks to critical dimensions. Since the idea is to monitor the gradual changes of component performance and various local related indices before catastrophic failure to enable the operator to respond with a maintenance hold, it is essential to couple the diagnostics with prognostic capability; this facilitates a prediction of how much time remains within the window of viable servicing or repair. In the HCF regime, the dominant fraction of total fatigue life may be spent at crack lengths of the order of 20-500 mum. The detection of longer cracks near the end of component life is critical since component failure may lead to failure of the overall structure. This necessitates the identification of (a) algorithms for identifying component 'hot spots' where failure is likely to occur, (b) development of appropriate crack growth laws for cracks of different length scales, ranging from the order of grain size to the order of component dimensions, including consideration of contacting components (fretting fatigue) and environmental effects and (c) development of algorithms for identifying the progression of component degradation on the basis of multiple-sensor inputs at different time and length scales, providing feedback to support cause for maintenance shutdown. This paper discusses each of these issues.

Current monitoring techniques that focus on the identification of faults present in a bearing have various limitations. Typically they are applicable only under well-defined, specific and precalibrated operating conditions, thereby preventing continuous monitoring of a system operating in a variant environment. They are often limited in damage severity estimation and prognostic capability. This, in turn, prevents the development of optimal maintenance scheduling in favour of overall system safety and productivity. Research presented in this paper has yielded results that have extended bearing diagnostics and prognostics to address these limitations and to achieve optimal machinery maintenance scheduling. This paper discusses the current research status on the development of a new signal processing method with noise cancellation capability to provide early defect detection, the establishment of a diagnostic model to estimate bearing defect severity under variant conditions and the formulation of an adaptively tuned defect propagation model to track the time-variant nature of defect growth for the forecasting of bearing remaining utility.

This paper considers the use of another time-frequency distribution called the Instantaneous Power Spectrum (IPS) in the detection of local faults in helical gears. The paper begins with a fundamental description of the IFS and then examines the capability of the technique in extracting condition indicating information from gear vibration signals and also in assessing the fault severity. The concept of a Stationarity Index (SI) is introduced which is very sensitive to small changes in the signal. The SI is then implemented with the IFS in the time-frequency plane to detect early changes in the vibration signal. It is shown that the Instantaneous Power Spectrum when used on its own, as well as in conjunction with the Stationarity Index is very sensitive to small changes in the signal and can be used to detect a small local fault at a very early stage.

The goal of the fault detection and predictive maintenance strategy is to maximize tool availability for production while minimizing the risk to product. The predictive maintenance methods allow the user to increase the elapsed time between maintenance activities while minimizing the risk of unexpected equipment failure. The predictive maintenance methods are based on the use of a statistically based fault detection system. The selected equipment parameters are monitored throughout the run for drift beyond established threshold limits. Fault detection is reported directly to a maintenance planning and scheduling application which in turn sends a message to the operating personnel. An option is available which will inhibit the use of the tool until the maintenance activity has been completed. A major part of this project was the identification of equipment parameters for monitoring, the statistical methods used in the analysis and the determination of the threshold values at which to initiate a maintenance activity. The decision process leading to the definition of these factors is discussed.

One of such promising diagnoses is first to regard any signal taken from the machinery operation as the time series data. We then think of the series itself expressing the displacement under the influence of an external force F. The time rate variables of the series are velocity V and acceleration A that is proportional to F. Under this force F, if the system makes any changes, its kinetic energy KE also changes. The time rate change of KE is the power PW, which is proportional to the product of V and A. The PW is very sensitive to any subtle change in F that controls the system dynamics. We generalize the method to obtain these physical variables from the time series with physical wavelets [1-3]. The wavelets are the windows through which we selectively view the series and its rate variables in the frequency region confined within each wavelet width. Any subtle change in F will appear on the selective correlation of V and A. The change in F that may lead to the malfunction of the systems will sometimes start at the order of 0.01%, which is often comparable to adverse noise. Even with this noise, however, the selective correlation will identify the small change leading to the malfunction. It can also predict the abnormal operating condition to control the system adoptively. We further make the physical wavelet orthogonal to each other in order to reconstruct the state space. In the space, we then draw a trajectory from the time series, which will reveal the physical dynamics of the operating conditions. This reconstruction is similar to so called time delay embedding in Chaos analysis [4]. Their bases chosen to reconstruct the state space, however, have no direct physical meaning. An example of the diagnoses and prognoses on a drilling machine tool by using the physical. wavelets is discussed in detail.

The information from the users is not only a important original knowledge source for updating and learning-the knowledge of the knowledge base in diagnosis center, but also a indispensable tache in information feedback of equipment' life cycle. However, it is difficult that maintenance data could be fed back and directly transformed into the knowledge in knowledge base in time, and consequently became the public information in Internet. To solve these problems, this article proposed a intelligent maintenance system in remote monitoring of mechatronical equipment, and also founded a framework of Maintenance Database System based on user-server structure. Maintenance Database System can be divided into four parts, Maintenance Record Database, Maintenance Knowledge Database, Equipment's Usage Database and the Equipment's Appliance Database. In this article, We presented the data structure of Maintenance Database System and the knowledge expression of Maintenance Database; and founded the machine learning module, which based on the conception trees and remote man-machine interactive manner. This system is used in remote monitoring of FMS equipment and fault diagnosis, and its running status is quite well.

The development of this system is based on four sequential steps: the development of simple but realistic Finite Element models based on dynamic simulations of the complete system, the monitoring of the real turbocharger, the accurate modelling of the foundations and the excitation from the main engine. In the final step possible faults of the machine are identified using the Artificial Neural Networks taking advantage of their learning capabilities for the real time diagnosis of potential faults. The application of the proposed system to a real naval turbocharger with vibration data obtained on working conditions show promising results.

This paper presents different methods for diagnosing the condition of oscillating bearings in the universal joints of a roughing rolling mill. The unstable speed conditions of these roller bearings call for time-frequency analysis methods. The analysis methods applied on the oscillating bearings are the Short-Term-Fourier-Transform (STFT) and the Wavelet-Transform (WT). The results of these methods are compared to the more common statistical methods.

In condition-based maintenance, machinery is repaired or serviced only when an intelligent monitoring system indicates that the system cannot fulfill mission requirements. The implementation of such systems requires a combination of sensor data fusion, feature extraction, classification, and prediction algorithms. In addition, new system architectures are being developed to facilitate the reduction of wide bandwidth sensor data to concise predictions of ability of the system to complete its current mission or future missions. This paper describes the system architecture, data fusion, and classification algorithms employed in a distributed, wireless bearing and gear health monitoring system. The role and integration of prognostic algorithms - required to predict future system health - are also discussed.

Within the new diagnostic method the faults of rotor machinery are represented by fictitious equivalent loads acting on the undamaged rotor system. To verify the concept, the identification method is tested numerically on a simple rotor-stator system. Moreover, various influences existing in practical applications, like defective sensors, noise in measured vibration signals or short sample length, affect the identification results. All these influences are examined independently by executing a lot of numerical tests on a simple rotor-stator system. Beyond that, the identification method was also tested experimentally on two real test rigs.

Achieving this will require new enabling diagnostic technologies. One such technology, the use of acoustic emission for the early detection of helicopter rotor head dynamic component faults, has been investigated by Honeywell Technology Center for its rotor acoustic monitoring system (RAMS). This ambitious, 38-month, proof-of-concept effort, which was a part of the Naval Surface Warfare Center Air Vehicle Diagnostics System program, culminated in a successful three-week flight test of the RAMS system at Patuxent River Flight Test Center in September 1997. The flight test results demonstrated that stress-wave acoustic emission technology can detect signals equivalent to small fatigue cracks in rotor head components and can do so across the rotating articulated rotor head joints and in the presence of other background acoustic noise generated during flight operation. This paper presents the results of stress wave data analysis of the flight-test dataset using wavelet-based techniques to assess background operational noise vs. machinery failure detection results.

A major challenge for an AE-based fault detection algorithm is to distinguish crack-related AE signals from other interfering transient signals, such as fretting-related AE signals and electromagnetic transients. Although under a controlled laboratory environment we have fewer interference sources, there are other undesired sources which have to be considered. In this paper, we present some methods, which make their decision based on the features extracted from time-delay and joint time-frequency components by means of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network using experimental data collected in a laboratory by colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Most of dynamical systems are not easy to analyze and detect faults because the observed parameters are not directly expressing the state of the system. We have to measure the temporal tendencies of the parameters, which is not easy not only for testing machine but also for human work Here, the effectiveness of the trend fault diagnosis system using recurrent neural networks is examined for the air-conditioning system. The network was trained with the fault and correct data sequences obtained from the system simulation. The experimental fault detection results by using actual data proved that the proposed method is effective to perform the trend diagnosis of dynamic system.

We consider the TTM framework [9, 10] for modeling DEDS behavior over time. In two companion papers [7, 2] we discussed issues related to modeling and state observation in TTMs for system with unmeasurable variables. In this paper we continue from that point and first discuss how faults are modeled in the extended framework of [7]. We then discuss the problem of state observation with delay originally discussed in the context of Finite State Machine by [11, 3]. Finally we show how an "With Delay Observer" can be used for detection and diagnosis of faults in a system modeled as a DEDS using the TTM framework.

Loads and fault severity indicators are incorporated into a risk probability of survival [P-S(t)] equation which varies over time as the machinery loads and faults vary; A measure of the machinery reliability [R(t)] is employed in the derivation of P-S(t) and in modified forms as bases of comparison for P-S(t). The lower confidence limit on R(t) and a safety level R(t) are used in conjunction with P-S(t) to indicate alarm conditions. RiskMAN(TM) techniques and mathematical models have been developed as part of the NNS/HUMS real time diagnostic system for Navy and Army military aircraft [Giuntini 1997]. The NNS/HUMS is a critical link in the transition from a Safe Life Maintenance (SLM) philosophy to a Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) philosophy. RiskMAN(TM) receives the output parameters from the neural network module which are load state, fault class, fault severity, fault probability and severity probabilities. Then it converts these parameters into meaningful information that will detect an imminent failure or will enable life of the system to be extended beyond its normal/typical overhaul time. Though being developed for military aircraft applications, RiskMAN(TM) is also applicable to general industrial RiskMAN(TM) machinery.				rgiuntini@hnt.wylelabs.com	Lin, Zhao/C-8319-2011	Lin, Zhao/0000-0002-6131-9723			Abernethy RB., 1983, WEIBULL ANAL HDB; *AMT CORP, 1998, UNPUB NEURAL NETWORK, V1; GIUNTINI RE, 1997, MATH METHOD ESTABLIS; VONALVEN WH, 1965, RELIABILITY ENG	4	1	1	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1062-922X		0-7803-6583-6	IEEE SYS MAN CYBERN			2000							2464	2466					3	Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Engineering	BR32T	WOS:000166106900429					2022-02-14

In addition to the traditional crossover and mutation genetic operators, a new mutation operator is introduced. This mutation operator helps identify solutions in relatively few generations by increasing the Hamming distance between candidate solutions. New candidate test vectors with higher fitness function scores replace the old ones. Hence the average fitness level of the population improves with each new generation. The resulting process yields solutions to the problem of the PLA test vector generation for shrinkage faults. PLA testing and fault simulation is computationally expensive in uniprocessor machines. However, a genetic algorithm based approach is well suited for implementation in parallel processing machines with vectorization capability.

From theoretical analysis, we know the existing demodulation methods have three limitations as following: when we demodulate two time-domain adding signals without modulating information (fault information), the subtraction of the two signals' frequencies will display as the result of demodulation; in generalized detection-filtering demodulation analysis, the effect of frequency aliasing may arise as a result of getting absolute value or detection; in several new Zoom demodulation methods, because digital low-pass filtering can not be carried out in the process of Zoom sub-sampling, it is possible to occur the phenomenon of frequency aliasing at low frequency range, which is the overlap of the higher harmonics of modulation frequency. This paper presents an optimized Hilbert Transform demodulation method based upon complex analytic band-pass filter, which can overcome the three limitations if the analytical frequency of modulation and filter's bandwidth satisfy a strict mathematics relation between themselves. Meanwhile, we can integrate band-pass filtering, Hilbert transform and sub-sampling as a whole to obtain a fast operation. It is an optimized demodulation method.

At the same time, FFT-FS spectrum zooming technology and AR spectrum estimate method can overcome the difficulty of the sampling frequency and sampling number so to get accurate frequency. As an example, vibration signal of reduction device is analyzed. As a result, the tooth faces of gear pair in the high-speed stage is deteriorated seriously and the bear in the high-speed shaft on the work side has fault feature.

Structure faults of diesel engine usually affect exciting forces or propagation behavior of local vibration signals and induce different vibration responses on engine surface. Compared to other symptomatic parameters vibration signal possesses advantages of easy data acquisition, strong monitor directionality, high detection precision, early condition prediction and is especially sensitive to mechanical conditions of significant components such as piston-liner, valve mechanism, fuel oil injector, turbocharger bearing, main journal bearing, etc. Experimental research and theoretical analysis carried out during author's doctoral and post-doctoral research period has made more clear the excitation and propagation of superficial local vibration signals, revealed the relationship between internal exciting forces, external local vibrations, engine performance conditions and mechanical faults of diesel engine, explored a new method to get over the difficulties of present vibration analysis method in practical use of diesel engine fault diagnosis. This paper briefly summarizes vibrational diagnosis mechanisms of worn-out piston-liner, abnormal valve clearance, exhaust valve leakage and worn-out main journal bearing, introduces the hardware design and software interfaces of vibration monitoring system for marine diesel engine.

One of the more effective tools in predictive maintenance is condition monitoring and diagnostics. However, in many instances, condition monitoring is not taught to engineering students at Universities at the undergraduate level. The School of Mechanical, Manufacturing and Medical Engineering (MMME) of Queensland University of Technology is in tile process of introducing condition monitoring in its undergraduate curriculum as core for the Mechanical Engineering students where it is offered as part of the Mechanical Design course. This paper describes the basis for the introduction of the new subject and the resources used in its teaching.

In addition, wear particle analysis can give more advanced warning of an impending disaster for machine condition monitoring. However, its application in industry is, so far, limited because the current techniques require the analysts to have considerable experience and involvement in terms of time, and also due to the issue of reliability and objectivity of current techniques. To overcome the drawbacks and further to gain widespread application, a new wear particle analysis system using computer image analysis techniques is developed towards industrial application. This system is a computerised wear particle analysis assemblage which can perform a series of analyses including the study of particle size distribution, particle counting, the analysis of boundary and surface morphologies of wear debris in three dimensions and wear particle identification. As the whole system is computerised, it is an efficient and reliable system to conduct wear particle analysis. Meanwhile, the system has great commercial potential as it overcomes the limitation of visual inspection method, and furthermore, it combines the "group analysis" with individual particle morphological analysis in one system. The development is a basis for developing an expert system for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using wear debris analysis for practical application.

The solution of tasks within mechatronic systems is performed on the process side and the digital-electronic side. As the interrelations during the design play an important role, simultaneous engineering has to take place from the very beginning. Mechatronic systems are developed for mechanical elements, machines, vehicles and precision mechanic devices. The integration of mechatronic systems can be performed by the components (hardware integration) and by information processing (software integration). The information processing consists of low-level and high-level feedback control, supervision and diagnosis and general process management. Special signal processing, model-based and adaptive methods are applied. With the aid of a knowledge base and inference mechanisms, mechatronic systems with increasing intelligence will be developed. The main goals are to increase systems performance, reliability and economy, and decrease production costs.

J	O'Donovan, R; Uzsoy, R; McKay, KN				O'Donovan, R; Uzsoy, R; McKay, KN			Predictable scheduling of a single machine with breakdowns and sensitive jobs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							STAGE PRODUCTION; RELEASE; SYSTEM; SHOPS	Production schedules released to the shop floor have two important functions: allocating shop resources to different jobs to optimize some measure of shop performance and serving as a basis for planning external activities such as material procurement, preventive maintenance and delivery of orders to customers. Schedule modification may delay or render infeasible the execution of external activities planned on the basis of the predictive schedule. Thus it is of interest to develop predictive schedules that can absorb disruptions without affecting planned external activities while maintaining high shop performance. We present a predictable scheduling approach, that inserts additional idle time into the schedule to absorb the impacts of breakdowns. The effects of disruptions on planned support activities are measured by the deviations of job completion times in the realized schedule from those in the predictive schedule. We apply our approach to minimizing total tardiness on a single machine with stochastic machine failures. We then extend the procedure to consider the case where job processing times are affected by machine breakdowns, and provide specialized rescheduling heuristics. Extensive computational experiments show that this approach provides high predictability with minor sacrifices in shop performance.

J	Sen, AK; Murty, ASR				Sen, AK; Murty, ASR			Parallel processing application in traction motor fault diagnosis	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						diagnosis with greater confidence; parallel processing; traction motor; thermal model; transputer based predictor		Parallel processing-based system condition monitoring and fault detection are the order of the day for providing greater safety and reliability of the system. Fast and accurate fault diagnosis and detection predictor provides better system protection and maintenance planning of spare parts. In this paper, an attempt has been made to predict the temperature profile of different parts of a traction motor by using parallel processing techniques. The prediction of temperature of different parts of the motor during healthy and faulty condition have been established by developing a thermal model of the machine and transputer based concurrent process predictor has been taken up to assess the thermal behaviour of the machine The significant advantage of this predictor is its capability of providing early warning about the condition of the machine with greater confidence and built in redundancy and thereby ensured the protection of the machine.

Such messages tend to be generated in large quantities, and are difficult and lime consuming to interpret manually. This paper presents the design and development of a case-based reasoning system for diagnosing locomotive faults using such fault messages as input. The process of using historical repair data and expert input for case generation and validation is described. An algorithm for case matching is presented, along with some results on pilot data.

The system comprises six major modules: database and management system, case maintenance; knowledge acquisition and editing; expert system; explanation and test-recommendation facilities; and user interface. Part I of a two-part paper details the knowledge acquisition and editing module, as presented here. Part II describes the remaining modules and also gives test results (Liao TW, Zhan Z-H, Mount CR. Engineering Failure Analysis 1999;6:387-406). The method used for automated knowledge acquisition is an inductive learning algorithm, which was modified from PRISM (Cendrowska J. Int J. Man-Machine Studies 1987;27:349-70) to handle noisy and missing data. Using the algorithm, a total of 48 rules were induced from 477 training examples gathered for the identification of 15 different failure mechanisms such as brittle fracture, fatigue, and stress corrosion cracking. Fifty-nine attributes were used to distinguish one failure mechanism from the others. They include pitted, beach marks, microvoids, etc. The knowledge editing function is provided to allow the verification of induced rules by the human expert. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model is used to compute/predict the characteristic frequency components which are indicative of rotor bar and connector breakages in the armature current waveforms and developed torque profiles, respectively. It was found that failures due to rotor connector breakages tend to degrade the developed torque of the machine considerably more than failures due to rotor bar breakages. Also, the effects and implications of rotor breakages on core loss distributions are quantified and described. Furthermore, this model has great potential in future applications to generate data bases for use in overall non-invasive diagnostics of faults or trouble shooting in relation to quality assessments of the state of the motor and the overall drive.

This drive has been designed with a;degree of inherent fault tolerance and is capable of continued operation in the presence of a variety of faults. Some of the most severe faults arise fi om winding insulation failure within a phase of the machine. A method of detecting turn to turn short circuits which can result from winding insulation breakdown is presented, along with a strategy for continued post fault operation of the drive. The detection method operates in real time, requires no additional sensors and is sufficiently sensitive to detect even a single shorted turn.

The first uses a neural network vibration-based condition monitoring system for providing advance warning of press felt problems. The characteristics of this system include spectral analysis through acceleration enveloping, a peak detection algorithm as a feature extractor and a neural network classifier. The second approach makes use of multivariate statistical techniques. This involves the generation of a multivariate statistical representation of nominal process behaviour. Process malfunctions are then identified by deviations from the developed model. Both approaches are successfully applied to an industrial paper machine. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Wang, XZ; Li, RF				Wang, XZ; Li, RF			Combining conceptual clustering and principal component analysis for state space based process monitoring	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; PROCESS TRENDS; STEADY-STATES; SIMULATION; REPRESENTATION; DISTILLATION; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; PCA	Multivariate statistics and unsupervised machine learning have recently been studied by many researchers for process monitoring and fault diagnosis. These approaches often depend on calculating a similarity or distance measure to group data sets into clusters. Apart from giving predictions, they are not able to give causal explanations on why a specific set of data is assigned to a particular cluster. In this work, a conceptual clustering approach is presented for designing state space based monitoring systems, which is able to generate conceptual knowledge on the major variables which are responsible for clustering, as well as projecting the operation to a specific operational state. A critical issue in this approach is how to conceptually represent dynamic trend signals. For this purpose, principal component analysis is used for concept extraction from real-time dynamic trend signals. The method is introduced using a continuous stirred tank reactor as a case study. Application of the approach to a refinery methyl tert-butyl ether process is also presented.

J	Mevel, L; Hermans, L; Van der Auweraer, H				Mevel, L; Hermans, L; Van der Auweraer, H			Application of a subspace-based fault detection method to industrial structures	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS	Early detection and localization of damage allow increased expectations of reliability, safety and reduction of the maintenance cost. This paper deals with the industrial validation of a technique to monitor the health of a structure in operating conditions (e.g. rotating machinery, civil constructions subject to ambient excitations, etc.) and to detect slight deviations in a modal model derived from in-operation measured data. In this paper, a statistical local approach based on covariance-driven stochastic subspace identification is proposed. The capabilities and limitations of the method with respect to health monitoring and damage detection are discussed and it is explained how the method can be practically used in industrial environments. After the successful validation of the proposed method on a few laboratory structures, its application to a sports car is discussed. The example illustrates that the method allows the early detection of a vibration-induced fatigue problem of a sports car. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Higher-order spectral analysis of machine vibrations for the provision of diagnostic features is investigated. Experimental work is based on vibration data collected from a small test rig subjected to bearing faults. The direct use of the entire bispectrum or trispectrum to provide diagnostic features is investigated using a variety of classification algorithms including neural networks, and this is compared with simpler power spectral and statistical feature extraction algorithms. A more detailed investigation of the higher-order spectral structure of the signals is then undertaken. This provides features which can be estimated more easily in practice and could provide diagnostic information about the machines.

J	Tafazoli, S; Lawrence, PD; Salcudean, SE				Tafazoli, S; Lawrence, PD; Salcudean, SE			Identification of inertial and friction parameters for excavator arms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION			English	Article						friction coefficients; hydraulic manipulator; inertia matrix; parameter estimation; robot dynamics	MACHINES; MODELS	A novel yet simple approach for experimental determination the link (mass and inertia-related) parameters and friction coefficients developed for a typical excavator arm. The parameters are needed for indirect measurement of the external forces, compensation for the link weights in the operator's hand in a force-feedback teleoperation setup, impedance control of the arm, simulation of the manipulator dynamics, and model-based fault detection. Treating the machine arm as an open kinematic chain, its dynamic equations are presented symbolically. The static torque equations are derived from these equations and the gravitational parameters are defined accordingly, A new method for decoupled estimation of the gravitational parameters from static experiments is presented. Furthermore, the arm dynamics are expressed in a form which is linear in the inertia and friction-related parameters. The arm inertia matrix is also computed as a function of the identifiable dynamic parameters. The full set of the inertial and friction parameters are identified by applying least squares to experimental data collected while moving the links. The presented results with the instrumented, computer-controlled mini-excavator show that the identified model predicts the joint torques, in both static and dynamic conditions, with a very good accuracy. In particular, the joint torque of the proximal link is estimated with 1.1% and 4.4% error in the static and dynamic tests, respectively. It is shown that with gravity compensation, the threshold level of the force feedback hand controller would be 1% of its full-scale domain, hence reducing operator fatigue and improving safety significantly. The inertia matrix is also confirmed to be positive definite within the arm workspace. The novel techniques presented in this paper are quite general and ran be applied to a wide range of multi-link hydraulic manipulators.

Three different families algorithms have been analyzed: divide and conquer (top down induction decision tree), covering, and inductive logic programming (ILP). We have used (1) fault data collected on corrective maintenance activities for the Generalized Support Software reuse asset library located at the Flight Dynamics Division of NASA's GSFC and (2) product measures extracted directly from the faulty components of this library. In our data set, the software quality models generated by both C4.5-rules (a divide and conquer algorithm) and FOIL (an inductive logic programming one) presented the best results from the point of view of model accuracy.

J	Zavarehi, MK; Lawrence, PD; Sassani, F				Zavarehi, MK; Lawrence, PD; Sassani, F			Nonlinear modeling and validation of solenoid-controlled pilot-operated servovalves	IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS			English	Article						electrohydraulic servovalve; nonlinear modeling; two-stage spool valve	PRESSURE CONTROL; VALVE	Solenoid-controlled pilot-operated servovalves are flow control devices widely used to drive high-flow hydraulic actuators in heavy-duty off-highway machinery. In these applications, a spool-operated pilot stage is required to account for large flow force in the main hydraulic valve. Design optimization, performance improvement, and fault diagnosis of such complex two-stage servovalves often require sophisticated analytical models with accurate physical parameters. This paper presents a novel step-by-step methodology for nonlinear modeling, parameter determination, model validation, and performance evaluation of solenoid-controlled pilot-operated spool valves. The proposed model takes into account such nonlinearities as pilot spool dead band, spool friction, flow coefficient variability, and leakage. This new model is complete in the sense that all nonlinear interactions between various electromechanical elements have been incorporated in a compact yet comprehensive model. The simulation model accepts a command voltage to the solenoids as input and gives the second stage spool displacement as output. To obtain the physical parameters used in the valve model, a systematic approach is proposed based on state measurement and curve-fitting techniques. The identified parameters of an example valve were used in simulations both to validate the nonlinear valve model and also to assess the valve's performance when certain valve parameters change.

Accurate models of the machine under faulted conditions are developed using both fixed mesh and time-stepping finite element packages. Some known causes of inaccuracy between models and experimental data are accounted for and the results of the simulation are compared with those obtained from a laboratory test rig.

The motor is disconnected from the supply, and the induced voltage in the stator due to only rotor flux is utilized to detect the fault. If there is any broken bar, it will directly affect the induced voltages in the stator windings, Using this approach, the effects of source nonidealities (such as unbalance, presence of time harmonics, etc.) and nonlinearity of machine magnetizing characteristics due to saturation can be avoided.

It has been introduced as the Vienna monitoring method [1], [2]. Rotor bar faults cause an asymmetric magnetic flux pattern in the air gap, Thus, the current phasor (or voltage phasor at current-controlled machines), flux phasor, and air-gap torque differ from those of an ideal symmetric machine. The Vienna monitoring method compares the outputs of a reference model, which represents an ideal machine, to a measurement model. Observing the deviations of these two models makes it possible to detect and even locate rotor faults. It can be applied to inverter-fed machines as no frequency analysis is used. The method is verified by on-line experimental results from a digital signal processor (DSP)-controlled insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter drive. The findings match the outcomes of a detailed machine simulation. Air-gap flux density evaluation by a measurement coil system proves both the excellent sensitivity and fault location ability of the proposed scheme.

J	Das, D; Touba, NA				Das, D; Touba, NA			Synthesis of circuits with low-cost concurrent error detection based on Bose-Lin codes	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						concurrent error detection; self-checking circuits; Bose-Lin codes; sequential circuits; logic synthesis	DESIGNS	This paper presents a procedure for synthesizing sequential machines with concurrent error detection based on Bose-Lin codes. Bose-Lin codes are an efficient solution for providing concurrent error detection as they are separable codes and have a fixed number of check bits, independent of the number of information bits. Furthermore, Bose-Lin code checkers have a simple structure as they are based on modulo operations. Procedures are described for synthesizing circuits in a way that their structure ensures that all single-point faults can only cause errors that are detected by a Bose-Lin code. This paper presents an efficient scheme for concurrent error detection in sequential circuits with no constraint on the state encoding. Concurrent error detection for both the state bits and the output bits is based on a Bose-Lin code and their checking is combined such that one checker suffices. Results indicate low area overhead. The cost of concurrent error detection is reduced significantly compared to other methods based on other codes.

J	Joentgen, A; Mikenina, L; Weber, R; Zeugner, A; Zimmermann, HJ				Joentgen, A; Mikenina, L; Weber, R; Zeugner, A; Zimmermann, HJ			Automatic fault detection in gearboxes by dynamic fuzzy data analysis	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						cluster analysis; dynamic data analysis; automatic fault detection	NETWORKS	The main objective of machine diagnosis is the early recognition of mechanical defects in a machine, which is often referred to as preventive maintenance. This may result in the reduction of faults and higher machine availability. Preventive maintenance can be performed periodically in fixed time intervals, by demand due to machine faults, or continuously, depending on the state of a machine. To minimize maintenance and repair time, state-dependent maintenance of machines is usually applied. It assumes precise and reliable monitoring of machine's states, which is often provided by an expert who can distinguish malfunctions in operation from other changes in machine's states. In Fuzzy-Neuro Systems '98 - Computational Intelligence, pp. 98-105, and Int. J. Fuzzy Sets and Systems 105 (1999) 81-90, we have introduced a clustering method for dynamic objects, i.e., objects which are described by (time) trajectories of features. The aim of this paper is to show exemplarily that this method can be used for early recognition of changes in a machine's state and thus for automatic fault detection. Moreover, the method can be applied to automatic feature selection. A major advantage of this method is that it requires less expert knowledge than traditional approaches.

A new converter topology which connects coils two banks in parallel is proposed. The combination of multiple coils per phase and the converter circuit suggests improved operation under faults compared with conventional topologies, Output power per coil current under faults is studied by finite-element analysis and static torque measurement. Circuit equations under faults are derived and operation under faults is evaluated by simulation, An SRG controller is constructed and experiments are performed. The experimental results support the equations and simulation results. It is concluded that the SRG can continue generating operation, even when open- or short-circuited coil faults occur, with the proposed converter and proper fault detection circuits.

J	Tse, PW; Atherton, DP				Tse, PW; Atherton, DP			Prediction of machine deterioration using vibration based fault trends and recurrent neural networks	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								High market competition for sales requires companies to reduce the cost of production if they are to maintain their market shares. Since the cost of maintenance contributes a substantial portion of the production cost, companies must budget maintenance effectively. Machine deterioration prognosis can decrease the cost of maintenance by minimizing the loss of production due to machine breakdown and avoiding the overstocking of spare parts. A new prognostic method is described in this paper which has been developed to forecast the rate of machine deterioration using recurrent neural networks. From tests applying the method to the prediction of nonlinear sunspot activities and vibration based fault trends of several industrial machines, the results have shown that the method is promising. It not only evaluates the seriousness of damage caused by faults, but also forecasts the remaining life span of defective components.

J	Bossley, KM; Mckendrick, RJ; Harris, CJ; Mercer, C				Bossley, KM; Mckendrick, RJ; Harris, CJ; Mercer, C			Hybrid computed order tracking	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							INTERPOLATION	Vibration analysis is an integral part of modern condition monitoring and fault diagnosis systems for rotating machinery. Orders (cycles per revolution) are used as a frequency base for this analysis, thus making speed-related vibrations easier to detect. Fundamental to the performance of such systems is the accuracy and reliability of the required synchronously sampled vibration data. In this paper, the accuracy of three different synchronous sampling schemes are studied: a traditional hardware solution, computed order tracking and a hybrid of the two. Run-ups and run-downs are of particular interest in condition monitoring systems as they highlight many shaft defects. Also, because of the sometimes rapid shaft speed changes, this is just where the traditional approaches to producing synchronous sampling are prone to producing erroneous results. The three methods are assessed on data produced from a simulation of the rundown of a gas turbine shaft, typical to those found in the power industry. The use of this simulation allows the true accuracy of the techniques to be accessed, and inadequacies of traditional methods are clearly highlighted. The different sampling schemes rely on various interpolation algorithms. The accuracy and reliability of these algorithms is fundamental to the performance of the different sampling schemes, and hence a survey of the state-of-the-art interpolation algorithms is presented. This ensures that the most appropriate algorithms are identified, and as a result the novel computed order tracking technique introduced in this paper is shown to produce superior results.

Intensive research effort has been for sometime focused on the motor current signature analysis. This technique utilizes the results of spectral analysis of the staler current. Reliable interpretation of the spectra is difficult, since distortions of the current waveform caused by the abnormalities in the drive system are usually minute. In the present investigation, the frequency signature of some asymmetrical motor faults are well identified using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), leading to a better interpretation of the motor current spectra. Laboratory experiments indicate that the motor current signature FFT-based analysis, with the proposed approach, is still a reliable tool for induction motor asymmetrical faults detection.

J	Brown, ER; Reuben, RL; Neill, GD; Steel, JA				Brown, ER; Reuben, RL; Neill, GD; Steel, JA			Acoustic emission source discrimination using a piezopolymer based sensor	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						acoustic emission; NDT; source discrimination; sensor; AE	SAGNAC INTERFEROMETER; DIFFUSE WAVES; COMPOSITES; CAVITATION; PLATES	Extracting information about the nature and extent of machine and structural damage from the resultant acoustic emission signals is of considerable interest in developing machine condition monitoring systems. The extent to which acoustic emission source characterization can be practically applied to track machine operation and identify developing faults is examined by looking at both the time and frequency content of signals captured by a broadband acoustic emission sensor. The acoustic emission sensor is a piezopolymer based design developed as a foul cost rugged alternative to more common high fidelity sensors such as capacitance types or National Board of Standards (NBS) conical design. The response characteristics of the piezopolymer sensor are compared with a commercial piezoceramic transducer and a laser interferometer using pencil lend fracture and helium jet as sources of acoustic emission. The practical value of the polymer sensor is then evaluated in field tests examining fluid and mechanical generated acoustic Emission on a single stage centrifugal pump and a turbocharged diesel engine. The results suggest that the broad frequency response of the polymer based sensor can improve the identification of acoustic emission sources, thus avoiding the need for deconvolution of the raw acoustic emission signal. It is concluded that the piezopolymer sensor design offers a useful alternative to many of the acoustic emission transducers currently on the market for industrial use, with the additional benefit of broad-band response. The ability to use the new sensor to reveal detail in machine operating signatures and recognizable fault patterns in the frequency domain offers the potential to incorporate such features into a condition monitoring system with diagnostic capabilities.

The focus of the paper is on the application of the techniques, not on the underlying theory. Each technique is described briefly and is accompanied by a discussion on how it can be applied properly. The discussion is finished with an enumeration of the advantages and disadvantages of the technique. Two condition monitoring cases, taken from the marine engineering field, are explored: condition monitoring of a diesel engine, using only the torsional vibration of the crank shaft, and condition monitoring of a compression refrigeration plant, using many different sensors. Attention is also paid to the detection of sensor malfunction and to the user interface, The experience from the cases shows that all techniques are showing promising results and can be used to provide the operator with information about the monitored machinery on a higher level, The main problem remains the acquisition of the required knowledge, either from measured data or from analysis.

J	Li, HX; Zuo, MJ				Li, HX; Zuo, MJ			A hybrid approach for identification of root causes and reliability improvement of a die bonding process - a case study	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						bonding process; reliability improvement; fault tree; fault diagnosis		This paper presents an industrial case study on reliability improvement of the die bonding machine in the semiconductor industry. A hybrid approach combining dynamic analysis, process decomposition, and a structured fault tree was used to analyze the die bonding process. Firstly, the process was analyzed technically and decomposed into several stages according to different motions. Then, the die movement and force balance at each stage were analyzed according to physical laws, to identify the root causes of die rotation. A structured fault tree was then constructed to trace all possible causes and effects. A qualitative approach was used to identify critical events (root causes) for further analysis. Experiments were conducted to modify the bonding process to reduce the effects of the critical events. Finally, further process modification was proposed for simplification of the fault tree. This case study combined the knowledge in control and reliability engineering and presented a hybrid approach, which is very useful for practising engineers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Li, Y; Billington, S; Zhang, C; Kurfess, T; Danyluk, S				Li, Y; Billington, S; Zhang, C; Kurfess, T; Danyluk, S			Dynamic prognostic prediction of defect propagation on rolling element bearings (c)	TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Joint ASME/STLE Tribology Conference	OCT 25-29, 1998	TORONTO, CANADA	ASME, STLE		rolling element bearings	CRACK-PROPAGATION; ROLLER BEARING; FATIGUE; CONTACT	Rolling element bearing failure is a major factor in the failure of rotating machinery. Current methods of bearing condition monitoring focus on determining any existing fault presence on a bearing as early as possible. Although a defect can be detected when it is well below the industry standard of a fatal size of 6.25 mm(2) (0.01 in(2)) the remaining life of a bearing (the time it takes to reach the final failure size) from the point where a defect can be detected can vary substantially. As a fatal defect is detected, it is common to shut down machinery as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic consequences. Performing such an action, which usually occurs at inconvenient times, typically results in substantial time and economics losses. It is, therefore, important that the bearing's remaining life be more precisely forecasted, in a prognostic rather than diagnostic manner; so that maintenance can be optimally scheduled. Unfortunately current bearing remaining life prediction methods have not been well developed due to the highly stochastic nature of the bearing fatigue process. This paper presents an adaptive bearing condition prognostic method that addresses the deficiency in current bearing remaining life prediction. In this paper; vibration and acoustic emission techniques are used to estimate defect severity by monitoring signals generated by a defective-bearing. A spall defect propagation process model is developed. Through the propagation model, in coupling with a defect diagnostic model, a recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is instituted to adaptively predict the defect growth rate. Results from numerical simulations and experimental bearing life tests are presented to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive prognostic scheme.

In situ hybridization has detected this serpin exclusively in the myoepithelial cells on the normal and noninvasive mammary epithelial side of the basement membrane and thus was named myoepithelium-derived serine proteinase inhibitor (MEPI), No MEPI expression was detected in the malignant breast carcinomas. MEPI encodes a 405-aa precursor, including an 18-residue secretion signal with a calculated molecular mass of 46 kDa, The predicted sequence of the new protein shares 33% sequence identity and 58% sequence similarity to plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) I and PAI-2. To determine whether MEPI can modulate the in vivo growth and progression of human breast cancers, we transfected a full-length MEPI cDNA into human breast cancer cells and studied the orthotopic growth of MEPI-transfected vs. control clones in the mammary fat pad of athymic nude mice. Overexpression of MEPI inhibited the invasion of the tells in the in vitro invasion assay. When injected orthotopically into nude mice, the primary tumor volumes, axillary lymph node metastasis, and lung metastasis were significantly inhibited in MEPI-transfected clones as compared with controls. The expression of MEPI in myoepithelial cells may prevent breast cancer malignant progression leading to metastasis.

The measuring method used is the twin-signal sensing method, where pulses are injected into each terminal of the. rotor, The reflected signals are subtracted to produce a signature signals that contains information about the rotor's state, The signature signals are! sampled and accepted or rejected as valid based on an outlier detection criteria, Novelty detection is applied to the accepted signals. The current signature signal is compared to a range of signature signals taken when the rotor was known. to. be free of shorts, If the current signature signal strays too far from the known healthy signal, the signature signal is 'novel' and the possibility of a short is declared. The method was tested on a running test rotor with voltage excitation, A comparison of methods shows that an elliptical novelty grouping algorithm gives highly accurate results.

J	Smith, ML; Smith, G; Hill, T				Smith, ML; Smith, G; Hill, T			Gradient space analysis of surface defects using a photometric stereo derived bump map	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						bump mapping; gradient space; surface defects	INSPECTION	An innovative method has been developed for the quantification of the surface quality of Lambertian component materials, while in the presence of a complex coincident albedo pattern. The technique uses a generic lighting configuration and is insensitive to component object pose. This is of considerable advantage for the relaxation of environmental structuring during on-line component inspection. A two-stage inspection strategy is proposed, consisting of an initial global surface assessment, together with the subsequent classification of segmented surface defect features. The technique has particular application for the detection of characteristic surface faults, such as indentations, protrusions or missing surface topology, typical of a range of manufacturing processes, including injection moulding, machining and stone polishing. The technique has been validated using a variety of flat and curved specimen components. Experimental results are presented in the paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The method is based on the conventional adaptive noise cancelling (ANC) technique principle; it varies the main signal input and reference signal input. Since the main and reference inputs signals are collected at different times, this method is called asynchronous adaptive noise cancelling (AANC). It can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, as in the case of the detecting bearing faults when vibration signals of machinery are collected under low-frequency noise condition. In combination with AANC, statistical analysis, enveloping spectrum analysis techniques are used for detection of bearing fault and diagnosis. Experimental result has shown that these techniques can be made more effective only after AANC has reduced the background noise from the diagnostic signals.

As a result, prognostic models form an integral part of a number of systems supporting these tasks. Furthermore, prognostic models constitute instruments to evaluate the quality of health care and the consequences of health care policies by comparing predictions according to care norms with actual results. Approaches to developing prognostic models vary from using traditional probabilistic techniques, originating from the field of statistics, to more qualitative and model-based techniques, originating from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, various approaches to constructing prognostic models, with emphasis on methods from the field of AI, are described and compared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This problem is even more difficult for domain-independent fault-detection and recovery since most such method; are based on a format analysis of the global state set. This paper presents a domain-independent fault isolation, detection and recovery method for object-based control systems based on constraints of the object architecture. Variations of the central behavior from normal cases are detected using a fuzzy state machine approach.

Good preprocessing reduces the noise in the data and retains most information needed for classification. Poor preprocessing on the other hand can make classification almost impossible. In this paper we evaluate several feature extraction methods in a special type of outlier detection problem, machine fault detection. We will consider measurements on water pumps under both normal and abnormal conditions. We use a novel data description method, called the Support Vector Data Description, to get an indication of the complexity of the normal class in;this data set and how well it is expected to be distinguishable from the abnormal data.

The results showed that either partial or entire aiding approach could improve the performance significantly, and were was no significant difference between the partial aid and the entire aid. However, there was a significant effect of the level of aiding on the transitions of diagnostic strategy. These results revealed that with a direct and short information aiding, one could save diagnostic time and test steps. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

In particular, the paper concentrates upon what we call unwanted situations. These are problems which are time-consuming and troublesome to solve but not necessarily critical. The experience gained from solving such problems is often an unused resource. A case-based reasoning approach is suggested to store operator experience and knowledge concerning these situations. When an unwanted problem occurs, it is then related to the stored experience. In the initial phase, the approach focuses on acquiring knowledge from operators to describe the situation and later on, to include the human operator in the matching procedure.

J	Ray, A; Phoha, S				Ray, A; Phoha, S			Stochastic modeling of fatigue crack damage for information-based maintenance	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						stochastic modeling; predictive maintenance; fatigue crack damage	GROWTH; DYNAMICS	The concept of information-based maintenance is that of updating decisions for inspection, repair, and maintenance scheduling based on evolving knowledge of operation history and anticipated usage of the machinery as well as the physics and dynamics of material degradation in critical components. This paper presents a stochastic model of fatigue crack damage in metallic structures for application to information-based maintenance of operating machinery. The information on operation history allows the stochastic model to predict the current state of damage, and the information on anticipated usage of the machinery facilitates forecasting the remaining service life based on the stress level to which the critical components are likely to be subjected. The Karhunen-Loeve expansion for nonstationary processes is utilized for formulating the stochastic model which generates the crack length statistics in the setting of a two-parameter lognormal distribution. Hypothesis tests are built upon the (conditional) probability density function of crack damage that does not require the solution of stochastic differential equations in either Wiener integral or Ito integral settings. Consequently, structural damage and remaining life of stressed components can be predicted to make maintenance decisions in real time. The damage model is verified by comparison with experimental data of fatigue crack statistics for 2024-T3 and 7075-T6 aluminum alloys. Examples are presented to demonstrate how this concept can be applied to hypothesis testing and remaining life prediction.

To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring - both characteristic for survival data - we propose a weighting technique that lessens the impact of data from patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times. A case study on prostate cancer recurrence shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside or even out perform modem statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data.

From domestic tools up to the automotive industry, there is an enormous number of possible applications. The pressures imposed by the market have led to the development of new strategies capable of answering the required demands. Neural networks have revealed high potential in a wide range of situations and have been successfully applied in fault detection and diagnosis systems. In this paper we intend to clarify, in part, the different diagnostic methodologies and, on the other hand, we suggest a neural network approach for monitoring the plastic injection moulding process. Future work will use the developed neural monitoring scheme for process fault diagnosis with the aim of industrial quality management.

Fault models based on operational errors of the concurrent system are considered. It is shown that tests that have been constructed from a model of a Mazurkiewicz trace machine are complete for the fault models introduced here and an: substantially shorter than tests that are obtained from a composite model, given the same fault model. Scenarios for test execution and the architecture of testers of concurrent systems are discussed.

They are needed as input information for a condition-based predictive maintenance strategy, for process optimisation or even for the identification of vibrations, for example torsional vibrations of the drive train, that may reduce the quality of the product. The structure of a computer-aided machine monitoring system is described with a focal point on a new torque measuring device that is based on strain gage technology. It fulfils the aggravated requirements in rolling mill applications. Some objects of examination and brief results of monitoring activities illustrate the benefit of permanent machine monitoring in rolling mills. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

Such messages tend to generate in large quantities and difficult and time consuming to interpret manually. This paper presents the design and development of a case-based reasoning system for diagnosing locomotive faults using such fault messages as input. The process of using historical repair data and expert input for case generation and validation is described. An algorithm for case matching is presented along with some results on pilot data.

Sensor data is collected and used to indirectly model the equipment. Due to the short response times required it is important to investigate robust sensor data representation schemes. Traditional Fourier Analysis is not sufficient to preserve the information in both frequency and time domains. In this paper we describe the use of wavelets, both continuous and discrete, for equipment diagnosis and prognosis. We detail wavelet-based techniques for gear fault diagnosis and prognosis.

The first system is an online vibration monitoring system with quality- and maintenance-related diagnostic functions. It perfectly fits the needs of the metal producing (e.g. rolling mills) and the paper industry. The second monitoring tool is a torque measuring and analysing system. It is designed for heavy drive trains and supports predictive maintenance strategies and process control. Several examples of the operation of the systems in practice confirm their effectiveness.

In this paper, an approach into vibration monitoring for pumps in the waste water industry is presented. Southern Water Services Limited is the largest water company in South England and has over 4,000 operation sites. A vibration data acquisition system is established for the pumps and motors in one of Southern Water's pumping stations with the aim to develop a complete predictive maintenance strategy using on-line vibration monitoring. The original tests are carried out for the pump shaft bearings and motor bearings only. More measuring points are installed later on according to the British Standard for pump vibration testing. The acquired data are processed and analysed in both the time and frequency domain. The bearing defect frequencies can be related to the machine running speed by analysis in the frequency domain. Since there is no historic information about the machines, and data has only been collected over a relatively short time period, accurate prediction can be made after more data is available.

A machine tool utilisation rate can be improved by an advanced condition-monitoring system using modem sensor and signal processing techniques and especially the number of unwanted stoppages during the unmanned operation can be removed with a reliable tool monitoring system. An expert system for automated diagnosis of tool wear was built using a new approach. In this approach the faults are described in a fault tree database and the corresponding features of condition-monitoring signals together with the machine status information are described in a symptom tree database. Using a rule synthesiser program the information gathered in the databases is automatically converted to expert system code. The knowledge needed for selecting the best sensors and signal processing methods for the expert system has been gathered from cutting tests and an analysis program for indirect tool wear measurement.

We provide some background to the previous work in this area, and describe a decision support tool, the Vibration Case Library, which uses Case-Based Reasoning technology. The objective of the system is to help practicing engineers access similar cases while attempting to diagnose actual hod potential faults on machines. Often engineers have only limited expertise in Vibration Analysis, and hence will find such an automated assistant attractive. However, implementing CBR in an ill-structured domain is no trivial matter, and this paper also provides background to various implementation issues encountered.

A brief summary on the theory is presented, followed by a description of some practical applications. Some experimental results are given comparing the classification results of higher derivatives with acceleration signals. In these applications the quality of the input features for a fuzzy pattern classifier is significantly higher if the feature calculation is based on a higher derivative of the time signal than on the original measured acceleration signal. The improvement of feature quality results in a lower rate of misclassification of four different fault classes for the task of early fault detection of roller bearings.

The knowledge base was developed using experience together with experimental and calculated results from modelling of fault states of the rotor system. The developed fault diagnose system was verified using a variety of case studies with measured vibration data from test rigs and from operating machines with documented faults. Results from the MATRIX programme showed good agreement with modelled faults on test rigs, and with the faults detected in practice.

Integrated artificial intelligence techniques are to provide information on the condition of a wide range of rotating plant. Data acquired from the plant is extensive and the artificial intelligence system development is critically dependent upon the data fed from the plant to the computer. The techniques to be described exploit several different modelling approaches, these being artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and rule based approaches. The diagnosis of the state of health of,the machine in question is performed by combination of the outputs from one or more of the previously mentioned techniques. This approach is believed to provide a more accurate level of fault detection and in addition provide a level of confidence for each diagnosis provided.

However, one of the main problems faced when using ANNs is how to select the optimal set of inputs for the ANN, allowing the creation of compact, highly accurate networks that require comparatively little pre-processing. This paper examines the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select the most significant input features from a large set of possible features in machine condition monitoring contexts. Using a large set of 156 different features, the GA is able to select a set of 6 features that give 100% classification accuracy.

One area that has benefited from this approach is that of the detection, measurement and identification of partial electrical discharges (PDs). Their interpretation is of importance as it can be an indicator of the ageing of the insulation as well as being an aggressive ageing agent itself. A satisfactory statistical analysis technique has been developed and used, both in the laboratory and on site, to examine/interpret PD measurements and present the results in a simple form showing the most probable fault/s or defect/s responsible for them. The technique is being incorporated to StatorMONITOR, an existing on-line PD measuring system for electrical machines, developed and used by Eleco Dowding & Mills (1). This paper presents and discusses results from practical applications and assesses their future usefulness with particular reference to the practising engineer.

The development of this system is based on four sequential steps: the development of simple but realistic Finite Element models based on dynamic simulations of the complete system, the monitoring of the real turbocharger, the accurate modelling of the foundations and the excitation from the main engine. In the fourth step possible faults of the machine are identified using the Artificial Neural Networks. In this way we can take advantage of the Artificial Neural Networks learning capability for the real time diagnosis of potential faults.

This paper investigates neural fuzzy-systems to support these processes, For the generation of patterns in the form of fuzzy rules it is necessary that an expert gives the linguistic terms of the chosen variables. For the validation of the generated rules the prognosis results are compared, which were achieved on the one hand by expert-formulated rules and on the other hand by rules generated by the neural fuzzy-system. The generated rules show a clearly better decision behaviour for a special problem in the breast cancer prognosis than the expert rules. An optimization for unsymmetrical costs is still to be made.

Transmission problem is characterized by high bandwidth vibration signals and oil analyze data which allow one to diagnose a wide variety of failures from relative few measurements. Unfortunately, viable simulation models do not exist for these systems and fault diagnosis cannot be solved by conventional approaches. Fault diagnosis encompasses a diverse collection of technologies and disciplines such as expert system, neural networks, fuzzy logic, machine learning. The key issue for all of these approaches is finding an effective representation for use in converting raw data to features, reasoning with these features and making recommendations consistent with the uncertainty in the measurements. In this project, neural networks and data fusion technology are introduced in the application of transmission system fault diagnosis.

A conceptual approach to combine the oil and vibration feature data is reviewed and discussed. The methodology requires the correlation of failure mode phenomena with appropriate features in controlled transitional tests that reflect the evolution of machine failures. The Mechanical Diagnostics Test Bed described herein was designed and built to provide a means to acquire such transitional data for gearboxes. A series of tests with collected data from accelerometers, temperature, torque, speed, and oil debris measurements in cooperation with NRL, has been conducted. With in-situ inspection, the tests allowed the correlation of processed features with damage assessment as it occurred. Methods to fuse non-commensurate vibration and oil features are explored for the potential to provide better estimation of failure mode identification and severity. The identification of specific feature vectors to track damage and provide prognostic precursors are also discussed. Collecting the data and developing algorithms in this manner will help to accelerate advances in CBM.

Condition-based maintenance (CBM) will require advanced tools to enable reliable and accurate detection of evolving faults at an early stage, diagnosis to the subsystem or component level, and prognosis of the remaining useful life of components. Several important questions are raised along this transition to CBM. How do we quantify and compare proposed techniques for failure mode diagnosis? With the desire for modular, open systems for health assessment and the large list of potential technology providers, acquisition offices require metrics of performance and effectiveness. How do we reduce false alerts to the operator/maintainer? Fusion of operational context into the diagnosis can reduce false alarms. Development of this capability will require that existing diagnostic data sets be augmented with operational data. This paper describes a program to collect operational data sets and evaluate diagnostic performance of a variety of technology providers addressing questions one and two. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Navy Repair Technology (REPTECH) program supported the effort. The REPTECH project has instrumented one H-46 aft transmission for initial trials and flight check with successful results. Plans are to proceed with full squadron operation and posting of data.

HUMS systems generate information at a rate and volume many order's of magnitude above existing fault detection systems, making the development of new methods necessary to effectively integrate and present the information in a timely, useful, and readily interpretable manner. This requires us to have a thorough understanding of aircrew information requirements for managing mechanical fault situations. This paper discusses the need for an aircrew interface to HUMS, provides an overview of the problem of developing interfaces to fault diagnosis systems, and presents our work to date.

Data collected by only one condition monitoring parameter are, sometimes, insufficient to achieve effective assessment of the condition of a machine due to its limited ability to cover the required information and the inherent uncertainty in the acquired data. The problem addressed in this paper, is how to keep availability, quality, and productivity at high levels through utilizing a common database, i.e. integrating the database of condition-based maintenance system with the main plant IT-system, for an innovative expert system. It was found that most research is focused on tool and process monitoring, using various types of condition monitoring parameters, to predict tool wear and tool life. Intelligent manufacturing systems techniques, e.g. Expert System, Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks, are being used to integrate and interpret data from multiple sensors. But less attention was devoted to the development of integrated condition monitoring systems, which enable the user to evaluate a multi-variant system based on the data collected from, e.g. maintenance, quality, production and accountancy. The major conclusion is that; using an innovated expert system, based on a common database having better data coverage and quality, and a continuously improved knowledge base with intelligent inference engine, one can enhance the reliability of data, certainty of decision making, remove the redundancy in the monitoring system, and allow the user to detect and eliminate reasons behind variations through effective diagnosis and prognosis. This leads to continuous improvement in quality, productivity and availability at a reduced cost, and improved effectiveness of the manufacturing system.

Competitive engine-sales campaigns driven by contractor support or power-by-the-hour agreements place the emphasis for ownership cost onto the equipment supplier. This situation is mirrored in the defence sector where reductions in equipment life cycle cost and improvements to weapon system availability and readiness are key customer stated requirements. These economic and operational business pressures, combined with the continuous drive for improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness have focused the attention of Rolls-Royce. The unequivocal need for advanced engine-system diagnostics has been realised and development of sophisticated engine health monitoring (EHM) technology is now underway. This paper describes one such technology; JetSCAN**, that possesses generic capability for aero-engine oil-system diagnosis and offers the potential for achieving reliable machine health prognosis. JetSCAN represents state-of-the-art in off-line condition diagnostic technology and offers laboratory standard without the need for highly skilled expertise. JetSCAN is powerful, intelligent and affordable - a valuable advancement in 21(st) Century EHM capability.

This change is promoted because recent developments in lubricant related condition monitoring has progressed from a crude general indicator of machine health, to a science where accurate diagnostic and prognostic indications can be made. The condition monitoring capability combined with a co-ordinated maintenance approach allows advanced tribological capabilities to make a significant contribution to the efficiency and reliability of mechanical plant, where there is immediate payback and great long term investment potential.									*DEL, 1992, MAINT PRACT TECHN; FOGEL AG, P TRIB 90; FOGEL AG, P TRIB 88; FOGEL AG, 1989, NEXT DECADE; FOGEL G, 1993, PROACTIVE CONTAMINAT; FOGEL G, 1990 MAINT MAN CONV; *FOGEL G, 1992, SA MECH ENG      SEP; Neale M, 1979, GUIDE CONDITION MONI; NICHOLLS C, 1991, COST EFFECTIVE CONDI; *SOAP, G FOG SAIT WORKSH CO	10	0	0	0	0	COXMOOR PUBLISHING CO	CHIPPING NORTON	PO BOX 72, CHIPPING NORTON OX7 6JU, ENGLAND			1-901892-11-5				1999							507	514					8	Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering; Materials Science	BW24V	WOS:000181333700046					2022-02-14

Plant such as power generators, letter sorters and food processing equipment are all indicative of the types of machinery that generate diverse, inter-related condition indicators. Whilst many of these measures can be processed by expensive focussed systems, no currently available system is able to provide a comprehensive analysis of all of a machines parameters and present this information in a coherent and useful manner. This can inhibit a plant manager's ability to make correct maintenance decisions. This paper describes an aspect of the NEURAL-MAINE project, which is developing a modular approach utilising Smart Technologies, Data Fusion and multiple sensor technologies, allowing for a comprehensive On-line monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, and focuses on the Concentrator element of the system. This is primarily concerned with the development of a dynamic Case Based Reasoning approach to fault diagnosis.

The APEmille SIMD machine, a project of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) of Italy, was offered as a test bed for a self-diagnosis strategy based on a comparison model. Because of the general machine architecture and some design constraints, the standard assumptions of the existing diagnosis models are not completely fulfilled by the diagnosis support built in;APEmille. This circumstance led to the development of a specific diagnostic model derived from the PMC and comparison models. The new model introduces the concept of direction-related and direction-independent faults. The consistency of this model with the APEmille architecture is discussed, and possible fault scenarios which ate particularly critical for the correctness of the diagnosis are examined. It is shown that the limited hardware redundancy, extended with simple functional tests, is sufficient for obtaining valid diagnosis with the presented model.

It implements true link-layer multicast, and offers a natural match to support network-layer QoS protocols such as RSVP. Because real-time performance guarantees fundamentally require slate to be installed inside the network, link/switch failures could lead to significant disruption to the QoS promised to the user applications. This paper describes the fault detection and recovery mechanism supported by the EtheReal architecture, and reports on the performance measurements of the initial prototype implementation. The heart of EtheReal's fault detection and recovery mechanism is a fast spanning tree reconfiguration algorithm to induce the total fault recovery time, and a delayed link inactivation scheme that allows real-time connections which are not affected by the failed links/switches to continue to exist, even though some of the links are marked as "blocked" in the new spanning tree topology. Measurements on the prototype show that the fault detection and recovery lime on a network whose diameter is 10 hops are 220ms and 31 ms, respectively. This combined delay corresponds to a minor jitter in real-time audio/video communication, and is a significant improvement over the standard IEEE 802. id implementation, which takes on the order of 30 sec.

The fault detection and the fault localization problems are strongly related issues. The easiness of diagnostics can be seen as a criteria of testability, it is in fact characterized by specific requirements at the design level. In this paper, we will make a clear link between these two issues and we will study the influence of some testability factors on the diagnostic activity. We will present our results and hints on "diagnosablility" in the context of finite stare machine model.				abder.ghedamsi@fst.rnu.tn		Karoui, Kamel/0000-0003-2507-9571			BENNETTS RG, 1994, J IEEE DESIGN TEST C; Chow T.

The knowledge about fault mode behavior of an induction motor drive system is extremely important from the standpoint of improved system design, protection, and fault-tolerant control, This paper addresses the application of motor current spectral analysis for the detection and localization of abnormal electrical and mechanical conditions that indicate, or may lead to, a failure of induction motors. Intensive research effort has been for some time focused on the motor current signature analysis. This technique utilizes the results of spectral analysis of the stator current. Reliable interpretation of the spectra is difficult since distortions of the current waveform caused by the abnormalities in the induction motor are usually minute. This paper takes the initial step to investigate the efficiency of current monitoring for diagnostic purposes. The effects of stator current spectrum are described and the related frequencies determined. In the present investigation, the frequency signature of some asymmetrical motor faults are well identified using advanced signal processing techniques, such as high-resolution spectral analysis. This technique leads to a better interpretation of the motor current spectra, In fact, experimental results clearly illustrate that stator current high-resolution spectral analysis is very sensitive to induction motor faults modifying main spectral components, such as voltage unbalance and single-phasing effects.

The active magnetic balancing comprises an integral electronic switch for winding segregation using either thyristors, MCTs or IGBTs. The system also comprises a virtual instrument based winding fault detection system including means for classification and identification of winding faults. The fault detection system controls the triggering of the electronic switch forming programmable, segmented primary windings. Each phase is grouped into sub-phases which are individually switched into or out of the excitation supply or load on a sub-cycle interval during the deenergization sequence, The internal fault detection system is able to isolate selected segments of the stator responsive to the level of stator faults detected and derive the mode with the lowest acoustic signature. This uses a spatial attenuation pattern of airgap radial flux established for each stator. A design example is shown for a 40 Megawatt PM propulsion motor. Test results are shown for a 300 HP, 480 Volt drive motor and a 500 kW linear induction catapult motor.

Like adjustable speed drives, fault prognosis has become almost indispensable. The manufacturers of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to decrease machine down time and improve salability. Prodigious improvement in signal processing hardware and software has made this possible. Primarily, these techniques depend upon locating specific harmonic components in the line current, also known as motor current signal analysis (MCSA). These harmonic components are usually different for different types of faults. However with multiple faults or different varieties of drive schemes, MCSA can become an onerous task as different types of faults and time harmonics may end up generating similar signatures. Thus other signals such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing the different types of fault and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes, will not be entirely out of place.

Prior to the implementation of the infrared scanning sensors, the common belief was that preceding a turn insulation failure, while there may be some arcing within the winding and the pyrolyzing of insulation(1), there was no significant detectable evidence of turn insulation degradation until it's too late. Even if the minute electrical discharges or pyrolysis particles were detected, there was no way to determine the location of the impending fault using these conventional methods; so the obvious result was an unexpected failure. With this paper, we will to show that, at least on large salient pole machines, there is forewarning of an impending turn insulation failure that can be detected and located in time to allow for repair before a failure damages the coil and core.

Early detection of incipient fault in machinery can provide a significant improvement in plant economy and reduce operational and maintenance costs and improves the level of safety. This paper investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in two stage industrial helical gearbox to detect the localized fault by using vibration signal. The vibration signal obtained from gearbox was first synchronously averaged and then divided into several segments which each segment represents one rotation of the gear. These segmented signals were then successively stored as columns of a matrix to form actual matrix for PCA analysis. The results from the PCA are then used in Q-statistic and T-2-statistic to calculate the change between normal and fault conditions. It is shown that the PCA with averaged vibration data can detect incipient local fault in very early stage, such as 10 % of tooth breakage. It was also found that this statistical diagnostic tool is very sensitive to small fault advancement.

The characteristics of helical gear vibration are studied in associating with the variation of meshing stiffness, gear errors and tooth faults. Based on the representation and linear fault progression model, a varying-time-frequency distribution (VTFD) is developed in order to highlight the smaller changes in SPWVD, The VTFD analysis of vibration signals permits both fault detection and location as early as 10 percent of single tooth face width reduction. Tn addition, a modified Euclidean distance is also introduced for automatic interpretation of SPWVD and quantitative description of fault.

Monitoring of such machines is notoriously difficult because they rarely fail, and often access for monitoring is restricted. However the importance of CM is crucial in order to reduce plant downtime, and to be able to guarantee reliability. This paper looks at approaches designed to detect the development of various electrical, mechanical, and environmental faults. Approaches such as flux and acoustic monitoring, model-based diagnosis, and thermography are examined. Particular attention is given to the non-intrusive methods of vibration and per-phase current monitoring. Finally the importance of on-line CM systems is explained, along with a brief description of the future role CM has to play in the detection of electric motor fault development.

Applying the bispectral analysis to the time signals obtained from the sensors placed on the rotor gives information corresponding to their spectral analysis. Diagnostic methods based on Fourier analysis can therefore be replaced by bispectral analysis. A brief review of the properties of bispectra is presented. Most emphasis is placed on the ability of bispectra to extract diagnostic information from fault signals. Furthermore, by use of the algorithm of bispectra, two kind of typical mechanical faults are analyzed. Results show that bispectral analysis is a more efficient method in machinery diagnosis compared with FFT-based spectral analysis.

In the Condition Monitoring (CM) role the principal source mechanisms are impacts and friction. The extreme sensitivity of the AE technique to these processes and the dynamic nature of the signal makes it a very sensitive indicator of the presence and evolution of machine fault conditions in addition to offering a means of probing the dynamics of the processes involved. One of the consequences of the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) of AE compared to the more traditional vibration technique has been the development of CM instrumentation that is simpler to use and easier to interpret.

J	Mehta, SV; Uzsoy, R				Mehta, SV; Uzsoy, R			Predictable scheduling of a single machine subject to breakdowns	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article							SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY; RELEASE DATES; MODELS; TIMES	The predictive production schedule has two important functions; allocating shop resources to the different jobs to optimize some measure of shop performance and serving as a basis for planning activities such as material procurement, preventive maintenance and delivery of orders to external or internal customers. This schedule is modified during execution on the occurrence of disruptions such as machine breakdowns. The schedule modification process may delay or render infeasible the execution of activities planned on the basis of the predictive schedule. Thus it is of interest to develop predictive schedules which can absorb disruptions without affecting planned activities while maintaining high shop performance. A predictable scheduling approach is presented, where the predictive schedule is built with such objectives. The effects of disruptions on planned activities are measured by the difference between planned and realized job completion times. The specific scheduling model considered is minimizing maximum lateness (Lmax) on a single machine with dynamic job arrivals and random machine breakdowns. It is shown that predictable scheduling provides high predictability with minor sacrifices in realized schedule performance.

J	Palau, A; Velo, E; Puigjaner, L				Palau, A; Velo, E; Puigjaner, L			Use of neural networks and expert systems to control a gas/solid sorption chilling machine	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REFRIGERATION-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DU FROID			English	Article						absorption; refrigeration; chemical reaction; expert systems	CHEMICAL HEAT-PUMPS; SOLID-GAS REACTIONS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	This works focuses on using neural networks and expert systems to control a gas/solid sorption chilling machine. In such systems, the cold production changes cyclically with time due to the batchwise operation of the gas/solid reactors. The accurate simulation of the dynamic performance of the chilling machine has proven to be difficult for standard computers when using deterministic models. Additionally, some model parameters dynamically change with the reaction advancement. A new modelling approach is presented here to simulate the performance of such systems using neural networks. The backpropagation learning rule and the sigmoid transfer function have been applied in feedforward, full connected, single hidden layer neural networks. Overall control of this system is divided in three blocks: control of the machine stages, prediction of the machine performance and fault diagnosis.

In particular, attention is focused on measurements of vertical stresses during plasma disruptions. The strategy is based on a neural model which estimates suitable features of the expected sensor response, allowing to isolate the most frequently occurring faults. The proposed strategy has been validated at JET, the Joint European Torus, on several disruptions, and is currently used for fault detection purposes, providing great accuracy in detecting sensor faults, together with a high degree of automation.

Recently, It is not only being further perfected in theory bur also produced a lot of good instruments by means of traditional performance parameter test method. Vibration noise test method oil-fluid analysis method and other. rest technology is attained good application in some aspects. But existing test diagnosis method is difficult to realized on-line test of engine technological status. As is known to all, it will lead to reduce resistance of lubricating oil path and oil pressure, because of wear of engine inside operating surface and appearance of inside interval. For attaining identical oil pressure with new engine, pu,np must be provided more oil to wear system in ol del to increase flow rate. So we may assess engine technological status, by means of monitoring engine speed, lubricating oil pressure and flow rate. This paper is bases on analyzing development and present situation of fault diagnosis and test technology of engine at home and abroad, by way of studying relationship between three parameters of engine speed, lubricating oil pressure, flow rate and engine technology state.

This paper proposes a remaining life adaptation methodology based on mechanistic modeling and parameter tuning. Vibration measurement is used to estimate defect severity by monitoring the signals generated from rotating bearings. Through a defect propagation model and defect diagnostic model, an adaptive algorithm is developed to fine tune the parameters involved in the propagation model by comparing predicted and measured defect sizes. In this manner, the instantaneous rate of defect propagation can be captured despite defect growth behavior variation. Therefore, a precise estimation of the remaining life can be determined. Simulations and experimental results are presented to illustrate the implementation principles and to verify the applicability of the adaptive prognostic methodology. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

J	Liu, B; Ling, SF				Liu, B; Ling, SF			On the selection of informative wavelets for machinery diagnosis	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							REPRESENTATION	A new method of machinery fault diagnosis based on wavelet analysis is presented. We introduce an extension to Mallat and Zhang's matching pursuit for machinery diagnosis is presented. Instead of the 'best matching' criterion, a mutual information measure is used to search a redundant wavelet dictionary for a small set of wavelets that carry meaningful information about machinery faults. With these informative wavelets treated as feature extractors, this approach effectively facilitates the diagnosis of machinery faults of a non-stationary nature. This method has been applied to the detection of diesel engine malfunctions. The results show that both the sensitivity and the reliability of this approach are good. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

This paper describes the theory and structure of such networks. A method for initialising hyperellipsoids and a training algorithm based on the standard backpropagation algorithm are proposed. Utilising the properties of bounded generalisation and extrapolation inherent in such networks, a Hierarchical Diagnostic Artificial Neural Network (HDANN) based on the ellipsoidal unit network is put forward with respect to simultaneous diagnosis of multiple faults on rotating machines, which consists of several subnetworks and aims at dividing a large pattern space into several smaller subspaces. The subnetworks can be trained in subspaces respectively and the whole network is capable of simultaneous diagnosis of multiple faults. Finally, typical fault data from rotating machines are tested in the network. The research results show that HDANN can obtain more accurate and efficient diagnostic results and is useful for real-time condition monitoring and on-line diagnosis of rotating machines.

The voltage stress due to the fast switching devices in voltage source inverters often leads to a failure of the interturn isolation and as a consequence to winding short circuits. This paper describes a simulation model to investigate the influence of stator faults due to inter-turn short-circuits as well as open windings on the operation of an inverter fed induction machine. Based on the simulation results a new method of stator fault detection is presented and analysed reference to its range of operation. This method utilises the behaviour of a current control loop which ensures symmetric stator currents even in the case of a stator fault. By evaluating the stator and the rotor equation of the induction motor the stator current space phasor can be reconstructed and compared with its actually measured value. Thus a signal can be obtained to detect machine faults. All the signals necessary to apply the proposed method to fault detection are already available in today's controlled induction motor drives. So the inverter and control electronics can be used to integrate the fault detection method into the inverter. Practical measurements are presented to verify the simulation results.

Vibration analysis methods for all rotating machinery, oil analysis for both lubricated parts and transformers, wear particle analysis, acoustic leak detection, and loose parts monitoring are commonplace. But what about the controls and instrumentation arena? Smart positioners/actuators are part of the answer. They can tell us that stroke times are different or something is sticking, and therefore some level of maintenance is in order. Smart transmitters and new sensing technologies allow those devices to hold their calibration longer. But how does one know when it is time to re-calibrate the sensor? When does an RTD or thermocouple and/or it's signal converter begin to drift? When did the steam temperature controls start to behave sub-optimally? If you perform the maintenance too early, you waste maintenance dollars. If you do it too late, you could be running off normal and not realize it, which in turn wastes operation dollars. There are hundreds of controllers and sensors to be maintained (thousands in a large facility), so guessing wrong can waste a lot of O&M dollars. This paper will explore new technology that finally allows the science of predictive maintenance to lend it's benefits to the field of controls and instrumentation.

The methodology consists of calculating Daubechies' 20-order (DAUB-20) mean-square dilation WTs of the data, and then selecting predominant wavelet coefficients distributed to certain levels of these WTs as inputs to ANNs for pattern recognition. The test results show that a fairly small sized backpropagation network trained with a reasonably small number of training sets can detect and classify various types or degrees of failures occurring on a spur gear pair successfully.

In particular the paper outlines the utilization of axis tachometer feedback signals as a means of monitoring the cutting process of a computer numerical control vertical milling machine. The work describes how a fault signature, corresponding to a tool breakage, can be identified in the axis tachometer signals at varying feed rates. The results of the preliminary testing of a monitoring system utilizing existing axis feed drive signals are presented. The paper then outlines steps being taken to develop the application of the method to an increased range of cutting conditions. This work was based upon a study of the interrelationship between the axis control signals when cutting is proceeding in either the X- or the Y-axis direction, and when both the X axis and the Y axis are feeding simultaneously.

These are extremely important components of the paper machine as they are responsible for guiding the paper through the press nips. Any deterioration in the felts may result in paper breakage and machine shut-downs with a resulting fall in productivity. The need for tighter control of the manufacturing process is thus the main motivation for this work. The system developed makes use of spectral analysis of the raw vibration signals. This involves the technique of acceleration enveloping for isolating the spectral components that reflect the process defects. Since visual examination of the spectra for detecting subtle changes in the early stages is both difficult and impractical, a peak detection algorithm has been designed. Its purpose is to extract the relevant features from each spectrum. These are then fed into a neural network classifier for discriminating between the fault and the no-fault conditions. The system is demonstrated to be successful for detecting felt deterioration in its early stages when assessed on industrial data. Other benefits include the ease of on-line implementation and its possible extension to a wide range of mechanical and rotating equipment.

J	Martin, KF; Marzi, MH				Martin, KF; Marzi, MH			Diagnostics of a coolant system via neural networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural networks; coolant system; diagnostics; novel faults		The application of a neural network (NN) to diagnose faults in a machine tool coolant system is described. The measured variable in the system is the pump outlet pressure; the transient response of this as the flow valve is closed is used as a pattern for fault recognition. A two-stage diagnostic system using a back propagation NN at each stage is described and this is trained by using data from the coolant system under healthy (i.e. unfaulty) and faulty conditions. The faults are simulated on the real coolant system. Novel (i.e. previously unmet) faults are defined by maximum values of a 'deviation' which is used to allocate faults. The diagnostic system is shown to be capable of first deciding whether the system is healthy or faulty; if faulty, it then decides whether one of the three common faults or a novel fault is occurring. Having made the decision that one of the common faults is occurring, it is then capable of deciding, from four different levels, the approximate severity level of the fault. Of 345 tests on the coolant system the diagnostic system allocated the fault 99 per cent correctly and the severity level 96 per cent correctly.

The Framework is an open software architecture that allows the integration of existing factory systems, such as the manufacturing execution systems, configurable equipment interfaces, recipe management systems, metrology tools, process tools, and add-on sensors, into a system which provides advanced process control specific functionality. The Advanced Process Control Framework project was formulated to enable effective integration of Advanced Process Control applications into a semiconductor facility to improve manufacturing productivity and product yields. The main communication link between the factory system and the Framework is the Configurable Equipment Interface. It interfaces through a specialized component in the framework, the Machine Interface, which converts the factory system communication protocol, ISIS, to the Framework protocol, CORBA. The Framework is a distributed architecture that uses CORBA as a communication protocol between specialized components. A generalized example of how the Framework is integrated into the semiconductor facility is provided, as well as a description of the overall architecture used for process control strategy development. The main development language, Tcl/Tk, provides for increased development and deployment over traditional coding methods.

The reduction in operating cost has meant a reduction in manpower. The ability to utilize remaining maintenance staff more effectively and to stay competitive in a deregulated environment has therefore become critical. In recent years, the industry has moved away from routine or periodic maintenance to predictive or condition based maintenance. This requires the assessment of equipment condition by frequent testing and inspection; a requirement that is incompatible with cost reduction. To overcome this dilemma, industry trends are toward condition monitoring, whereby the health of apparatus is monitored continuously. This requires the installation of sensors or transducers on power equipment and the data taken forwarded to an intelligent device for further processing. These devices then analyze the data and make evaluations based on parameter levels or trends, in an attempt to predict possible deterioration. This continuous monitoring allows the electric utility to schedule maintenance on an as needed basis. The industry has been faced with many challenges in sensor design. The measurement of physical, chemical and electrical parameters under extreme conditions of electric fields, magnetic fields, temperature, corrosion, etc. is extensive. This paper will give an overview of these challenges and the solutions adopted for apparatus such as power transformers, circuit breakers, boilers, cables, batteries, and rotating machinery.

Areas of potential application are to the surveillance and diagnostics of complete nuclear power plants and to specific systems such as check valves, instrumentation systems, and rotating machinery. Applications include sensor surveillance and calibration verification, diagnostics of both plant transients and specific faults, efficiency optimization, vibration analysis, loose parts monitoring, and adaptive and/or optimal control. The synergistic benefits of combining the use of neural networks, fuzzy systems and genetic algorithms are illustrated in several application. Although some of the work cited (e.g. vibration systems) are not necessarily associated with nuclear power plants, the results are directly applicable. Indeed, the methodologies of soft computing technologies have many applications outside the nuclear power field, e.g., fossil-fired power plants, chemical process facilities, high performance aerospace systems, financial market issues, sociological systems, and others.

Load-induced structural damages are simulated within the finite element software FEMAS using nonlinear material modelling of reinforced concrete. Time degradation of the compressive strength of concrete is studied by interaction of the post-hardening effects and fatigue. Numerical results show the evolution of structural safety in different lifetime periods by means of the failure probability.

This flight test was the culmination of an ambitious 38-month proof-of-concept effort directed at demonstrating the feasibility of detecting crack propagation in helicopter rotor components. The program was funded as part of the U.S. Navy's Air Vehicle Diagnostic Systems (AVDS) program. Reductions in Navy maintenance budgets and available personnel have dictated the need to transition from time-based to "condition-based" maintenance. Achieving this will require new enabling diagnostic technologies. The application of acoustic emission for the early detection of helicopter rotor head dynamic component faults has proven the feasibility of the technology. The flight-test results demonstrated that stress-wave acoustic emission technology can detect signals equivalent to small fatigue cracks in rotor head components and can do so across the rotating articulated rotor head joints and in the presence of other background acoustic noise generated during flight operation. During the RAMS flight test, 12 test flights were flown from which 25 Gbyte of digital acoustic data and about 15 hours of analog flight data recorder (FDR) data were collected from the eight on-rotor acoustic sensors, The focus of this paper is to describe the CH-46 flight-test configuration and present design detail:; about a new innovative machinery diagnostic technology called acoustic fault injection. This technology involves the injection of acoustic sound into machinery to assess health and characterize operational status. The paper will also address the development of the Acoustic Fault Injection Tool (AFIT), which was successfully demonstrated during the CH-46 flight tests.

The single biggest obstacle to acceptance of highly autonomous software control systems is doubt about their trustworthiness as a replacement for human analysis and decision-making. Such doubts can be addressed with a comprehensive system verification effort, but techniques suitable for conventional sequencer-based systems are inadequate for reactive systems. This paper highlights some of the key features that distinguish autonomous systems from their predecessors and then focuses on one approach to aid in their verification using a "lightweight": formal method. Specifically, we present a little language that enables system engineers acid designers to specify expected behavior in the form of invariants: state machines, episodes, and resource constraints, and a way of compiling such specifications and linking them into the operational code as embedded behavior auditors. Such auditors become part of the overall Fault-detection design, checking system behavior in real-time, not only in the test-bed but also in flight.

The main object is to develop a basis for long-term prognoses of the structural behavior with respect to changes of the material properties and of their scattering. E.g., mechanical damage accumulation models and further deteriorative prediction models are generated. The time histories of these influences are of special importance, as different categories of design life times are considered. In this contribution, special reference is given to the structural design fur different working lives, with respect to probabilistics. A reliability assessment concept based on nonlinear material models is developed for reinforced concrete structures. Thus, a basis is obtained for calibrating partial safety factors, as they are preferably used in engineering practice. Principal elements of the nonlinear deterministic and probabilistic assessment are demonstrated. Actual problems and necessary future developments are also referred to.

The United States Department of Defense (DoD) in recognizing this has been active in promoting programs to develop innovative ways to reduce expenses by effectively maintaining their aging vehicle fleet: some of which date back to the 1950s.. One such program, a Multidisciplinary Research Program of the University Research Initiative (M-URI) in Integrated Predictive Diagnostics, has encouraged the development of new methods for detecting and predicting failure in structures through support of activity being conducted at the MultiUniversity Center for Integrated Diagnostics. This paper provides an overview of the various projects being pursued through the Center, and the achievements that are being made by its diverse staff of investigators, which include mechanical, civil and electrical engineers, materials scientists and signal analysts. Studies associated with the detection and identification of incipient failures, reliable prediction of the occurrence of failures, and advancements in monitoring the condition of a component or system in realtime are reported upon.

The benefits of on-line testing allow for equipment analysis and diagnostics during normal production. Corrective actions can be planned and implemented, resulting in reduced unscheduled downtime. An understanding of the theory related to partial discharge, and the relationship to early detection of insulation deterioration is required to properly evaluate this predictive maintenance tool. This paper shall present a theory to promote the understanding of partial discharge technology, as well as various implementation and measurement techniques that have evolved in the industry. Data interpretation and corrective actions shall be reviewed, in conjunction with comprehensive predictive maintenance practices that employ partial discharge testing and analysis.

This process generates heat by deformation and friction. The heat generated must be immediately removed after every reduction diameter step, otherwise the final quality of wire and the drawing performance will be poor. That is the reason why the improvement of the cooling efficiency in the drawing machine is of great importance. The better the cooling efficiency, the greater the wire quality and the productivity of the process will be. Nowadays, the infrared thermography control offer the possibility to analyze how the drawing aspect is affecting the cooling efficiency and how this technique allows the drawing process improvements. As you look at the capstans in time wire process control, you are doing at the same time, predictive maintenance in the machine.

The development of model based decision support systems related to the planning and execution of farm operations is essential considering a sustainable and profitable production. The planning models generally applied in both industry and agriculture have been traditional deterministic operational research models trying to provide the planner with exact optimal solutions. However, often these models have not been able to capture the inherent uncertainty and risks involved when planning future actions, and thereby prompting the need for models exceeding the limitations of traditional modelling approaches. In an attempt to provide for a more comprehensive modelling of planning as part of a decision support system, the use of probabilistic networks (Bayesian networks) has been investigated as a method for building planning models for scheduling field operations. The Bayesian approach includes principles from Artificial Intelligence and provides for a normative framework to model decision making and reasoning under uncertainty. For instance, in the case of managing harvesting operations, the model will give the probable number of harvesting hours, probable state of the crop with regard to quantity and quality, probable machinery capacity, when evidence on area to be harvested, weather prognosis, etc. are, provided.

To achieve this, the resolution power of signal-modelling-based parametric techniques is shown through spectrum assessment computation. The processing of the experimental results enabled (i) various AR spectrum analysis methods and especially Burg's algorithm to be tested, and (ii) conventional spectrum analysis techniques such as the correlogram to be compared with parametric methods at a detection level as well as for mechanical component fault monitoring, especially ball bearing defects. Among various possible models, the AR model was retained along with Burg's algorithm and the AIC criterion. A detection and spotting methodology of faults likely to occur on rotating machinery was developed on the basis of the results which were obtained. This methodology, supplementing other analysis techniques, relies on the understanding of component spectrum behaviour and various constraints to be mastered such as component access availability and problems due to industrial measuring device spectrum resolution, as well as static properties of the power spectrum density assessors of a random signal. The results show that parametric methods are particularly worthwhile in the early detection of component defects, especially when two typical frequencies are close to one another. However, the complexity of these techniques necessitates many precautions when they are implemented; consequently, they should not replace conventional methods, but supplement them.

The Hough transform is used in an automatic technique, which makes use of a parameter space to describe features of interest in images. This method has been widely applied in machine vision for recognition of features in highly structured images. Geoscientific data is more demanding. Features of interest within scenes of natural environments exist on all scales, are often partially obscured and the images are usually noisy. Pre-processing of images before the HT is essential. Adaptations of the HT to cope with particular properties of geoscientific data include: optimising the dimensions of the discrete transform domain; using feature-modelling to cancel lines found; transforming multi-scale tiles of the original image and correcting amplitudes in the transformed domain to account for the position bf features. These specific adaptations produce a method for automatic feature detection which requires the user to select only two parameters. Output of the procedure is rich in feature content and accurate, leaving a clean result for statistical analysis. This optimised HT is robust for natural scenes, coping in particular with short line-segments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The paper analyses the control system for a propulsion plant on a ferry. It is shown how fault detection, isolation and subsequent reconfiguration can cope with many faults that would otherwise have serious consequences. The paper emphasizes analysis of re-configuration possibilities as a necessary tool to obtain fault tolerance, showing how sensor fusion and control system reconfiguration can be systematically approached. Detector design is also treated and parameter adaptation within fault detectors is shown to be needed to locate non-additive propulsion machinery faults. Test trials with a ferry are used to validate the principles. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The machine must be star connected and have the neutral accessible. The mathematical theory of the technique is provided and supported by an experimental validation-turn faults in the stator of an induction machine are detected from the algebraic sum of the three, instantaneous, line-neutral voltages. However, this voltage sum contains undesirable frequencies that decrease the sensitivity of the scheme. Bandpass filtering the voltage sum (around the fundamental) optimizes sensitivity by removing the harmonics that arise from core saturation, slot harmonics, etc. The design of the scheme makes it practically immune to false alarms attributable to varying load conditions, operating temperatures, and source voltage perturbations. It is shown that this technique is simpler in both theory and practice than other techniques based upon accurate calculations of sequence voltages and currents. The simplicity of this technique permits a low-cost implementation to flag a turn fault within a few cycles of the fundamental machine excitation.

J	Mechefske, CK				Mechefske, CK			Objective machinery fault diagnosis using fuzzy logic	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS	Vibration-based machine condition monitoring incorporates a number of machinery fault detection and diagnostic techniques. Many machinery fault diagnostic techniques use automatic signal classification in order to increase accuracy and reduce errors caused by subjective human judgment. In this paper, fuzzy logic techniques have been applied to classify frequency spectra representing various rolling element bearing faults. The frequency spectra representing a number of different fault conditions have been processed using a variety of fuzzy set shapes. The application of basic fuzzy logic techniques has allowed fuzzy numbers to be generated which represent the similarity between frequency spectra. Correct classification of different bearing fault spectra was observed when the correct combination of fuzzy set shapes and range of membership domains were used. The problem of membership overlapping found in previous studies, where classifying individual spectrum with respect to spectra that represent true fault classes was not conclusive, has been overcome. Further work is described which will extend this technique to other classes of machinery using generic software. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

J	Mitchell, J; Bond, T; Bever, K; Manning, N				Mitchell, J; Bond, T; Bever, K; Manning, N			MIMOSA - Four years later	SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								Great progress is being made in MIMOSA, the Machinery Information Management Open Systems Alliance. Since MIMOSA's formal introduction in the September 1995 issue of Sound and Vibration, an open method for transferring vibration and other crucial predictive data has been developed and demonstrated among a group of progressive suppliers. The MIMOSA Common Relational Information Schema (CRIS), originally developed for vibration data, has been expanded to include virtually all predictive technology and equipment information required by control, condition and maintenance management systems. MIMOSA now includes most suppliers of predictive systems and many progressive users. MIMOSA is moving forward on three parallel paths to refine and extend the CRIS table structure, develop a work integrator specification and formulate an object model based upon Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) and Distributed COM (DCOM). If you are a user or supplier of equipment information, MIMOSA offers a consensus path to open data exchange that will be highly beneficial to you.

J	Lee, SK; White, PR				Lee, SK; White, PR			The enhancement of impulsive noise and vibration signals for fault detection in rotating and reciprocating machinery	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							TIME	Impulsive sound and vibration signals in machinery are often caused by the impacting of components and are commonly associated with faults. It has long been recognized that these signals can be gainfully used for fault detection. However, it tends to be difficult to make objective measurements of impulsive signals because of the high levels of background noise. This paper presents an enhancement scheme to aid the measurement and characterization of such impulsive sounds, called a two-stage Adaptive Line Enhancer (ALE), which exploits two adaptive filter structures in series. The resulting enhanced signals are analyzed in the time-frequency domain to obtain simultaneous spectral and temporal information. In order to apply the two-stage ALE successfully the filter parameters and adaptive algorithms should be chosen carefully. Conditions for the choice of these parameters are presented and suggestions are made for suitable adaptive algorithms. Finally, the techniques developed are applied to the diagnosis of faults within an internal combustion engine and to data from an industrial gearbox. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

J	Raju, GK; Cooney, CL				Raju, GK; Cooney, CL			Active learning from process data	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; FAULT; DIAGNOSIS; KNOWLEDGE; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; MODEL	Much of the prevailing connectionist machine learning research in chemical engineering assumes a one-way passive relationship between the learner and the application domain. This article investigates a two-way active relationship between learner and domain. An active relationship is useful and even necessary if the prevailing research is to be successfully applied to real-world problems involving sparse and strongly biased data. A process development case study is used to illustrate the impact of data quality and quantity and to compare the performance of active learning against conventional passive learning. This study highlights on the need to assess data quality and demonstrates the improvements in the rate of active learning.

J	Cohen, G				Cohen, G			Neural networks implementations to control real-time manufacturing systems	COMPUTER INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						neural networks; multi-layer perception; manipulators manoeuvres; tools change management; closed lamp conveyor systems; machine faults diagnosis		The main objective of advanced manufacturing control techniques is to provide efficient and accurate tools in order to control machines and manufacturing systems in real-time operations. Recent developments and implementations of expert systems and neural networks support this objective. This research explores the use of neural networks to control several manufacturing systems in real-time operations: robot manipulators, tool changes, conveyor systems and machine faults diagnosis. The main barrier to wide implementation of neural networks is the huge computation resources (times and capacities) required to train a network. This research represents the use of a multi-layer architecture of networks (input layer, several hidden layers and an output layer) to define single-valued inter-relationships between system participants and to avoid the need for long training processes. The use of neural networks to control the above-mentioned systems was evaluated from the following parameters: the architectures, network training methods, efficiencies and accuracies of networks to perform the task of control, Several conclusions related to neural network implementations to manufacturing systems were produced: (1) the multi-layer architecture fits the complexity of manufacturing systems; (2) neural networks are efficient to control real-time operations of machines; (3) machines which were controlled by neural networks performed accurate results; and (4) the use of several hidden layers can replace the need for long training processes and saves on computation resources.

J	Sarjeant, WJ; Zirnheld, J; MacDougall, FW				Sarjeant, WJ; Zirnheld, J; MacDougall, FW			Capacitors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PLASMA SCIENCE			English	Article						capacitor; capacitor technology; electronics capacitors; energy storage		Over the last decade, significant increases in capacitor performance, especially in reliability and energy/power densities, have been achieved for energy discharge applications in plasma science and fusion research applications through a combination of advanced manufacturing techniques, new materials, and diagnostic methodologies to provide requisite life-cycle performance for high energy pulse applications. Recent innovations in analysis of aging are introduced for predicting component performance and fault tolerance, especially relevant for very high energy storage applications necessary for next generation simulators, electrically energized fusion research machines, and advanced high power electronics for commercial, industrial, and military applications. Included in this study will be developments in capacitor technologies for electronics filtering and resonant energy transfer applications, as well as multisecond energy reservoir applications for uninterruptible power sources and the like. Next generation power electronics, driven by advances in solid state switching technologies, will require reduced capacitor dissipation factor by 1/3 to 1/10 at the same cost, particularly for ac applications. In addition, higher power electronics will require robust high frequency mica capacitor technology for >300 degrees C operation, up to 5 kV. The increasing expansion of the motor drive and industrial switched mode power supply (SMPS) market will be driven in cost by the availability of electrolytic capacitors of 750-850 Vdc ratings, at 450 Vdc cost and size. New formation processes and electrolytes are anticipated to be needed to achieve these extended performance levels. At higher frequencies, advanced power electronics drives the need for lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) much less than 0.1% to 100 MHz, multimicrofarad value solid tantalum capacitors, having fail-safe surface mount configurations. Emerging power electronics applications in the millisecond and longer time are projected to have a broad application need for electrochemical chemical double layer capacitors, especially for compact sizes as this technology has the potential of achieving energy densities of many 20 kJ/kg for discharge times of tens of seconds. The prismatic power conditioning system, designed to be compliant with the available volume and surfaces into which it is to be placed, is described in some detail. It permits flexibility for the design engineer to optimize the design without having to allocate a specific space for the power conditioning system or subcomponents. Such prismatic geometry power and power conditioning systems are becoming commercially feasible in the low power consumer and industrial regime because of dramatic advances in multichip module switching, energy storage, and planarized interconnections. This work builds on assessing the applicability of these technologies to the megawatt-class average power, power electronics regime. Higher power density prismatic power electronics enables a broad range of applications in the commercial arena in areas such as motor drives, inverters, power quality systems, and mobile power systems.

A 'proof of concept' demonstrator has been built to this design and key parameters measured on the demonstrator drive are given. A novel current controller with near optimal transient performance is developed to enable precise shaping of the phase currents at high shaft speeds. A list of the most likely electrical faults is considered. Fault detection add identification schemes are developed for rapid detection of turn to turn faults and power device short circuit faults. Post fault control strategies are described which enable the drive to continue to operate indefinitely in the presence of each fault. Finally, results show the initially healthy drive operating up to, through and beyond the introduction of two of the more serious faults.

J	Gharaybeh, MA; Bushnell, ML; Agrawal, VD				Gharaybeh, MA; Bushnell, ML; Agrawal, VD			A parallel-vector concurrent-fault simulator and generation of single-input-change tests for path-delay faults	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						delay testing; fault concurrency; fault simulation; path-delay fault; vector parallelism	COMBINATIONAL-CIRCUITS; COVERAGE	A new simulation-based method use's single-input change (SIC) vectors to derive tests efficiently for singly testable (ST) path-delay faults (PDF's). A PDF is ST iff there exists a delay test that guarantees its detection when it is the only PDF in the circuit. It is known that an ST PDF must have a single-input change test. We utilize this result and present a fault simulator that is specifically tuned to simulate single-input change vectors efficiently. We assign random values to all inputs, and then propagate rising and falling transitions from each input while all other inputs are held steady. We present a 16-valued algebra with which rising and falling PDF's from all inputs are concurrently simulated. Using a suitable encoding for signal values, gates are evaluated directly through Boolean operations, and all computation stages use machine word parallelism. Results on the ISCAS'85 and '89 benchmarks show that the approach is superior to another published method in terms of both fault coverage and execution time.

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE Conference on Real Time	SEP 22-26, 1997	BEAUNE, FRANCE	IEEE				In the CERN 26 Gev Proton Synchrotron (PS) accelerator network, super-cycles are defined as sequences of different kinds of beams produced repetitively [Fig.1]. Each of these beams is characterised by attributes such as particle type, beam energy, its route through the accelerator network, and the final end user. The super-cycle is programmed by means of an editor through which the operational requirements of the physics programme can be described. Each beam in the normal sequence may later be replaced by a set of spare beams automatically depending on software and hardware interlocks and requests presented to the Master Timing Generator (MTG [Glos. 1]). The MTG calculates at run time how each beam is to be manufactured, and sends a telegram [Glos. 3] message to each accelerator, just before each cycle, describing what it should be doing now and during the next cycle. These messages, together with key machine timing events and clocks are encoded onto a timing distribution drop net where they are distributed around the PS complex to VME-standard timing reception TG8 [Glos. 8] modules which generate output pulses and VME bus interrupts for task synchronisation. The TG8 modules are able to use accelerator-related clocks such as the incremental/ decremental magnetic field trains, or the beam revolution and radio frequencies to produce high precision beam synchronous timing. Timing Surveillance Modules (TSM) monitor these timings, which give high precision interval measurements used for the machine tuning, beam diagnostics, and fault detection systems.

J	Holroyd, TJ				Holroyd, TJ			Using acoustic emission to simplify the condition monitoring of industrial machinery	INSIGHT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Planned Maintenance Reliability and Quality	APR 02-03, 1998	UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD, ENGLAND		UNIV OXFORD			The technology of Acoustic Emission (AE) is based upon the detection of naturally generated high-frequency elastic waves within materials and is most widely known as a non-destructive testing technique having an ability to globally monitor structures. In this role, AE is widely used in the aerospace and petrochemical industries for testing critical structures. In addition to those AE sources associated with defect growth, AE sensors are also extremely sensitive to a plethora of other energy loss mechanisms such as impacts, friction, turbulence and cavitation. Since these are precisely the energy loss mechanisms which are associated with the degradation of the mechanical condition of a machine, it follows that AE has great potential as a Condition Monitoring (CM) tool. In particular, the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which AE offers, compared to lower frequency vibration techniques, opens the way for a more direct measure of machine faults. However past research in this field has been dogged by the variability in the response of AE defection systems and fragmented by the diversity of signal processing techniques employed. These factors have restricted the evolution of AE as a CM tool from the research laboratory to the industrial shop-floor Recent developments in AE instrumentation have resulted in very simple but effective means of carrying out such monitoring in the industrial environment. In this paper some of these developments are briefly described and the application of AE as a CM tool is illustrated by way of actual examples.

J	Liu, Q; Zhang, C; Lin, AC				Liu, Q; Zhang, C; Lin, AC			Pattern recognition of machine tool faults with a fuzzy mathematics algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							SYSTEMS	The accuracy and precision of CNC machine tools directly affect the quality of machined parts. Automatic diagnosis of faults can improve the maintenance efficiency of CNC machine tools, and thus increase production uptime and improve product quality. In this study, the typical fault categories of CNC machine tools, such as cyclic, backlash, scale mismatch, etc., are taken as reference patterns and recognized by the fuzzy mathematics algorithm with the machine contouring trajectory measured by an inspection device. A primary component extraction (PCE) method is introduced to recognize multiple-cause faults. The study shows that the fuzzy pattern recognition method is able to identify major components of machine tool faults, their categories and direction simultaneously, with a small amount of sampling data. As a feature-based method of fault diagnosis, the PCE method can be integrated into the computer-aided maintenance of manufacturing systems.

Loose end fault and paper damage are two major defects in cigarette manufacturing. It is known that the proportion of defects is related to the cigarette tobacco content. These defects are monitored by a screening variable (tobacco weight) at the making machine and are inspected by an optical device at the packing machine. We investigate the optimal production plan (mean input tobacco weight) and the quality control design (control limits) of a maker-packer production system. The inspection error is considered in the analysis.

J	Tai, KC; Young, YC				Tai, KC; Young, YC			Synchronizable test sequences of finite state machines	COMPUTER NETWORKS AND ISDN SYSTEMS			English	Article						finite state machines; communication protocols; test sequence generation; synchronizable test sequences	UIO SEQUENCES; PROGRAMS	The finite state machine (FSM) model is commonly used for specifying communication protocols and other types of distributed systems. For an FSM with multiple ports, multiple testers are needed, but the synchronization between inputs from different testers becomes a problem. A synchronizable test sequence of an FSM is a test sequence for which the synchronization problem either does not exist or can be solved by communication between testers. In this paper, we consider two testing strategies for an FSM: port-based resting, which does not allow testers for the FSM to communicate with each other, and group-based testing, which divides ports of the FSM into mutually disjoint groups and allows testers for ports in the same group to communicate with each other. For each type of testing, we define a necessary and sufficient condition under which a test sequence of an FSM is synchronizable and show how to generate a set of testers according to a given test sequence. We also discuss test sequence generation and fault detection, and present the results of empirical studies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Szczerbicki, E; White, W				Szczerbicki, E; White, W			System modeling and simulation for predictive maintenance	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS	Condition monitoring, the process of data collection for the evaluation of machinery performance and reliability, is an essential part of today's on-line predictive maintenance for complex manufacturing systems. Together with the increasing complexity of machinery systems, the number of assets that need to be diagnosed is also rapidly increasing. This is why the management of condition monitoring became a complex cooperation and resource allocation problem. This paper describes an implementation of computer simulation as a modeling and decision support tool for the management of a condition-monitoring service group. The implementation was developed using the SLAMSYSTEM modeling environment. It provides an easily adaptable management-style program that may be applied to a company with a monitoring system that varies in versatility, expertise, and availability.

J	Gil, C; Ortega, J				Gil, C; Ortega, J			Algebraic test-pattern generation based on the Reed-Muller spectrum	IEE PROCEEDINGS-COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL TECHNIQUES			English	Article						Boolean testing; digital spectral techniques; Reed-Muller spectrum; testing digital circuits	SATISFIABILITY; ALGORITHM	In the last few years new test generation procedures based on Boolean techniques have been reported. Despite the fact that Boolean operations are in general computationally expensive and that procedures are available based on path-oriented methods of reasonable efficiency, there is still interest in developing new methods to speed up the detection of those faults that are hard to detect by the path-oriented methods, to reduce the test lengths obtained, or to make it possible to use parallel machines more efficiently. A new algebraic procedure to determine test patterns for stuck-line faults in combinational logic circuits is proposed. It is based on the use of Reed-Muller coefficients to build and solve the equation that describes the Boolean difference between the circuit affected by a given fault and the correct one. It is also shown how digital spectral techniques, which have been widely used in the synthesis of switching functions and in the determination of circuit signatures for built-in self testing, can also be applied to the test-pattern generation problem.

In this paper we prove that the multilevel method (M method) [which splits the specification graph into a basic subgraph and one or more higher level subgraph(s)] is capable of diagnosing any number of faults in the higher level subgraph(s), if the basic subgraph is error-free, Heuristics for obtaining the basic subgraph and higher level subgraphs from the specification graph are also given. The advantage of the M method is that it has error recovery and, in addition, it does not assume the presence of reliable reset in the implementation under test. We additionally propose an incremental test sequence generation method, which produces a shorter test sequence and whose fault coverage is same as that of the hi method. Finally, we compare the M method with other fault detection and fault diagnostic methods.

J	Mehta, SV; Uzsoy, RM				Mehta, SV; Uzsoy, RM			Predictable scheduling of a job shop subject to breakdowns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION			English	Article						job shop; predictable scheduling; rescheduling; scheduling; uncertainties	SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY; MODELS	Production schedules released to the shop door have two important functions: 1) allocating shop resources to different jobs to optimize some measure of shop performance; 2) serving as a basis for planning external activities such as material procurement, preventive maintenance, and delivery of orders to customers. Schedule modification may delay or render infeasible the execution of external activities planned on the basis of the predictive schedule. Thus it is of interest to develop predictive schedules which can absorb disruptions without affecting planned external activities, while maintaining high shop performance, We present a predictable scheduling approach where the predictive schedule is built with such objectives. The procedure inserts additional idle time into the schedule to absorb the impacts of breakdowns. The amount and location of the additional idle time is determined from the breakdown and repair distributions as well as the structure of the predictive schedule. The effects of disruptions on planned support activities are measured by the deviations of job completion times in the realized schedule from those in the predictive schedule. We apply our approach to minimizing maximum lateness (L-max) in a job shop environment with random machine breakdowns, and show that it provides high predictability with minor sacrifices in shop performance.

J	Aktouf, C; Robach, C; Marinescu, A; Mazare, G				Aktouf, C; Robach, C; Marinescu, A; Mazare, G			An implementation approach of the IEEE 1149.1 for the routing test of a VLSI massively parallel architecture	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						MIMD architectures; routing test; IEEE 1149.1; built-in self-test; diagnosis		This paper presents an implementation approach for the test of routers in a fine grain massively parallel architecture. First, an ad hoc test technique which diffuses test messages router by router is analyzed. Even though the technique does not add hardware, it is shown inefficient and not applicable due to practical constraints such as the limited number of pins of the chip implementing the machine. Based on a hierarchical implementation of the IEEE 1149.1 standard, two approaches are proposed and compared in terms of the area overhead, the overall test time and the flexibility in applying tests and diagnosing the routers inside the machine. The basic idea for both approaches is to construct groups of basic cells which are driven by the same test block and compare their test results after the same test vectors are applied at each cell input. The two approaches differ in the granularity of a basic cell. The choice of an implementation approach is not trivial. It is shown that each approach presents better performance than the other, that is, the approach which allows better fault coverage and less test time requires more silicon and less diagnostic possibilities compared to the second approach.

J	Friswell, MI; Garvey, SD; Penny, JET; Smart, MG				Friswell, MI; Garvey, SD; Penny, JET; Smart, MG			Computing critical speeds for rotating machines with speed dependent bearing properties	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article								In this paper available methods are examined for computing critical speeds for rotating machines whose bearings have speed dependent properties and a modification is proposed which can be incorporated into almost all of the established techniques. The established methods for the calculation of critical speeds are adequately efficient when only a single configuration is analyzed. The trend towards incorporating critical speed calculations into the design optimization process and model-based fault diagnosis systems requires the more efficient calculation of critical speeds. The proposed modification involves replacing the sets of speed-dependent bearing characteristics by fictitious multi-degree-of-freedom systems whose characteristics emulate those of the bearings themselves. The method by which these fictitious systems can be found is explained and the advantages of using this method for computing critical speeds are demonstrated in conjunction with the finite element approach to evaluating critical speeds. The proposed technique is also well suited to computing efficiently the machine response to unbalance by using a truncated modal decomposition. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

The analyzer acquires multiple vibration signals with high resolution, and computes frequency spectra, root mean square amplitude, and other peak parameters of interest. Fast execution speed has been achieved by performing data acquisition and frequency spectrum computation using C-language. Vibration signals up to 10 kHz can be analyzed by the spectrum analyzer. Special algorithms, such as window smoothing, digital filtering, data archiving and graphic display have also been incorporated, With these features the vibration analyzer can perform most of the functions available in complex, stand-alone machines, The software for the analyzer is menu driven and user-friendly. The personal computer used is a 66 MHz PC-486 compatible machine, The use of a general purpose PC and standard programming language makes the vibration analyzer simple, economical, and adaptable to a variety of problems. The applications of the system in malfunction detection in rotating machinery are also described.

J	Janzen, ME; Vicente, KJ				Janzen, ME; Vicente, KJ			Attention allocation within the abstraction hierarchy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article							ECOLOGICAL INTERFACE DESIGN; PLANT CONTROL ROOMS; MULTILEVEL INTERFACES; SKILL ACQUISITION; MANAGEMENT	Previous research has shown that Rasmussen's abstraction hierarchy, which consists of both physical and functional system models, provides a useful basis for interface design for complex human-machine systems. However, very few studies have quantitatively analysed how people allocate their attention across levels of abstraction. This experiment investigated the relationship between attention allocation strategies and performance on a thermal-hydraulic process simulation. Subjects controlled the process during both normal and fault situations for about an hour per weekday for approximately one month. All subjects used a multi-level interface consisting of four separate windows, each representing a level of the abstraction hierarchy. Subjects who made more frequent use of functional levels of information exhibited more accurate system control under normal conditions, and more accurate diagnosis performance under fault trials. Moreover, subjects who made efficient use of functional information exhibited faster fault compensation times. In contrast, subjects who made infrequent or inefficient use of functional information exhibited poorer performance on both normal and fault trials. These results provide some initial, specific evidence of the advantages of an abstraction hierarchy interface over more traditional interfaces that emphasize physical rather than functional information.

These variables are trended to determine the rate of deterioration and to perform a simulation to predict either the machine life or the maintenance period. Some useful terms for using models in predictive maintenance are defined and the prediction procedure is described. The procedure is demonstrated with a simple two degree-of-freedom example and the numerical model of an actual hydraulic turbine-generator rotor. Some benefits and problems associated with the implementation of the procedure are then discussed. It is considered that this procedure brings the possibility of a better understanding of deterioration processes and a resulting better life prediction.

J	Lin, RS; Yuang, MC; Hsu, SJ				Lin, RS; Yuang, MC; Hsu, SJ			Efficient minimization of homogeneous FSMs for fault diagnosis	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						minimization; Finite State Machine (FSM); distinguishing sequences; fault diagnosis		On the base of the Finite State Machine (FSM) model, the fault diagnosis problem deals with the identification of a faulty implementation against its specification represented by an FSM. In particular, to efficiently identify potential faulty implementations caused by a transfer error in an FSM, cross-verification over the FSM is performed after all potential faulty FSMs have been minimized. Existing minimization algorithms become inefficient due to the lack of taking advantage of the homogeneity of these potential faulty FSMs. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm for the efficient and simultaneous minimization of a set of homogeneous faulty FSMs. Disregarding the suspicious transition, the first phase of the algorithm performs minimization of these faulty FSMs via a common digraph of th FSMs. These faulty FSMs are considered minimized if the distinguishing sequences of all state-pairs can be discovered from the common digraph. Otherwise, the algorithm in the second phase performs minimization for each faulty FSM by individually restoring its corresponding unexpected transition in the reduced common digraph. To demonstrate the efficiency of the two-phase algorithm, we carried out experiments on a number of realistic protocol specifications, including the Alternation Bit Protocol (ABP), Transport Protocol Class 4 (TP4), and ISDN Basic Rate Interface (BRI) protocol. Experimental results show that the algorithm renders the minimization complexity greatly reduced for most of the realistic protocol FSMs.	Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan; Minist Commun, Telecommun Labs, Chungli, Taiwan		Lin, RS (corresponding author), Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Hsinchu 30050, Taiwan.

J	Karpovsky, MG; Chakrabarty, K; Levitin, LB				Karpovsky, MG; Chakrabarty, K; Levitin, LB			On a new class of codes for identifying vertices in graphs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						code construction; coding theory; covering radius; fault diagnosis; graph theory; multiprocessor systems	COVERING RADIUS; SUPERCOMPUTER; MACHINE; BOUNDS	We investigate a new class of codes for the optimal covering of vertices in an undirected graph G such that any vertex in G can be uniquely identified by examining the vertices that cover it, We define a ball of radius t centered on a vertex upsilon to be the set of vertices in G that are at distance at most t from upsilon. The vertex upsilon is then said to cover itself and every other vertex in the ball with center upsilon. Our formal problem statement is as follows: Given an undirected graph G and an integer t greater than or equal to 1, find a (minimal) set C of vertices such that every vertex in G belongs to a unique set of balls of radius t centered at the vertices in C. The set of vertices thus obtained constitutes a code for vertex identification, We first develop topology-independent bounds on the size of C. We then develop methods for constructing C for several specific topologies such as binary cubes, nonbinary cubes, and trees, We also describe the identification of sets of vertices using covering codes that uniquely identify single vertices. We develop methods for constructing optimal topologies that yield identifying codes with a minimum number of codewords, Finally, we describe an application of the theory developed in this paper to fault diagnosis of multiprocessor systems.

This is because it is economically unacceptable to shut down expensive production equipment due to tribological failures. There is considerable concern that many industries appear to be uncertain regarding these issues. The strategy for integrated machine wear control should be to use only those tests that are relevant. Acquisition of reliable and trendable data is vital to this concept and its management. Machine wear control incorporating spectrometry, fluid condition, diagnostic ferrography, lubricant contaminant monitoring, vibration, thermography and performance analysis allows a rational approach to failure prevention, When incorporated with failure potential analysis, it can often provide a safe interchange from scheduled to on-condition maintenance. This paper outlines the most significant analysis methods and provides basic guidelines for their integration it also explains how this approach can provide maximum benefits, if undertaken correctly.

J	McCormick, AC; Nandi, AK				McCormick, AC; Nandi, AK			Cyclostationarity in rotating machine vibrations	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							CUMULANT THEORY; TIME-SERIES; DIAGNOSIS	Vibrations in rotating machinery are produced by a combination of periodic and random processes due to the machine's rotation cycle and interaction with the real world. The combination of such components can give rise to signals which have periodically time-varying ensemble statistics and are best considered as cyclostationary. In this paper, second-order cyclic statistical methods are described and several applications of these to machine vibration analysis are introduced. The second-order techniques are compared with traditional (purely stationary) spectral analysis and synchronous averaging (first-order cyclic analysis). This comparison is made for data collected from a rotating machine subjected to bearing faults and the applications are demonstrated. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

Nevertheless, some faults such as wire-breaking and unsatisfactory accuracy may still occur due to improper operations or inappropriate machine maintenance. A maintenance and fault-diagnosis system which integrates artificial neural network (ANN) and expert system (ES) is developed. It is time-saving in knowledge acquisition, is easy to maintain and is capable of self-learning. The occasions which call for machine maintenance are advised automatically. Suggestions to eliminate faults are proposed sequentially according to the inferred priority once a fault is taking place. Moreover, it can provide explanations.										0	0	0	0	1	V D I-V D E - VERLAG GMBH	DUSSELDORF	PO BOX 10 11 39, W-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	0083-5560		3-18-091405-X	VDI BERICHT			1998	1405						233	242					10	Electrochemistry; Engineering, Manufacturing; Engineering, Mechanical	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Electrochemistry; Engineering	BL18T	WOS:000074632700019					2022-02-14

This suggests that to have effective control on the plasma charge damage in the advanced semiconductor manufacturing, the antenna must be connected to the MOS transistor gate, and the interactions of the antennas connected to the source, drain, and substrate to the gate antenna have to be considered. Depending on the relative direction, distance, and size of the antennas connected to the gate, source, drain, and substrate, the magnitude of the charge- damage effects can be enhanced or exacerbated. Furthermore, to predict and automatically warn about the potential charge-damage in IC layout design phase, a new charge antenna DRC (Design Rule Check) software has been developed to perform systematic layout checking for the interactions of the ULSI interconnection lines; which become antennas connected to all four terminals of MOS transistors.

These deviations affect torque and speed as well as stator terminal voltages and currents. The proposed fault detection technique senses the actual machine state with the help of real time space phasor models. The Vienna Monitoring Method compares on-line a voltage model output with a current model and observes the deviations in a rotor fixed reference frame. High accuracy and robustness allows the detection of a faulty rotor bar out of the switched voltage and current signals of an inverter fed machine in an early state. The focus of this paper is the detection of a single rotor bar increase under transient speed conditions without the necessity of a clutched load. During an inverter controlled accelerating, lasting 200ms only, the Vienna Monitoring Method evaluates currents, voltages, and rotor position for the calculation of an indication quantity that allows a reliable detection. As one acceleration task only does not excite ever rotor cage bar sufficiently, a set of acceleration and deceleration cycles has to be driven.

In this paper, we investigate these issues via a software tool which can generate testability metrics and diagnostic information for analog circuits represented by SPICE descriptions. This tool, termed the Virtual Test-Bench (VTB), incorporates three different simulation-based techniques for fault detection and isolation. The first method is based on the creation of fault-test dependency models, while the other two techniques employ machine learning principles based on the concepts of: (1) Restricted Coloumb Energy (RCE) Neural Networks, and (2) Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). Whereas the output of the first method can be used for the traditional off-line diagnosis, the RCE and LVQ models render themselves more naturally to on-line monitoring, where measurement data from various sensors is continuously available. Since it is well known that analog faults and test measurements are affected by component parameter variations, we have also addressed the issues of robustness of our fault diagnosis schemes. Specifically, we have attempted to answer the questions regarding fixing of test measurement thresholds, obtaining the minimum number of Monte-Carlo runs required to stabilize the measurements and their deviations, and the effect of different thresholding schemes on the robustness of fault models. Although fault-simulation is a powerful technique for analog circuit testability analysis, its main shortcomings are the long simulation time, large volume of data and the fidelity of simulators in accurately modeling faults. have plotted the simulation time and volume of data required for a range of circuit sizes to provide guidance on the feasibility and efficacy of this approach.

The implementation of discrete signals has led to the definition of many different discrete TFDs. The spectral decomposition of the kernel allows the computation of the Generalized Discrete-Time TFD (GDTFD) as a weighted sum of spectograms with orthonormal windows. The partial sum offers the user a vehicle to perform trade-off between exactness and computational requirement. In this paper, we extend this idea by showing that the combination of incremental refinement and approximating structure along with the spectral decomposition based GDTFD provides more flexibility and a variety of trade-offs between approximation quality and computational cost. The paper discusses aspects of a suitable VLSI architecture featuring modular structure, local connections and reconfigurable logic module for implementation. The result serves as a basis to design a programmable core for computing GDTFD within an integrated mechatronic system targeting fault detection.

The classification machine of different branches of decision tree is composed of different artificial neural network (ANN), thus a system model of combinatorial ANN is constructed, and the multi-resolution identification for transformer faults is achieved. The shortage of the complex configuration and the slow convergence of single ANN is overcome with this method, and the diagnosis accuracy is improved simultaneously. The application results show that this method is valuable for transformer faults diagnosis.

A new converter topology which connects coils two hanks in parallel is proposed. The combination of multiple coils per phase and the converter circuit suggests improved operation under faults compared with conventional topologies. Output power per coil current under faults is studied by finite-element analysis and static torque measurement. Circuit equations under faults are derived and operation under faults is evaluated by simulation, Pa SRG controller is constructed and experiments are performed, The experimental results support the equations and simulation results.

A fuzzy-based neural network paradigm with an on-line learning algorithm is developed to perform expert advising for the ground-based maintenance crew. A hierarchical fault diagnosis architecture is advocated to fulfill the time-critical and on-board needs in different levels of structural integrity over a global operating envelope. The research objective is to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed health monitoring procedure through numerical simulations of bearing faults in USAF MH-53J PAVE LOW helicopter transmissions. The proposed fault detection, identification and accommodation architecture is applicable to various generic rotorcraft machines. The proposed system will greatly reduce the operational and developmental costs and serve as an essential component in an autonomous control system.

Planning tools being adapted include decision support systems (DSS) aimed at achieving better production control. Specifically, this project addresses operational planning or scheduling of field operations. This planning procedure involves the allocation of time and resources to activities considering inherent uncertainty and risks. The method used is applied decision analysis together with the principles of Bayesian networks. Bayesian networks capture the relations (which may be uncertain or imprecise) between a set of random variables associated with some domain. By augmenting the network with decision variables and a utility function, an influence diagram is created. This combined approach enables the formal description of a decision problem involving conditional, functional and informational dependencies. The DSS is built by using an expert system shell HUGIN (Handling Uncertainty by General Influence Networks) providing the knowledge representation framework and inference engine necessary. Crop condition, weather forecasts and labour/machinery states are specified together with their mutual dependencies and conditional probabilities. Given some prior information and specific observations the model will update all probabilities. For example, in the, case of managing harvesting operations, the model will give the probable number of harvesting hours, probable state of the crop with regard to quantity and quality, when given evidence on current moisture content, weather prognosis, availability of labour and machinery etc.	Danish Inst Agr Engn, Dept Agr Engn, Res Ctr Bygholm, DK-8700 Horsens, Denmark		Sorensen, CG (corresponding author), Danish Inst Agr Engn, Dept Agr Engn, Res Ctr Bygholm, DK-8700 Horsens, Denmark.

Those who analyze the data and prepare work orders for maintenance and repair know why they have prepared the orders, but those involved in the actual maintenance of the machinery. often know little more than which component to replace. By implementing an easy-to-use, accurate system of both machinery condition data collection and analysis, and by involving all maintenance personnel in the process. plant operation can become efficient and cost-effective. Personnel are educated as to the cause and extent of the damage, and learn how essential it is to pinpoint potential problems before they occur. By taking this proactive approach. a company can save millions of dollars by avoiding costly damage, unscheduled shutdowns, lost man-hours and missed project deadlines. This paper describes how to practically implement a cost effective predictive maintenance program, discussing what to do, what not to do. case histories, and the benefits and results achieved.

As the application of the commonly employed spectrum analysis techniques is complicated by the inverter drives inherent frequency variation, the Vienna Monitoring Method avoids any frequency analysis and observes instead the machine state with the help of on-line models, The key for the fault detection is thereby the comparison of the estimated machine states out of two independent machine models with different model structures. While the models respond identically to the regular machine operation they diverge in case of a structural machine asymmetry. Experimental results from an IGBT drive show that a single rotor bar resistance change can be detected unequivocally. The method is thus sensitive enough to detect an upcoming fault in a very early state. As the extent of the cage asymmetry is estimated too, maintenance or repair can be conveniently scheduled on time.

The motor is disconnected from the supply; and the induced voltage in the stator due to only rotor flux is utilized to detect the fault. If there is any broken bar, it will directly affect the induced voltages in the stator windings. Using this approach the effects of source non-idealities (such as unbalance, presence of time harmonics, etc.) and nonlinearity of machine magnetizing characteristics due to saturation can be avoided.

The method employs simple statistical analysis to detect turn shorts in the stator of the machine. It is shown that the standard deviation of the calibrated, RMS line currents reveals a change in the machine's electrical symmetry that can be caused by turn shorts. To account for inherent machine imbalance, calibration is performed with the machine in a known fault-free state; additionally, current normalization accounts for varying loads. The method is sensitive to source balance, and is thus proposed only for inverter-fed machines.

While it has been possible to assess the general state and condition of the stator insulation, experience gained so far has shown that these diagnostic tests are not sensitive to detect or predict the breakdown or failure of the insulation, which is a microscopic phenomenon. In other words, the conventional diagnostic tests such as dissipation factor, capacitance, polarisation index, DC leakage current measurements are average/integrated effects and are not capable of reflecting the microscopic phenomenon such as an insulation breakdown [2]. In view of these facts, there is a need to device a test method or to find a more searching and sensitive parameter capable of predicting the insulation breakdown. In this context, partial discharge measurements assume greater importance as it is believed that partial discharges (PD) are capable of revealing the incipient faults [3,4,5,6]. The paper presents the partial discharge degradation studies carried out on the stator bars of 1.1kV. 135 MW hydrogenerator. The generator bars have been subjected to accelerated electrical ageing and the partial discharges have been monitored periodically using Multichannel Analyser (MCA) in order to characterise the ageing phenomena. The MCA provides the distributions of partial discharge pulse magnitudes against their repetition rates. The distribution profiles have been examined in detail in order to characterise the internal discharges, slot discharges and endwinding discharges that occur in the stator winding.

Faults occurring in induction machines can negatively influence worker safety and production processes in terms of time delays and quality of the final product. Some anomalies can be early detected in order to predict fault conditions, so allowing optimizing servicing and machine stopping. The method proposed, based on artificial intelligence techniques, allows analyzing the operating conditions of induction motors. In particular, the fuzzy set theory is used to perform a spectrum analysis of the stator current in order to identify some kinds of incoming faults.

The detection method introduced involves the induction machine being considered as a simple system thereby precluding the need for a priori data or complex modelling techniques. The induction machine fault conditions discussed are common failure mechanisms, and represent faults of both an electrical and mechanical nature. A novel signal processing technique for condition monitoring called Higher Order Spectra is introduced and is shown to be the optimal detection mechanism for fault diagnosis using the machine vibration. These techniques are then verified in a rigorous experimental investigation and the detection mechanism is shown to be largely independent of the induction machine load condition. In addition, it is shown that this technique is entirely extensible to other fault types without loss of generality. Part I of the paper concentrates predominantly on the fundamental aspects of this novel detection method, and it is shown that the developed techniques improve on conventional methods. It also details a rigorous experimental investigation and highlights pertinent results. Part II of the paper extends the work introduced by considering the use of variable speed, inverter supplies to the induction machine. It also describes the development of a software-based, generalised and automated induction machine condition monitoring system.

Part I investigated the fundamental aspects of this technique and examined fault detection with a sinusoidal supply to the induction machine. Part II goes on to extend the techniques introduced previously to include the condition monitoring of variable speed induction machine operation. The fault conditions investigated in Part I are re-examined for a variable speed, inverter-fed induction machine. It is shown that the previously introduced techniques are entirely general and extend to non-sinusoidal, variable speed induction machine operation without modification. The second part of this paper then goes on to describe the automation of the HOS based predictive frequency method of induction machine condition monitoring. The design, development and testing of a software based induction machine condition monitoring tool is described. The tool removes the need for experienced operator judgment and automatically diagnoses common fault conditions regardless of the machine load, speed or supply type. In addition, the software is constructed from inexpensive, readily available components and is based on the previous work of parts I and II of this paper.

This review covers the application of expert systems, neural networks and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques to overcome specific problems. Usually a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behaviour of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase the knowledge of well tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault conditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterising the faults. Then the fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input dataset for specific AI (neural networks, fuzzy logic or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilising as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition. the supply converter is also considered to also incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various techniques is provided to highlight the advantages and the validity limits of using.-II technologies. Some application examples are discussed and, areas for future research are also indicated.

When this occurs, ultrasonic sensors can be used in order to check for the existence of fabrication defects in foundry pieces before allowing them to be machined This check is carried out by studying the echoes coming from the piece under analysis. This article is based on the comparison of the results obtained from two analysis techniques which use these echoes. Both systems work by differentiating the valid pieces from the defective ones, using the high part of the ultrasonic frequency range (215 kHz). In the first case, the process of separation of valid and defective pieces is based on expert systems, applied directly on the temporal characteristics of the echoes. For the second defect detection method, signal processing techniques are used on these high-frequency echoes; firstly, digitally filtering the signal and then, once the part of the signal pertaining to the echoes coming from the piece is separated, it is decomposed into its frequential components. The techniques used in these two working methods are explained in this article.

The features of these techniques and the improvements that they introduce in the diagnostic process are recalled, showing that, in order to obtain indication on the fault extent, faulty machine models are still essential. Moreover, bg the models, that must trade off between simulation result effectiveness and simplicity, it is possibly to overcome crucial points of the diagnosis. With reference to rotor electrical faults of induction machines, a new and simple procedure based on a model which includes the speed ripple effect is developed. This procedure leads to a new diagnostic index, independent of the machine operating condition and inertia value, that alloys the implementation of the diagnostic system with a minimum configuration intelligence.

It is argued that software is commonly difficult to keep up to date because many of the implications of these changing features on software details are obscure. A possible solution is to use a software generation system in which the transformation of system properties into system software is made explicit. The proposed generation system stores the system properties, such as machine properties, product properties and information on manufacturing techniques, in databases. As a result this information, on which system control is based, can also be made available to other programmes. In particular, artificial intelligence programmes such as fault diagnosis programmes, can benefit from using the same information as the control system, rather than a separate database which must be developed and maintained separately to ensure consistency. Experience in developing a simplified model of such a system is presented.

The proposed approach is composed of two steps. In the event of a fault, the first step is the detection of the failed component, and the estimation of the fault parameters. The second step consists in the design of a new control structure which implicitly reconfigures the control law using the on-line estimates of the altered system dynamics. The application to a winding machine is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.

So uncertainty factors are considered on the basis of variants utility computation as for HL-criterion which is based on convolution of nature state for the project implementation relying on their prognostic values; risk index for a project variant is calculated as a difference between variant utility values for HL-criterion and minimax criterion. The project variant choice is based on set theory methods for multi-criteria optimization that use comparison thresholds, the optimization problem taking into account economical, ecological end technical criteria and risk factors. The paper presents the results of the developed method application to a project for open pit "Tugnuysky" in East Siberia. On the basis of the study of both possible extraction machines types and quality standards it was shown that the best results will be attained with the use of DEMAG excavators for selective mining of slightly inclined coal seams of complex structure. In that case the decrease of minimum extracted seam thickness to 0.3 m results in the extracted coal quality rise (ash content decreases by 7%, and dilution by 30%) and the total amount of minable coal reserves increase by 9.3%. Besides, air pollution rate decreases by 13%. The net profit per year for the system "open pit - power station" is expected to rise for 7.4%.

Ln metal components, these AE signals are very complex transients that exhibit rapid time-varying behaviour due to multiple modes and multipath propagation. In this paper we present a scheme for the detection of AE transients that requires minimal a priori assumptions on the signal model. The technique, that is amenable to both adaptive and block implementations, is based on the thresholding of the ratio of the residual energy in fitting the transient to a linear model, to the signal energy. The method works well in detecting transients even at low SNRs.

Many standard signal processing approaches such as cyclostationary models are developed assuming a constant fundamental frequency, Even slight variations in the RPM can cause significant reduction in signal processing gain and fault detection/classification performance. In this paper, methods to track fundamental frequency developed originally for Army battlefield acoustic signatures are presented, analyzed and applied to the NRaD firepump dataset. In additon, a visual aid technique, termed the cyclostationary image is presented that provides insight into the fundamental frequency variations and features of the time domain signature.

This paper describes a neural network vibration-based condition monitoring system for providing advance warnings of malfunctions in the paper machine. Spectral analysis of the raw vibration signals involves the technique of enveloping for isolating the spectral components that reflect the process defects. Feature extraction is then carried out by a suitably designed peak detection algorithm. This is followed by a neural network classifier for discriminating between the fault and the no-fault conditions. The system's performance is assessed on industrial data from a major paper manufacturer. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

Although extensive theoretical and experimental results have been presented for hydrodynamic bearings, the available literature seems to be limited for precision hydrodynamic bearing spindles. In this study, practical methods have been developed to quantify the performance of a hydrodynamic wheel spindle operating in the horizontal mode to produce precision parts with submicron roundness tolerance and very fine surface finish. These methods can easily and cost effectively be implemented on various machines in an actual production environment for effective predictive maintenance. The main experimental results show that the long-term drift of the spindle at steady state is less than 1 mu m vertically and 0.2 mu m horizontally, and the radial error motion of the spindle based on unfiltered data is less than 1.6 mu m for all the speeds tested. It is also found that the shaft center position (vertical lift and horizontal shift) at the cold condition is substantially different from that in the steady-state warm condition. From the results, an optimal spindle speed is recommended. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

In fact, in the case of steady state operations, anomalous current spectral component;, that increase if a fault occurs, allow to diagnose the presence and, in some case, the type of fault. In this paper, a Bayesian approach is proposed using a simulation technique, the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), to estimate the amplitude of some spectral components modified by machine faults and the slip, a parameter related to the load conditions, with a view to automatically detecting faults.

The cyclostationary nature of rotating machine vibrations can be exploited by using periodic time-varying autoregressive models to model the signal better than time-invariant models. Experimental data collected from a small rotating machine set subjected to several bearing faults were used to compare time-varying and time-invariant models. Comparison is also made with a simple feature-based neural network fault diagnosis system.

Established methods of obtaining structural models for these foundations, such as the finite element method or modal testing, have proved unsuccessful because of complexity or cost. Another method of foundation system identification, using the unbalance excitation applied by the rotor itself during maintenance run-downs, has previously been proposed but has not yet been experimentally verified. In this paper the necessary theory is developed and certain issues critical to the success of the estimation are examined. The method is tested in both simulation and experiment using a two-bearing rotor rig and good fits between model and measurement are obtained. The predictive capacity of the estimated models when the system is excited with a different unbalance is not as good, and it is surmised that this may be due among other things to inaccurate bearing models.

J	Al-Najjar, B				Al-Najjar, B			Improved effectiveness of vibration monitoring of rolling bearings in paper mills	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART J-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING TRIBOLOGY			English	Article						bearing defects; vibration spectral analysis; defect vibration frequency; fault diagnosis; envelope alarming; data gathering and feedback; maintenance improvement		Rolling element bearing failures in paper mill machines are considered in relation to their critical role in the machine function. The paper discusses these failures according to what becomes damaged and how, and relates them to the vibration spectra and their development over the lives of the bearings. Interpretations of some variations in the vibration signature, i.e. relating vibration amplitude changes and frequency shifts to the deterioration processes involved, are proposed and discussed. The literature was found mainly to confirm this analysis. A new approach to envelope alarming is presented and shown theoretically (logically) to offer later renewal with fewer failures, and therefore lower cost and higher productivity. Deficiencies in data coverage and quality, and the feedback of case study results, are discussed. A model to improve maintenance experience is proposed and discussed. Using vibration to monitor component conditions, the accurate prediction of remaining life requires (a) enough vibration measurements, (b) numerate records of operating conditions, (c) better discrimination between frequencies in the spectrum and (d) correlation of (b) and (c). This is because life prediction depends on the amplitudes of(and) the frequencies generated by the component damage. Much money could be saved because some of the present policies utilize as little as half of the useful life of a bearing.

The system can be used in Hydro Powerplants of medium size. First some recommendations for the adequate selection of the monitoring points are given. Spectral alarm bands are used for monitoring. The vibration signatures are devided into several bands. A basic approach for the selection of alarm bands based in the knowledge of the basic excitations generated when the machine is in operation, is also described To select the alarm levels, some results from a statistical analysis of vibrations measured in several Powerplants of Francis type are used. Due to the large scattering of these results a reevaluation of the alarm levels for each machine is necessary. The method used is analyzed and the results from several years of monitoring are finally discussed.

Identifiability of rotor parameters can be critical due to small currents flowing in the rotor. With modern pulse-width modulated (PWM) inverters it is possible to create arbitrary test signals for the identification process. The integration of a voltage source inverter in the diagnostic process is stressed.. Theoretical background on appropriate modeling is given. Finally, comments are made on measurement results of a laboratory benchmark stand comprising a 370 W induction machine and a three-phase PWM voltage source inverter. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

The following types of faults have been considered: sensor faults, actuator faults, and load faults in the synchronous machines. The implementation of FDI has been carried out on a TMS320-C30 based real-time multi-channel processor. Satisfactory results have been obtained and reported in this paper. Furthermore, the paper has concluded that for the purpose of fault detection, a simplified synchronous machine model is sufficient. However, in order to isolate the fault, or to obtain the detailed information about the fault, or to estimate the severity of the fault, more detailed mathematical and physical models have to be used.

The envelope analysis as a part of it turned out to be a very effective method for diagnosis of antifriction bearings. Different bearing failures lead to different patterns of the envelope spectrum. Checking the amplitudes of characteristic bearing frequencies is mostly not sufficient for a reliable diagnosis. Therefore human experts compare the pattern of the spectrum with typical patterns of bearing defects. In this paper a fuzzy system is presented which imitates this action of human experts. The knowledge which is necessary for the diagnosis will be stored in the fuzzy rules. In this manner, the system is able to automatically recognize typical bearing defects as well as other kinds of machine failures. The input parameters of the fuzzy system are extracted by an extensive data preprocessing. The: presented fuzzy-system is used in different applications in mining and steel industry.

Formulation of the method and calculation of the Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) are presented. The Spectral Correlation Function may be seen as a parameter. measuring the 'link' between harmonic components. This technique is demonstrated on simulated example, and used to analyse real vibration signals measured on an industrial like gear system. SCD is compared to classical (but powerful) phase modulation technique for the diagnostics of spalling in gear teeth. The results show that SCD may detect this fault in an early stage.

Nevertheless, the reliable early fault detection of large and complex drive systems which are used e.g. in mining industry remains problematic. On the one hand the large size of such transmission parts requires multiple sensors and on the other hand common vibration diagnosis techniques do not work at extremely low rotating speed.

Process data for modeling were provided by the Weyerhaeuser Canada Ltd.'s Grande Prairie pulp mil. Using the PLS modeling technique, it was found that the breaks process can be modeled with 3 latent variables. Instead of using the numerous process variables, the 3 latent variables (linear combinations of the original variables) were used for process monitoring and fault detection. The developed model indicated to the expert system if the process was trending toward a sheetbreak, at which point the expert system would start trouble-shooting. The expert system was designed to perform diagnosis of the process and identify the cause of sheetbreaks by analyzing information from major operating variables as well as operator inputs. The system would also suggest remedies for the anticipated sheetbreak so that the operators can take corrective action. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

The authors describe the implementation of a novelty detection and adaptive diagnostic system which forms a modular component of a larger on-line condition monitoring system. NEURAL-MAINE, a project under the European Union's EUREKA programme, aims to advance on-line condition monitoring applications by the use of neural networks, data fusion and multiple sensor technology. NEURAL-MAINE aims to implement a system on two levels: at the first,, Local Fusion Systems (LFS) are used to model individual machine components, such as high pressure turbines; at the second, a larger 'Overseer' system sits above the LFS and takes in their input, as well as plant operating parameters, in order to give a global view of the condition of the plant. This paper describes the implementation and testing of the two major components of the Local Fusion System, namely the novelty detection and the adaptive diagnostic systems. Novelty detection works by using a Kohonen-based neural network(1) to learn the normal operating state of the component that is being modeled, with new values being passed into the network to see if it is similar to the learned normal states of operation. If the new fused sensor values are unlike the values which the Kohonen neural network represents, this is nagged as novel, and the values are passed to the adaptive diagnostic system. The adaptive diagnostic system takes as its input the values that the novelty detection system identified as novel and passes these into the Kohonen-based diagnostic networks. If the diagnostic networks recognize the values then a local diagnosis is given and passed to the Overseer system. If the diagnostic networks do not recognize the values, then these patterns are dynamically learned as the new fault condition occurs, and the diagnostic networks are updated. This system allows fault knowledge for a specific machine to be dynamically built, which can then potentially be applied on other machines of phe same type.

Experimental results from a PWM inverter drive demonstrate the robustness with respect to highly distorted voltage and current waveforms. Under this conditions a cracked bar has been clearly detected. Fault related torque pulsation leads to speed oscillations. This effect is examined with the help of results from both a speed and a torque controlled mode experiment. The field test results do not indicate any noticeable deterioration. Finally, transient load torque is utilized to produce the required rotor currents for fault detection. Although several acceleration cycles are required to excite currents in any rotor bar and data can only be recorded during maximum acceleration the results are remarkably close to the steady state values.

Typical evolutive faults like: phase resistance increase caused by poor contacts, turn-to-turn shortcircuits, unbalanced supply voltages, magnetic circuit ageing and squirrel-cage bar rupture, are taken into consideration. A triphase abc frame it was taken in to consideration for real phase parameters identification. In order to provide the electrical parameters, an identification technique based on currents, voltages and speed acquisition during transients (e.g. starting-up) has been developed on a portable acquisition and post-processing system. The proposed equipment includes: 486 notebook with PCMCIA acquisition board, current clampmeters, voltages probes and signal conditionning module and can be applied to any drive without interfering with operating conditions. Also, a data base software processor was developed for storing and comparison against the reference set of each new parameter set identification, enabling a time evolution behaving. The system can be successfully applied for both periodical preventive maintenance and electrical parameters verification of repaired induction machines.

A real-time feedback system is required to offset deficiencies in perceptual information. This feedback system acquires data from multiple sensors and fuses these data to extract pertinent information within defined time windows. To perform this task, a set of computing components interact with each other resulting in a discrete event dynamic system. In this work, a new discrete event requirements model for sensor fusion has been proposed to ensure logical and temporal correctness of the operation of the real-time diagnostic feedback system. This proposed scheme models system requirements as a Petri net based discrete event dynamic machine. The graphical representation and quantitative analysis of this model has been developed. Having a natural graphical property, this Petri net based model enables the requirements engineer to communicate intuitively with the client to avoid faults in the early phase of the development process. The quantitative analysis helps justify the logical and temporal correctness of the operation of the system. It has been shown that this model can be analyzed to check the presence of deadlock, reachability, and repetitiveness of the operation of the sensor fusion system. This proposed novel technique to model;he requirements of sensor fusion as a discrete event dynamic system has the potential to realize highly reliable real-time diagnostic feedback system for many applications, such as minimally invasive instrumentation.

The test architecture considered is general enough to allow the context and the component to have external inputs and outputs. Using a given fault model for testing in context, conditions are provided to detect all the redundant transitions that do not need to be tested. A complete test suite for the fault model is obtained and a method to select a minimal subset of this test suite with the same fault detection power is then proposed. Furthermore, the proposed method can be used to reduce a test suite produced by human experts while preserving its fault detection power.

Through limiting value reference, it performs however only the assessing of a normally and/or disturbed operating condition and the countermeasures following from that, for example the disengaging of the unit. In contrast to that stands the failure analysis with diagnosis option status. By definition it starts first after a threshold is assessed, at interference or faulty operation condition. Goal is accordingly, to index dates and references to developing faults, future unusual operating condition to call to attention, and in the ideal case the determination of the excitation source. Therewith, for the technical staff and/or the operation control, the possibility arises, already before entrance of an endangering disturbance of production interference, to initiate corresponding countermeasure. As a basis for an effective fault analysis at industrial units, the vibration measurement offers itself. To supervision and diagnosis purposes, the signal delivered by the adapted vibration transducers is processed in the way to receive machine characteristic signatures and fault patterns, with the goal of a subsequent automatically classification including a differentiating statement on the diagnostic condition of the unit to be monitored. State of art are statistical evaluation of time signals and spectra as well as cepstra analysis in frequency domain. Joint information on faulty operation and its source localisation in a complex machine structure offers the correlation analysis. Related to several examples of fan and pump arrangements, the methodical action manner is supposed to be introduced here for a oriented fault determination based on the aimed analysis of in-process vibration signals in combination with correlation to the process parameters.										0	0	0	0	0	V D I-V D E - VERLAG GMBH	DUSSELDORF	PO BOX 10 11 39, W-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	0083-5560		3-18-091425-4	VDI BERICHT			1998	1425						347	358					12	Acoustics; Engineering, Industrial; Engineering, Mechanical	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Acoustics; Engineering	BM07U	WOS:000077553000029					2022-02-14

The problem is especially difficult when the dimensionality of the data is very high, such as the data collected from a paper machine or an entire chemical plant. By projecting the data into a lower dimensional space that more accurately characterizes the state of the process, dimensionality reduction techniques can greatly improve and simplify the process monitoring procedures, fault detection, and isolation. The application of principal component analysis (PCA) as a dimensionality reduction tool for monitoring chemical processes has been studied by several academic and industrial engineers. Although PCA contains certain optimality properties in terms of fault detection, it is not well-suited for fault isolation. Fisher's discriminant analysis (FDA), a dimensionality reduction technique heavily studied in the pattern classification literature, has advantages from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, we develop an information criterion that automatically determines the order of the dimensionality reduction for FDA, and show that FDA is more proficient than PCA for isolating faults, both theoretically and by applying these techniques to paper machine data provided by International Paper and simulated data collected from the Tennessee Eastman problem.

Error detection and recovery are based on the well-known approach of replicating application processes on multiple computers in a network. The advantages of this fault tolerance scheme based on indirect instrumentation include (1) a general error detection method that ensures data integrity for critical data without the need for any modification of code, (2) a high degree of a automation and transparency for fault-tolerant configuration and operation (i.e., the set-lip time for a new application is on the order of a few minutes), and (3) the ability to perform error detection for applications for which no source code or only minimal knowledge of the code is available, including legacy applications. The types of faults that are tolerated include transient and permanent hardware faults on a single machine and certain types of application and OS software faults.

The following types or faults have been considered: sensor faults, and load faults in the synchronous machines. The paper has concluded that for the purpose of fault detection, a simplified synchronous machine model is sufficient. However, in order to isolate the fault, or to obtain the detailed information about the fault, or to estimate the severity of the fault, more detailed mathematical and physical model have to be used.

J	Troeder, C				Troeder, C			Experience with the metrological analyses of comminution machines	ZKG INTERNATIONAL			English	Article								Industrial comminution, systems are subject to a variety of stresses. The alignment of the driveline, the interaction, between individual components or even the dynamic effects of the individual mechanical elements can. place the availability of the entire plant at risk. The majority of unscheduled maintenance measures are very expensive and can cause a complete shutdown of the production line. In this case there is a need for rapid, short-term remedies. However, with complex problems much experience is needed to be able to apply effective remedies. The following article shows how the causes of typical faults in comminution. plants can be identified by measuring and analysing suitable plant parameters, and which remedies should be taken in the individual cases. In addition to faults which can originate from drive systems, couplings, gear units and their gear-root systems, a description is also given of the influence of the process itself as a. source of problems, using the example of the grinding process in a coal mill. The installation of a machine diagnosis and monitoring system is therefore a logical extension. of any preventive maintenance strategy. With the hell, of this system it is possible to detect any damage at an early stage and determine the remaining service life.										0	0	0	0	0	BAUVERLAG GMBH	WALLUF	PRESSEHAUS, AM KLINGENWEG 4A, D-65396 WALLUF, GERMANY	0949-0205			ZKG INT	ZKG Int.		1998	51	3					130	+					12	Construction & Building Technology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Construction & Building Technology; Materials Science	ZK490	WOS:000073326800007					2022-02-14

Our approach detects a linear pattern in preprocessed images via model-based clustering. It employs an approximate Bayes factor which provides a criterion for assessing the evidence for the presence of a defect. The model used in experimentation is a (possibly highly elliptical) Gaussian cloud superimposed on Poisson clutter. Results are shown for some representative examples, and contrasted with a Hough transform. Software for the statistical modeling is available. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Schoen, RR; Habetler, TG				Schoen, RR; Habetler, TG			Evaluation and implementation of a system to eliminate arbitrary load effects in current-based monitoring of induction machines	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1996 Industry-Applications-Society Annual Meeting	OCT 06-10, 1996	SAN DIEGO, CA	Ind Applicat Soc		condition monitoring; load effects; motor	FAULT-DETECTION; ROTOR; MOTOR	This paper presents a method for removing the load effects from the monitored quantity of the machine, Fault conditions in induction machines cause the magnetic field in the airgap of the machine to be nonuniform. This results in harmonics in the stator current of the motor which can be measured in order to determine the health of the motor, However, variations in the load torque which are not related to the health of the machine typically have exactly the same effect on the load current. Previously presented schemes for current-based condition monitoring ignore the load effect or assume it is known, Therefore, a scheme for determining machine health in the presence of a varying load torque requires some method for separating the two effects, This is accomplished by comparing the actual stator current to a model reference value which includes the load effects, The difference between these two signals provides a filtered quantity, independent of variations of the load, that allows continuous on-line condition monitoring to be conducted without concern for the load condition, Simulation and test results illustrate the effects on the spectrum of the monitored quantity for both constant and eccentric airgaps when in the presence of an oscillating load.

J	Paya, BA; Esat, II; Badi, MNM				Paya, BA; Esat, II; Badi, MNM			Artificial neural network based fault diagnostics of rotating machinery using wavelet transforms as a preprocessor	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								The purpose of condition monitoring and fault diagnostics are to detect and distinguish faults occurring in machinery, in order to provide a significant improvement in plant economy, reduce operational and maintenance costs and improve the level of safety. The condition of a model drive-line, consisting of various interconnected rotating parts, including an actual vehicle gearbox, two bearing housings, and an electric motor, all connected via flexible couplings and loaded by a disc brake, was investigated. This model drive-line was run in its normal condition, and then single and multiple faults were introduced intentionally to the gearbox, and to the one of the bearing housings. These single and multiple faults studied on the drive-line were typical bearing and gear faults which may develop during normal and continuous operation of this kind of rotating machinery. This paper presents the investigation carried out in order to study both bearing and gear faults introduced first separately as a single fault and then together as multiple faults to the drive-line. The real time domain vibration signals obtained from the drive-line were preprocessed by wavelet transforms for the neural network to perform fault detection and identify the exact kinds of fault occurring in the model drive-line. It is shown that by using multilayer artificial neural networks on the sets of preprocessed data by wavelet transforms, single and multiple faults were successfully detected and classified into distinct groups.

It is designed to detect the intermittent loss of firing pulses of an individual switching device within the inverter. The mathematical model of the induction machine is linearized in the field-torque coordinates, and the misfiring of the inverter is represented by pulse functions, which have effects in both the field and torque directions. Since the fault considered is of an intermittent nature, the time-domain response of the magnetizing and the torque-producing components of the motor stator current is used to form the condition-monitoring signal. The method is adaptive to changes in the operating point during variable-speed operation. Digital simulation and laboratory experiment are utilized to illustrate the method and to evaluate the computational effort required.

The importance of multiple state-table faults and their advantages as test generation objectives to avoid the need for checking experiments are considered. The proposed procedure is based on a new method for implicit enumeration of large numbers of multiple faults by using incompletely specified faulty machines. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of implicit fault enumeration in detecting large numbers of multiple faults and in guaranteeing detection of all the faults or all the faults up to a specific multiplicity.

J	Wang, LC; Girgis, AA				Wang, LC; Girgis, AA			A new method for power system transient instability detection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER DELIVERY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1996 IEEE/PES Summer Meeting	JUL 28-AUG 01, 1996	DENVER, CO	IEEE Power Engn Soc, PES			REAL-TIME; STABILITY	Reliability and computational simplicity are of primary importance in developing on-line instability detection methods. With regard to these requirements, this paper has proposed a new method for instability detection based on generator angles, angular velocities, and their rates of change. According to the developed method, system instability or out-of-step condition is detected by identifying the characteristics-concave or convex-of a surface on which the post-fault system trajectory lies, The variation mode and probabilistic property of the proposed index are investigated by using the 10 machine 39 bus IEEE test system.

J	Lee, SK; White, PR				Lee, SK; White, PR			Higher-order time-frequency analysis and its application to fault detection in rotating machinery	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							SIGNAL ANALYSIS; KERNELS; SPECTRA	Impulsive acoustic and vibration signals within rotating machinery are often induced by irregular impacting. The detection of these impulses can be useful for fault diagnosis purposes. Recently there has been an increasing trend towards the use of higher-order statistics for fault detection within mechanical systems based on the observation that impulsive signals tend to increase the kurtosis values. This paper considers the use of the third- and fourth-order Wigner moment spectra, called the Wigner bi- and tri-spectra respectively, for analysing such signals. Expressions for the auto- and cross-terms in these distributions are presented and discussed. It is shown that the Wigner trispectrum is a more suitable analysis tool and its performance is compared to its second-order counterpart for detecting impulsive signals. These methods are also applied to measured data sets from a car engine and an industrial gearbox. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

J	Coolen, FPA; Newby, MJ				Coolen, FPA; Newby, MJ			Guidelines for corrective replacement based on low stochastic structure assumptions	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						corrective replacement; exchangeable lifetimes; imprecise probabilities; low stochastic structure; predictive inference	MODELS	This paper presents corrective replacement decisions, e.g. for machines in a production process or other technical systems. In an attempt to base decisions on observed failure times only, some guidelines are provided for replacing failed machines. The method does not provide an optimal strategy in ail situations, indicating that sometimes more information or assumptions are needed. The optimal policy indicates how to act if the low assumptions model recommends action. If the model does not strongly indicate an action, more data need to be collected or more sophisticated modelling is needed. Further modelling would require additional assumptions or input from expert judgements, and could be an expensive exercise. A method that gives clear guidelines if the data are strongly indicative may save time and money. This paper presents the model in an elementary form and is intended as ct first step towards modelling more realistic maintenance situations. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Kohler, I; Sausen, R; Reinberger, R				Kohler, I; Sausen, R; Reinberger, R			Contributions of aircraft emissions to the atmospheric NOx content	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						AERONOX; lightning; man-made NOx sources; chemistry module; GCM	HIGH-ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT; TROPOSPHERIC OZONE; NITROGEN-OXIDES; CLIMATE MODEL; STRATOSPHERE; IMPACT; CIRCULATION; TRANSPORT; AEROSOL	The relative contribution of aircraft emissions to the total atmospheric NOx content is studied by means of the atmosphere general circulation model ECHAM, which was extended by a simplified (linear) NOx chemistry module with NOx and HNO3 as prognostic variables. NOx originates from fossil Fuel combustion, biomass burning, soil microbial activity, lightning, degradation of N2O in the stratosphere, and aircraft emissions. NOx and HNO3 are removed by dry deposition, HNO3 additionally by wet deposition. A simulation in seasonal cycle mode was performed. Both the resulting January and July mean distributions of NOx and the relative contributions of the different sources to the total atmospheric NOx burden are analysed, including their uncertainty ranges. NOx emissions from aircraft cause a significant change to the background NOx concentration. During January more than 60% of the NOx emissions found in the region between 30 and 60 degrees N, and 175-325 hPa arise from aircraft. The maximum value in the North Atlantic flight corridor is found to be larger than 85%. During July, aircraft emissions contribute only about 20% to the NOx burden in this region. In January and July the uncertainty ranges of these contributions are 42-80% and 10-37%, respectively. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The prime objective of a power transmission network is to supply power to the customers and to meet the lend demands. When a fault occurs in a transmission network, it must be identified and eliminated as soon as possible. Since control centres are flooded with hundreds of alarm messages during a fault, fault diagnosis, which involves the analysis of alarm messages, is a time consuming task. Faults in a power network are caused by various environmental conditions which change with time and their diagnosis involves real time decision making which cannot be modelled by using traditional mathematical modelling techniques. Earlier research suggested that decision-support systems can aid system controllers during emergency situations. Artificial intelligence techniques such as expert systems, neural networks and model based reasoning have been used in the past but these techniques lack efficiency when applied to large systems such as power networks. As part of our an going research towards the development of an intelligent architecture for fault diagnosis, we attempt to develop an efficient model by combining two reasoning techniques (model-based and heuristic) and incorporating a machine learning algorithm called Explanation Eased Generalisation (EBG) for automated knowledge acquisition. The machine learning algorithm learns shallow knowledge from the reasoning process of the combined (or hybrid) model and stores it for future problem solving. In this paper, the developed hybrid fault diagnosis system is discussed and its performance is compared with the traditional model based reasoning approach.

Existing machine condition monitoring systems consider each diagnostic index separately. Development of art automated diagnostic procedure that considers simultaneously several diagnostic indices is the objective of the present paper. The multivariable trend analysis of on-line vibration signals is deployed as the basis for this procedure.

Traditional plasma etch variables such as pressures, gas flows, temperatures, RF power, etc. are combined with a generalized representation of the time dependent effects of maintenance events to predict film etch rates, uniformity, and selectivity. A cascade neural-network model is developed using 15 months of data divided into train, test, and validation sets. The neural model both fits the validation data well and captures the nonuniformity in the in-control region of the machine. Two control algorithms use this model in a predictive configuration to identify input state changes, including maintenance events, to bring an out-of-control situation back into control. The overall goal of the optimization is to reduce equipment downtime and decrease cost of ownership of the tool by speeding up response time and extending the lifetime of consumable parts. The optimization routines were tested on 11 out-of-control situations and successfully suggested reasonable low-cost solutions to each for bringing the system back into control.

J	Hall, DL; Hansen, RJ; Lang, DC				Hall, DL; Hansen, RJ; Lang, DC			The negative information problem in mechanical diagnostics	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	41st International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition	JUN 10-13, 1996	BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND				FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DYNAMIC-SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORK	Condition-based maintenance (CBM) is an emerging technology, which seeks to develop sensors and processing systems aimed at monitoring the operation of complex machinery, such as turbine engines, rotor craft drivetrains, and industrial equipment. The goal of CBM systems is to determine the state of the Equipment (i.e., the mechanical health and status), and to predict the remaining useful life for the system being monitored. The success of such systems depends upon a number of factors, including: (1) the ability to design or use robust sensors for measuring relevant phenomena such as vibration, acoustic spectra, infrared emissions, oil debris, etc.; (2) real-rime processing of the sensor data to extract useful information (such as features or data characteristics) in a noisy environment and to detect parametric changes that might be indicative of impending failure conditions; (3) fusion of multi-sensor data to obtain improved information beyond that available to a single sensor; (4) micro and macro level models, which predict the temporal evolution of failure phenomena; and finally, (5) the capability to perform automated approximate reasoning to interpret the results of the sensor measurements, processed data, and model predictions in the context of an operational environment. The latter capability is the focus of this paper. Although numerous techniques have emerged from the discipline of artificial intelligence for automated reasoning (e.g., rule-based expert systems, blackboard systems, case-based reasoning, neural networks, etc.), none of these techniques are able to satisfy all of the requirements for reasoning about condition-based maintenance. This paper provides an assessment of automated reasoning techniques for CBM and identifies a particular problem for CBM, namely, the ability to reason with negative information (viz., data which by their absence are indicative of mechanical status and health). A general architecture is introduced for CBM automated reasoning, which hierarchically combines implicit and explicit reasoning techniques. Initial experiments with fuzzy logic are also described.

In this procedure, the condition monitoring is performed based on the on-line vibration measurements, and further, the fault quantification is formulated into a multivariate trend analysis. Self-organizing neural networks are then deployed to perform the multivariable trending of the fault development. The attributes for the disordering of ''knots'' in the trend analysis are determined. The disordering of neural network units is then eliminated by suitably altering the self-organizing neural network algorithm. Applications of this diagnostic procedure to the condition monitoring and life estimation of a bearing system are fully developed and demonstrated. The efficiency and advantages of the intelligent diagnostic procedure in precisely monitoring and quantifying the fault development are systematically brought out considering this bearing system.

J	Bohez, ELJ; Thieravarut, M				Bohez, ELJ; Thieravarut, M			Expert system for diagnosing computer numerically controlled machines: A case-study	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						CNC; diagnosis; expert system; rule ordering		Efficient diagnosing of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine is considered to be a very important component of modern manufacturing systems. It requires knowledge and expertise that are difficult or sometimes impossible to find in human experts. An expert system is proposed to overcome this problem. The diagnostic model used in this study is a hybrid reasoning approach between a deep model and a shallow model. The shallow model which represents the heuristic knowledge is provided in two different ways: a fault direct access heuristic and a heuristic for search boundary generation (for the deep model). The structure and behavior of the CNC system, or the deep knowledge, use the general deep reasoning strategy to locate the fault exactly. The hybrid reasoning approach provides an efficient and effective diagnostic model. The main objective of this paper is to propose the use of a logic interpretation of the ladder diagrams and the electrical diagrams of CNC machines for the deep model to define the fault location. Other technical knowledge of CNC machines is necessary to accomplish this process. The knowledge base of the prototype system developed in this study is production rule based; it consists of approximately 500 rules. A condition-based forward-chaining concept and a rule-ordering concept are used. These concepts reduce the knowledge base size. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Spoerre, JK				Spoerre, JK			Application of the cascade correlation algorithm (CCA) to bearing fault classification problems	COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY			English	Article						neural network; fault diagnostics; machine monitoring; cascade correlation algorithm	DIAGNOSIS; NETWORKS	The impact of machine breakdowns and failures on factory productivity and product quality is an important concern for manufacturing industries, For this reason, predictive maintenance techniques are being investigated extensively as a method of decreasing machine downtime and enhancing production reliability. With increasing attention on neural network technologies, there is an interest in the application of such networks to manufacturing operations, including predictive maintenance challenges. This paper focuses on applying the cascade correlation algorithm (CCA) in predicting specific bearing faults. In the experimental procedure, a set of vibration signals are collected and used in training the CCA. Each vibration signal contains unique information about the particular machine condition that is occurring. From the results of the experiments provided in the paper, the CCA is shown to be a viable network structure for identifying several different bearing conditions utilizing a minimum network structure without a compromise in accuracy.

Four longitudinal experiments were conducted with a simplified but representative thermal-hydraulic process simulation. These experiments investigated the impact of four behaviour-shaping constraints that can influence operator adaptation: interface content, interface form, type of training, and pre-existing competencies. The findings obtained from the research program are summarized, and a number of implications for the design and operation of process-control systems are suggested.

This paper presents a new strategy for adaptive out-of-step protection of synchronous generators based on neural networks. The paper describes the neural networks architecture adopted as well as the selection of input features for training the neural networks. A feed forward model of the neural network based on the stochastic back-propagation training algorithm has been used to predict the out-of-step condition. Due to power network configuration changes, the performance of the protective relays can vary. Consequently, a new adaptive out-of-step protection strategy is suggested in this paper. This depends firstly on detecting the case of the system through case detection neural networks by some pre-fault local measurements at the machine to be protected, and then calculating the new out-of-step condition through an adaptive routine. The capabilities of the developed adaptive out-of-step prediction algorithm have been tested through computer simulation for a typical case study. The results of using the proposed algorithm demonstrate the adaptability of the proposed strategy.

J	Fyfe, KR; Munck, EDS				Fyfe, KR; Munck, EDS			Analysis of computed order tracking	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article								Vibration analysis of rotating machinery is an important part of industrial predictive maintenance programmes, so that wear and defects in moving parts can be discovered and repaired before the machine breaks down, thus reducing operating and maintenance costs. One method of vibration analysis is known as order tracking. This is a frequency analysis method that uses multiples of the running speed (orders), instead of absolute frequencies (Hz), as the frequency base. Order tracking is useful for machine condition monitoring because it can easily identify speed-related vibrations such as shaft defects and bearing wear. To use order tracking analysis, the vibration signal must be sampled at constant increments of shaft angle. Conventional order tracking data acquisition uses special analog hardware to sample at a rate proportional to the shaft speed. A computed order tracking method samples at a constant rate (i.e. uniform Delta t), and then uses software to resample the data at constant angular increments. This study examines which factors and assumptions, inherent in this computed order tracking method, have the greatest effect on its accuracy. Both classical and computed methods were evaluated and compared using a digitial simulation. It was found that the method is extremely sensitive to the timing accuracy of the keyphasor pulses and that great improvements in the spectral accuracy were observed when making use of higher-order interpolation functions.

J	Schoen, RR; Habetler, TG				Schoen, RR; Habetler, TG			A new method of current-based condition monitoring in induction machines operating under arbitrary load conditions	ELECTRIC MACHINES AND POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article								Fault conditions in induction machines such as eccentric air gaps and broken rotor bars result ire harmonics in the stator current of the motor which can be used to monitor the health of the machine. However, variations in the load torque at multiples of rotational speed typically have the same effect on the motor current spectrum. When monitoring a single phase of the stator current, this load effect can prevent the detection of a fault condition by producing current components that obscure those harmonics related to the condition of the machine. This paper presents a new method for removing the load effects from the monitored quantity of the machine. This is accomplished by comparing the actual stator current to a model reference value which includes the load effect. Simulation results illustrating the effects on the spectrum of the monitored quantity are given for both constant and eccentric air gaps when in the presence of an oscillating load.

The drawbacks of this approach are mostly related to the knowledge elicitation through laborious enumeration of the tree structure and ad hoc threshold selection for symptoms definition. These problems can be alleviated if a more profound knowledge of the process is brought into play. The main idea of the paper consists of modeling the nominal and faulty states of the plant by means of interval-like component models derived from first-principles laws, e.g. the conservation law. Such a model serves to simulate the entire system under different fault conditions, in order to obtain the representative patterns of measurable process quantities, i.e. training examples. To march these patterns by diagnostic rules, multistrategy machine learning is applied. As a result, binary decision trees that relate symptoms to faults are obtained, along with the thresholds defining the symptoms, This technique is applied to a laboratory test process operating in the steady state, and is shown to be suitable for handling incipient single faults. The proposed learning approach is compared with two related machine learning methods, It is found that it achieves similar classification accuracy with better transparency of the resulting diagnostic system.

This paper presents a recovery method based upon the theory of a fuzzy finite state machine. A fuzzy specification is given for the bounds within which an autonomous agent is capable to recover after an unexpected situation has occurred in ifs environment. If has been shown that the three main components of the recovery problem: (i) fault detection, (ii) fault recovery, and (iii) the properties of the actuator / sensor gear of an autonomous agent are interrelated The suggested method can be implemented either by an application-independent software algorithm, or by fuzzy logic hardware.

A fuzzy-based neural network paradigm with an on-line learning algorithm is developed to perform expert advising for the ground-based maintenance crew. A hierarchical fault diagnosis architecture is advocated to fulfill the time-critical and on-board needs in different levels of structural integrity over a global operating envelope. The research objective is to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed health monitoring procedure through numerical simulations of bearing faults in USAF MH-53J PAVE LOW helicopter transmissions. The proposed fault detection, identification and accommodation architecture is applicable to various generic rotorcraft machines. The proposed system will greatly reduce the operational and developmental costs and serve as an essential component in an autonomous control system.

These models can be used as one step ahead predictors allowing comparison of signals for the purposes of fault detection and diagnosis. From the prediction error, features can be extracted and used to determine the machine's condition. In this paper, the higher-order statistics of the error time series are extracted and used to compare vibration time series. Vibration data from a rotating shaft placed under different fault conditions were used for training and testing models. A statistical approach which assesses the probability that a fault has occurred is used and results indicate that this approach could be used to diagnose known conditions and even detect unknown faults.

An FMS can be modeled by the Colored Timed Petri Net (CTPN). However, the CTPN models of most FMSs lack the activities of the statistical process control (SPC) and fault diagnosis, and they lead to the incomplete FMSs' CTPN models. In this paper, the CTPN-based SPC, and fault diagnosis models are proposed to model the FMSs':SPC and fault diagnosis behaviors. Since the models depend on the measured data from the inspection machines and the sensors' data from the devices, the CTPN-based SPC and fault diagnosis models can be incorporated into the production CTPN models to give a complete model of FMSs' activities. It will be shown the CTPN-based fault diagnosis is easy to model, and the results are straightforward.

This is because it is economically unacceptable to shut down expensive production equipment due to tribological failures. There is considerable concern that many industries appear To be uncertain regarding these issues. The strategy for integrated machine wear control should be to use only those tests that are relevant. Acquisition of reliable and trendable data is vital to this concept and its management. Machine wear control incorporating spectrometry, fluid condition, diagnostic ferrography, lubricant contaminant monitoring, vibration, thermography and performance analysis allows a rational approach to failure prevention. When incorporated with failure potential analysis, it can often provide a safe interchange from scheduled so on-condition maintenance. This paper outlines the most significant analysis methods and provides basic guidelines for their integration. It also explains how this approach can provide maximum benefits, if undertaken correctly.

Because of different materials, loaded in an extended level of varieties which additionally suffer under different corrosion attack condition, the dilemma is arising how to assess reliably the allowable fault size in different weld joint parts. The presence of faults is obvious but the possibilities to reveal them are limited and not always possible. For the structure capacity of bearing under high loading the weld joint faults size and their distribution are the essential parameters. The larger the allowable fault size anticipated, the safer the welded structure, the easiest the detection of the fault size by NDE methods can be. Thus, for assessing the safety of complex loaded welded structure, machine parts or equipment life time, it is obligatory to consider the requirements of different ''Fitness for Purpose'' systems. The article presents the possibility of assessing the detected fault by means of NDE if the material fracture toughness of the area where the fatigue crack tip located is known. The fatigue crack represents the severest possible discontinuity that can occur in a welded joint. The principles of IIW Guidance on Assessment of The Fitness for Purpose of Welded Structures - IIW/IIS-SST-1157-90 and BS PD 6493 and separately ET model that treats mis-matched weld joints are shown and used.

In spite of using the best design available, failures of components or subsystems in such systems can not be totally eliminated. For such systems, there is a need to detect faults in the critical components/subsystems in time, otherwise these faults may cause serious degradation of performance of the main system. Even if such components/subsystems show faults, the faults can only be detected by inspection. There may be a delay between the detection of a fault first time and the actual occurrence of die failure. During this delay period the output coming out of the system will be inferior to the regular output and hence there will be a loss of revenue. if frequent inspections are conducted, such loss of revenue could be reduced, but due to the increased number of inspections the inspection costs will increase. In this paper a model has been presented which would help in deciding an optimum number of inspections and the optimal sequence in which these inspections are to be carried out in order to minimize tile total cost of inspections, inspection replacements and failure replacements per cycle. An example showing the application of the model has also been given at the end of the paper.

Preventive maintenance can achieve these goals by minimizing the machines' downtime, protecting operators from accidents and reducing the inventory. This kind of maintenance can be established by having an intelligent machine condition monitoring system which can provide an early warning of unhealthy machines, identify the type of faults and predict the life span of a defective machine. Recently, neural networks have become popular tools in the development of such intelligent system. For the purposes of detecting machine faults, Back Propagation network (BP) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) network have been employed. To further enhance the robustness of fault diagnosis, the theory of Harmony is added to neural networks so that high confidence can be achieved even when machine has little history to learn or operated with the existence of disturbance. Results have shown that LVQ network embedded with Harmony performs the best in fault classification. For predicting the life span of machines, recurrent neural network has been used and its performance outweighs other feed-forward type neural networks or autoregressive methods. The aim of this paper is to introduce a robust fault diagnostic system for machines by using LVQ network with Harmony. Recurrent neural network not only can be used in predicting the life span of a machine but also extended to other applications such as sales and economic forecasting.

For fault classification only a small subset of the coefficients are relevant. A new approach is presented for machinery fault classification that uses AR coefficient vectors but performs dimension reduction before classification, utilizing techniques from statistics and pattern recognition communities. The hybrid approach is illustrated by analyzing the Westland helicopter transmission vibration signal data set. The data consist of 8 accelerometer signals for each of 68 no-fault and seeded-fault runs on the aft transmission of a CH-46E helicopter. The effect of different dimension-reduction and classification techniques on fault classification is studied. For the comparison the Kolmogorov-Smirnov separability test and classification performance are used. This approach drastically reduces the training data requirements and complexity of classifiers. These results should advance the performance of HUMS systems and bring us closer to adequately addressing prognostics for complex machinery.

The research is aimed at the improvement of product quality in commercial injection molding systems. A significant enhancement has been achieved in the level of application of visually based inspection techniques to component quality. The aim of the research has been the investigation, and employment, of inspection methods that use knowledge based machine vision. The application of such techniques in this context is comprehensive, extending from object oriented analysis, design and programming of the inspection program, to the application of rule based reasoning, to image interpretation, vision system diagnostics, component diagnostics and molding machine control. In this way, knowledge handling methods are exploited wherever they prove to be beneficial. The vision knowledge base contains information on the procedures required to achieve successful identification of component surface defects. A collection of image processing and pattern recognition algorithms are applied selectively. Once inspection of the component has been performed, defects are related to process variables which affect the quality of the component, and another knowledge base is used to effect a control action at the molding machine. Feedback from other machine sensors is also used to direct the control procedure. Results from the knowledge based vision inspection system are encouraging. They indicate that rapid and effective fault detection and analysis is feasible, as is the verification of system integrity.

Recently there is an increasing trend towards the use of higher order statistics for fault detection within mechanical systems based on the observation that impulsive signals tend to increase the kurtosis values. We show that the fourth order Wigner Moment Spectrum, called the Wigner Trispectrum, has superior detection performance to the second order Wigner distribution for typical impulsive signals found in a condition monitoring application. These methods are also applied to data sets measured within a car engine and industrial gearbox.

Condition monitoring by lubricant analysis is one of the basic tools of a predictive maintenance program along with vibration monitoring, performance monitoring and thermography. In today's modern power generation, manufacturing, refinery, transportation, mining, and military operations, the cost of equipment maintenance, service, and lubricants are ever increasing. Parts, labor, equipment downtime and lubricant prices and disposal costs are a primary concern in a well run maintenance management program. Machine condition monitoring based on oil analysis has become a prerequisite in most maintenance programs. Few operations can afford !lot to implement a program if they wish to remain competitive, and in some cases, profitable. This paper describes a comprehensive Machine Condition Monitoring Program based on oil analysis. Actual operational condition monitoring programs will be used to review basic components and analytical requirements. Case histories will be cited as examples of cost savings, reduced equipment downtime and increased efficiencies of maintenance programs through a well managed oil analysis program.

Two coupled state observers, one for the induction machine and another for the mechanical load, are used to detect and recognize fault-specific behaviors (fault signatures) from the real-time measurements of the rotor angular velocity and terminal voltages and currents. Practical applicability of the method is verified in full-scale experiments with a conveyor belt drive at SSAB, Lulea Works.

The four interlinked approaches for data collection are simple fault simulation, finite element method simulation, test rig simulation and real data gathering. This approach makes it possible to vary such parameters as type and structure of the machinery in question, together with the operational parameters such as running speed, load and environmental factors. The models are optimized to ensure that the data is representative of real machine vibrations, both in healthy and faulty condition. The data is then used to develop diagnostic modules, utilising neural networks, expert systems and other techniques, and to provide diagnostic advice on the health of the machine.

These unavoidable process conditions often disturb the whole setup and there is every possibility to miss important and relevant information. Standards for overall monitoring as well as for peak-amplitudes responsible for root cause identification are not always available because these machines are 'custom designed' and manufacturer's standards are of paramount importance to consider. The health of these machines cannot be assessed by simply comparing with the international standards unlike most common machines such as fans, pumps, motors etc. with minimum number of auxiliaries. There may also be limitations in the features of the instruments used for the purpose. In this paper, an attempt has been made to setup a monitoring approach for screw compressor which will help the industries initially setting base-line data to implement vibration analysis based off-line predictive maintenance programme either with the help of an analyser or with a latest software.

Today still most systems require an experienced expert and a lot of time to carry out the analysis and conclude if it is a problem or not, what type and how serious. Next steps is to compare with previous measurements, conclude the severity, carry out the trend analysis in order to tell how long time the machinery still can operate safe, and finally advise the action required.

One of the most popular methods for monitoring is the use of vibration analysis techniques, which have quite a good performance in most of the machine types. However, this performance may be improved combining simultaneously some other monitoring technique, such as acoustic emission monitoring. The use of these two methods of monitoring has made it possible to develop an expert system for the diagnosis of a wide range of rotating machinery. This system can detect a series of defects in certain types of machines, and has the capability to be improved increasing the number of machines and defects detected.

It means that any manifestations of mechanical failures do not have to show themselves only in mechanical quantities, i.e. vibration in our case. Mechanical failures can also manifest themselves in electrical quantities, namely in electric current in our case. This statement is valid inversely too, which means that faults occurring in electric circuits can be measured through mechanical quantities. This paper deals with measuring the current spectra of induction motors with short circuited armatures that are drives used in the industries most.

In a control room, it is difficult to recognize accidents such as fires, fuel oil leaks, and unusual sounds, at a moment's notice. Maintenance operators, therefore, have to patrol the plant yard to find them. To eliminate the need for patrols, the need for automatic monitoring systems to detect such accidents is increasing. A new intelligent monitoring system has been developed, using advanced image and sound analysis, which is linked to human senses, to realize the request. This system can detect oil and steam leaks from burners, unusual sounds from machines, and fire and smoke in the vicinity. This paper describes the system outline, features, and methods of image processing and sound analysis.

Planned Maintenance (PM) and Condition Directed or Predictive Maintenance (PdM) are examples of successful, broad use, proven practice. Condition assessment, lifetime prediction and diagnostic analysis based on vibration characteristics, operating fluid (lubricating and hydraulic oil) quality and condition, operating and electrical performance and thermography provide vital support. Today, there is growing recognition that single technology solutions, no matter how well implemented, are insufficient to produce results required to meet the demands of modern, high intensity, operations. There is a clear need for an overall, guiding concept. The concept must incorporate current "best practice" maintenance and fully integrate all elements of equipment information. Information exchange with unit management and information systems is a necessity. Likewise, a compelling what and why to justify "how to" practice and technology is essential. Many progressive visionaries are introducing a concept that some are beginning to call Asset Management. As typically presented, Asset Management is a strategic concept that goes beyond maintenance to include critical factors that influence performance, fix cost and ultimately determine the prime objective - availability. These include specification, design, installation, safety, operation, economics, organization, maintainability, work practices and training. Information, or more specifically the integration, exchange and display of information is a key component. Current and projected condition, supplied by multiple condition assessment systems and operating performance, conveys vital information. Design specifications, manufacturers' manuals, maintenance history, troubleshooting and task instructions, operating and maintenance recommendations (decision support) and lifecycle costs are other examples of crucial information. All must be immediately available and displayed intuitively for a broad range of users. All have observed the unification, information access and intuitive display achieved by Microsoft Windows. The Internet is another example. The same principles must be extended to equipment asset management. The only question is how. There is a solution. Demand open, self integrating, information systems. Vibration, lubricating oil, performance and electrical analysis systems that can freely exchange information between themselves, maintenance management and control systems. Think this is impossible? Personal computers seem to do very well with office applications. MIMOSA, The Machinery Information Management Open Systems Alliance, has demonstrated feasibility with a multi supplier open exchange of vibration data. Suppliers are committed. All that is needed now is user demand to complete the vital task. This presentation will summarize the necessity for and elements of change required to optimize the performance and availability of equipment assets. The advantages of fully integrated information as a fundamental element of success will be explored in depth. Details and current status of MIMOSA, an industry effort to gain open information exchange, will be presented.

The approach supplements the original vibration, which is caused by the machine's operation, with a low level impulse induced by a small exciter built into or attached to the machine. The principle by which the impulse is able to obtain information concerning the machine internal components is similar to the action of sonar, because it relies on the feedback from the exciter signal after it travels through the machine and returns. Unfortunately, this process takes place in a mechanically "noisy" environment that nearly overwhelms the impulse return signal. Therefore, the returning structure-borne sound signal is time-averaged to filter out nearly everything except items that correlate with the randomly applied impulses. A Fourier transform of the time-averaged result produces clean frequency spectra containing natural frequency peaks. From the shape of these peaks, individual component dynamic characteristics can be determined, operational forces can be inferred, and a great many issues can be evaluated which are key to machinery health assessment and prognosis. Such issues include bearing and seal stiffness and implied wear, and existence of cracks in shafts or their supporting structures.

Prognostics involves monitoring to ascertain the current health of a machine in combination with predictive modeling, and implies the ability to confidently predict remaining life under a range of operating conditions so as to guarantee operation for a minimum One under extreme conditions. Development of efficient numerical models of material damage accumulation and component failure are key parts of a prognostics capability. Such models need not approach perfect fidelity, as errors can be detected by monitoring, but must be accurate enough to guarantee safe operation over some time window into the future. A hierarchical modeling approach is being developed to address this need, with the following features : (1) local material failure is modeled approximately using continuum damage mechanics; (2) component failure is modeled through numerical solution of representative boundary value problems; and (3) system failure is modeled dynamically by representing individual components as discrete elements having associated damage states. Damage mechanics solutions for individual components are used to define characteristic "component damage modes," which are used to construct low-order component models for use in system simulation. These simulations are used to identify system failure modes and accompanying observables, as well as to assess remaining life.

High pressure hydraulic pumps, the type used to provide the power for heavy equipment and robots, can be completely destroyed if they are allowed to cavitate for even a few hours. Similar results are true for feedwater pumps in steam power applications and hydraulic power units for aircraft controls. While cavitation is obvious to any mechanic standing near a pump which is cavitating, it is difficult to diagnosis if the pump is being operated remotely or is just one piece of equipment among many. The goal of this work is to develop an on-line condition monitoring tool to detect the occurrence of cavitation in hydraulic pumps using expert system technology, and to communicate that condition to operators and management using an intelligent user interface. The method of cavitation detect presented here involves developing a linear discriminant function of five variables. These five variables are state variables which would normally be available in many applications, i.e., pressures, temperatures, and flow rate. This approach is shown to be successful from tests run on a hydraulic system. In addition, the use of on-line cavitation detection is presented in the context of it being only one of several system attributes monitored as part of an integrated real-time machine health assessment system (condition monitoring). The goal of the system is to provide on-line intelligent predictive maintenance capability thus saving time and money on mission critical systems.

The goals of this system are to provide increased machinery diagnostic/prognostic capability at a time when available maintenance manpower is being reduced. The system will provide increased mission readiness and support maintenance scheduling by providing an accurate, autonomous assessment of machinery condition. This open diagnostic/prognostic system does not focus on a single condition based maintenance technology but is designed to combine multiple, diagnostic/prognostic approaches that will, individually, provide different information about the machinery's condition. This system is designed to blend multiple approaches and will also accept new technologies and algorithms as they are developed or become available. Sensor and sensor validation algorithms will be designed and chosen that provide reliability, redundancy and low cost. Local processors will be used to autonomously and continuously collect data and monitor the chilled water plant components. A centralized processing and data repository will also provide prognostic results to maintenance personnel. This paper will discuss the three sub-systems of the diagnostic/prognostic system: sensors, Data Concentrators (DCs) and the Prognostics/Diagnostic Monitoring Engine (PDME).

However, to adequately model the signals large model orders have been used due to the presence of intermodulation and other sources of noise. We have developed a new approach for machinery fault classification through AR modeling followed by dimension reduction, utilizing techniques prevalent in the statistics and pattern recognition communities. The goal is to enhance those features of the AR-coefficient vector that contribute the most to the classification of faults. We describe the details of our hybrid approach and illustrate it by analyzing the Westland helicopter transmission vibration signal data set. The data consist of 8 accelerometer signals for each of 68 no-fault and seeded-fault runs on the aft transmission of a CH-46E helicopter. We first show that each data channel exhibits stationarity, which permits us to split each file into multiple 1-second segments for processing. This reduces processing time and provides for additional training data, allowing us to obtain statistically significant results. Classification performance is very dependent on the accelerometer used for generating features; as expected, the accelerometer closest to the faulty component provides the most information about the fault. We then compare the effect of different dimension-reduction techniques on fault classification. We show that for higher-order AR vectors all the dimension reduction techniques give comparable results. But, for lower-order AR vectors non-parametric methods result in greater fault separability at the cost of greater computation. Finally, we suggest a fault classification method suitable for real-time operation where low order AR modeling is followed by dimension reduction and non-parametric classification. Here, each part is a linear operation, and therefore, can be combined into a single linear operation, thereby saving greatly in complexity. These results should further the performance of CBM systems and bring us closer to adequately addressing prognostics for complex machinery.

Vibration spectral data indicated amplitudes at specific frequencies that were low compared to vibration levels for most other machines, but high relative to normal for this case. Routine monitoring with the deployed Expert System provided early detection and diagnosis, and tracked the degradation until corrective action was required. Subsequent inspection of the gearbox revealed a condition that warranted immediate correction to avoid extreme costs. This paper describes the method used to detect the fault, the inspection results, and the benefits derived from such an approach.

In the support and maintenance of shipboard machinery and equipment, preemptive maintenance will provide ships' personnel with the ability to act on potential machine failure and repair/replacement situations before shutdown and operational crisis can occur. A Preemptive Maintenance system combines the concepts of equipment Intrinsic Health Monitoring (IHM) (a form of condition monitoring) and Predictive Maintenance (PDM) in a manner which produces optimum efficiency in equipment functional operation as well as optimizing logistics in support of operations. The integration of this kind of an equipment "health" status system within the framework of functional performance will provide a ship's "equipment situation report" with fewer manhours spent in equipment surveillance and will provide greater assurance of continued faultless machinery operation. The great benefit of an IHM system as applied to ship operation is the system console presentation that continued "fail-free" operation can be expected over a future demand period. (The assurance of planned operations without interruption.) In addition, remote observation of impending problems at a central maintenance support facility can assist in the diagnosis of the problem and the most efficient corrective action.

A growing body of machine types is being serviced with file filters to remove the fine wear particulates from the circulating oil leaving none for traditional oil analysis to measure. Benefits of fine filtration are gained in machine life, but failure warning is thereby lost. Warning and condition monitoring functions may be restored with the aid of bench top or portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) instrumentation for analyzing the wear debris collected as a thin layer on membrane filters. For coarsely filtered machines, a drawn oil sample of a few milliliters is membrane-filtered and x-ray analyzed. For finely filtered machines, the wear particulates are fist recovered from the machine's in-line filter, for example by Humphrey's straightforward and rapid technique, and then refiltered onto a membrane. Thus, the same bench top x-ray instrument can serve multiple machines with varying filtration specifications. The x-ray measurements indicate wear rates for each of the over two dozen elements of interest and are useful for identifying worn engine modules and components, while providing as much as 100 hours advanced warning of impending failure and affording new opportunities for management of operations and maintenance.

The development of this technology includes image analysis, on-line sensors, Ferrogram Scanners, portable screening tools, automated oil analysis screening tools, electronic transfer of evaluation results, and artificial intelligence. Wear is the inevitable consequence of surface contact between machine parts such as shafts, bearings, gears, and bushing...even in properly lubricated systems. Equipment life expectancies, safety factors, performance ratings and maintenance recommendations are predicated on normally occurring wear. However, such factors as design complexity, unit size, intricate assembly configurations, and variations in operating conditions and environments can make maintenance or repair needs (ordinary or emergency) difficult to evaluate or detect without taking equipment out of service. Modern integrated and automated high speed machine systems make any interval of down time costly and non-productive. This is why non-interceptive diagnostic techniques such spectrometric oil analysis, vibration analysis, motor current analysis, and ferrography (wear particle analysis) are increasingly being applied in the power, process, semiconductor and manufacturing industries. Machine designers and builders are increasingly using wear analysis as a realistic criterion for improvements in products such as compressors, gears, bearings and turbine components. This paper will describe the wear particle analysis technology and it's effect working with other predictive maintenance tools within industry.

Neural nets, for example, which must be trained with a priori data, encode a (generally) non-linear transformation via a set of weights associated with the network architecture. By contrast, explicit automated reasoning techniques, such as rule-based expert systems or logical template systems, encode explicit knowledge gained from maintenance personnel or system designers to allow interpretation of fault conditions based on the values of observed data. An automated reasoning technique that has been found useful is a hybrid approach which combines implicit and explicit automated reasoning techniques. In particular, a set of fuzzy logic rules are first developed to reason about fault conditions based on information obtained from knowledgeable maintenance personnel. Next, a neural network is trained to represent the rules. Finally, the neural net is supplied with examples of real data for fault and non-fault conditions and allowed to evolve or re-learn to adapt to the supplied data. The resulting hybrid neural network is more robust than could be obtained by simply training the neural network from sample data alone. Moreover, it is possible (by inspection) to derive rules from the neural network which are usually more concise and robust than the original rules. These features facilitate accurate assessment of fault conditions in a machine, which is essential for predicting the remaining useful life of the machine.

Such information is invaluable for prognostic purposes. The methodology presented herein focuses on the analysis of vibration signals induced by gears and bearings and, specifically, on a means of extracting from such vibration patterns amplitude and phase modulation signals. Such modulation terms, we conjecture, are simple indicators of the severity of a particular type of localized component defect. We show that such amplitude and phase modulation information can be extracted using a neural network computational methodology that relies on nothing more than knowledge of the bearing geometry and the frequency tories at which a given type of defect will manifest itself. We present numerical simulation examples and show that the technique requires extremely few a priori assumptions.

This paper will provide some insight as to how one develops such a capability using wavelet-based fault monitoring and diagnostic kernels. Essentially, the underpinnings of such a capability result from the ability to 1) develop robust wavelet-based parameters related to an underlying assessment of the operational machine model, 2) rapid extraction of wavelet-based vectors containing the desired individual parameters and 3) post-processing of the raw outputs of a globally trained, nonlinear classifier (e.g. backpropagation neural network) for tracking of the evolving failure through feature space. This paper explores this technique by applying it to a digitized vibration record of an evolving gas turbine blade tip failure obtained during cycle testing of an General Electric F100-GE-129 turbofan gas turbine.

True Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM), however, requires the identification and tracking of the sensor observables capable of detecting the faults and the ability to relate these variables to the overall health and remaining useful life of the machine. Thus, as part of a larger-scale research program in CBM for machinery, a Mechanical Diagnostics Test Bed (MDTB) was constructed to provide data on a commercial transmission as its health progresses from new to faulted and finally to failure. The paper presents a full description of the MDTB research station and its instrumentation. The generation of continuous run/good-to-bad gearbox transitional data will be used to determine appropriate data fusion and approximate reasoning techniques that result in the identification and detection of precursors to failure. The MDTB will also provide a test and evaluation vehicle for emerging prognostic time-to-failure/remaining life prediction algorithms and advanced sensors developed either at Penn State or by other participating researchers.

It takes into consideration the various stages of the life cycle of a system from a diagnosis-orientated point of view and from a methodological one. Holistic modelling is the key to the methodology discussed. The holistic model includes the life behaviour (slow-time coordinate) as well as the classical dynamics (expressed with the fast-time coordinate). Diagnosis is based on mathematical models dependent oil discrete life times of the system which perform a system condition assessment in the past and in the present through an adjusted mathematical model (adaptive model), and for the future by the use of prediction with the help of adaptive models. The principle part of the paper is the knowledge base in the form of verified and validated mathematical models which are adjusted to the states of the system at current life times. These models describe the current state of the system, permit a comparison with previous states, and therefore serve the purposes of fault detection, localization, and the cause-finding of faults and their assessment, predictions due to future forcings and trent predictions. The diagnostic decision-making based on the validated models also is mentioned. Finally, some marginal notes are made on the diagnostics of machines, and an example of a bridge illustrates the model-based diagnosis.

The self-regulation is driven by consumer demands for safe products that do not contribute unnecessarily to environmental degradation. Government, representing the people, retains overall control via its legal role, but is less involved in day-to-day inspection, testing, and regulation. Environmental restoration and protection has had considerable success in heavy and resource-based industries during the last three decades, and manufacturing and transportation pollute much less than they once did over much of the world. Environmental impact assessments and long-term management plans with public input now are routinely integrated into the planning process rather than being tacked on to the ends of planning and development processes driven entirely by economic aspirations. Yet, while industry clearly has assumed some responsibility for its actions relative to the environment and the public, progress on other fronts has been less than satisfactory. A case in point is wetland conservation across the Canadian Prairies. Some progress is being made, but it is certain that most of the remaining wetlands, only about one-half the original, will disappear unless governments cease subsidizing drainage in response to lobbyists. Restoration is important, but a truly sustainable life will not be attained without maintaining overall landscape and ecosystem process integrity.

We show that all path delay faults that can affect the rated-clock operation of the circuit are testable by the variable-clock method. Also, all path delay faults that are untestable by the variable-elect method are, in fact, untestable by the rated-clock method. However, some faults tested by the variable-clock method may be incapable of affecting the rated-clock operation. Our study is based on a finite-state machine model in which fault-free transitions are shown by green arcs. Faulty transitions are shown by red arcs. A test traverses successive arcs until a faulty output occurs. A variable-clock test can exercise more flexibility in selecting from green and red arcs. It can cover all functional paths, but may find only a proper subset of untestable paths. Our analysis assumes a delay fault, consisting of either a singly-testable path or multiply-testable paths, and hence corresponds to non-robust detection.

The technological challenges for reliable and cost effective operation of machinery are met through a combination of failure prognostics, condition-based maintenance, and computer-based scheduling and control. This paper presents a unified approach to synthesis of methodologies for maintenance that are built upon the fusion of sensor-based and model-based information. The current state-of-the-art diagnostic tools primarily rely on identification of the individual events and statistical trending of sensor data. Such diagnostic tools merely provide the current status of the machinery and equipment health and are not capable of predicting the time remaining to the end of service life. Apparently, these diagnostic tools do not take advantage of the information-based synergism that usually exists among the individual sensor data, dynamics of the physical process, and the characteristics of the structural materials. In essence, the lack of this knowledge often leads to: Less than achievable performance due to overly conservative design and operational procedure; or Over-straining of the mechanical structures leading to unexpected failures and drastic reduction of the service life. For example, imprecise diagnostic tools could result in cost escalation due to extremely conservative time-based preventive maintenance to avert catastrophic failures. On the other hand, they may create a dangerous environment in which warning messages are not seriously taken due to occurrence of frequent false alarms. The work reported in the paper characterizes the process dynamics and material properties and then utilizes this information in a mathematical form that is readily applicable to synthesis of robust decision and control policies for plant operation & maintenance. The main-theme here is the development of analytical tools for damage estimation and failure prognostics and their potential applications to naval machinery. The paper is organized as follows. An introductory overview wilt be presented first followed by details of analytical formulation of the proposed methodologies. This will set the stags for exploring how these damage estimation and prognostic algorithms can be employed in support of naval machinery systems. The paper will be concluded with a glimpse at the future.

C	Hammett, R		Wilson, PA		Hammett, R			Seawolf ship control - Experience with performance monitoring and fault localization	ELEVENTH SHIP CONTROL SYSTEMS SYMPOSIUM, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	11th Ship Control Systems Symposium	APR, 1997	SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND	Minist Def, UK, Univ Southampton, Dept Ship Sci				This paper relates lessons learned from the development and testing of the Performance Monitoring (PM) and Fault Localization (FL) functions of the Seawolf ship control system. This functionality, in conjunction with redundant components, provides automatic detection, recovery, and reporting of failures of ship control electronics, sensors, actuation components, valves, and ship control machinery. It improves the ability of the ship to perform its mission and reduces overall life-cycle operating costs. The importance of PM/FL will be even greater on future submarines, as systems are more fully automated to allow for a reduction in size of me crew. PM/FL functionality does not come without a price; these complex decisionmaking algorithms are difficult to specify, develop, and test. Seawolf has advanced the state-of-the-art in this area but has by no means tapped its full potential. The paper will discuss achieving the correct balance between PM/FL functionality and development cost, the difficulties involved in the exhaustive verification of PM/FL, and possible future PM/FL technical trends. The Seawolf submarine utilizes a Ship Control System (SCS) that represents the state-of-the-art for such systems. This fully integrated system incorporates features such as a fault-tolerant computer, flat panel operator displays, and automatic modes of control for steering, diving and depth control functions. High-speed data busses allow ship control to interface with the combat system, gyrocompass inertial sensors, and data distribution system. Hardware redundancy and the PM software allow the system to operate following failures of the ship control electronics, sensors, and actuation systems it controls. Following failure, a separate maintenance computer is used to perform FL, allowing for efficient repair and restoration of full redundancy. The PM software executes on the fault-tolerant computer, and uses sensor voting and system mathematical models to detect failures. Real-time diagnostic tests are activated to identify healthy data paths and to collect data needed to perform FL. PM activates or uses redundant components or data paths to accommodate failures. For severe failures, PM makes the decision to transfer SCS functions to independent, emergency back-up systems. Seawolf PM software development presented a significant challenge because the ship control senses or controls several hundred signals, each connected with various forms of quad, dual, and simplex redundancy. The design of the hardware architecture and the level of redundancy were guided by the needs of the PM/FL approach. Verification of this functionality was achieved by performing both software-only and simulated full-system fault-injection testing. At the full-system level, over one thousand simulated failure conditions were introduced, and the ability of the system to operate correctly and provide correct maintenance reporting was demonstrated. During shipboard integration, PM became an important tool for discovering and correcting ship control installation problems.

Conventional monitoring techniques perform well however, their appeal fades when confronted with complex systems characterized by multiple criteria/decisions etc. An ''Artificial Intelligence'' based approach for monitoring the strongly interdependent propulsion machinery promises to be a viable solution. Optimum exploitation of propulsion and power generation machinery of warships require intelligent suggestions for usage pattern and incipient fault diagnosis to the operators. This paper projects an innovative approach which involves a conglomeration of various specialized techniques namely a shell resident Fault Diagnostic Knowledge Based System, an on-line non-linear parameter estimation propulsion independent technique for a class of marine diesel engines and marine gas turbines, knowledge elicited from vibration signatures and diesel engines combustion simulation in a prototype Knowledge Based System (KBS). The main objective of the KBS developed is to optimally exploit the ship borne machinery based on their ''condition'' and confidently predict incipient faults, besides using it as an onboard trainer. Introduction of KBS in the present ships as retrofits or as built-in system in future ships is justified due to continuing trend of rising cost of platform induction with reduced number of operators and ever increasing levels of reliability demanded of these platforms throughout their life cycle.										0	0	0	0	4	COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS PUBLICATIONS LTD	SOUTHAMPTON	ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON, HANTS, ENGLAND S04 2AA			1-85312-523-7				1997							535	549					15	Engineering, Civil	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Engineering	BJ04J	WOS:A1997BJ04J00038					2022-02-14

Crews participated in four process-disturbance scenarios, each of which was modeled using Micro Saint. Three scenarios investigated operator task performance; the other scenario investigated operator diagnoses. Comparisons of model and empirical results revealed good predictive ability of the models. For task performance, models accurately predicted latencies between a critical event and appropriate response initiation. The model of cognitive performance predicted many of the diagnoses the operators held during the scenario, as well as the diagnoses shifts over time. These results indicate potential for using task network modeling to supplement empirical research and contribute to control room human-machine interface design.

Although experimental techniques such as vibration measurement of the stator frame, or spectrum analysis of the stator current waveforms, (also know as motor current signature analysis (MCSA)) exist to determine behavior of the machine under faulty conditions, little have been done to examine them through analytical means. A method using the modified winding function approach (MWFA) is proposed in this paper, to study the effect of static and dynamic eccentricity on a single phase induction motor. Simulation results for both cases of eccentricity have been included. Experimental results with the machine running on bad bearings (emulating eccentric motor operation) with no load have also been presented.

A fuzzy-based neural network paradigm with an on-line learning algorithm is developed to perform expert advising for the ground-based maintenance crew. A hierarchical fault diagnosis architecture is advocated to fulfill the time-critical and on-board needs in different levels of structural integrity over a global operating envelope. The research objective is to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed health monitoring procedure through numerical simulations of bearing faults in USAF MH-53J PAVE LOW helicopter transmissions. The proposed fault detection, identification and accommodation architecture is applicable to various generic rotorcraft machines. The proposed system will greatly reduce the operational and developmental costs and serve as an essential component in an autonomous control system.

The surface to be examined is divided into discrete areas, and the characteristics of each area are compared against the characteristics of carpet of acceptable (good) quality. The Gaussian Markov random-field (GMRF) model is used for the modelling of the carpet-surface texture. An experimental device involving the use of a line-scan camera and an IBM personal computer simulates on-line inspection of woven carpets to detect various types of fault arising in the production process, Measures for detecting faults are derived from the GMRF model based on sufficient statistics, This measure is very effective in detecting textural differences. The detection of unlevel, linear, and other types of fault is discussed. In combination with a previous linear-faults-detection method, it is possible to detect all types of textural fault on a plain carpet in ape efficient way.

Interrelationships withdraw from a deep understanding of the physical processes, since cause-and-effect relations of parameters are not clearly determined yet. Owing to a permanent rise in demands on quality and reliability of product and process, the process capability has to be assured to achieve the goal of error-free manufacturing. The processing quality is determined by parameters which have to be controlled by algorithmic methods. The number of these parameters is too large to build up control cycles. Hence, there is a need to perform a fault analysis to obtain a reduced set which can be handled. This parameter set is required to cover the major part of influence on the processing results. Dependencies, influences and correlations between input and output parameters are ascertained by interviews with experts as well as by experimental results. By these measures cause-and-effect relations can be determined. The results lead to a state model which simulates both, machining structures and process cycles. Several methods of fault observation are tested for their suitability to monitor laser beam welding. A combination of well suited methods is utilized to generate the state model. The reliability of the model will be discussed with regard to successful failure detection and avoidance.

Firstly, the results of the application of widely used techniques are given and their limitations are delineated. Secondly, the application of the wavelet transform is proposed, since the vibrations of this kind of machine are highly non-stationary. Finally, an inverse-filtering technique is used to recover the actual output link motion from the casing vibration, in order to enable condition monitoring and diagnostics to be carried out through the analysis of the mechanism motion.

Artificial neural networks have recently been established as a powerful method of pattern recognition. The neural network-based fault detection approach usually requires pre-processing algorithms which enhance the fault features, reducing their number at the same time. Various time-invariant and time-variant signal pre-processing algorithms are studied here. These include spectral analysis, time domain averaging, envelope detection, Wigner-Ville distributions and wavelet transforms. A neural network pattern classifier with pre-processing algorithms is applied to experimental data in the form of vibration records taken from a controlled tooth fault in a pair of meshing spur gears. The results show that faults can be detected and classified without errors.

This review is concentrated on the investigations on polymer fluorophores, i.e. polymers, containing fluorescent fragments in their main or side polymer chains. In the investigations cited is shown that several factors influence the spectra and the value of quantum output of poly-shiff base fluorescence in liquid solutions: the value of fluorescence quantum output of initial low molecular fluorophore, poly-Schiff bases' molecule aggregation degree, protogene properties of solvent, thermodynamic rigidity of polymer chain. Registration of these factors allowed to obtain for the first time liquid solutions of poly-Schiff bases with anomalously high quantum yield for fluorescent polymers (up to 80 %). The setting of direct correlation between polymer molecule rigidity and the quantum yield makes possible its prognosis at a qualitative level for poly-Schiff bases with similar initial fluorophore.

Early diagnosis of potentially damaging faults or defects can lead to substantial cost savings. Frequently. in practice, interpretation of the vibration data is performed more on a qualitative as opposed to quantitative basis which may be of limited benefit. The work presented here shows that by utilising a simple approach involving the (SVD) Singular Value Decomposition method, changes in measured vibration data can be incorporated into an appropriate rotordynamic model and identification of the cause of the modified vibration response achieved. The technique is intended to be used in conjunction with available information related to the machine's construction and/or operational history. The proposed approach consists of two separate components:- the first used to identify bearing-related problems and the second employed in the diagnosis of rotor balance problems. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is assessed by recourse to analysis of a real representative rotor system.

High standards being put in front of designers necessitate the incorporation of new emerging technologies exploiting low-cost embedded sensors and microprocessors. These new tools make it possible to include sophisticated damage detectors that report on the condition of the machinery. The diagnosis system will provide valuable information about the state of the machine and report when damage is developing. Given this knowledge the extent of the damage can be assessed and the remaining life time can be determined. Careful modeling of rotating machines allows one to predict the influence of each failure mechanism on the dynamic response. However the effect of this damage may often be buried within the measured information (due to the complex dynamic behavior of rotating machines). In this paper it is proposed to enhance the delectability of the various faults by using a two stage approach. First we employ our physical understanding of the dynamic behavior in presence of a fault. This understanding is used to magnify certain aspects of the dynamics most attributed to the sought malfunction. At a second stage, we propose to utilize the already demonstrated idea of Kalman-filtering-based multi-hypothesis testing to detect the location and extent of the damage. The physical understanding on which this work is based upon is the fact that different faults manifest themselves in different ways in the spatial, temporal and frequency domains. Appropriate processing of the measured data coming from several sensors allows for detection of the damage. The initial steps of the proposed diagnosis scheme is developed for a rotor with a cracked shaft. It is shown that the the total response is not a good indicator for the presence of a crack more sentitive measures for the presence of a crack exploit forward and bacward separation of the rotor's whirl and inspection of high harmonics of the unbalance response. Those high-order harmonics are a result of the parametric excitation caused by the time-varying nature of the crack. These pints are demonstrated by a numerical simulation of a model of a crack and by measured data and thus provide sgood foundation for further research.

Diagnostic systems have been developed to detect failure in both mechanisms and structures. This presentation discusses the basic issues of detection and identification of failures, some examples, and likely directions for new developments in diagnostics. Faults in mechanisms cause extra, unexpected forces and motions that can be detected by vibration sensors, the electrical supply, radiated sound, and temperature A machine that combines electric motors and mechanisms (a motor driven gear train, for example) will reflect variations in the electrical load current which can be exploited. The faults in motor operated valves (MOV's) are detectable by such a combination of signals. Signal processing developments have made highly transient events open to analysis, leading to damage detection in impacting systems. The poppet valves in compressors, for example, indicate various faults through the timing and strength of their impacts with the valve plate. This diagnostic procedure has involved the signal processing procedure termed ''cepstral smoothing''. Finally, the diagnostics of structural faults is illustrated by faulted spot welds in a automotive body component. In this case, the delay in the transmission of vibration, related to ''group delay'' has been shown to indicate the presence of faulted welds. The reasons why group delay is more indicative of structural faults than other measures, such as resonance frequency shifts, are discussed. The future opportunities for diagnostics are likely to be cost related. The number of products that can benefit from diagnostics will increase and the precinct base will expand in numbers (consider automobiles and refrigerators), and capable (read complex) algorithms, processors, and sensor systems will all come down in price. Therefore, as costs fall, we can expect to see fault sensing systems in all kinds of products as a matter of course.

The simple structure that represents fuzzy rules in a neural network uses a rule extraction mechanism varying from most other approaches as it is based on concepts of machine learning. An additional, straightforward optimization eventually enhances the performance of the diagnosis. The approach is especially designed for the needs of technical fault diagnosis using parity space, observer and parameter estimation techniques. It evaluates parameter as well as parity space residuals and other information from the faulty process. Prior knowledge can easily be included as rules due to the simple structure of the scheme. The approach is tested on an electrical d.c. motor test bench to which several different faults can be applied.

We believe that if we can detect the machine performance degradation (early signs of failures), then we can prevent the occurrence of failures. Our idea is use a new type of NN, called Fuzzy CMAC. We put a smooth hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function at the output of the Fuzzy CMAC network with 1 denoting normal and -1 denoting the failure. The training of the network is performed by feeding known patterns of normal and failure conditions to it. When the network is applied to detect faults, if the output lies anywhere in between -1 and 1, it means the machine is in degraded state. If the output is close to 1, it means the system is close to normal but it is also on the verge of degrading. One major advantage of this method is its simplicity in implementation. A simple robot trajectory tracking example will be given to illustrate the idea.			Xu, H (corresponding author), INTELLIGENT AUTOMAT INC,2 RES PL,SUITE 202,ROCKVILLE,MD 20850, USA.

FDC capabilities can result in the improvement of over all equipment effectiveness (GEE), reduction in the tool downtime and reduction in the number of scrap wafers. In order to evaluate the performance of a large number of commercial FDC software, we conducted a benchmarking study at SEMATECH. The purpose of this paper is to report the tool data and the procedures that we were successfully able to use to benchmark the FDC software. These procedures can be used to compare FDC software based on similar or different principals. The results from this benchmarking have allowed the SEMATECH member companies to choose the software for beta-testing in the production environment. We conducted the benchmarking, by using the tool data obtained from three SEMATECH member companies, Texas Instruments (Tool 1), MOTOROLA (Tool 2) and Lucent Technologies (Tool 3). Tool data was put on a secured FTP site with the instructions for solving the benchmarking problems. The software suppliers downloaded the data, analyzed the data and returned the results within the specified time-limits. Tool 1 data consisted of machine data (42 parameter) from a LAM 9600 plasma etcher. Faults in the tool were generated via a design of experiment (DOE) and the purpose of the benchmark was to see if a software can identify tool faults by observing the machine data in real-time. Ten suppliers submitted the results of the analysis of Tool 1 data. Tool 2 data consisted of real-time machine data from a LAM 4600 plasma etcher as well as pre-etch data (deposit height) and wafer characteristics (snake resistance). The purpose of this benchmark was to be able to predict the wafer characteristics (snake resistance) via pre-etch data and the real-time machine data. Seven suppliers returned the results of the analysis of tool 2 data. On average suppliers were able to predict the snake resistance within a few percentage points. Tool 3 benchmark evaluated the capability of a FDC software to predict the tool faults in advance. We supplied machine data from 140,000 wafers collected over a six-month period on a Drytek plasma etcher. We also identified the faults in the tool data-and we wanted the supplier to use their software to predict the tool faults in advance. Seven suppliers submitted the results of the analysis of tool 3 data. The best results indicated that it may be possible to predict the tool faults in advance. However, we believe that in order to prove this approach conclusively, we need to conduct further study.

In this study, subjects used an interface consisting of four windows, each representing a level of the abstraction hierarchy, to control a thermal-hydraulic process simulation. The goal was to investigate the relationship between attention allocation strategies and performance under normal and abnormal conditions. Subjects controlled the process for about one hour per weekday for approximately one month. The results indicate that subjects who made more frequent use of functional levels of information exhibited more accurate system control under normal conditions, and more accurate diagnosis performance under fault trials. Moreover, subjects who made efficient use of functional information exhibited faster fault compensation times. These results provide specific evidence of the advantages of functional information in an abstraction hierarchy interface.

Yet inspection reliability measurements are needed if we are to set appropriate inspection intervals for airframe components. Visual inspection of aircraft is characterized as using multiple senses (despite its name) and having to inspect for multiple fault types, in contrast to NDI which is used for single specific fault types. The study here used 12 professional inspectors to perform nine visual inspection tasks on a long-service Boeing 737 aircraft. Each inspector worked over two days. Measures were taken of performance, strategy and individual differences. Only a fraction of the results are presented here, with a major finding that aircraft visual inspection has approximately the same reliability as industrial inspection. Individual differences were found, as well as correlations between certain aspects of performance and individual characteristics such as Field Independence and Peripheral Visual Acuity. However, there was little correlation between an individual inspector's performance on the different tasks, showing the difficulty of designing selection and placement procedures for such a wide-ranging job.
