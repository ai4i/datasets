Adoption of recent advances in big data analytics methods will help in developing an effective PdM strategy. This paper discusses advanced machine learning based PdM strategy. Various approaches to formulate the PdM problem and solve it are discussed. The performance of respective machine learning algorithms on equipment data is evaluated. To benefit from the strengths of various algorithms a super learning based approach with deep neural networks is proposed. This approach is robust compared to single method selection and handles changing production environment well. This cross validation based stacked model ensemble predictive maintenance strategy is also easy to automate.	[Butte, Sujata; Prashanth, A.

Application of EMD ANN and DNN for Self-Aligning Bearing Fault Diagnosis	ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS			English	Article						self-aligning bearing; fault classification; artificial neural networks; deep neural networks	INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Self-aligning roller bearings are an integral part of the industrial machinery. The proper analysis and prediction of the various faults that may happen to the bearing beforehand contributes to an increase in the working life of the bearing. This study aims at developing a novel method for the analysis of the various faults in self-aligning bearings as well as the automatic classification of faults using artificial neural network (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN). The vibration data is collected for six different faults as well as for the healthy bearing. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) followed by Hilbert Huang transform is used to extract instantaneous frequency peaks which are used for fault analysis. Time domain and time-frequency domain features are then extracted which are used to implement the neural networks through the pattern recognition tool in MATLAB. A comparative study of the outputs from the two neural networks is also performed. From the confusion matrix, the efficiency of the ANN has been found to be 95.7% and using DNN has been found to be 100%.

Working condition of bearing will directly affect the operation and function of equipment. Therefore, the testing and fault diagnosis of the running state of bearing is significant. A common method for extracting the mechanical fault is assuming that vibration signals are stable. But the real measured signals often are non stationary. For this nonlinear phenomenon, it is difficult to solve the problem fundamentally by the traditional power spectrum analysis.In this present work aims to formulate an automated prediction model using vibration signals of various bearing conditions by using EMD (empirical mode decomposition) and entropy based features and different classification algorithms.

The monitoring system helps to recognize and monitor the surface roughness, dimensional tolerance and tool condition. In this way, the condition monitoring system provides precise dimensional products, high productivity and enhanced machine tool life. This paper presents the classification of healthy and faulty conditions of the face milling tool using Decision tree (J48 algorithm) technique through machine learning approach. The sound signals of the face milling tool under healthy and faulty conditions are acquired. A set of discrete wavelet features are extracted from the sound signals using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method. Decision tree technique is used to select prominent features out of all extracted features. The selected features are fed to the same algorithm for classification. Output of the algorithm is used to study and categorize the tool conditions. The decision tree model has provided a good classification accuracy of about 81% for the given sound signals and can be considered for fault diagnosis/condition monitoring. From the experimental results, it is suggested that the proposed method which comprises of decision tree and DWT techniques with sound signals can be recommended for the applications of fault diagnosis of the face milling tool.

Existing methods for condition monitoring of bearings require extensive experimental arrangements using costly sensors and complex computational techniques in frequency domain for fault diagnosis. This work presents a simple time domain based approach using Fourier harmonic regression analysis method for condition monitoring of rolling element bearings. In the present work, bearing vibrations are acquired in normal and faulty conditions. A Fourier harmonic regression analysis method is applied to determine the confidence intervals for the bearing condition monitoring. The magnitude of harmonics and standard deviation of residuals are analyzed for identifying effect of faults like outer race fault, inner race fault and bearing ball fault. Experimental results show the effectiveness in detection of bearing conditions using the calculations in time domain. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The lack of control of applications over Cloud execution environments largely limits the applicability of state-of-the-art approaches that address reliability issues by relying on heavyweight training with injected faults. In this paper, we propose LOUD, a lightweight fault localization approach that relies on positive training only, and can thus operate within the constraints of Cloud systems. LOUD relies on machine learning and graph theory. It trains machine learning models with correct executions only, and compensates the inaccuracy that derives from training with positive samples, by elaborating the outcome of machine learning techniques with graph theory algorithms. The experimental results reported in this paper confirm that LOUD can localize faults with high precision, by relying only on a lightweight positive training.

It is very important to set up effective and reliable diagnostic model for AC system in electric bus. In this paper, various types of feature parameters are extracted and analyzed for related soft-fault firstly; and then new fault prediction model of BP neural network is established with improved particle swarm algorithm. There are three steps of prediction data modeling to determine the type and trend of AC system failure soft-fault quickly: characteristic parameters extraction; data preprocessing; the best particles calculation. However, the neural network model of the soft-fault diagnosis in high-dimensional complex problems is easy to fall into the local extreme point, named as "dimension disaster". Thus, the improved support vector machine (SVM) model is proposed to deal with the high-dimensional problems. Penalty parameter C and Gaussian kernel function parameters of SVM, which are optimized by improved particle swarm algorithm in this paper, will influence the predicted results greatly. From soft fault diagnosis results of different prediction models, we can see that the fault diagnosis model of optimized SVM based on improved particle swarm algorithm spends less training time and has higher predictive accuracy with optimized SVM parameters through the improved particle swarm algorithm.

In recent years, intelligent fault diagnosis algorithms using machine learning technique have achieved much success, and many deep learning techniques have also found their way into fault diagnosis of rotating machines. Considering that convolution is the most important method to analyze signals in digital signal processing, a novel deep convolutional neural networks is developed to operate directly on the raw vibration signal. The proposed MS-DCNN model could broaden and deepen the neural networks to learn better and more robust feature representations owing to multi-scale convolution layer, meanwhile, reduce the network parameters and the training time. Fault classification experiments of rolling element bearings have been undertaken to indicate the effectiveness of the MS-DCNN model. Compared with 1d-DCNN and 2d-DCNN, MS-DCNN can not only achieve higher accuracy rate in the testing set, but also run more smoothly in the training process.

This paper utilizes the fusion of the communication signal and the echos of probe signals received at the same antenna array, and it proposes a joint scheme for adaptive diagnose of the antenna. An iterative estimation scheme is implemented for the coupled problem of the estimation of the degree of arrival (DOA) and element damage patterns, and two confidence factors are proposed for a joint decision algorithm for evaluating the credibility of the estimation based on the two types of signals. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated through simulation. The judgment error rate of the element damage patterns is reduced significantly under the joint scheme, for example, from 15% to only 3% for certain parameters. The gain of the joint decision algorithm is interpreted, and the optimal threshold of the confidence factors as well as the effect of the SNR of the communication and echo of the probe signals at the antenna element array are studied. This paper solves the problem of the diagnosis of antenna array elements at extremely low SNRs and will greatly contribute to the robust performance of smart sensors in wireless sensor networks.

Unfortunately, owing to the technical complexity, any issues related to optimal sensor deployment can deteriorate the performance of the sensor system, which has consequently received much attention and interest. This paper aimed to review the current literature studying optimal sensor deployment looking at modeling characteristics and strategy implementation. First, the modeling characteristics with four key elements, namely cause-effect model, optimization benchmark, optimization strategies, and performance assessment, are surveyed thoroughly. Second, a wide variety of strategy implementation of sensor deployment is discussed in detail. Finally, the open-ended issues faced by industry and academia are discussed and several principle conclusions drawn.

J	Liu, S; Sun, Y; Zhang, LY				Liu, Sheng; Sun, Yue; Zhang, Lanyong			A Novel Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Noise-Assisted MEMD and Functional Neural Fuzzy Network for Rolling Element Bearings	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; improved functional neural fuzzy network (FNFN); noise-assisted multivariate; empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD); particle swarm optimization (PSO)	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; WAVELET; MACHINE; EMD; SPECTRUM	To solve the problem in which the auxiliary white-noise parameters need to be artificially selected in a noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) and considering the fact that obtaining a large number of typical fault samples in practical engineering is difficult, a rolling bearing fault-diagnosis method based on velocity modified-mutation particle swarm optimization (PSO)-optimized NA-MEMD and improved functional neural fuzzy network (FNFN) is proposed. First, the original vibration signal is processed using the velocity modified-mutation PSO NA-MEMD method to decompose it into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different characteristic time scales. Owing to the distribution characteristics of the IMF with the time scales and because the energy in different states of a bearing in different frequency bands changes, we calculate the energy moment of each IMF as a fault feature vector. Second, the fault feature vectors are then used as input to construct the improved FNFN structure. Finally, the method is validated using the data from the bearing data center of Case Western Reserve University and the vibration signals of the propulsion-motor bearings in the rudder paddle compartment during normal ship navigation and is compared with other neural network. The results show that the method proposed in this paper can quickly and more accurately diagnose rolling-bearing faults using limited training samples.

J	Arshad, A; Riaz, S; Jiao, LC; Murthy, A				Arshad, Ali; Riaz, Saman; Jiao, Licheng; Murthy, Aparna			Semi-Supervised Deep Fuzzy C-Mean Clustering lefor Software Fault Prediction	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Semi-supervised learning; fuzzy C-Mean clustering; feature learning; software fault prediction	PRESERVING DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DEFECT PREDICTION; FEATURE-SELECTION; LABELED DATA; CLASSIFICATION; FRAMEWORK; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; SCHEME	Software fault prediction is a consequential research area in software quality promise. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised deep fuzzy C-mean (DFCM) clustering for software fault prediction, which is the cumulation of semi-supervised DFCM clustering and feature compression techniques. Deep is utilized for the feature-based multi clusters of unlabeled and labeled data sets along with their labeled classes. In our approach, for the training model, we simultaneously deal with the unsupervised data and supervised data to exploit the obnubilated information from unlabeled data to labeled data to support the construction of the precise model. We utilize DFCM clustering to handle the class imbalance problem and withal fuzzy theory logic is very akin to human logic and it is facile to comprehend. We further ameliorate the prediction performance with the coalescence of feature learning techniques-feature extraction and feature selection (using random-under sampling) to generate good features and remove irrelevant and redundant features to reduce the noisy data for classification. However, by the performance of the model results, the amalgamation of deep multi clusters and feature techniques work better due to their ability to identify and amalgamation essential information in data feature. The classification model is predicted on the maximum homogeneous between the features of labeled and unlabeled data, the model is trained on the un-noisy data set obtained by the deep coalescence of multi clusters and feature techniques. To check the efficacy of our approach, we chose data sets from real-world software project (NASA & Eclipse), and then we compared our approach with a number of latest classical base-line methods, and investigate the performance by using performance measures such as probability of detection, F-measure, and area under the curve.

The extracted feature vectors are entered. The feature vector is trained and identified by multi - classification method. The optimal parameters of the support vector machine are searched by trial and error method and cross validation method. Then, the support vector machine is compared with BP neural network.

In the last decade with the availability of industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices, this has made it possible to monitor the machine continuously using wireless sensors, assess the degradation and predict the failures of time. Condition-based predictive maintenance has made a significant influence in monitoring the asset and predicting the failure of time. This has minimized the impact on production, quality, and maintenance cost. Numerous approaches have been in proposed over the years and implemented in supervised learning. In this paper, challenges of supervised learning such as need for historical data and incapable of classifying new faults accurately will be overcome with a new methodology using unsupervised learning for rapid implementation of predictive maintenance activity which includes fault prediction and fault class detection for known and unknown faults using density estimation via Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering and K-means algorithm and compare their results with a real case vibration data.

J	Qiu, MQ; Li, W; Jiang, F; Zhu, ZC				Qiu, Mingquan; Li, Wei; Jiang, Fan; Zhu, Zhencai			Remaining Useful Life Estimation for Rolling Bearing With SIOS-Based Indicator and Particle Filtering	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Rolling bearing; RUL estimation; two-stage; initial degenerate point; health indicator	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HEALTH; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION; TUTORIAL	Rolling bearing is a key component of rotating machinery, and its remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is also a critical technique in prognostics health management activities. In this paper, we propose a two-stage strategy for bearing health monitoring, where the bearing health process is divided into two stages: normal stage and degeneration stage, and a new method is proposed to estimate the bearing RUL by combining a new health indicator (HI) and particle filtering (PF). First, the structural information of the spectrum (SIOS) algorithm is employed to construct the HI called SIOS-based indicator (SIOSI) for bearing degeneration monitoring. Second, the initial degenerate point (IDP) is evaluated by a novel index calculated with self-zero space observer in order to conduct the two-stage division of normal and degeneration stages. Third, after detecting the IDP, the bearing RUL is estimated using the SIOSI and the PF-based algorithm with the help of a degeneration model. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated using vibration data collected from bearing run-to-failure tests. Experimental results have shown that the bearing RUL could be estimated acceptably with the proposed method, and its performance is greatly superior to that presented by L-10 life formula.

First, the paper starts by presenting the impact of an inverter IGBT open-circuit fault on the induction machine performance. A comparative study is then carried out between three different detection techniques: the mean value of the currents method, the measurement of the current drop method and the Park's vectors method. The comparison is to assess each technique in terms of its performance, that is the time detection rapidity and localisation ability, as well as in terms of hardware, that is the number of current sensors required for IGBT open-circuit fault detection. To validate these methods, a test-rig is developed in our diagnostic group laboratory which consists of the realisation of a two-level voltage source inverter controlled by a DSPACE-1104 card to generate the PWM vector control for the induction motor. The obtained simulation and experimental results illustrate well the detection effectiveness of each technique as well as the comparison study merits.

Parallel Implementation of Finite State Machines for Reducing the Latency of Stochastic Computing	2018 19TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON QUALITY ELECTRONIC DESIGN (ISQED)	International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED)	MAR 13-14, 2018	Santa Clara, CA	IEEE Elect Devices Soc, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc, IEEE Reliabil Soc, Synopsys, Innovotek, Silicon Valley Polytechn Inst			COMPUTATION; LOGIC; ARCHITECTURE	Stochastic computing, which employs random bit streams for computations, has shown low hardware cost and high fault-tolerance compared to the computations using a conventional binary encoding. Finite state machine (FSM) based stochastic computing elements can compute complex functions, such as the exponentiation and hyperbolic tangent functions, more efficiently than those using combinational logic. However, the FSM, as a sequential logic, cannot be directly implemented in parallel like the combinational logic, so reducing the long latency of the calculation becomes difficult. Applications in the relatively higher frequency domain would require an extremely fast clock rate using FSM. This paper proposes a parallel implementation of the FSM, using an estimator and a dispatcher to directly initialize the FSM to the steady state. Experimental results show that the outputs of four typical functions using the parallel implementation are very close to those of the serial version. The parallel FSM scheme further shows equivalent or better image quality than the serial implementation in two image processing applications Edge Detection and Frame Difference.

One of the most important applications of multi-modal MRI is the provision of vital diagnostic data for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. As traditional MRI researches using univariate analyses can only reveal disease-related structural and functional alterations at group level which limited the clinical application, and recent attention has turned toward integrating multi-modal neuroimaging and computer-aided prognosis (CAD) technology, especially machine learning, to assist clinical disease diagnose. Research in this area is growing exponentially, and therefore it is meaningful to review the current and future development of this emerging area. Hence, in this paper, based on our own studies and contributions, we review the recent advances in multi-modal MRI and CAD technologies, and their applications to assist the clinical diagnosis of three common neurologic and psychiatric disorders, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome. We extracted multi-modal features from structural, diffusion and resting-state functional MRI, then different feature selection methods and classifiers were applied. In addition, we applied different feature fusion schemes (e.g. multiple kernel learning) to combining multi-modal features for classification. Our experiments show that using feature fusion techniques to integrate multi-modal features can yield better classification results for diseases prediction, which may outline some future directions for multi-modal neuroimaging where researchers can design more advanced methods and models for neurologic and psychiatric research.

Power converter is one of the critical components that undergoes high rate of medium and short term thermal cycles especially in Offshore floating wind turbines compared to fixed bottom turbines. The current study proposes a novel methodology to predict the remaining useful life of an offshore wind turbine power converter in digital twin frame work as a means of predictive maintenance strategy. The remaining useful life is estimated for both diagnostic and prognostic health monitoring specific for offshore operating environment.

To reduce the probability of death, early detection and prevention of breast cancer is a crucial factor. Evaluating the probability of breast cancer recurrence is an important act related to breast cancer prognosis. The aim of this paper is to predict the probability of breast cancer recurrence among patients. The researchers individually applied Random Forest and Deep Neural Network classifiers to increase the prediction accuracy of those models. Wisconsin Prognosis Breast Cancer dataset was obtained from UCI machine learning Repository. The results of our experiment indicate that Random Forest technique achieved the highest accuracy compared to the existing works.

Its goal to build new and/or leverage existing algorithms to learn from training data and give accurate predictions, or to find patterns, particularly with new and unseen similar data, fits perfectly to Non-Destructive Evaluation. The advantages of ML in NDE are obvious in such tasks as pattern recognition in acoustic signals or automated processing of images from X-ray, Ultrasonics or optical methods. Fraunhofer IKTS is using machine learning algorithms in acoustic signal analysis. The approach had been applied to such a variety of tasks in quality assessment. The principal approach is based on acoustic signal processing with a primary and secondary analysis step followed by a cognitive system to create model data. Already in the second analysis steps unsupervised learning algorithms as principal component analysis are used to simplify data structures. In the cognitive part of the software further unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms will be trained. Later the sensor signals from unknown samples can be recognized and classified automatically by the algorithms trained before. Recently the IKTS team was able to transfer the software for signal processing and pattern recognition to a small printed circuit board (PCB). Still, algorithms will be trained on an ordinary PC; however, trained algorithms run on the Digital Signal Processor and the FPGA chip. The identical approach will be used for pattern recognition in image analysis of OCT pictures. Some key requirements have to be fulfilled, however. A sufficiently large set of training data, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and an optimized and exact fixation of components are required. The automated testing can be done subsequently by the machine. By integrating the test data of many components along the value chain further optimization including lifetime and durability prediction based on big data becomes possible, even if components are used in different versions or configurations. This is the promise behind German Industry 4.0.

Fault Diagnosis with Statistical Properties and Implementation Using MKSVM for Flash ADC	INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY FOR INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (ICTIS 2017) - VOL 1	Smart Innovation Systems and Technologies		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology for Intelligent Systems (ICTIS)	MAR 25-26, 2017	Ahmedabad, INDIA	ASSOCHAM Gujarat Chapter, G R Fdn, Assoc Comp Machinery, Ahmedabad Chapter		Structural and functional faults; ADC; Machine learning; Kernel functions and MKSVM	NEURAL-NETWORKS	This paper focuses on the Fault Diagnosing methodologies crucial for attaining reliability and maintainability of all electronic circuits is implemented for analog to digital converter (ADC) with a wide range of faults. Fault Diagnosis (FD) is considered as the pattern recognition problem and solved by machine learning theory. Functional test is is needed instead of structural test for testing complex circuits. Fault diagnosis using Fault Dictionary, Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic are enigmatic or inconclusive diagnosis results which have more debug duration and even inaccurate repair actions that exponentially rises service overhead. The effectiveness of these methods are considered, which cover ability in detecting, identifying and localization of faults, the ability of analysing linear and nonlinear circuits, etc. Recent machine learning techniques like support vector machines (SVM) with kernel functions improve the preciseness of functional FD which reduces the product cost through correct repair process. The proposed Multikernel SVM (MKSVM) methodology gives better results than earlier methods as it works with the fundamentals of machine learning and generalization for FD.

In the conventional model, the degradation data are usually used for degradation modeling directly. In engineering practice, the degradation of many systems presents a volatile situation, that is, fluctuation. In fact, the volatility of degradation data shows the stability of system, so it could be used to reflect the performance of system. As such, this paper proposes a new degradation model for RUL estimation based on the volatility of degradation data. Firstly the degradation data are decomposed into trend items and random items, which are defined as a stochastic process. Then the standard deviation of the stochastic process is defined as another performance variable because standard deviation reflects the system performance. Finally the Wiener process and the normal stochastic process are used to model the trend items and random items separately, and then the probability density function (PDF) of the RUL is obtained via a redefined failure threshold function that combines the trend items and the standard deviation of the randomitems. Two practical case studies demonstrate that, compared with traditional approaches, the proposed model can deal with the degradation data with many fluctuations better and can get a more reasonable result which is convenient for maintenance decision.

In this paper, an analog circuit incipient fault diagnosis method using deep belief network (DBN) based features extraction is presented. In the diagnosis scheme, time responses of analog circuits are measured, and then features are extracted by using the DBN method. Meanwhile, the learning rates of DBN are produced by using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, which is beneficial to optimizing the structure parameters of DBN. Afterward, a support vector machine (SVM) based incipient fault diagnosis model is constructed on basis of the extracted features to classify incipient faulty components, where the regularization parameter and width factor of SVM are yielded by using the QPSO algorithm. Sallen-Key bandpass filter and four-op-amp biquad high pass filter incipient fault diagnosis simulations are conducted to demonstrate the proposed diagnosis method, and comparisons verify that the proposed diagnosis method can produce higher diagnosis accuracy than other typical analog circuit fault diagnosis methods.

In this paper, an innovative method named Self adaptive Entropy Wavelet (SEW) is proposed to detect incipient transverse crack faults on rotating shafts. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is applied to obtain optimized wavelet function using impulse modelling and decompose a signal into multi-scale wavelet coefficients. Dominant features are then extracted from those vectors using Shannon entropy, which can be used to discriminate fault information in different conditions of shafts. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is carried out to classify fault categories which identifies the severity of crack faults.

J	Sohaib, M; Kim, JM				Sohaib, Muhammad; Kim, Jong-Myon			Reliable Fault Diagnosis of Rotary Machine Bearings Using a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder-Based Deep Neural Network	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							ROLLER-BEARINGS; MODEL	Due to enhanced safety, cost-effectiveness, and reliability requirements, fault diagnosis of bearings using vibration acceleration signals has been a key area of research over the past several decades. Many fault diagnosis algorithms have been developed that can efficiently classify faults under constant speed conditions. However, the performances of these traditional algorithms deteriorate with fluctuations of the shaft speed. In the past couple of years, deep learning algorithms have not only improved the classification performance in various disciplines (e.g., in image processing and natural language processing), but also reduced the complexity of feature extraction and selection processes. In this study, using complex envelope spectra and stacked sparse autoencoder(SSAE-) based deep neural networks (DNNs), a fault diagnosis scheme is developed that can overcome fluctuations of the shaft speed. The complex envelope spectrum made the frequency components associated with each fault type vibrant, hence helping the autoencoders to learn the characteristic features from the given input signals more readily. Moreover, the implementation of SSAE-DNN for bearing fault diagnosis has avoided the need of handcrafted features that are used in traditional fault diagnosis schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional fault diagnosis algorithms in terms of fault classification accuracy when tested with variable shaft speed data.

These biomarkers can improve prognosis by detecting dreadful disease such as cancer at an early stage than the current approaches. Analyzing raw data from these nanoscale devices for disease detection is tedious as the raw data suffers from noise. Furthermore, disease detection decisions are made based on manual or semi-automated analysis-which are time-consuming, monotonous and error-prone process. Recent trends show an unprecedented growth in the advancement of nanotechnology for medical diagnosis. These devices generate huge amount of raw data and analyzing raw data in order to classify biomarkers in a fully automated and robust way is a challenge. In this paper, we present an algorithm for identifying cellular spikes, we have adapted extreme learning machines and dynamic time warping for the classification of cancer in raw data collected from nanoscale biosensors, such as solid-state micropores.

Traditional inspection on catenary components has to be performed only at night with human eyes. Not only the inspection speed is very slow, but also the inspection results are not reliable, as a result of the poor lighting environment and long-time working tiredness. In this paper, we present an automatic visual inspection system for checking the status of components on catenary. A dedicated designed camera system is mounted on an inspection car, which is composed of many super-high-resolution area-scan cameras with different directions and fields of view. The camera system covers almost all the components to be checked and gives great details of each component. A post detection module is integrated in order to trigger the cameras and lighting device at a proper location, which utilizes several laser distance sensors pointing at the steady arms. Considering the great data storm at each catenary post, high-performance servers with GPU acceleration are used, and technologies of multi-thread and parallel computing are exploited. Furthermore, an intelligent analysis framework is proposed, which uses structural analysis to localize each component in the image, and perform automatic detection based on different features such as geometry, texture, and logic rules. The system can operate at a maximum speed of 160 km/h in both directions, and has been successfully used in China highspeed railways, which shows great advantages in the catenary inspection application.

Vibration-based methods are the most popular way of diagnosing damage in machinery joints. Any technique that is used for such a purpose requires dealing with the variability inherent to the system due to manufacturing tolerances, environmental conditions or aging. The level of variability in vibrational response can be very high for mass-produced complex structures that possess a large number of components. In this study, a simple and efficient time frequency method is proposed for detection of damage in connecting joints. The method suggests using singular spectrum analysis for building a reference space from the signals measured on a healthy structure and then compares all other signals to that reference space in order to detect the presence of faults. A model of two plates connected by a series of mounts is used to examine the effectiveness of the method where the uncertainty in the mount properties is taken into account to model the variability in the built-up structure. The motivation behind the simplified model is to identify the faulty mounts in trim-structure joints of an automotive vehicle where a large number of simple plastic clips are used to connect the trims to the vehicle structure.

In this paper, a novel method called multiscale feature extraction (MFE) and multiclass support vector machine (MSVM) with particle parameter adaptive (PPA) is proposed. MFE is used to preprocess the process signals, which decomposes the data into intrinsic mode function by empirical mode decomposition method, and instantaneous frequency of decomposed components was obtained by Hilbert transformation. Then, statistical features and principal component analysis are utilized to extract significant information from the features, to get effective data from multiple faults. MSVM method with PPA parameters optimization will classify the fault patterns. The results of a case study of the rolling bearings faults data from Case Western Reserve University show that (1) the proposed intelligent method (MFE_PPA_MSVM) improves the classification recognition rate; (2) the accuracy will decline when the number of fault patterns increases; (3) prediction accuracy can be the best when the training set size is increased to 70% of the total sample set. It verifies the method is feasible and efficient for fault diagnosis.

In order to effectively remove image noise and preserve the good image detail, in this paper, a new improved image denoising method has been proposed based on Contourlet and NeighShrink. Firstly, the image of the Contourlet coefficients is obtained by the Contourlet transform. And then, the Contourlet coefficients are contracted by the neighbourhood shrinkage method. Lastly, the image is denoised by the inverse Contourlet transform. Taking elevator fault detection as a practical application example in the simulation study, the images of the elevator machine and the wire rope are denoised after greying. The detection images of traction motor and wire rope are analysed and compared with the different denoising method.

It remains a challenging task to achieve high fault diagnostic accuracy of water quality monitoring and controlling devices. This paper proposes a hybrid water quality monitoring device fault diagnosis model based on multiclass support vector machines (MSVM) in combination with rule-based decision trees (RBDT). In the modeling process, an RBDT is used to diagnose the gateway fault and wireless transmitter fault at the same time as a feature selection tool to reduce the number of features. A multiclass support vector machine classifier is employed to diagnose the faults of water quality sensors due to its robustness and generalization. We adopted an RBDT-MSVM algorithm to construct a fault diagnosis model. The diagnostic results indicate that RBDT-MSVM model has great potential for fault diagnosis of online water quality devices. RBDT-MSVM was tested and compared with other algorithms by applying it to diagnose faults of water quality monitoring devices in river crab culture ponds. The diagnostic results indicate that the model has great potential for fault diagnosis of online water quality devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model RBDT-MSVM can achieve classification accuracy as high as 92.86%, which is superior to the other three fault diagnosis methods. The results clearly confirm the superiority of the developed model in terms of classification accuracy, and that it is a suitable and effective method for fault diagnosis of water quality monitoring devices in intensive aquaculture.

Additionally, owing to the long lifetime and high reliability of LEDs, estimating the lumen maintenance life by using traditional destructive life testing methods is time-consuming and expensive. Even the IESNA TM-21 standard, which is widely accepted by many LED manufacturers, has weaknesses in terms of guaranteeing life prediction accuracy, because it relies on the least-squares regression (LSR) method without considering measurement dynamics and uncertainties. The theory of prognostics and health management (PHM) has been widely used in many electronics that originates the idea that the "unhealthy" (anomaly) of electronics could be detected and the reliability (and remaining useful life) of electronics could be predicted by using an in situ sensing approach and data-driven methods. In this chapter, a detail review of current reliability testing and qualification methods for LEDs and general PHM methodologies are introduced in advance. Then an online anomaly detection and lumen maintenance life prediction method based on the PHM methodology are proposed for phosphor-converted white LED packages.

However, wind turbine availability and reliability, especially for offshore sites, still need to be improved, which strongly affect the cost of wind energy. Wind turbine operational cost is closely depending on component failure and repair rate, while fault detection and isolation will be very helpful to improve the availability and reliability factors. In this paper, an efficient machine learning method, random forests (RFs) in combination with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), is used to establish the data-driven wind turbine fault detection framework. In the proposed design, RF is used to rank the features by importance, which are either direct sensor signals or constructed variables from prior knowledge. Then, based on the top-ranking features, XGBoost trains the ensemble classifier for each specific fault. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, numerical simulations using the state-of-the-art wind turbine simulator FAST are conducted for three different types of wind turbines in both the below and above rated conditions. It is shown that the proposed approach is robust to various wind turbine models including offshore ones in different working conditions. Besides, the proposed ensemble classifier is able to protect against overfitting, and it achieves better wind turbine fault detection results than the support vector machine method when dealing with multidimensional data.

Degradation Trend Prognostics for Rolling Bearing Using Improved R/S Statistic Model and Fractional Brownian Motion Approach	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Fractional Brownian motion (FBM); stochastic differential equation (SDE); Hurst exponent (HE); improved R/S statistic model; degradation trend prognostics	HURST EXPONENT ESTIMATION; USEFUL LIFE PREDICTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; TIME-SERIES; FRAMEWORK	Fractional order characteristics (FOCs) have been shown to be useful in the predict degradation trend of rotating machinery. In this paper, a novel prognostics methodology based on improved R/S statistic and fractional Brownian motion (FBM) for rolling bearing degradation process is proposed. Due to the fact that bearing health indicators, such as equivalent vibration intensity (EVI), often exhibit non-stationary and non-Gaussian traits, the FOC methodology normally involves the estimation of a parameter Hurst H; the improved R/S statistic technique with auto-covariance estimator was introduced to address the issue that the calculation of the Hurst exponent by classical R/S methods is sensitive to heteroskedasticity and short-range dependence. Furthermore, a slow degrading process of a rolling bearing can be predicted by a common FOC model, but the actual sharp transition points (STPs) of the degradation are often very difficult to track. The main purpose of a rolling bearing degradation prediction is to prognosticate and track the STP's trend when the failure occurs between the normal phase and the incipient degradation phase. A method that combined FBM and Brownian motion is presented when the forecasted points contaminated with STPs, in which the predicting operator, driven by a new stochastic differential equation and its computationally efficient algorithm, are explored. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can better predict the EVI degradation trend than traditional FOC and other time series models.

Owing to the complexity of the structures and working conditions, it is quite challenging to effectively diagnose the combined failure and extract fault features of stewing bearings. In this study, a method was proposed to denoise and classify the combined failure of slewing bearings. First, after removing the mean, the vibration signals were denoised by maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution. The signals were then decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD). Appropriate IMFs were selected based on the correlation coefficient and kurtosis. The approximate entropy values of the selected IMFs were regarded as the characteristic vectors and then inputted into the support vector machine (SVM) based on multiclass classification for training. The practical combined failure signals of the 3 conditions were finally recognized and classified using SVMs. The study also compared the proposed method with 5 other methods to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Wang, F; Fang, LQ; Qi, ZY				Wang Fei; Fang Liqing; Qi Ziyuan			Fault Diagnosis Method for Hydraulic Pump Based on Fuzzy Entropy of Wavelet Packet and LLTSA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONLINE ENGINEERING			English	Article						wavelet packet analysis; fuzzy entropy; LLTSA; feature extraction; hydraulic pump; fault diagnosis	APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; SAMPLE ENTROPY	As the vibration signal characteristics of hydraulic pump present non-stationary and the fault features is difficult to extract, a new feature extraction method was proposed. This approach combines wavelet packet analysis techniques, fuzzy entropy and LLTSA (liner local tangent space alignment) which is one of typical manifold learning methods to extracting fault feature. Firstly, the vibration signals were decomposed into eight signals in different scales, then the fuzzy entropies of signals were calculated to constitute eight dimensions feature vector. Secondly, LLTSA method was applied to compress the high-dimension features into low-dimension features which have a better classification performance. Finally, the SVM (support vector machine) was employed to distinguish different fault features. Experiment results of hydraulic pump feature extraction show that the proposed method can exactly classify different fault type of hydraulic pump and this method has a significant advantage compared with other feature extraction means mentioned in this paper.

Multiple Faults Detection for Rotating Machinery Based on Bicomponent Sparse Low-Rank Matrix Separation Approach	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Multiple faults detection; bicomponent sparse low-rank matrix separation (BSLMS); alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); rolling bearing; gearbox	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; CORRELATED KURTOSIS DECONVOLUTION; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION; SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; TRANSIENT FAULTS; DIAGNOSIS; DICTIONARY	Multifault detection of rotating machinery at the incipient fault stage presents a challenging issue due to its interaction feature, complexity, and coupling characteristics. Aiming at the concern of identifying the multiple faults pattern of rotating machinery, a novel multiple faults detection approach based on Bi-component sparse low-rank matrix separation is proposed in this paper. The core idea of the proposed method is that the measured vibration signal typically shows as the sum of transient component and oscillatory component, meanwhile, the multi-fault identification problem with regularization terms can be transformed into a sparse optimization formulation that could be solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm. The proposed approach is applied by simulated synthetic signal, experimental data including rolling bearing and gearbox with weak multiple faults, and its effectiveness and superiority are verified by comparing to some state-of-the-art methods such as L1-norm fused lasso optimization, maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution, and ensemble empirical mode decomposition.

J	Zhang, A; Gao, XW				Zhang, Ao; Gao, Xianwen			Fault diagnosis of sucker rod pumping systems based on Curvelet Transform and sparse multi-graph regularized extreme learning machine	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						curvelet transform; extreme learning machine; sparse representation; sucker rod pumping systems; fault diagnosis	RECOGNITION; SVM	A novel approach is proposed to complete the fault diagnosis of pumping systems automatically. Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform is firstly adopted to extract features of dynamometer cards that sampled from sucker rod pumping systems, then a sparse multi-graph regularized extreme learning machine algorithm (SMELM) is proposed and applied as a classifier. SMELM constructs two graphs to explore the inherent structure of the dynamometer cards: the intra-class graph expresses the relationship among data from the same class and the inter-class graph expresses the relationship among data from different classes. By incorporating the information of the two graphs into the objective function of extreme learning machine (ELM), SMELM can force the outputs of data from the same class to be as same as possible and simultaneously force results from different classes to be as separate as possible. Different from previous ELM models utilizing the structure of data, our graphs are constructed through sparse representation instead of K-nearest Neighbor algorithm. Hence, there is no parameter to be decided when constructing graphs and the graphs can reflect the relationship among data more exactly. Experiments are conducted on dynamometer cards acquired on the spot. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for faults diagnosis in sucker rod pumping systems.

Decision tree based weld defect classification using current and voltage signatures in GMAW process	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Emerging Trends in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (IMME)	MAR 10-12, 2017	Tiruchirappalli, INDIA	SERB, ARMREB, JSW, JCBL, MSC Software, Essar Steel, ATS		GMAW process; weld defect classification; decision tree; current and voltage signatures	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE	The quality of the weld is most important in industries manufacturing boilers and pressure vessels which will work in severe operating conditions. In an automated environment, developing a process monitoring and control system will ensure the weld quality and prevent the occurrence of defects. In this paper, an attempt is made using the decision tree algorithm to establish a correlation between the current and voltage signatures with the quality of the weld. Carbon steel plates are welded using GMAW processes and experimental design is established to obtain weld without any defects (good weld) and weld with porosity and burn-through defects. "KUKA" robotic GMAW welding setup integrated with "Fronius" power source is used in this study for experimentation. "TVC" data acquisition system is used to capture the current and voltage signatures. Statistical features are extracted from the current and voltage signatures. Decision tree algorithm with split criterions such as "gini index", "towing", and "deviance" are used to classify the weld defects. Results indicate the effectiveness of decision tree algorithms in classifying the weld defects using the current and voltage signatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Paithankar, A; Chatterjee, S				Paithankar, Amol; Chatterjee, Snehamoy			Forecasting time-to-failure of machine using hybrid Neuro-genetic algorithm - a case study in mining machinery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING RECLAMATION AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Failure time data; neural network; genetic algorithm; reliability; mining	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CONJUGATE-GRADIENT; RELIABILITY PREDICTION; NETWORK APPROACH; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; FAULT-DETECTION; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS; MODEL; BACKPROPAGATION	Forecasting of time-to-failure is an important aspect of a mining machine for the performance assessment, fault detection and schedule maintenance. The knowledge of failure time allows more defined arrangement of preventive maintenance. Traditional methods, including lifetime distribution models, fault tree analysis and Markov models, have a limitation of assuming a specific statistical distribution function to fit the failure time data. In this study, a hybrid data-driven method using neural network and genetic algorithm is proposed to forecast failure time. The forecasting model was developed using neural network algorithm and all the neural network parameters, i.e. input nodes, hidden nodes and the learning algorithms, are selected automatically using the genetic algorithm. The developed model was validated using the failure data of a mining machine. A case study was conducted investigating a load-haul-dump machine (LHD) in the mining industry. Failure historical data for the LHD machine were collected, and cumulative failure time was calculated for time-to-failure forecasting. Study results demonstrate that the developed model performs satisfactory in the prediction of next failure time. A comparative study reveals that the proposed method performs better than existing methods.

J	Giap, CN; Son, LH; Chiclana, F				Cu Nguyen Giap; Le Hoang Son; Chiclana, Francisco			Dynamic structural neural network	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial neural network; binary multi-input multi-output problems; dynamic structure; Genetic algorithm; greedy algorithm; medical diagnosis	FAULT-DETECTION; MODEL	Artificial neural network (ANN) has been well applied in pattern recognition, classification and machine learning thanks to its high performance. Most ANNs are designed by a static structure whose weights are trained during a learning process by supervised or unsupervised methods. These training methods require a set of initial weights values, which are normally randomly generated, with different initial sets of weight values leading to different convergent ANNs for the same training set. Dealing with these drawbacks, a trend of dynamic ANN was invoked in the past year. However, they are either too complex or far from practical applications such as in the pathology predictor in binary multi-input multi-output (MIMO) problems, when the role of a symptom is considered as an agent, a pathology predictor's outcome is formed by action of active agents while other agents' activities seem to be ignored or have mirror effects. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic structural ANN for MIMO problems based on the dependency graph, which gives clear cause and result relationships between inputs and outputs. The new ANN has the dynamic structure of hidden layer as a directed graph showing the relation between input, hidden and output nodes. The properties of the new dynamic structural ANN are experienced with a pathology problem and its learning methods' performances are compared on a real well known dataset. The result shows that both approaches for structural learning process improve the quality of ANNs during learning iteration.

A prognostic model of de-bonding driving force has been formulated as a function of material science, solid mechanics and fracture mechanics properties to estimate critical, safe and fail conditions of the coating-substrate system. The blister growth velocity rate is also included in the developed model to estimate the blister propagation as a function of diffusion-induced stress and residual stress.

J	Han, DY; Su, X; Shi, PM				Han, Dongying; Su, Xiao; Shi, Peiming			Weak Fault Signal Detection of Rotating Machinery Based on Multistable Stochastic Resonance and VMD-AMD	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							WAVELET TRANSFORM; DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSTICS	For solving detection problems of multifrequency weak signals in noisy background, a novel weak signal detection method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and rescaling frequency-shifted multistable stochastic resonance (RFMSR) with analytical mode decomposition (AMD) is proposed. In this method, different signal frequency bands are processed by rescaling subsampling compression to make each frequency band meet the conditions of stochastic resonance. Before the enhanced signal components are synthesized, they are processed to achieve the enhanced signal by means of AMD, leaving only the enhanced sections of the signal. The processed signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by VMD, in order to require the detection of weak multifrequency signals. The experimental analysis of the rolling bearing inner ring fault and gear fault diagnosis demonstrate that the proposed method can not only enhance signal amplitude, reduce false components, and improve the VMD algorithm's accuracy, but also effectively detect weak multifrequency signals submerged by noise.

The fault detection systems are usually laid out separately with the health monitoring systems in practice. In this paper, the well-established observer-based residual generator is formulated to construct multiple evaluation functions which are employed as the classification features of the support vector machine (SVM) for fault detection. It can be regarded as a tentative approach to combine the model-based and data-driven methods to enhance the fault detection performance. The standard SVM is modified for fault detection to achieve the quantitative tradeoff between false alarm rate and fault detection rate. In Addition, this paper also provides a unified framework for fault detection and health monitoring based on the SVM. Simulations on the ship propulsion system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It was assumed that the signal carrying the important information about the current state of the machine is the measured signal of the axial flux. The basis for the diagnostic decision making was the analysis of the energy of the detailed wavelet representation, obtained as a result of the use of a specially constructed orthonormal transformation basis. To ensure sufficient resolution of fault detection, the authors constructed orthonormal wavelet basis based on the recursive formulas for generating higher order Legendre polynomials. The construction of the orthonormal basis was carried out using the scaling function, which was designed using the appropriately scaled Legendre polynomial. The synthesis of the basic wavelet and the orthonormal basis was based on the recurrent dependencies of the multi-resolution analysis using the relationship between the elements of the quadrature mirror filters. Dependencies between elements from two consecutive levels of decomposition were used. By applying the constructed orthonormal basis, the research on the nature of the energy flow of an axial flux signal of an induction motor between adjacent frequency bandwidths in steady-state depending on the machine load was presented. Studies have shown that significant flows of the diagnostic signal energy occur between the adjacent frequency bandwidths periodically at frequency of about 2.5 Hz. This periodic energy flows of the axial flux signal hamper fault detection and diagnostic decision making. The analysis results confirmed that it is possible to ensure a sufficient level of selectivity of a diagnostic system by means of this method. To ensure a sufficient efficiency of diagnostic systems it is required to separate flow effects from fault symptoms.

J	Abdulraheem, KF; Al-Kindi, G				Abdulraheem, Khalid F.; Al-Kindi, Ghassan			Wind Turbine Condition Monitoring using Multi-Sensor Data System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Condition Monitoring; Wind Turbine Vibration Analysis; Multi-Sensor system for machine health monitoring	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS	Wind turbines are being complex and critical systems. They encompass interacting mechanical and electrical systems subjected to variable aerodynamics and environmental conditions. Therefore, the use of single sensor to monitor and evaluate the performance and working condition of the system will not generate reliable results. To tackle this issue and to enhance the reliability of such system a multi-sensor (i.e. vibrations, torque, voltage and current) fusion system proposed in this paper to monitor the health condition of the wind turbine system. In time domain, both wind turbine vibration and the generated current increased by increasing the blade rotational speed. However, the overall vibration level is reduced by increasing the blade pitch angle. This could relate to the influence of increasing the air resistance, as more area of the blade will be in contact with the air, which plays the role of a damper. The developed air resistance reduce the rotational speed of the blade and consequently the generated current and voltage dropped. In frequency domain, the FFT power spectrum peaks are clearly indicates the influence of the rotational speed of different wind turbine rotating components on the generated frequency peaks. However, the peaks are very clear with less noise in the electrical signals compared with the vibrational signals. This gives a motivation to examine the application of the both vibrational and electrical signals for wind turbine condition monitoring and fault diagnostics.

J	Qin, B; Zhang, LY; Yin, H; Qi, Y				Qin, Bo; Zhang, Luyang; Yin, Heng; Qi, Yan			Multiple Feature Vectors Based Fault Classification for WSN Integrated Bearing of Rolling Mill	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; BAT ALGORITHM; DIAGNOSIS; PCA	For rolling mill machines, the operation status of bearing has a close relationship with process safety and production effectiveness. Therefore, reliable fault diagnosis and classification are indispensable. Traditional methods always characterize fault feature using a single fault vector, which may fail to reveal whole fault influences caused by complex process disturbances. Besides, it may also lead to poor fault classification accuracy. To solve the above-mentioned problems, a fault extraction method is put forward to extract multiple feature vectors and then a classification model is developed. First, to collect sufficient data, a data acquisition system based on wireless sensor network is constructed to replace the traditional wired system which may bring dangers during production. Second, the measured signal is filtered by a morphological average filtering algorithm to remove process noise and then the empirical mode decomposition method is applied to extract the intrinsic mode function (IMF) which contains the fault information. On the basis of the IMFs, a time domain index (energy) and a frequency index (singular values) are proposed through Hilbert envelope analysis. From the above analysis, the energy index and the singular value matrix are used for fault classification modeling based on the enhanced extreme learning machine (ELM), which is optimized by the bat algorithm to adjust the input weights and threshold of hidden layer node. In comparison with the fault classification methods based on SVM and ELM, the experimental results show that the proposed method has higher classification accuracy and better generalization ability.

A modified exponential score function for troubleshooting an improved locally made Offshore Patrol Boat engine	JOURNAL OF MARINE ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PREFERENCE RELATIONS; FAILURE MODE; FUZZY	In this paper, we present an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution model which is based on a modified exponential score function for detecting early failure in a locally made Offshore Patrol Boat engine, with special regard to component interaction failure, using groups of experts' opinions to detect the root cause and the engine systems most affected by the failures in the Boat engine. The study is aimed at providing an alternative method for the traditional product development failure mode identification and analysis methods which hitherto are limited when it comes to component interaction accidents and failure analysis in the machine system. The results from the study show that although early detection of failures in engines is quite difficult due to the dependency of machine systems and components on each other, using an intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making method which is based on experts' opinions these faults/failure can easily be diagnosed and detected.

The harvesters considered in the analysis harvest an average of 20 tons of sugarcane per hour and their malfunction may lead to major losses; therefore, an effective maintenance approach is of main interest for cost savings. For the considered distributions, mathematical background is presented. Maximum likelihood is used for parameter estimation. Further, different discrimination procedures were used to obtain the best fit for each component. At the end, we propose a maintenance scheduling for the components of the harvesters using predictive analysis.

As tool life degradation due to wear is the main limitation to machining productivity and part quality, prediction and periodic assessment of the condition of the tool is very helpful for the machining industry. The RUL prediction of tools is demonstrated based on the force sensor signal values using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) method and Neural Network (NN) techniques. End milling tests were performed on a stainless steel workpiece at constant machining parameters and the cutting force signal data was collected using force dynamometer for feature extraction and further analysis. Both the SVR and NN models were compared based on the same set of experimental data for the prediction performance. Results have shown a good agreement between the predicted and actual RUL of the tools for both models. The difference in the level of the prognostic matrices such as accuracy, precision and prediction horizon for both models was discussed.

While large-scale data processing, analysis, storage, and platform model such as cloud computing were previously and currently are increasingly. Today, the major challenge is it address how to monitor and control these massive amounts of data and perform analysis in real-time at scale. The traditional methods and model systems are unable to cope with these quantities of data in real-time. Here we present a new methodology for constructing a model for optimizing the performance of real-time monitoring of big datasets, which includes a machine learning algorithms and Apache Spark Streaming to accomplish fine-grained fault diagnosis and repair of big dataset. As a case study, we use the failure of Virtual Machines (VMs) to start-up. The methodology proposition ensures that the most sensible action is carried out during the procedure of fine-grained monitoring and generates the highest efficacy and cost-saving fault repair through three construction control steps: (I) data collection; (II) analysis engine and (III) decision engine. We found that running this novel methodology can save a considerate amount of time compared to the Hadoop model, without sacrificing the classification accuracy or optimization of performance. The accuracy of the proposed method (92.13%) is an improvement on traditional approaches.

This paradigm encourages tool sharing and reuse thus can reduce cost and time in product realization. In this research, a new cost estimation framework is developed based on big data analytics tools so that the manufacturing cost associated with a new job can be estimated based on the similar ones in the past. Manufacturers can use this cost analytics service in their job bidding process, which is currently ad hoc and subjective in industry practice. The new framework is implemented and demonstrated for additive manufacturing, where the similarities of 3D geometry of parts and printing processes are established by identifying relevant features. Machine learning algorithms for dynamic clustering, LASSO and elastic net regressions are applied to feature vectors to predict the cost based on historical data.

Hybrid Artificial Intelligence based Fault Diagnosis of SVPWM Voltage Source Inverters for Induction Motor	MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Processing of Materials, Minerals and Energy (PMME)	JUL 29-30, 2016	Ongole, INDIA	PACE Inst Technol & Sci		Voltage Source Inverter; Fault Diagnosis; Hybrid Artificial Intelligence; Back Propagation Neural Networks; Genetic Algorithm	SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; DRIVES	Induction motors are widely used in various industries for production processes due to their inherent characteristics like high reliability, robustness, low cost and ease of construction and operation. However, while in operation they face harsh and severe conditions imposed on them by the electrical, mechanical, thermal and environmental stresses which give rise to abnormalities in machine parameters such as voltages and currents. If the motor drive is allowed to continue to run under such situations, it will lead to catastrophic failure of the motor disrupting the production process and huge loss of revenue. Hence, an intelligent drive control method based on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique of Neuro-Genetic Algorithm is proposed in this paper for condition monitoring, fault diagnosis and evaluation of induction motor without any additional information. The hybrid architecture of Back Propagation Neural Network (BPN) to get the desired output fast and with Genetic Algorithm to overcome the computational complexity and time consuming process involved in BPN.

Early warning of an approaching bearing failure is fundamental to guarantee the machine availability by timely maintenance actions and diminishing breakdown. In this paper, the statistical and frequency analysis of acoustic signals were performed for the detection of bearing defects. The results show that the statistical parameters can be used to detect different types of faults in ball bearings. The power spectral density analysis shows that bearings with different physical conditions running at different speeds emit acoustic signals with different power spectrums. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Vibration analysis is the most predominant procedure to recognize the nature and degree of any issues in machines and components (i.e. bearings and gears) or any upkeep choices identified with the machine. The condition-based maintenance is the request based upkeep to guarantee the machine accessibility by convenient maintenance activities and lessening breakdown upkeep. This paper introduces the state-of-the-art-review to give a wide and great reference for analysts to be used on condition based maintenance of bearings and gears for fault detection.

The specific steps are as follows: First, the vibration signal of a rolling bearing is decomposed by EEMD, and the extracted features are used as the input vectors of AMTS. Then, the AMTS method, which is designed to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional Mahalanobis-Taguchi system and to extract the key features, is proposed for fault diagnosis. Finally, a type of HI concept is proposed according to the results of the fault diagnosis to accomplish the health assessment of a bearing in its life cycle. To validate the superiority of the developed method proposed approach, it is compared with other recent method and proposed methodology is successfully validated on a vibration data-set acquired fromseeded defects and from an accelerated life test. The results show that this method represents the actual situation well and is able to accurately and effectively identify the fault type.

Four mechanical faults (bearing fault, unbalanced rotor, bowed rotor and misaligned rotor), and three electrical faults (broken rotor bars, stator winding fault with two severity levels and phase unbalance with two severity levels) are considered in the present study. The proposed fault diagnosis consists of three steps. In the first step, the vibration in three orthogonal directions and the current in three phases are acquired from the healthy and faulty motors using a machine fault simulator (MFS). In second step, useful statistical features are extracted from the time, frequency and time-frequency domain (continuous wavelet transform (CWT)) of the signal. For the effective fault diagnosis, SVM parameters are optimally selected based on the grid-search method along with 5-fold cross-validation, and the effective fault features are selected based on the wrapper model. Finally, the fault diagnosis of IM is performed using optimal SVM parameters and effective features as input to the SVM. The classification performance of all methodologies developed in three domains is compared for various operating conditions of IMs. The test results showed that the developed methodology could isolate ten IM fault conditions successfully based on features from all three domains at all IM operating conditions; however, time frequency features give the best results.

In order to acquire the information of these faults, various diagnostic methods have been proposed in the past decades. Most methods used the squared envelope spectrum (i.e., the spectrum of the squared envelope) as the final diagnostic tool, but different preprocessing steps were used before obtaining the envelope signal. The key problem is to obtain the center frequency and bandwidth of the fault signal, then analyze the envelope (squared envelope spectrum) of the band-pass filtered signal. The framework of accuracy rate method was proposed by means of cross validation of the nearest neighbor classifier in this paper: a) obtain the piecewise signal through original signal segmentation; b) calculate the feature of each piecewise signal; c) then an accuracy rate is calculated based on cross validation of the nearest neighbor classifier; and d) repeat the above steps in different frequency band, then find a frequency band with the maximum accuracy rate. Through this algorithm, we can obtain a fault frequency band, and then we can find out the type of the fault by the spectrum of the squared envelope. At the end of this paper, the proposed method is validated by two examples and compared with the other two diagnostic methods: conventional envelope analysis and Fast kurtogram. Through the comparison of results, the validity and superiority of this method has been proved.

Aiming at the separation of different signal components induced by rolling bearing composite defects, a novel signal decomposition based on linear time-invariant (LTI) filtering and multiple resonance is proposed in this paper, which can decompose the fault vibration signal with composite defects into high-, middle-, low-resonance components and the low frequency component. The high- and middle-resonance components sparsely represent the damped responses induced by severe and slight defects, respectively. The low-resonance component represents transient component induced by some random interferences, and the low-frequency component contains the components of shaft rotation rate and harmonics caused by shaft bending or imbalance. Compared with conventional dual-Q-factor resonance-based signal sparse decomposition (RSSD), this method can not only detect the feature frequency, realize semi-quantitative analysis of defects' amounts and severities, but also provide a monitor for shaft bending and imbalance. The effectiveness and practicability of this method has been validated by the experimental signal with dual defects on outer race, which explores a new way to apply RSSD to the diagnosis of rolling bearing composite defects.

The increasing presence of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in commercial buildings has resulted in a rising availability of high frequency interval data. These data can be used for a variety of energy efficiency applications such as demand response, fault detection and diagnosis, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) optimization. This large amount of data has also opened the door to the use of advanced statistical learning models, which hold promise for providing accurate building baseline energy consumption predictions, and thus accurate saving estimations. The gradient boosting machine is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is gaining considerable traction in a wide range of data driven applications, such as ecology, computer vision, and biology. In the present work an energy consumption baseline modeling method based on a gradient boosting machine was proposed. To assess the performance of this method, a recently published testing procedure was used on a large dataset of 410 commercial buildings. The model training periods were varied and several prediction accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance. The results show that using the gradient boosting machine model improved the R-squared prediction accuracy and the CV(RMSE) in more than 80 percent of the cases, when compared to an industry best practice model that is based on piecewise linear regression, and to a random forest algorithm.

Prognosis of Bearing Degradation Using Gradient Variable Forgetting Factor RLS Combined With Time Series Model	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adaptive algorithms; ball bearings; fault diagnosis; prognostics and health management; time-series analysis	VIBRATION; DIAGNOSTICS	Rolling element bearing is a critical component in many mechanical systems in view of its critical functionality. One of the major issues industries face today is the failure of bearings, which results in catastrophic consequences. Although various prognostic approaches were proposed for the degradation of bearings, the incapability of adaptation of those models yields inaccurate predictions under different running conditions of the bearings. To address this issue, this paper proposes a prognostic algorithm using the variable forgetting factor recursive least-square (VFF-RLS) combined with an auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) model. The structure and parameters of ARMA model were initially determined using the vibrational data of the bearing without significant defect presented. During the bearing degradation process, the ARMA model makes predictions of the future degradation trend. Once the future acquired signal becomes available, the error between the acquired and predicted vibrational signal is calculated. The VFF-RLS algorithm uses the calculated error, correlation matrix and other parameters to update the coefficients of the ARMA model. In addition, the VEE-RLS algorithm updates the forgetting factor during each iteration to achieve faster convergence and reduced error. The updated ARMA model makes new predictions and the adaptive process continues. To demonstrate the applicability of adaptive prognosis methodology, the accuracy of the prediction of the proposed model is tested using experimental and simulated data in comparison with an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model without adaptation. Results show accurate predictions of the vibrational signal and degradation trend of the bearings over the ARIMA model.

J	Tahir, MM; Badshah, S; Hussain, A; Khattak, MA				Tahir, Muhammad Masood; Badshah, Saeed; Hussain, Ayyaz; Khattak, Muhammad Adil			Extracting accurate time domain features from vibration signals for reliable classification of bearing faults	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Pattern recognition; Feature extraction; Time domain features; Fault diagnosis; Central tendency; Vibration analysis	ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DECISION TREE; DIAGNOSIS; DEFECTS	Identification of localized faults in rolling element bearing (REB) frequently utilizes vibration-based pattern recognition (PR) methods. Time domain (TD) statistical features are often part of the diagnostic models. The extracted statistical values are, however, influenced by the fluctuations present in random vibration signals. These inaccurate values consequently affect the diagnostic capability of the supervised learning based classifiers. This study examines the sensitivity of TD features to signal fluctuations. Vibration data is acquired from different REBs containing localized faults using a test rig, and a central tendency (CT) based feature extraction (CTBFE) method is proposed. The CTBFE ensures the supply of reliable feature values to the PR models. The method selects the fault related appropriate portion of a vibration signal prior to extract TD features. Variety of classifiers is used to judge the effect of CTBFE method on their fault classification accuracies, which are enhanced considerably. The results are also compared with a similar sort of existing method, where the proposed method provides better results and feasibility for on-line applications. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this paper, a novel fusion algorithm is proposed based on local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD), composite spectrum (LCS). and information entropy. To make full use of feature information, the LCS is proposed based on the modification of traditional composite spectral algorithm. LCS high-order power entropy and high-order singular entropy, which are relatively defined in Shannon entropy (SE) and Tsallis entropy (TE), are extracted as initial features. Furthermore, the method of feature fusion is presented to modify the features' conciseness and to improve the performance. Results of the analysis in the experiment indicate that the proposed method is available, and the fused feature is effective in evaluating the pump degradation process.

A STUDY OF VARIOUS BLADE FAULT CONDITIONS ON A WIND TURBINE USING VIBRATION SIGNALS THROUGH HISTOGRAM FEATURES	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Structural health monitoring; Fault diagnosis; Wind turbine blade; Machine learning; Histogram features; Vibration signals	STRUCTURAL DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM; MODEL	Wind energy is one of the rapidly evolving renewable energy resources. It is particularly essential to built dependability and accessibility of wind turbines and additional to decrease the wind energy cost. Wind turbine blades are ought to be an important component among the other basic segments in the wind turbine framework since they transform the dynamic energy of wind into useable power. Wind turbine blades are manufactured from either carbon fiber reinforced polymer or glass fiber reinforced polymer. Damages and flaws are unavoidable either in the manufacturing process or the lifetime of a composite blade. Hence, structural health monitoring for wind turbine blade is essential to avoid failures and extend dependability in both fabrication quality control and in-service investigation. In this study, a three-bladed variable wind turbine was chosen and using histogram features, the condition of a wind turbine blade is inspected. The faults like hub-blade loose connection, blade crack, pitch angle twist, erosion and blade bend faults were studied and these faults are classified using various data mining algorithms. The main contribution of this study is to build and suggest a data-model for fault identification on wind turbine blade while in operation using machine learning classifiers like sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, simple logistic algorithm (SLA), multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic algorithm (LA) and radial basis function (RBF).

J	Jia, R; Ma, FQ; Wu, H; Luo, XQ; Ma, XP				Jia, Rong; Ma, Fuqi; Wu, Hua; Luo, Xingqi; Ma, Xiping			Coupling Fault Feature Extraction Method Based on Bivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition and Full Spectrum for Rotating Machinery	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DIAGNOSIS; EMD; INFORMATION; SYSTEM; IMPACT	To accurately extract the fault characteristics of vibration signals of rotating machinery is of great significance to the unit online monitoring and evaluation. However, because the current feature extraction methods are mainly for single channel, the results of feature extraction are often inaccurate. To this end, a coupling fault feature extraction method based on bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and full spectrum is proposed for rotating machinery. Firstly, the two-dimensional orthogonal signal obtained by orthogonal sampling technique is decomposed by bivariate empirical mode decomposition to obtain the intrinsic mode function with phase information. In order to obtain the sensitive modal components, the sensitivity coefficients are constructed on the basis of mutual information. Then, the sensitivity coefficient of each intrinsic mode function is calculated, and the intrinsic mode function with the larger sensitive coefficient is selected as the sensitive component. Finally, the full spectrum of the sensitive component is obtained using the full vector envelope technique, so as to get a comprehensive and accurate characteristic component. The results of simulations experiment and an application example show that this method can extract the fault characteristic component of the rotating machinery comprehensively and accurately. It is of great significance to realize the accurate diagnosis of coupling faults of rotating machinery.

However, imbalanced distributions exist pervasively between faulty and normal samples, which leads to imprecise fault diagnostics and prognostics. In this paper, an effective imbalance learning algorithm Easy-SMT is proposed. Easy-SMT is an integrated ensemble-based method, which comprises synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE)-based oversampling policy to augment minority faulty classes and EasyEnsemble to transfer an imbalanced class learning problem into an ensemble-based balanced learning subproblem. We validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in a real wind turbine failure forecast challenge, and our solution has won the third place among hundreds of teams. Moreover, we also evaluate the method on prognostics and health management 2015 challenge datasets, and the results show that the model could also achieve good performance on multiclass imbalance learning task compared with baseline classifiers.

J	Zhang, SL; Wang, YX; Liu, MQ; Bao, ZJ				Zhang, Senlin; Wang, Yixing; Liu, Meiqin; Bao, Zhejing			Data-Based Line Trip Fault Prediction in Power Systems Using LSTM Networks and SVM	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Data mining; power system faults; recurrent neural networks; support vector machines	RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION	Power system faults are significant problems in power transmission and distribution. Methods based on relay protection actions and electrical component actions have been put forward in recent years. However, they have deficiencies dealing with power system fault. In this paper, a method for data-based line trip fault prediction in power systems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. The temporal features of multisourced data are captured with LSTM networks, which perform well in extracting the features of time series for a long-time span. The strong learning and mining ability of LSTM networks is suitable for a large quantity of time series in power transmission and distribution. SVM, with a strong generalization ability and robustness, is introduced for classification to get the final prediction results. Considering the overfitting problem in fault prediction, layer of dropout and batch normalization are added into the network. The complete network architecture is shown in this paper in detail. The parameters are adjusted to fit the specific situation of the actual power system. The data for experiments are obtained from the Wanjiang substation in the China Southern Power Grid. The real experiments prove the proposed method's improvements compared with current data mining methods. Concrete analyses of results are elaborated in this paper. A discussion of practical applications is presented to demonstrate the feasibility in real scenarios.

It is meaningful to extract optimal features from raw signal and provide accurate fault diagnosis results. In order to resolve the nonlinear problem, an enhancement deep feature extraction method based on Gaussian radial basis kernel function and autoencoder (AE) is proposed. Firstly, kernel function is employed to enhance the feature learning capability, and a new AE is designed termed kernel AE (KAE). Subsequently, a deep neural network is constructed with one KAE and multiple AEs to extract inherent features layer by layer. Finally, softmax is adopted as the classifier to accurately identify different bearing faults, and error backpropagation algorithm is used to fine-tune the model parameters. Aircraft engine intershaft bearing vibration data are used to verify the method. The results confirm that the proposed method has a better feature extraction capability, requires fewer iterations, and has a higher accuracy than standard methods using a stacked AE.

The orthogonal adaptive transformation consists of calculating the adaptive operator and the standard spectrum for every state, using two sets of vibration signal records for each type of fault. To classify a new signal, we calculate the spectral vector of this signal in each base. Then, the similarity between this vector and other standard spectra is computed. The experimental results show that the proposed method is very useful for improving the fault detection.

J	Sun, Q; Wang, YR; Jiang, YY				Sun, Quan; Wang, Youren; Jiang, Yuanyuan			A Novel Fault Diagnostic Approach for DC-DC Converters Based on CSA-DBN	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Crow search algorithm; dc-dc power converter; deep belief network; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; wavelet packets	POWER ELECTRONIC-CIRCUITS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION	Effective fault diagnosis for mission-critical and safety-critical systems has been an essential and mandatory technique to reduce failure rate and prevent unscheduled shutdown. In this paper, to realize fault diagnosis for a closed-loop single-ended primary inductance converter, a novel optimization deep belief network (DBN) is presented. First, wavelet packet decomposition is adopted to extract the energy values from the voltage signals of four circuit nodes, as the fault feature vectors. Then, a four-layer DBN architecture including input and output layers is developed. Meanwhile, the number of neurons in the two hidden layers is selected by the crow search algorithm (CSA) with training samples. Not only the hard faults such as open-circuit faults and short-circuit faults but also the soft faults such as the component degradation of power MOSFET, inductor, diode, and capacitor are considered in this study. Finally, these fault modes are isolated by CSA-DBN. Compared with the back-propagation neural network and support vector machine fault diagnosis methods, both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method has a higher classification accuracy that proves its effectiveness and superiority to the other methods.

This has given rise to more and more business desire to apply data-driven methods for health monitoring of machines. In recent years, various deep learning algorithms have been adapted to this field, including multi-layer perceptrons, autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and so on. Among these methods, autoencoder is of particular interest for us because of its simple structure and its ability to learn useful features from data in an unsupervised fashion. Previous studies have exploited the use of autoencoders, such as denoising autoencoder, sparsity aotoencoder, and so on, either with one layer or with several layers stacked together, and they have achieved success to certain extent. In this paper, a bearing fault diagnosis method based on fully-connected winner-take-all autoencoder is proposed. The model explicitly imposes lifetime sparsity on the encoded features by keeping only k% largest activations of each neuron across all samples in a mini-batch. A soft voting method is implemented to aggregate prediction results of signal segments sliced by a sliding window to increase accuracy and stability. A simulated data set is generated by adding white Gaussian noise to original signals to test the diagnosis performance under noisy environment. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare our methods with some state-of-the-art bearing fault diagnosis methods. The experiments result show that, with a simple two-layer network, the proposed method is not only capable of diagnosing with high precision under normal conditions, but also has better robustness to noise than some deeper and more complex models.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, F; Wang, ZY; Zhang, WJ				Ding, Yu; Wang, Fei; Wang, Zhen-ya; Zhang, Wen-jin			Fault Diagnosis for Hydraulic Servo System Using Compressed Random Subspace Based ReliefF	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; RELEVANCE	Playing an important role in electromechanical systems, hydraulic servo system is crucial to mechanical systems like engineering machinery, metallurgical machinery, ships, and other equipment. Fault diagnosis based on monitoring and sensory signals plays an important role in avoiding catastrophic accidents and enormous economic losses. This study presents a fault diagnosis scheme for hydraulic servo system using compressed random subspace based ReliefF (CRSR) method. From the point of view of feature selection, the scheme utilizes CRSR method to determine the most stable feature combination that contains the most adequate information simultaneously. Based on the feature selection structure of ReliefF, CRSR employs feature integration rules in the compressed domain. Meanwhile, CRSR substitutes information entropy and fuzzy membership for traditional distance measurement index. The proposed CRSR method is able to enhance the robustness of the feature information against interference while selecting the feature combination with balanced information expressing ability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CRSR method, a hydraulic servo system joint simulation model is constructed by HyPneu and Simulink, and three fault modes are injected to generate the validation data.

First, a cumulative transformation is presented to map the original features extracted from a vibration signal to their respective cumulative forms. The technique not only makes the extracted features show a monotonic trend but also reduces the fluctuation; such properties are more propitious to reflect the bearing degradation trend. Then, a new degradation index system is constructed, which fuses multidimensional cumulative features by kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Finally, an extreme learning machine model based on phase space reconstruction is proposed to predict the degradation trend. The model performance is experimentally validated with a whole-life experiment of a rolling bearing. The results prove that the proposed method reflects the bearing degradation process clearly and achieves a good balance between model accuracy and complexity.

This investigation has exploited the built-in ensemble process of non-iterative classifiers to resolve the most challenging issues in this area, including bearing and stator fault detection. Non-iterative techniques exhibit with an average 15% of increased fault classification accuracy against their iterative counterparts. Particularly RF has shown outstanding performance even at less number of training samples and noisy feature space because of its distributive feature model. The robustness of the results, backed by the experimental verification shows that the non-iterative individual classifiers like RF is the optimum choice in the area of automatic fault diagnosis of induction motor.

Aiming at this problem, an RUL prediction method based on the consistency test of a Wiener process is proposed. Firstly, the parameters of the Wiener process estimated by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) are proved to be biased, and a modified unbiased estimation method is proposed and verified by derivation and simulations. Then, the h statistic is constructed according to the reciprocal of the variation coefficient of the Wiener process, and the sampling distribution is derived. Meanwhile, a universal method for the consistency test is proposed based on the sampling distribution theorem, which is verified by simulation data and classical crack degradation data. Finally, based on the consistency test of the degradation model, a weighted fusion RUL prediction method is presented for the fuel pump of an airplane, and the validity of the presented method is verified by accurate computation results of real data, which provides a theoretical and practical guidance for engineers to predict the RUL of equipment after maintenance.

In the first step, using the empirical mode decomposition method, the original statistical characteristics were calculated from intrinsic mode functions of the vibration signal. Due to information redundancy of the original statistical characteristics, this paper presents a novel features extraction method that combines K-means method and standard deviation to select the most sensitive characteristics. Furthermore, a modified features dimensionality reduction method is proposed, to realize the low-dimensional representations for high-dimensional feature space. Finally, the performance of the fault diagnosis model is evaluated by vibration signals with 12 bearing fault conditions, which are provided by Bearing Data Center of Case Western Reserve University. Experiment results show that the proposed fault diagnosis model can serve as an effective and adaptive bearing fault diagnosis system.

J	Chen, ZZ; Cao, SC; Mao, ZJ				Chen, Zhongzhe; Cao, Shuchen; Mao, Zijian			Remaining Useful Life Estimation of Aircraft Engines Using a Modified Similarity and Supporting Vector Machine (SVM) Approach	ENERGIES			English	Article						prognostics; residual useful life; similarity-based approach; supporting vector machine (SVM)	RESIDUAL LIFE; DAMAGE PARAMETER; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; MODEL	As the main power source for aircrafts, the reliability of an aero engine is critical for ensuring the safety of aircrafts. Prognostics and health management (PHM) on an aero engine can not only improve its safety, maintenance strategy and availability, but also reduce its operation and maintenance costs. Residual useful life (RUL) estimation is a key technology in the research of PHM. According to monitored performance data from the engine's different positions, how to estimate RUL of an aircraft engine by utilizing these data is a challenge for ensuring the engine integrity and safety. In this paper, a framework for RUL estimation of an aircraft engine is proposed by using the whole lifecycle data and performance-deteriorated parameter data without failures based on the theory of similarity and supporting vector machine (SVM). Moreover, a new state of health indicator is introduced for the aircraft engine based on the preprocessing of raw data. Finally, the proposed method is validated by using 2008 PHM data challenge competition data, which shows its effectiveness and practicality.

The first step in detecting such failures is the mathematical modeling of the motor under healthy and failed conditions. In this paper, an attempt to develop an accurate mathematical model for this motor under static eccentricity is presented. The model is based on the modified winding function method and coupled magnetic circuits approach. The model parameters are calculated directly from the motor winding layout and its geometry. Static eccentricity effects are considered in the motor inductances calculation. The performance of the line start permanent magnet synchronous motor using the developed mathematical model is investigated using MATLAB/SIMULINK (R) software (2013b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) under healthy and static eccentricity condition for different loading values.

Accurate prediction of the concentration of dissolved gas in oil can provide an important reference for the evaluation of the state of the transformer. A combined predicting model is proposed based on kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) using an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (FFOA) to select the smooth factor. Firstly, based on the idea of using the dissolved gas ratio of oil to diagnose the transformer fault, gas concentration ratios are also used as characteristic parameters. Secondly, the main parameters are selected from the feature parameters using the KPCA method, and the GRNN is then used to predict the gas concentration in the transformer oil. In the training process of the network, the FFOA is used to select the smooth factor of the neural network. Through a concrete example, it is shown that the method proposed in this paper has better data fitting ability and more accurate prediction ability compared with the support vector machine (SVM) and gray model (GM) methods.

J	Song, JH; Kim, KH				Song, Jae-Hwan; Kim, Kyeong-Hwa			A Practical Approach to Localize Simultaneous Triple Open-Switches for a PWM Inverter-Fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine Drive System	ENERGIES			English	Article						free-wheeling mode detection; PWM inverter; reliable on-line fault localization; seven fault groups; three simultaneous open-switches	OPEN-CIRCUIT FAULT; VOLTAGE-SOURCE INVERTERS; INDUCTION-MOTOR DRIVES; SPEED DRIVES; PMSM DRIVE; DIAGNOSIS; MODEL; SCHEME	In order to overcome the limitations of conventional diagnosis methods, this paper proposes a reliable and practical on-line fault localization scheme for a pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter-fed permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drive system even when the inverter has simultaneous open faults in up to three switches. An open-switch fault is usually initiated by an accidental over-current, or electrical and thermal stresses. This fault may induce crucial secondary damage in the drive system since it is easily propagated and produces a continuous harmful effect on other system components. The open-switch faults in inverters often occur in a very complicated manner. Due to this reason, it was only recently that real-time diagnosis schemes under the open-switch faults in multiple switches have been presented in a few references. However, to alleviate the complexity and exactness issues, most of the conventional diagnosis schemes have considered the open faults only in two simultaneous switches until now, which is not generally the case. Even though the fault detection is simple and immediate, the exact fault localization is not a simple task, especially when there are open faults in three simultaneous switches because different open-switch fault locations may develop the same fault signature. To deal with such a problem, free-wheeling mode detection is introduced in this paper for the purpose of identifying the exact fault group and the faulty switch location. Then main objective of this paper is to realize a reliable fault localization algorithm under the condition of simultaneous open-switches (up to three) on an online basis without requiring any extra hardware or sensors in order that the algorithm can be easily installed in main CPU of a commercial drive system. For this purpose, the open faults in simultaneous switches are categorized into seven different fault groups. The entire system is implemented on a digital controller by using TMS320F28335 digital signal processor (DSP). The experimental results are presented under various open fault conditions to validate the usefulness of the proposed open-switch fault localization scheme.

The paper firstly overviews the manufacturing process of engine bearing and then discusses the need of automating the pneumatic press. The proposed automation system involves (a) speed control by replacing the conventional method with a variable frequency drive (VFD), (b) feeder and pusher control using PLC, (c) fault detection and safety measures, (d) and PLC-based sequential control of all the processes carried out on pneumatic press. The control system is based on MicroLogix-1000 PLC from Allen Bradley and the ladder logic program for it has been written on RSlogix-500. For the evaluation of the proposed control system, the PLC program was emulated on RSLogix Emulate-500 and the operations of the pneumatic press were simulated on FluidSIM-P. The results of simulation validate the design of PLC based controller in general and digital input-output connections of the PLC and PLC program in particular. (C) 2018 The Authors.

J	Zeng, DT; Zhou, DJ; Tan, CQ; Jiang, BY				Zeng, Detang; Zhou, Dengji; Tan, Chunqing; Jiang, Baoyang			Research on Model-Based Fault Diagnosis for a Gas Turbine Based on Transient Performance	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						fault diagnosis; gas turbine; transient performance; cuckoo search; modeling and simulation; deterioration	SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR	It is essential to monitor and to diagnose faults in rotating machinery with a high thrust-weight ratio and complex structure for a variety of industrial applications, for which reliable signal measurements are required. However, the measured values consist of the true values of the parameters, the inertia of measurements, random errors and systematic errors. Such signals cannot reflect the true performance state and the health state of rotating machinery accurately. High-quality, steady-state measurements are necessary for most current diagnostic methods. Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain these kinds of measurements for most rotating machinery. Diagnosis based on transient performance is a useful tool that can potentially solve this problem. A model-based fault diagnosis method for gas turbines based on transient performance is proposed in this paper. The fault diagnosis consists of a dynamic simulation model, a diagnostic scheme, and an optimization algorithm. A high-accuracy, nonlinear, dynamic gas turbine model using a modular modeling method is presented that involves thermophysical properties, a component characteristic chart, and system inertial. The startup process is simulated using this model. The consistency between the simulation results and the field operation data shows the validity of the model and the advantages of transient accumulated deviation. In addition, a diagnostic scheme is designed to fulfill this process. Finally, cuckoo search is selected to solve the optimization problem in fault diagnosis.

Therefore, early fault detection is required to reduce the maintenance expenses and obviate high cost and unscheduled downtimes. Fault diagnosis systems that provide features extraction and patterns classification of the fault are able to detect and classify the failures in machines. The majority of the related works that reported a procedure for detection of rotor bar breakage so far have applied motor current signal analysis using discrete wavelet transform. In this paper, the most appropriate features are extracted from the coefficients of a wavelet packet transform after fast Fourier transform of current signal. The aim of this study is to develop an effective and sensitive method for fault detection under low load conditions. Through combining the strength of both time-scale and frequency domain analysis techniques, a unified wavelet packet signature analysis pinpoints the fault signature in the special fault-oriented frequency bands. The wavelet analysis combined with a feed-forward neural network classifier provides an intelligent methodology for the automatic diagnosis of the fault severity during runtime of the motor. The faults severity is considered as one, two, and three broken rotor bars. The results have confirmed that the proposed method is effective for diagnosing rotor bar breakage fault in an induction motor and classification of fault severity.

J	Pino, G; Ribas, JR; Guimaraes, LF				Pino, Gabriel; Ribas, Jose Roberto; Guimaraes, Luciana Fernandes			Bearing Diagnostics of Hydro Power Plants Using Wavelet Packet Transform and a Hidden Markov Model with Orbit Curves	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; SPEECH RECOGNITION; ENVELOPE ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; VIBRATION; PROGNOSTICS; DECOMPOSITION; MACHINES; NOISE	The contribution of a medium-sized hydro power plant to the power grid can be either at base load or at peak load. When the latter is the most common operation mode, it increases the start and stop frequency, intensifying the hydro turbine components' degradation, such as the guide bearings. This happens due to more frequent operation in transient states, which means being outside the service point of the machines' nominal condition, consisting of speed, flow, and gross head. Such transient state operation increases the runner bearings' mechanical vibration. The readings are acquired during the runner start-ups and filtered by a DC component mean value and a wavelet packet transform. The filtered series are used to estimate the relationship between the maximum orbit curve displacement and the accumulated operating hours. The estimated equation associated with the ISO 7919-5 vibration standards establishes the sojourn times of the degradation states, sufficient to obtain the transition probability distribution. Thereafter, a triangular probability function is used to determine the observation probability distribution in each state. Both matrices are inputs required by a hidden Markov model aiming to simulate the equipment deterioration process, given a sequence of maximum orbit curve displacements.

J	Vaziri, V; Hamidi, JK; Sayadi, AR				Vaziri, Vahid; Hamidi, Jafar Khademi; Sayadi, Ahmad Reza			An integrated GIS-based approach for geohazards risk assessment in coal mines	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Geohazard risk; GIS; Geostatistical estimation; Rock engineering system (RES); Tabas coal mine	MINING SAFETY; NORTH CHINA; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; METHODOLOGY; PREDICTION; HAZARDS; HEALTH	From the viewpoint of safety in underground coal mining, the most suitable mining panel is the one with minimum geological structures, the right machinery, and equipment selection, trained employee, and proficient stope management. Since the ground parameters are uncontrollable and inherent uncertainties exist, a high percent of risk will usually accompany the underground coal mining activities. The main purpose of this study is to present a geological-geotechnical risk assessment model for identification of high risk-prone areas in underground coal mines using an integrated GIS-geostatistics system. Tabas as the first mechanized and largest underground coal mine in Iran was selected as a case study in this study. Gas content of coal seam, Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR), initial in situ stress state, fault throw, and orientation were selected as hazard/risk factors. For estimating the amount of coal seam gas content, CMRR and initial in situ stress in unsampled areas and providing the prediction maps, geostatistics module in ArcGIS was used. Rock engineering system-interaction matrix method was used for attribute weight assignment. Next, the attribute layers were weighted, rated, and overlaid to create a final map of geohazards risk. The analysis results of final risk map indicate that about 45% of under study area is prone to high to very high geohazards risk. Comparison of the results with experiences obtained during the early part of the mine and mined-out panels showed generally good agreement with promising ideas. This highlights the potential application of the GIS-based approach for hazards detection and geohazards risk assessment in underground coal mines.

Automated point mapping for building control systems: Recent advances and future research needs	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Building automation systems; Building control; Machine learning; Point mapping; Metadata; Semantics	MIXTURE; ENERGY	This paper presents a review of recent research and development on methodologies relevant to automating mapping of points in building control systems and between building control systems and external or replacement software and hardware. Manual point mapping is labor intensive and costly, presenting a major impediment to innovations in building control (e.g., automated fault detection and diagnostics, self-healing, and automated commissioning for existing building control systems). The methods reviewed focus on classifying building control system points, especially sensor classifications by sensor type. Fewer publications address other important aspects of the point mapping problem, such as discovering spatial and functional relationships among points, relationships between control system points, physical systems, and equipment, and between various equipment and the systems of which they are part, and discovering metadata, normalizing it to a common namespace, and assigning the metadata to control system points. To motivate further development of new automated point mapping approaches, we identify many research questions organized into four key technical needs: 1) a complete solution and underlying problem formulation, 2) alignment of methods with the actual point mapping problem, 3) test cases, data sets for testing, explicit test procedures, and consistent performance metrics for reporting testing and evaluation results, and 4) understanding of the applicable data space to ensure future adaptability of automated BAS point mapping.

The network is developed under the foundation of bayesian belief network theory, which comprises two main elements: the structure and parameters. The structure obtained by machine learning and experts' experiences illustrates the relationships among faults and physical variables from the qualitative prospective, and its parameters (including prior probability distribution and conditional distribution) describe the uncertainty between them quantitatively. Once the structure and parameters are determined, the posterior probability distribution which can be used to complete fault diagnosis and isolation will be calculated by some algorithms. In comparison with other fault diagnosis approaches, the proposed approach can make full use of performance information. Moreover, it is more reasonable and precise to express the relationship between faults and variables rather than Boolean variables.

J	Sinha, AK; Das, S; Chatterjee, TK				Sinha, Ashish Kumar; Das, Sukanta; Chatterjee, Tarun Kumar			WAVELET TRANSFORM BASED BALL BEARING FAULT DETECTION SCHEME FOR HEAVY DUTY MINING ELECTRICAL MOTORS UNDER SUPPLY FREQUENCY REGULATION USING MCSA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Bearing fault; Condition monitoring; Discrete wavelet transform; Squirrel cage induction motor	INDUCTION MACHINE	Most heavy duty mining electrical drives employ squirrel cage induction motors (SCIMs) which are subjected to various undesirable stresses. Therefore, condition monitoring of the SCIMs is indispensable for achieving production goals with minimum downtime in a fault-free working environment. Because bearing damage is the most frequently occurring fault in SCIMs, an effective fault detection scheme will aid in achieving production targets in an industrial mining scenario. In this regard, the present work intends to propose an effective fault monitoring algorithm, which is immune to supply frequency regulation, for the detection of ball bearing damage in an SCIM. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for the design of the fault detection scheme. Validation of the proposed scheme is done in a LabVIEW based laboratory interface. The complete analysis is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink using a 5.5 kW, 3-phase, 415 V, 50 Hz SCIM.

The proposed method relies on the use of the optimized Slepian window for performing the short time Fourier transform (STFT) of the stator current signal. It is shown that for a given sequence length of finite duration, the Slepian window has the maximum concentration of energy, greater than can be reached with a gated Gaussian window, which is usually used as the analysis window. In this paper, the use and optimization of the Slepian window for fault diagnosis of induction machines is theoretically introduced and experimentally validated through the test of a 3.15-MW induction motor with broken bars during the start-up transient. The theoretical analysis and the experimental results show that the use of the Slepian window can highlight the fault components in the current's spectrogram with a significant reduction of the required computational resources.

Vibration signals were decomposed using ELCD, and numerous intrinsic scale components (ISCs) were obtained. Next, time-domain index, energy, and relative entropy of intrinsic scale components were calculated. According to the distance-based evaluation approach, sensitivity features can be extracted. Finally, sensitivity features were input to extreme learning machine to identify rolling bearing fault types. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved better performance than support vector machine (SVM) and backpropagation (BP) neural network methods.

J	Aydin, I; Karakose, M; Karakose, E; Akin, E				Aydin, Ilhan; Karakose, Mehmet; Karakose, Ebru; Akin, Erhan			A new fault diagnosis approach for induction motor using negative selection algorithm and its real-time implementation on FPGA	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Negative selection algorithm; clonal selection; FPGA; induction motors; fault detection	ELECTRIC MOTOR; BROKEN BAR; MACHINE; SPACE; TREE	Condition monitoring of induction motors has become an important issue of researchers in recent years. The detection of broken rotor bar faults is one of the most difficult problems and many methods have been proposed for accurate detection of these faults. In recent years, some studies have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance by combining different signal processing techniques. However, the proposed methods require high computational complexity. The contribution of this study is threefold. The first one is a new feature extraction method to distinguish different motor conditions by analyzing one phase of induction motor steady-state current. The phase space of the feature signal is constructed by using determined time delay and embedding dimension. The second contribution is to optimize the detectors of the negative selection algorithm by clonal selection. The proposed clonal selection algorithm minimizes the overlap between the detectors and maximizes the coverage of the anomalous data. Because the feature extraction method and test stage of the negative selection algorithm have low computational complexity, the last contribution is Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) implementation for online detection of rotor related faults.

J	Sinha, AK; Das, S; Chatterjee, TK				Sinha, Ashish Kumar; Das, Sukanta; Chatterjee, Tarun Kumar			Empirical relation for broken bar determination in SCIM	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fourier transforms; Current signature analysis; Squirrel cage induction motor; z test	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; BINOMIAL MODEL; MOTORS	Purpose - Condition monitoring of squirrel cage induction motors (SCIMs) is indispensible for achieving fault-free working environment. As broken rotor bars (BRBs) are one of the more frequent faults in a SCIM especially where direct-on-line starting is indispensible, as in underground mines, a priori knowledge of fault severity in terms of the number of BRBs assists in effective fault monitoring. In this regard, this paper aims to propose a unique empirical relation to facilitate the determination of number of BRB. Design/methodology/approach - Fast Fourier transform is used to obtain fault sideband amplitudes under varying number of BRBs and load torque for 5.5 kW, 7.5 kW, 10 kW, three-phase, 415 V, 50 Hz SCIMs in MATLAB/Simulink. The nature of variation is decided by an appropriate curve fitting technique for comprehending a unique empirical relation. The proposed empirical relation is validated by bootstrapping and z-test. Furthermore, hardware validation is done using 1 kW laboratory prototype with Labview interface. Findings - The analytical study reveals the dependence of lower and upper sideband amplitudes on the number of BRBs, load torque and machine rating. Therefore, fault severity in terms of number of BRBs is accurately calculated using the proposed empirical relation if load torque, machine rating and amplitudes of lower and upper sidebands are known. Originality/value - The unique empirical relation proposed in the present work provides accurate knowledge of fault severity in terms of the number of BRBs. This facilitates maintenance scheduling which shall reduce effective downtime and improve production.

Central to the ideas aimed at curbing this trend is the use of technology in the form of the mandate to implement electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs consist of patient information such as demographics, medications, laboratory test results, diagnosis codes, and procedures. Mining EHRs could lead to improvement in patient health management as EHRs contain detailed information related to disease prognosis for large patient populations. In this article, we provide a structured and comprehensive overview of data mining techniques for modeling EHRs. We first provide a detailed understanding of the major application areas to which EHR mining has been applied and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanying challenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metrics associated with EHRs, and the various study designs. With this foundation, we then provide a systematic and methodological organization of existing data mining techniques used to model EHRs and discuss ideas for future research.

In safety-critical equipment, where the occurrence of faults can generate catastrophic losses, health monitoring of most critical components is absolutely needed to avoid and prevent breakdowns. In this paper, a noninvasive health monitoring method is proposed. It is based on fuzzy logic and the neural network to estimate and predict the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the capacitance (C) of capacitors and supercapacitors (SCs). This method, based on the neo-fuzzy neuron model, performs a real-time processing (time series prediction) of the measured device impedance and the degradation data provided by accelerated ageing tests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, two experiments are performed. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the ESR and C for a set of 8 polymer film capacitors, while the second one is dedicated to the prediction of the ESR and C for a set of 18 SCs.

The effect of load torque oscillation should be considered in induction motor drives for reliable broken bar fault detection. Induction machine drivers are run in DTC mode to control its torque and speed. In practice, the presence of load torque fluctuation may sometimes cause false positive alarms on stator current spectrum. However, discerning of broken rotor bar failure from low-frequency load variation for DTC drives remains unexplored. Experimental results show that by using the proposed method broken rotor bar failure can be reliably detected in the presence of low-frequency load torque oscillation in DTC induction motor drives.

In the proposed method, the degradation messages are interpreted as quantized measurements. The use of degradation messages reduces the need for data communication bandwidth, since they only need to be transmitted or stored when some predefined threshold is crossed. In contrast, the direct monitoring of degradation-related measurements requires frequent updates, usually at a fixed sampling rate. This characteristic is fundamental on failure prognostics applications in real aircraft due to the high infrastructure costs associated with data transmission. A case study using field data recorded from commercial aircraft is presented to illustrate the proposed methodology. The problem under consideration consists of estimating the time remaining until the fluid level reaches unacceptably low values in the hydraulic system. Two quantization steps are considered in the evaluation. Predictions employing direct measurements of fluid level are also performed to establish a comparative performance baseline. The results show that it is possible to choose a quantization step that allows a reduction in the transmission costs without significant loss of prognostics performance. Note to Practitioners-Failure prediction is a topic of great interest in various industry sectors. Predicting these events is challenging not only because of the advanced techniques involved in signal processing but also the availability of these signals with proper quality. Specifically in the aeronautical industry, the availability of signals for failure prediction may rely on in-flight data transmission systems. The usage of such systems can lead to prohibitive costs when transmitting large quantities of data. As a consequence, most commercial aircraft monitoring systems can only send a small set of failure messages indicating that the systems are failed or, in some cases, that they achieved an intermediate degradation level. This paper proposes an adaptation of a state-of-the-art failure prognostics algorithm (particle filter) that uses intermediate degradation messages to predict failure instants. The method is tested with real commercial aircraft data and the impact of the number of intermediate degradation levels is analyzed.

These plaque features are: thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), plaque burden PB >= 70%, or minimal luminal area MLA <= 4 mm(2). Identification of arterial locations likely to later develop such high-risk plaques may help prevent MACE. We report a machine learning method for prediction of future high-risk coronary plaque locations and types in patients under statin therapy. Sixty-one patients with stable angina on statin therapy underwent baseline and one-year follow-up VH-IVUS non-culprit vessel examinations followed by quantitative image analysis. For each segmented and registered VH-IVUS frame pair (n = 6341), location-specific (approximate to 0.5 mm) vascular features and demographic information at baseline were identified. Seven independent support vector machine classifiers with seven different feature subsets were trained to predict high-risk plaque types one year later. A leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction power of different feature subsets. The experimental results showed that our machine learning method predicted future TCFA with correctness of 85.9%, 81.7%, and 77.0% (G-mean) for baseline plaque phenotypes of TCFA, thick-cap fibroatheroma, and non-fibroatheroma, respectively. For predicting PB >= 70%, correctness was 80.8% for baseline PB >= 70% and 85.6% for 50% <= PB< 70%. Accuracy of predicted MLA <= 4 mm(2) was 81.6% for baseline MLA <= 4 mm(2) and 80.2% for 4 mm(2) < MLA <= 6 mm(2). Location-specific prediction of future high-risk coronary artery plaques is feasible through machine learning using focal vascular features and demographic variables. Our approach outperforms previously reported results and shows the importance of local factors on high-risk coronary artery plaque development.

Therefore, the main role of maintenance and production managers is to keep manufacturing system always up by adopting most appropriate maintenance methods. There are alternative maintenance techniques for each machine, the selection of which depend on multiple factors. The contemporary approaches to maintenance technique selection emphasize on operational needs and economic factors only. As the reliability of production systems is the strategic intent of manufacturing organizations, maintenance technique selection must consider strategic factors of the concerned organization along with operational and economic criteria. The main aim of this research is to develop a method for selecting the most appropriate maintenance technique for manufacturing industry with the consideration of strategic, planning and operational criteria through involvement of relevant stakeholders. The proposed method combines quality function deployment (QFD), the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the benefit of doubt (BoD) approach. QFD links strategic intents of the organizations with the planning and operational needs, the AHP helps in prioritizing the criteria for selection and ranking the alternative maintenance techniques, and the BoD approach facilitates analysing robustness of the method through sensitivity analysis through setting the realistic limits for decision making. The proposed method has been applied to maintenance technique selection problems of three productive systems of a gear manufacturing organization in India to demonstrate its effectiveness.

J	Xiao, QL; Fang, YL; Liu, Q; Zhou, SJ				Xiao, Qili; Fang, Yilin; Liu, Quan; Zhou, Shujuan			Online machine health prognostics based on modified duration-dependent hidden semi-Markov model and high-order particle filtering	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Online health prognostics; Modified duration-dependent hidden semi-Markov model; Forward-backward algorithm; High-order particle filter; Residual useful lifetime assessment	DIAGNOSTICS; PREDICTION	Accurate online health prognostics is considered as a significant part of the condition-based maintenance (CBM), and it contributes to reduce downtime and achieve the most reliable running condition for machinery equipment. In this paper, an online machine health prognostics approach is proposed based on the modified duration-dependent hidden semi-Markov model (MDD-HSMM) and the high-order particle filter (HOPF) method. In the MDD-HSMM, the health state transition probabilities and the observation probabilities are both defined not only as state dependent like traditional HSMM does, but also as duration dependent, which is more realistic to describe the state space model to model the mechanical failure propagation process. And a new forward-backward algorithm is developed to facilitate the training process and to reduce computational complexity of the proposed MDD-HSMM. Then, the HOPF method with an online update scheme is applied to recognize the health states and predict the residual useful lifetime (RUL) value of machine in real time, which is based on the health state space model established by the MDD-HSMM and the online sensing monitoring data. And, a sliding window with variable length, which represents the relationship between current state and several previous states, is applied to adjust the order of HOPF. Finally, a real case study is used to illustrate the prognostics performance of the proposed approach and the experiment results indicate that the proposed approach has higher effectiveness than conventional HSMM methods.

It is feasible to make the features distinct through wavelet denoising. However, some of the deterministic signals may be lost with noise removed resulting in the loss of energy which make it difficult to judge the real components of the surface. An improved signal determination method - wavelet denoising with compensation of the loss (WDCL) is proposed in this paper. The compensation method uses ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and transfer function in which instantaneous frequency is calculated by Hilbert transform (HT). The coefficients of the transfer function are adjusted by improving the passing rate of the deterministic signals and lowering the passing rate of noise. The result shows that the WDCL can enhance the resolution of the real signals and reduce noise further.

J	Yang, CS; Shen, WM; Chen, QQ; Gunay, B				Yang, Chunsheng; Shen, Weiming; Chen, Qiangqiang; Gunay, Burak			A practical solution for HVAC prognostics: Failure mode and effects analysis in building maintenance	JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING			English	Article						FMEA; Work-order; Fault Detection and diagnostics (FDD); Prognostics; HVAC	FAULT-DETECTION; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS; DEMAND	Fault detection, diagnostics, and prognostics (FDD&P) is attracting an amount of attention from building operators and researchers because it can help greatly improve the performance of building operations by reducing energy consumption for heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) while improving occupant comfort at the same time. However, FDD&P, particularly HVAC prognostics, for building operations remains with many challenges due to special operation environments of HVAC systems. These challenges include "tolerance or ignorance" of failures in long-haul operations, lack of operation regulations, and even lack of documents for HVAC failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), which is a systematic method of identifying and preventing system, product and process problems. To address some of these challenges, the authors propose an FMEA method for common building HVAC equipment by exploring work-orders generated by building energy management systems (BEMS) using a data mining approach. With this FMEA approach, it is possible for building operators to isolate and prognose faults practically. The FMEA approach also helps us tackle high impact failures, for which operation data can be acquired and machine learning-based predictive models can be developed. This paper reports some preliminary results in conducting an HVAC FMEA from a large number of work-orders obtained from a BEMS in routine operations. The HVAC FMEA will be used as a guidance tool for data gathering and developing data-driven models for HVAC FDD&P and as a practical solution for HVAC prognostics in case that predictive models are difficult to develop.

Multiscale morphology is suited to demodulate the signal because of its powerful demodulation ability. However, when the structuring element scales are increased gradually, the multiscale morphology method using closing and/or opening allows the low-amplitude impulses to be eliminated. Therefore, iterative asymmetric multiscale morphology is explored in this paper to handle the problem. Firstly, a modified difference filter is developed based on closing and opening to conduct iterative morphology operation, and then a type of asymmetric-multiscale is designed to set the structuring element scales of the modified difference filter filter for demodulating the fault signal with amplitude modulation well. Meanwhile, iterative morphology is conducted to enhance the impulsive features, and kurtosis acts as the iteration stop condition. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by both simulation experiment and the vibration signals of rolling element bearings with an inner race, an outer, and a rolling element faults. In comparisons with the conventional multiscale morphology, the results demonstrate that the iterative asymmetric multiscale morphology method has better diagnosis for the bearing faults.

J	Jain, I; Jain, VK; Jain, R				Jain, Indu; Jain, Vinod Kumar; Jain, Renu			Correlation feature selection based improved-Binary Particle Swarm Optimization for gene selection and cancer classification	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Microarray data analysis; Cancer classification; Improved Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (iBPSO); Hybrid model; Gene selection; Naive-Bayes	TUMOR; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; PATTERNS	DNA microarray technology has emerged as a prospective tool for diagnosis of cancer and its classification. It provides better insights of many genetic mutations occurring within a cell associated with cancer. However, thousands of gene expressions measured for each biological sample using microarray pose a great challenge. Many statistical and machine learning methods have been applied to get most relevant genes prior to cancer classification. A two phase hybrid model for cancer classification is being proposed, integrating Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) with improved-Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (iBPSO). This model selects a low dimensional set of prognostic genes to classify biological samples of binary and multi class cancers using NaiveBayes classifier with stratified 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed iBPSO also controls the problem of early convergence to the local optimum of traditional BPSO. The proposed model has been evaluated on 11 benchmark microarray datasets of different cancer types. Experimental results are compared with seven other well known methods, and our model exhibited better results in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes in most cases. In particular, it achieved up to 100% classification accuracy for seven out of eleven datasets with a very small sized prognostic gene subset (up to <1.5%) for all eleven datasets.

Wind turbines are getting bigger in size and power, what incurs that a simple unit breakdown causes large energy losses. They operate under varying, complex and dynamic loads due to the environmental conditions, such as wind shear, turbulence, gusts, etc. Condition-based and prognostic and health maintenance is key to assure reliable and efficient performance of wind farms, especially offshore. Fault diagnosis is important, but given the operational complexity of the wind turbines, previous knowledge about the condition of a wind turbine component and fault prognostics are the state of the art of wind farm operation. Although some advance has been made in the diagnostics of faults of wind turbines, very little research has been carried out in the field of fault prognostics of wind turbines. Then, there is an urgent need to develop prognostic techniques for such complex systems operating in real conditions. This article aims to present a comprehensive, specific and concise review of the up to date efforts and advances in the research of prognostic techniques and remaining useful life estimation methods applied to the critical components of wind turbines and analyse its advantages, capabilities and limitations.

J	Cheng, FZ; Qu, LY; Qiao, W				Cheng, Fangzhou; Qu, Liyan; Qiao, Wei			Fault Prognosis and Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Wind Turbine Gearboxes Using Current Signal Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); current signal; fault prognosis; gearbox; particle filtering (PF); prediction; remaining useful life (RUL); wind turbine	DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Gearbox faults constitute a significant portion of all faults and contribute to a significant portion of the downtime of wind turbines. Thus, an accurate prediction of the gearbox remaining useful life (RUL) is important to achieve condition-based maintenance to ensure secure and reliable operations of wind turbines and reduce the cost of wind power. This, however, is a challenging work due to the lack of accurate physical degradation models and limited data. This paper proposes a new fault prognostic and RUL prediction method for gearboxes based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and particle filtering (PF) approaches. In the proposed method, the fault feature is extracted from the measured one phase stator current of the generator connected with the gearbox; the ANFIS learns the state transition function of the extracted fault feature; the PF algorithm then predicts the RUL of the gearbox based on the learned state transition function and new information of the fault feature. Experimental results on a gearbox run-to-failure test are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Rashidi, B; Singh, DS; Zhao, Q				Rashidi, Bahador; Singh, Dheeraj Sharan; Zhao, Qing			Data-driven root-cause fault diagnosis for multivariate non-linear processes	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						Kernel PCA; Root-cause fault diagnosis; Symbolic dynamic-based normalized transfer entropy (SDNTE); Joint xD-Markov machine	PLANT-WIDE OSCILLATIONS; TRANSFER ENTROPY; IDENTIFICATION; PARAMETERS; SYSTEMS	In a majority of multivariate processes, propagating nature of malfunctions makes the fault diagnosis a challenging task. This paper presents a novel data-driven strategy for real-time root-cause fault diagnosis in multivariate (non-)linear processes by estimating the strength of causality using normalized transfer entropy (NTE) between measured process variables and variations of a residual signal. In this paper, a new framework for root-cause fault diagnosis applicable for multivariate nonlinear processes is proposed, which can reduce the necessary number of calculation for causality analysis among time-series. More specially, a new and fast symbolic dynamic-based normalized transfer entropy (SDNTE) technique is proposed to enable real-time application of transfer entropy, which has been considered as a burdensome approach for causality analysis. The concept of SDNTE is built upon principles of time-series symbolization, xD-Markov machine and Shannon entropy. This paper also introduces a new concept of joint xD-Markov machine to capture dynamic interactions between two time-series. The,proposed root-cause fault diagnosis framework is applied on Tennessee Eastman process benchmark and its computational advantages are shown by comparing with conventional kernel PDF-based method.

J	Zidi, S; Moulahi, T; Alaya, B				Zidi, Salah; Moulahi, Tarek; Alaya, Bechir			Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks Through SVM Classifier	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						WSNs; fault detection; machine learning; SVM; classification	DIAGNOSIS	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are prone to many failures such as hardware failures, software failures, and communication failures. The fault detection in WSNs is a challenging problem due to sensor resources limitation and the variety of deployment field. Furthermore, the detection has to be precise to avoid negative alerts, and rapid to limit loss. The use of machine learning seems to be one of the most convenient solutions for detecting failure in WSNs. In this paper, support vector machines (SVMs) classification method is used for this purpose. Based on statistical learning theory, SVMis used in our context to define a decision function. As a light process in term of required resources, this decision function can be easily executed at cluster heads to detect anomalous sensor. The effectiveness of SVM for fault detection in WSNs is shown through an experimental study, comparing it to latest techniques for the same application.

The challenge on sensor technology and processing is determined by dynamic process behavior in the interaction zone. The dimensionality of spatial process information however can be used to determine different process conditions and quality faults. In this paper, a laser welding process is coaxially observed using a highspeed mid-infrared-camera in combination with near-infrared CMOS-camera. The signals are evaluated by extracting geometrical and statistical features. These features are subsequently used by machine learning techniques to predict quality -relevant process variables. The work identifies and compares the importance of the extracted features based on their prediction performance. This importance is used to reassess the sensors and underlying signal analyses in order to enhance the relevance of the acquired process information. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This results in inefficient production processes due to unforeseeable machine downtimes, fluctuating lead times and a high number of rush orders. An approach for the integration of anticipative maintenance strategies within a production planning and control model is developed in order to increase the flexibility and quality of production planning. Based on an anticipative maintenance strategy, the model derives measures for minimizing the overall production costs as well as maintenance related costs over a finite planning horizon.

This enables the detection and localization of the defects on the ball screw. The fault detection is realized using a self-implemented classification algorithm and other pattern recognition algorithms. The diagnosis is based on acceleration and AE measurement data performed on an axis test rig using various damaged ball screws at different operating parameters. Moreover, the structure of the pattern recognition process will be introduced, this includes the signal pre-processing, the selection of the most suitable features for this specific application using MATLAB. Finally, the evaluation of the developed solution will be showed. The actions allowing improving the accuracy of measurement data and the effectiveness of the processing algorithms, based on MATLAB applications, are described throughout the paper. Satisfactory classification results will be obtained and discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Due to the technological limits of their manufacturing processes, micro -gears show large shape deviations compared to their size, which significantly influence their lifetime. Thus, for micro-gears a model has been developed to enable a prognosis of their lifetime based on areal measurements of the gear geometry, finite elements simulations as well as lifetime experiments. To significantly reduce the amount of experiments, existing prior knowledge is additionally used as input to the lifetime model by means of Bayesian statistics. To enable a time-efficient application of the model for industrial series production, in this article the application of a machine learning approach based on artificial neural networks is investigated. The uncertainty of the model is evaluated according to the principles of the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM). (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

One aspect of data analytics is anomaly detection within data points received in some cases in real time that help to conduct predictive maintenance, weather monitoring or cyber security forensics for instance. Although there exists a number of web dashboards that allow IoT users to visualize data in time domain and perform statistical analysis, anomaly detection is often absent else if present not that straightforward, reliable and accurate. The development and implementation of Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE) poses a number of challenges that are in fact addressed in this paper. The research work exposes the multifaceted aspect of IoT networks and applications based on real life use cases and the difficulties engendered in mounting an ADE from both software system engineering and network convergence perspectives. Moreover a comparative description of diverse time series models adopted in anomaly detection is undertaken. It was noticed that there is neither one size fit all solution nor a plug n play alternative and that the unsupervised mode in machine learning as a model for time series analysis is the most versatile and efficient technique for IoT analytics developers.

The current knowledge of these problems is not sufficient and needs further research on data processing, analysis of efficiency of diagnostic and prognostic procedures, collection and selection of diagnostic parameters and development of automatic procedures for recognition and prognosis of a machine state. New solutions and different aspects of diagnostic prognosis based on the proposed partial procedures focus on factors determining automation of procedures for identification of technical systems states. New automated procedures for acquisition and processing of symptoms indicating the machine state provide better possibilities of control and supervision of technical systems operation and :maintenance through identification of their current states, and its good prognosis.

This paper proposes an approach of DGA based on Deep Belief Networks (DBN) which belongs to deep-learning theory. With composed of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), DBN can built the mapping relationship between the characteristic gas and the fault types automatically to achieve the accurate diagnosis, namely Pattern Recognition (PR). In this paper, DGA data is divided into three categories, called training data, fine-tuning data and test data. Training data is used for unsupervised-learning to initialize parameters of RBMs in DBN, and fine-tuning data is for supervised-learning with fault modes to optimize parameters. Finally, the test data is used to calculate the recognition rate of transformer fault diagnosis. It comes to conclusion that DBN model proposed shows a promising results of transformer fault diagnosis with high accuracy of 84.87% Compared with Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) method, DBN model not only achieves a high recognition rata of transformer fault, but also have strong generalization ability under big data, which could provide a powerful tool for the internal fault diagnosis of transformers.

The challenge for the industry is that product qualification testing is time-consuming and comes at a substantial cost. The work reported with this paper focus on the development and demonstration of a novel approach that can support "smart qualification testing" by using data analytics and data-driven prognostics modelling. Data analytics approach is developed and applied to historical qualification test datasets for an electronic module (Device under Test, DUT). The qualification spec involves a series of sequentially performed electrical and functional parameter tests on the DUTs. Data analytics is used to identify the tests that are sensitive to pending failure as well as to cross-evaluate the similarity in measurements between all tests, thus generating also knowledge on potentially redundant tests. The capability of data-driven prognostics modelling, using machine learning techniques and available historical qualification datasets, is also investigated. The results obtained from the study showed that predictive models developed from the identified so-called "sensitive to pending failure" tests feature superior performance compared with conventional, as measured, use of the test data. This work is both novel and original because at present, to the best knowledge of the authors, no similar predictive analytics methodology for qualification test time reduction (respectively cost reduction) is used in the electronics industry.

Ongoing efforts in the technological development of automobiles, especially in the field of driver assistance systems, yield more and more safety-critical systems, e.g., breaking control systems, and thus generate a high demand for reliable online diagnosis systems. In order to perform fault diagnosis on system level, the interrelations between all measurements must be determined, which is a challenging and often demanding task done by human system experts. In this paper we present a systematic approach based on machine learning to establish an online diagnosis system for a hybrid-electric vehicle model.

However, the performance of automatic fault diagnosis is limited by the ad-hoc nature of logs. The key problem is that existing developer-written logs are designed for humans rather than machines to automatically detect system anomalies. To improve the quality of logs for fault diagnosis, we propose a novel log enhancement approach which automatically identifies logging points that reflect anomalous behavior during system fault. We evaluate our approach on three popular software systems AcmeAir, HDFS and TensorFlow. Results show that it can significantly improve fault diagnosis accuracy by 50% on average compared to the developers' manually placed logging points.

In a number of techniques proposed earlier, sensors based measurement of voltage, current, temperature, and speed were achieved and transferred to computer for protection decision. But, those suggested techniques were engraved with the limitations that they were machine dependent and less efficient in case of multiplicity of faults apart from their high cost and requirement of expert knowledge. The cost effective logic mechanism developed in this work gives the flexibility to monitor multiple faults at incipient stage and take protection decisions. The programmability of the developed system with respect to threshold values of the parameters; makes it independent of machines and machines' ratings. The literature is void of such a system satiating the twin objectives of condition monitoring fault detection and protection, in the most simple and user friendly manner.

This paper presents a machine learning model for the fault detection and classification of induction motor faults by using three phase voltages and currents as inputs. The aim of this work is to protect vital electrical components and to prevent abnormal event progression through early detection and diagnosis. This work presents a fast forward artificial neural network model to detect some of the commonly occurring electrical faults like overvoltage, under voltage, single phasing, unbalanced voltage, overload, ground fault. A separate model free monitoring system wherein the motor itself acts like a sensor is presented and the only monitored signals are the input given to the motor. Limits for current and voltage values are set for the faulty and healthy conditions, which is done by a classifier. Real time data from a 0.33 HP induction motor is used to train and test the neural network. The model so developed analyses the voltage and current values given at a particular instant and classifies the data into no fault or the specific fault. The model is then interfaced with a real motor to accurately detect and classify the faults so that further necessary action can be taken.

Achieving this objective requires a substantial amount of working capital to acquire large quantities of new machinery, equipment to extract data from the machinery, and high-priced big data analysis software. However, most factories in the world are smallor medium-sized companies and have not enough capital to replace their machinery or purchase big data analysis software. It is therefore almost impossible for these factories to reach the goal of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, most of the conventional automated production scheduling methods only consider a single criterion in scheduling, which is not applicable for actual situations. This study therefore proposed a multitasking multi-machine scheduling system for multi-stage multi-criteria production to address various shortcomings in existing methods. To achieve this goal, we proposed a novel concept based on skyline queries to assist in the scheduling process. Also, a data structure of "heap" is applied in this work to accelerate the scheduling process. The experimental results demonstrated the validity of the proposed approach.

Breast cancer presents one of those threats, and bioinformatics field must work towards finding models to fight against it, with one of them being creation of classification model for that kind of illness. Using machine learning techniques in order to make these classifications is one of those ways. It is widely known that ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-uzzy Inherent System) can significantly upgrade any kind of classification process, and in that way, help in biomedicine and cancer treatment. Furthermore, more objective models for classification must be developed, regarding both time and resources, in order to get optimal results. In this paper, GA (Genetic Algorithm) algorithm that optimize ANN and ANFIS has been used to make classification of breast cancer diagnosis. It is shown that GA optimization of ANFIS and ANN parameters results in creating model with better accuracy comparing to basic classifiers.

This method utilized five exhaust gas parameter values of HC, CO, CO2, O-2,NOX and normalized them. Then it took these data as feature vector for test and train in Twin Support Vector Machine classifier, so as to achieve the purpose of identifying fault categories. The experimental results shows that twin support vector machine have better effect than Neural Network or Support Vector Machine, and the training speed is faster. In the case of small sample data, the accuracy rate of fault diagnose can reach 97.6%, which can effectively describe the complex relationship between the changes of vehicle exhaust components and engine default.

To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security1 and DYN2, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a permissioned Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of a set of pre-identified parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBotCatcher, then discussing its components.

A suitable approach may include collaborative edge computing using available, resource-constrained IoT edge analytic hardware. In this paper, collaborative computing method is used to construct a popular and very useful waveform for IoT analytics, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). GMM parameters are learned in the cloud, but the GMMs are constructed at the IIoT edge layer. GMMs are constructed using C28x, a ubiquitous, low-cost, embedded digital signal processor (DSP) that is widely available in many pre-existing IIoT infrastructures and in many edge analytic devices. Several GMMs including 2-GMM and 3-GMMs are constructed using the C28x DSP and Embedded C to show that GMM designs could be achieved in form of an osmotic microservice from the IIoT edge to the IIoT fog layer. Designed GMMs are evaluated using their differential and zero-crossings and are found to satisfy important waveform design criteria. At the fog layer, constructed GMMs are then applied for novelty detection, an IIoT cybersecurity and fault-monitoring application and are found to be able to detect anomalies in IIoT machine data using Hampel identifier, 3-Sigma rule, and the Boxplot rule. The osmotic collaborative computing method advocated in this paper will be crucial in ensuring the possibility of shifting many complex applications such as novelty detection and other machine learning based cybersecurity applications to edges of large scale IoT networks using low-cost widely available DSPs.

Unfortunately, current techniques for achieving high reliability and security incur high overheads. In particular, integrating countermeasures against security attacks is problematic as security threats are often not well defined, evolve continuously, and as a result, many CPSs often remain vulnerable. We propose to exploits the physical plant state information to enhance both reliability and security. Our approach, which monitors the controlled plant state trajectory, allows for tunable fault-tolerance as well as detection of malicious attacks, and it achieves these at a low overhead. The plant state space consists of safe and marginal state subspaces. In the safe subspace the CPS will continue its safe operation even if the worst case control signal is applied. In contrast, any erroneous control applied when the plant state is marginal, may lead to a catastrophic system failure. Such an erroneous control output may be due to either a benign fault or a malicious security attack. As most of the time the plant will be deep within its safe subspace, we can avoid using expensive redundancy techniques and thus, reduce the computational load while still guaranteeing safe operation. When a marginal state of the plant is detected, it will signal the potential presence of a "natural" fault or malicious attack. Our scheme will counter this by switching to a critical mode involving higher levels of redundancy to combat natural failures as well as alternative mechanisms to defeat malicious attacks. A major challenge in our approach is to determine, in real-time, whether the current state of the physical plant is deep within its safe sub-space or is marginal. We have used various machine learning techniques for classifying the state and our results indicate that with a reasonable number of entries in a lookup table and with a short execution time, the required classification can be performed efficiently.

Functional and structural complexity, consideration of the tolerances on the components parameters, the infinity of the set of parametric faults, etc., leads to the accumulation of large amounts of data describing the behavior of the fault-free and faulty states of the circuit. Machine learning methods are actively used to construct neuromorphic fault dictionaries (NFD), which provide fault diagnostics of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Many problems of training a neural network with a large amount of data can be solved by reducing the size of training sets and using only significant characteristics in them. The paper proposes a method based on calculating entropy to select the essential characteristics for a training set. An algorithm for reducing the dimension of a training set using entropy is presented. The results of experimental studies for the Sallen-Key analog filter are demonstrated. The received results show high efficiency of the proposed method: at insignificant time spent on data preprocessing, the training time of the neural network is reduced by a factor of 192, and the resulting NFD provides diagnosis up to 95.0 % catastrophic and up to 84.81% parametric faults.

Faults arise from panel short-circuit, soiling, shading, ground leakage and other sources. Machine learning algorithms have enabled data-based classification of faults. In this paper, we present an Internet-based PV array fault monitoring simulation using the Java-DSP (J-DSP) simulation environment. We first develop a solar array simulation in J-DSP and then form appropriate graphics to examine V-I curves, maximum power point tracking, and faults. We then introduce a multi-layer perceptron model for PV fault detection. We deploy and assess the simulation by disseminating to a group of users that provide feedback.

Unbalanced Fault Diagnosis in Transmission Networks Using Multiple Model Filters	2018 ANNUAL AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference	JUN 27-29, 2018	Milwaukee, WI				POWER-SYSTEMS	This paper provides a scalable solution to the diagnosis of unbalanced transmission faults. The solution hinges on our previous work on diagnosis of balanced transmission faults using multiple model filters (MMF). The purpose of diagnosis is to support a secondary protection that capitalizes on new sensing technologies to cost-effectively mitigate cascading failures caused by protection misoperations. The essence of the MMF-based diagnosis approach is to probabilistically determine which assumed transmission circuit model is most likely to have generated the observed data among the multiple models of circuit topologies of anticipated contingencies. The key to the ready applicability for the diagnosis of unbalanced faults lies with the ability of the MMF to directly process high rate sampled waveforms in time domain without any reliance on the decomposed symmetric components of unbalanced phasors. To explain the diagnosis process, the problem formulation and the solution to diagnosis of unbalanced faults are detailed for a small 3-machine 9-bus test system. It is shown that diagnosis delays for unbalanced faults remain under 50 milliseconds at a probabilistic decision threshold of above 95%. The paper applies the concept of the sensor-defined partition of a transmission network model to reduce computation and communication complexity while maintaining the performance for the diagnosis of both balanced and unbalanced faults.

This paper proposes a general data -based fault identification method using deep learning(DL). Because of the great success of deep learning in a variety of practical applications, it has recently become the most popular approach in machine learning. Deep learning employs a hierarchical structure to learn the inherent features in systems layer by layer. The proposed DL -based fault identification method can be structured into three stages: first, transforming the fault identification problem into classification problem, defining the normal and fault state, and preprocessing the original data; second, developing the DL model for fault identification using the preprocessed data and the predefined state; third, validating the DL model with testing dataset. The proposed method is applied to two different size and multiple fault types datasets generated by the SOFC system. And the testing results show that the proposed method can accurately predict the fault type outperforming the other two classification methods. In addition, since the proposed method requires only data, it is easy to migrate to other types of FC-based systems.

We achieve this by casting the time-series prediction problem as a classification problem, wherein we craft a set of features that capture key time-series characteristics specific to defrost and operating regimes. Our feature extraction employs seasonality-trend decomposition and pattern learning using dynamic time warping and clustering. The extracted features are used to learn a random forest-based binary classifier that can indicate the presence or absence of an issue in any given refrigeration case at any given time. We validate our approach on real data from 2265 refrigeration cases from several large supermarkets. The approach achieves a precision of 89%, lead time of approximately seven days, and a recall of 46% when evaluated on unseen cases.

Monitoring vibration signal is an effective method for diagnosing faulty bearings and preventing thus catastrophic failures. However, existing algorithms neither offer satisfactory accuracy nor are efficient for real-time implementation due to complexity in feature extraction part. In this paper, we propose an accurate method for bearing diagnosis customized for real-time implementation. The proposed system estimates power spectral density of vibration signal using an autoregressive model for feature extraction. This is a novel use of autoregressive model for fault diagnosis which reduces the dimensionality of vibration signal and captures its frequency contents simultaneously. The proposed system can diagnose different bearing faults under variable load conditions with above 99% accuracy.

Currently, the remaining lifetime estimates to support mission extension decisions are largely based on consumables (e.g. remaining propellant). However, more accurate quantitative reliability-based lifetime assessments are needed to demonstrate compliance to the probability of successful disposal requirements imposed by Space Debris Mitigation (SDM) standards and regulations [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] which are in place to limit the growth of hazardous human-made objects in protected orbital regions. Remaining lifetime predictions should take into account wear out mechanisms impacted by environmental stresses (e.g. radiation) or use conditions (thermal and power cycles), limited resources (e.g. propellant, power degradation over time), and the minimum configuration needed for disposal. Although wear-out mechanisms or spacecraft limitations are covered for the most part by design margins these generally only apply to the nominal mission lifetime. In order to address this challenge and in line with the European Space Agency's (ESA) system safety and dependability roadmap [9], a generic reliability model is proposed combining systems engineering and reliability aspects by integrating units degradation, diagnostic, and prognostic information. The approach is proposed to be validated at unit, subsystem, and satellite level using in-orbit field data.

The most sensible features within vibration signals are selected by the sensitivity analysis and correlation analysis under healthy condition as well as some typical fault situations. The health condition matrix is established base on dynamic update Self-Organized Map (DSOM). The Confident Value (CV) of each vibration signal acquired by DSOM is integrated using the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) to form an Integrated Confident Value (ICV). Finally, the Comprehensive Health Index (CHI) can be defined by quantitative value created by rotation error which is an indirect form of machining precision and health condition. Experiments of condition monitoring for motorized spindle is conducted on the platform where a large amount of health data under normal working conditions are trained. Rotation error is chosen as the standard value of health status, based on which parameters of health status are tested under the condition of rotor imbalance fault. The proposed method based on lifetime data can not only apply to motorized spindle of NC machine tools, but also share inspiration for the maintenance and management of health status of other equipment.

Focusing on the relationship from processing machine performance to the process quality and the produced product reliability, the connotation of manufacturing system health risk is defined and modeled based on potential impacts of the possible machine degradation on the whole manufacturing process. Then, the concept of big operational data is proposed to provide a data foundation for the comprehensive performance evaluation and prediction of manufacturing systems, where all the original data that correspond to the same output product are organized as a set. Further, the comprehensive risk index consisting of three sub-indexes, which are called machine degradation risk, process variation risk and quality accident risk respectively, is presented to model the health risk of manufacturing systems. With the aid of collected big operational data and the proposed rolling grey model with mixed reconstruction strategy (MRS-RGM), the value of manufacturing system health risk for a future period can be forecasted. Then, based on the prediction result, the change trend of manufacturing system health state can be accurately analyzed to obtain the better predictive maintenance policy. At the end of this paper, a cylinder head manufacturing system in a Chinese vehicle engine manufacturer is anaylzed as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advancement of the presented approach. The result shows that lower economic losses, better manufacturing quality and higher product reliability can be achieved by the proposed health risk model, which utilizes the big operational data and considers the whole manufacturing process compared with traditional reliability-based methods.

In this paper, we proposed a penalized (log)-location-scale regression model that can utilize high dimensional tensors to predict the residual useful lifetime of systems. Our method first reduces the dimensionality of tensor covariates by projecting them onto a low tensor space. Next, the coefficient tensor is decomposed by utilizing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition. The decomposition facilitates further dimension reduction of coefficient tensors. By doing so, the number of parameters to be estimated is dramatically reduced. Furthermore, a numerical algorithm with global convergence property was developed for the model estimation. We evaluated the performance of our proposed methodology through simulations and a case study on degradation modeling of bearings in a rotating machinery. The results indicated that our methodology outperformed the benchmark in terms of both prediction accuracy and precision at all life percentiles.

Maintaining the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) of these lithium ion batteries is therefore very important for risk free and efficient industrial operations. This research is aimed at using multilevel nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NLMEM) to study the charge capacity decay of lithium ion batteries and predict the End of Life (EOL) cycles. NLMEM is very vital for this study because inherent uncertainties associated with manufacturing, measurement, modeling and the operating environment are bound to have a cumulative effect on the charge capacity decay over time. The decay process of the lithium ion battery charge capacity is assumed to follow an exponential model with model parameters related to the baseline information about battery impedance, charging and discharge rates. Maximum likelihood estimation was used for estimating the parametric values of the decay model based on stochastic approximation, expectation and maximization algorithm (SAEM). Data set from NASA (R) Ames Laboratory for three batteries - B#5, B#6 and B#7 were used to test the nonlinear mixed effect model and we obtained good accuracy in the predictions as indicated by the low root mean square error (RMSE) values. The End of Life (EOL) cycles for the batteries were also predicted (considering 80% threshold failure criteria) with low errors rates of approximately 3-6% from our NLMEM model, when compared to experimental data.

Despite the proliferation of lithium ion batteries, research is still needed to assess and quantify the effects of model parameters on the charge capacity decay and the techniques for estimating the state of health of the batteries. This study uses a stochastic modeling technique that is based on the multiphase decay rate sigmoidal model, to study the battery charge capacity decay over time and determine the effects of the charge decay model parameters on the decay pattern of the batteries. The variabilities of the state of charge (SoC) of the batteries over the lifecycle phases were also studied using the Weibull distribution function and the reliability was estimated for 70% and 60% end-of-life (EOL) failure thresholds. Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was used to replicate lithium ion battery experimental results obtained from the NASA (R) Ames laboratory and the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) was utilized for studying the sensitivity of the model parameters to the lithium ion battery charge capacity decay. We further used the Weibull function to determine the battery charge cycles at different lifecycle phases, which were classified with the Retained Life (RL) of the battery as - {phase I: RL >= 90%; phase II:70% <= RL <= 90%, phase III: 50% <= RL <= 70 %, phase IV: 30% <= RL <= 50%, phase V: 1% <= RL <= 30%}. Our analysis reveals that the LHS experiment based estimation of the battery capacity had a mean variation of 0.04% to 0.44% from the original experimental data and the model parameters did not have any distinctive pattern affecting the battery charge capacity decay. This suggests that the decay of the charge capacity may have been driven by other internal factors that may include electrochemical influence of charging current, current fluctuations and distortion of the surfaces of the electrodes. Similarly, the effect of aging on the availability of charge via reduced diffusion may also be a possible cause for the imbalance in the battery system, impacting the charge decay and EOL of the battery. Characterization of the battery efficiency at the different lifecycle phases will be vital for decision-making on optimal utilization of these batteries for powering devices needed for critical operations.

DIAGNOSIS	In this paper, we present a new approach for predictive analytics using time-series condition-monitoring data. A double hybrid state-space model was proposed, with a continuous latent state vector serving as a unit-less health indicator regarding the health status of a system and a discrete latent state vector denoting the operating condition of the system through time. We also considered two observation levels. The first level consisted of continuous noisy sensor observations. The survivability of the system was considered as a second level of observations. Instead of an explicit formula, a non-parametric method relating the continuous latent state to the sensor observations using a single-layer feed-forward neural network, called the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), was considered and a new Bayesian iterative procedure using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for ELM training and joint state-parameter estimation was presented. Finally, our method was tested on a number of simulated degradation data sets.

Extracting submerged periodic impact signal is one of important approach to fault diagnosis. Bearing failure is one of the most common reasons of machine breakdowns and accidents. Based on Matching Pursuit in dual fractional Fourier-wavelet domain, a novel method is proposed to extract the fault characteristic frequency for the incipient fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings in this paper. It is carried out in two steps. First, the fractional Fourier Transform and dual tree complex wavelet transform are implemented according to the criteria of the periodicity of its autocorrelation function to achieve maximum. Secondly, matching pursuit method in dual fractional Fourier wavelet domain is applied to extracting submerged periodic signal. Taking orthogonal wavelet bases that mutually form Hilbert transform pairs as choice object, the method can match feature more effectively by a set of elementary functions of these dual orthogonal wavelets. From the theoretical analysis and the experimental studies, it is shown that the proposed method is effective especially to extract impulsive feature of the defects impacts on high intensity noise for a roller bearing system, while other matching pursuit method based on DWT and other wavelet de-noising methods based on threshold cannot do it completely. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by both simulation and experimental data.

Monitoring of the rotor temperature is very important for both control and protection of induction machines. Temperature sensors are usually avoided due to additional wiring. In this paper, a novel temperature identification method based on rotor slot harmonics is proposed. The mathematical model of submersible motor under high temperature and high pressure is established by analyzing the laws between the motor parameters and load, voltage and current. And the parameters and temperature identification of submersible motor can be carried out according to calculating the proposed model with the sampling voltage and current, so as to realize accurate system monitoring and reliable fault diagnosis. Opposed to temperature sensors and previous solutions where temperature is calculated based on the real part of the impedance, the presented method is calculated from the change of the rotor resistance.

In order to further improve the accuracy of power transformer fault diagnosis, this paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of various classification and optimization algorithms, and finally presents a transformer fault diagnosis method based on cloud model and Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) optimization Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine(KELM). The method applies the kernel function to the Extreme Learning Machine, and maps the low-dimensional nonlinear relation to the high-dimensional linear space, which avoids the dimension disaster and reduces the calculation cost. It has further improved the fault diagnosis ability, For the simultaneous parameter problem, the cloud model is used to optimize the shrinkage-expansion factor of the quantum particle swarm. The parameters of the kernel limit learning machine are optimized by the combination of the cloud model and the quantum particle group. And then the method has the advantages of strong global search ability, high searching precision and fast convergence speed Finally, the validity of the proposed method is proved by comparing with other fault diagnosis methods.

One of the key assumptions of state machine replication is that replicas must execute operations deterministically. Deterministic execution often translates into sequential execution of requests at replicas. With the increasing demand for dependable services and widespread use of multi-core servers, several proposals for enabling concurrent execution in state machine replication have appeared in the literature. Invariably, these techniques exploit the fact that independent operations, those that do not share any common state or do not update shared state, can execute concurrently. Existing protocols differ in several important ways. In this paper, we survey this field of research and discuss the main aspects of the different protocols. Central aspects include conflict detection, representation and enforcing; tradeoffs involving existing architectures and level of allowed parallelism; workload-driven adaptation schemes; and implications of parallel state machine replication to recovery.

On-Chip Lifetime Prediction for Dependable Many-Processor SoCs Based on Data Fusion	2018 IEEE 12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EMBEDDED MULTICORE/MANY-CORE SYSTEMS-ON-CHIP (MCSOC 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 12th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore/Many-core Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC)	SEP 12-14, 2018	SISLAB, Hanoi, VIETNAM	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Vietnam Natl Univ, IEEE, Vietnam Sect, IEEE SSCS Vietnam Chapter, REV, Dai Hoc Conghe, ASL	SISLAB	MPSoC; Prognostics; System awareness; fusion; IJTAG embedded instruments; IDDX and slack-delay monitors; test	TEMPERATURE	The developments in technology and complexity of many-processor Systems-on-Chips emerge at a very rapid pace as is their introduction in safety-critical applications, for instance the transport sector. The inherent decrease in dependability of these complex nanosystems must be compensated by counter measures. One promising approach is the usage of IJTAG-compatible embedded instruments in and around cores, monitoring the "health" of target processors. It has been anticipated that these instruments will be (primarily) used for reducing the cost of final testing. In case of degradation during life time, however, they can be reused and counteractions like run-time remapping can be carried out. In this paper, the on-line data of two types of embedded instruments will be used for the prognostics, a slack-delay monitor and an IDDX monitor. Their (correlated) data is being fused which enables a more accurate life-time prediction as compared to a single monitor approach. However, the computational requirements for the embedded dependability manager will increase to enable handling embedded instrument data fusion and/or multi-parameter life-time prediction.

The ever expanding network of smart meters allows for a more accurate estimation of the state of the water distribution systems, at the same time requiring modern data processing solutions. By fusion with the more traditional approach in this field of research it is possible to enhance the existing capabilities for network analysis and to extend the algorithms to the level of cognitive abilities that form a basis for more efficient decision support system. In this paper we extend the fault sensitivity analysis for water distribution systems with the insights provided by state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for data clustering and anomaly detection.

This paper proposes a pluggable framework based on a microservices architecture that implements FT support as two complementary microservices: one that uses complex event processing for real-time FT detection, and another that uses online machine learning to detect fault patterns and pre-emptively mitigate faults before they are activated. We provide an early evaluation of how our framework can handle a real-world scenario.

The article aims to propose a reference architecture which will improve the way maintenance is considered in the current manufacturing world, by enabling an overall increase of production rates, while increasing the operational equipment effectiveness and decreasing the impact of maintenance needs. This objective would be accomplished by establishing an IoT infrastructure for the collection of the huge amount of available shop floor data, which can be analyzed, considering data analytics algorithms, predictive maintenance models and forecasting techniques, to perform the machine/system health assessment and prediction of maintenance needs, e.g. by detecting earlier the occurrence of possible failures and consequently the need to implement maintenance interventions. The scheduling of predictive maintenance needs will be integrated with the existing maintenance planning tools, and especially synchronized with the production planning tools to achieve a non-disruptive maintenance impact in the production system. A cloud-based collaborative maintenance services platform allows the secure collection, aggregation and analysis of a large amount of shared data from numerous manufacturers that use the same or similar machinery, and acts as an open market where companies can contract specialized maintenance services. This reference architecture aims to provide replicable architecture to be broadly applicable in a variety of industries, capable to improve the production efficiency through a real-time health monitoring and early detection of failures and outages, to speed up the maintenance delivery, and consequently mitigate their impact.

In industrial manufacturing systems, bearing fault diagnosis is a critical task which helps to reduce the cost for maintaining. This paper proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis algorithm for rotary machine in which multiple sensors are installed using Deep Belief Network and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. First, for signals from each sensor, a Deep Belief Network is used to extracted features. Each feature set generated by the corresponding Deep Belief Network is classifier by one softmax classifier. Finally, prediction results of all softmax classifiers are fused by DS evidence theory to generate the final prediction of bearing fault. Experiments are carried out with bearing data from Case Western Reserve University Data Central.

Prognostic protection in time can reduce morbidity and mortality. In this paper, we first identify the risk factors and repertoire of hepatitis B virus reactivation through a new feature selection method based on neighborhood component analysis (NCA). Then we use SVM classifier to classify and predict all the feature subsets. Based on this, Bayes and Grid optimization are respectively used to optimize the previous SVM model. The key feature subset is classified and predicted. The experimental results show that HBV DNA level, KPS score, segmentation method, extrinsic boundary, V25, TNM stage and Child-Pugh stage are the risk factors of HBV reactivation. Among them, V25 found after NCA feature selection is the first risk factor in the study of hepatitis B virus reactivation. Among them, under 10- fold cross validation the prediction accuracy of the two eigenvector combinations of HBV DNA level and extrinsic boundary is 85.56% Bayesian and grid-optimized SVM classifier can be applied to the study of hepatitis B virus reactivation.

Most methods of fault detection and location rely on measurements of electrical quantities provided by current and voltage transformers. In this paper, a prototype data collecting device was built for collecting data during different faulted conditions in a single-phase distribution network. Machine learning algorithms were developed for fault detection, location and classification on single-phase distribution lines. The transmission line was modelled using resistor network in the device; the current and voltage sensors were used in the prototype model with the data collection device for current and voltage readings under open-circuit and short-circuit faulted conditions. Training data was collected by varying the load on the line during the simulation of the fault type, sensor location on the node and analyzed. The test data was assessed using three (3) machine learning algorithms namely: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for prediction of fault, location and classification within the single-phase distribution network. Test results showed that a higher accuracy rate of 99.42 % was obtained by using the Decision Trees algorithm compared to the others investigated.

Cars acting as mobile sensors will become important data sources for cloud-based applications like predictive maintenance and dynamic traffic forecast. Due to the limitation of available communication resources, it is expected that the grows in Machine-Type Communication (MTC) will cause severe interference with Human-to-human (H2H) communication. Consequently, more efficient transmission methods are highly required. In this paper, we present a probabilistic scheme for efficient transmission of vehicular sensor data which leverages favorable channel conditions and avoids transmissions when they are expected to be highly resource-consuming. Multiple variants of the proposed scheme are evaluated in comprehensive real-world experiments. Through machine learning based combination of multiple context metrics, the proposed scheme is able to achieve up to 164% higher average data rate values for sensor applications with soft deadline requirements compared to regular periodic transmission.

Traditional fault diagnosis methods require manual feature extraction or selection which brings great limitations to the practical application. In our paper, a real-time intelligent fault diagnosis method is proposed based on wavelet transform algorithm and deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model. Firstly, original vibration signals of different kinds of fault is collected. Then, original signals are converted into time frequency image using wavelet transform method. Finally, these time frequency images are fed into the DCNN to train the constructed model, and real-time signals are input into the trained model to achieve classification of the running state of the bearing. A real experiment is provided to estimate the effectiveness of the approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has high diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Undeniably, the traditional intelligent fault diagnosis methods such as back propagation (BP) neural network, recurrent neural network (RNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) might have a satisfactory performance in accuracy. However, the premise of this high accuracy is to add labels to all samples manually, which will undoubtedly increase the cost of failure detection. In this article, a semi-supervised fault diagnosis framework for a gearbox is proposed by utilizing GAN. First of all, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is adopted transform 1-D vibration signals into 2-D frequency spectrograms to fit the input format of GAN. Then, the frequency spectrograms are input into the GAN model to achieve fault diagnosis with few marked samples. Finally, an experiment study is carried out to confirm the excellent result of our approach in accuracy and stability. The results indicate that its performance in stability and accuracy is quite excellent.

Due to the complexity and nonlinearity of aircraft engine model and the development of data mining, data-driven approaches have been developed and applied in RUL estimation. However, traditional data-driven approaches such as regression methods and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) can't make use of sequential information. Sequence models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have flaws when dealing with long-term dependencies. In this paper we propose a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for RUL estimation. Besides, we proposed a Euclidean distance-based method to identify the initial useful life to make the estimation more accurate.

For a complex flight control system, it is difficult to build an accurate physical model, so data-driven method has emerged. In this paper, an extreme learning machine (ELM) method optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Compared with traditional feed -forward neural network, ELM has great generalization performance at a high learning speed. Furthermore, GA is used in this method to adjust hidden nodes parameters to find the most suitable parameters that minimizes the ELM model error. What is more, different fault models are built respectively, so as to achieve the purpose of fault isolation.

Normally PHM requires abundant prior information or statistic features to predict future system states, however an expert or accurate physical model is usually unavailable in practice. As an important trend of deep neural network algorithms, long short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) has been proven significantly practical and accurate in machine learning problems such as natural language processing (NLP) and time serial prediction. In this paper a novel fault prognosis approach using LSTM based on vibration signal of rotating machinery is presented. It is proven that the capacity of machinery performance prediction with LSTM algorithm is improved with limited data available in a relatively short time period. The proposed LSTM approach, compared with other prognosis methods, gives a successful outcomes that may enhance the ability of health management and machine condition monitoring. It is proven that the proposed approach is superior and more practical for machine prognosis in complex bearing systems.

In particular, we predict the daily electrical power curve of a photovoltaic panel based on the power curves of neighboring panels. An exceptionally large deviation between predicted and actual (observed) power curve can be used to indicate a malfunctioning panel. The problem is quite challenging because the power curve depends on many factors such as weather conditions and the surrounding objects (causing shadows with a regular time pattern). We demonstrate, by means of numerical experiments, that the proposed method is able to predict accurately the power curve of a functioning panel. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches that are based on simple interpolation filters.

A SMART CONDITION MONITORING SYSTEM FOR HV NETWORKS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AUGMENTED REALITY AND VIRTUAL REALITY	2018 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY 65TH ANNUAL PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TECHNICAL CONFERENCE (PCIC)	Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE-IAS-Petroleum-and-Chemical-Industry-Committee Petroleum and Chemical Industry Technical Conference (PCIC)	SEP 24-27, 2018	Cincinnati, OH	IEEE IAS Petr & Chem Ind Comm, IEEE, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		Artificial Intelligence; Al; Augmented Reality; AR; High Voltage Motors; HV Network Condition Monitoring; Industrial Internet of Things; IIoT; Machine Learning; On-Line Partial Discharge; Virtual Reality; VR		The authors present a conceptual design for a SMART asset monitoring solution for high voltage (HV) networks in the petrochemical industry. The paper discusses the potential for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) into an application of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for condition monitoring. The paper is a continuation of the work presented by the authors at the IEEE-PCIC 2017 conference in Calgary. The proposed asset management system analyses condition monitoring (CM) data and assesses the risk of failure data across complete HV networks. Knowledge of deteriorating asset condition provides the operator with an advanced, early warning of incipient mechanical and electrical faults. With knowledge of the severity and source of such faults, pinpointed preventative maintenance interventions can then made during planned maintenance outages. The complete HV network asset monitoring solution described includes permanent sensors and monitoring nodes deployed at strategic locations across the network. Processed data is passed via a local area network to local servers and then via secure data cloud transmission to a centralized monitoring server located at the CM headquarters. This central server operates a CM database that logs, displays, benchmarks and trends the condition data with comparison to a statistically-significant database of measurements. It is proposed in the IIoT solution proposed that this database will be downloadable to a smartphone/tablet for use by the field engineer. The monitoring technology will likely also incorporate a number of AI machine learning software modules for the de-noising of raw signals and the diagnosis of different types of defects within different types of HV plant items. The proposed SMART CM system includes an advanced graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing HV asset CM data along with operational and maintenance (O&M) data. The GUI will also be able to display both condition criticality and operational criticality (on a color-coded range of 0-100%) for individual HV plant items on a digitized mimic of the HV network's single-line diagram (SLD). This could also be combined with geometric positioning data of assets across the facility (including HV cable routes and lengths) to provide a fully digitized SMART network diagram for use in the IIoT asset management solution. Asset management data, combined with the application of the developing techniques of AI, AR and VR, will greatly help the user to visualize the plant items in 3-D, their position within the network, their condition and operational criticality along with all related asset management information together on one dashboard screen, downloaded onto smartphone/tablet. The paper concludes with a case study showing the development of a specification for a SMART IIoT asset condition monitoring solution suitable for a large petrochemical refining facility.

Inadvertent failure of rotating machines causes high repair expenses and loss of revenue. Existing Monitoring and Diagnosis (M&D) techniques require either additional device(s) to be installed or scheduled shutdowns for testing. This paper proposes continuous M&D of the rotating machines as a part of Machine Protection Relay (MPR), which is already installed in most critical machines. Proposed applications as a part of an already installed MPR can proactively monitor Thermal, Electrical, and Mechanical failure modes; and take control actions. This paper further performs extensive testing of Stator M&D by monitoring the evolution of a stator inter-turn fault, and also lessons learnt from the site installation of an advanced MPR. Test results are presented from actual field data of a damaged rotating machine as well as a simulated stator-turn fault in a real time environment.

Based on the concept of magnetic field pendulous oscillation (MFPO) phenomenon, typical operating characteristics under various faulty conditions are investigated for the PMSM drive system, including single-phase open fault, two-adjacent phase open fault, and two-nonadjacent phase open fault, respectively. Moreover, to reduce the implementation cost of the developed diagnostic method, a phase-locked loop (PLL) technique is adopted to overcome the fault masking difficulties associated with the compensation action of the closed-loop drives. In addition, original theoretical derivation of the proposed fault diagnostic technique is presented. This approach can effectively detect and identify various types of open-phase faults, as well as help localize the faulty phase.	[Chen, Hao; Demerdash, Nabeel A.

Bearing failure can cause damages of other components and lead to a lengthy downtime of the machine and costly maintenance. To reduce the cost and downtime for maintenance of the machines, it is desirable to perform fault prognostics to enable predictive health management for bearings. This paper proposes a new data-driven approach for bearing fault prognostics, which is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, self-organizing map, and unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The proposed approach has two steps. The first step is to detect bearing's degradation process by learning the historical data and the second step is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) with the aid of a degradation model and the UKF. The proposed approach is validated by bearing's life data obtained from a run-to-failure experiment. Results show that the proposed approach can detect the bearing degradation process successfully and predict the RUL effectively.

Incipient fault diagnosis is an important topic which aims at detecting the fault at an early stage and isolating them from other ambiguous conditions.In this work, an analytical model for inter-turn fault diagnosis in induction machines has been developed. A methodology for early diagnosis of fault has been envisaged, in presence of ambiguous conditions such as voltage imbalances and load variations. The novel method is based on motor current signature analysis (MCSA), using deep learning based one dimensional convolutional neural network(1D-CNN) model and long short term model(LSTM). The results using these two methods have been compared, and this initial investigation shows that CNN is found to be more suitable than LSTM, for incipient fault diagnosis.

This paradigm-shift benefits from new algorithms that can be implemented at the grid edge (as opposed to the transmission grid) to detect anomalies faster, more efficiently, and in real-time. Micro-PMUs (mu-PMUs) are phasor measurement units that can be placed on the distribution lines to provide real-time data about the state of the grid and can detect fast transients. In this paper, we use data from mu-PMUs to engineer physics-based features for a novel anomaly detection algorithm that detects anomalies based on the transient properties of the power grid. This allows for a more capable, agile, and reliable anomaly scoring system that can learn normal behavior patterns and detect anomalous behavior efficiently. We show that by combining the classical data-based approaches with physics-based features in the anomaly detection algorithm, the machine learning algorithm proposed is capable of detecting different classes of anomalies (such as edge devices on-off attacks, single line-to-ground (SLG) faults, etc.). Simulation results on IEEE 34-node test feeder show that we can achieve better detection performance than traditional techniques for a broader class of anomalies.

The Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) is considered as the main organ of a railway network. CBTC controls movements of trains and manages messages exchanged between the different systems of railways. In this paper, we propose a cooperative detection framework to secure the CBTC against attackers that execute locally a malicious software (i.e., internal threats) and/or spread and deliver an attack from an external network (i.e., external threats). The present detection framework has two main security systems: host and network detection system, and human-machine interaction system. When these security systems run in a cooperative way, the attack detection and false alarm rates are improved, while the expected attack damage rate is reduced. The framework is integrated in a real sub-systems of railway network and according to experiments results, we show that it is capable to detect accurately sophisticated cyber-attacks, such as fault data injection and flooding attacks.

Adaptive Remaining Useful Life Prediction Algorithm for Bearings	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 11-13, 2018	Seattle, WA	IEEE		prognostic system; bearing; remaining life prediction	FAULT DIAGNOSTICS; PROGNOSTICS; FILTER	It is well known that the lifetime of bearings varies a lot even if the bearings are manufactured in the same assembly line. This is because the exposed operating conditions may be very different for each bearing. As a result, an adaptive remaining lifetime prediction algorithm is a more natural choice and is expected to be more accurate than the non-adaptive counterparts. This paper presents a new adaptive approach to predicting remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings. This approach improves an earlier method developed by us. In our earlier approach, it was observed that the prediction estimates depend on the initial conditions of the adaptive estimator. In the new approach, a bank of predictors is run in parallel and their predictions are constantly evaluated. Only the good estimators that meet the criterions are used for RUL output. Evaluations using actual bearing data demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Feature extraction methods based on time and frequency domain are applied to define the features of one-phase current signal. In order to dynamically estimate the stability and discover the potential hazards within three-phase current signals, Amplitude Variation Rate (AVR), Phase Fluctuation Rate (PFR) and Shape Inconsistent Rate (SIR) are proposed in this paper as conjoint phase features. A well-organized and strongly related visualization way to indicate the status and deviation degree of rotating machinery called Dynamic Current Features Map (DCFM) is established, where an unsupervised machine learning method is adopted to describe the healthy area. The new map expresses character including rotating speed, time track and the deviation degree from normal condition simultaneously, which can be an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Historical data of current signals from healthy motorized spindle, current signals from aged sample and fault signals of motorized spindle are collected to test the availability and efficiency of DCFM and the result proves the map's potential to fulfill the condition monitoring task.

In traditional health stage division, multiple health indicators (HIs) are extracted from original data, and then one suitable HI is constructed. According to the trend of the one HI, the whole degradation process is divided into different health stages based on the change points. The change points are the transition points between different health stages. But the one HI is difficult to construct and just suitable for special applications. Therefore how to consider multiple HIs simultaneously for health stage division is a big problem. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based method by using change points (RLCP) is proposed to divide health state. The health stage division problem based on change points is modelled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then reinforcement learning is introduced to solve the MDP effectively. The performance of the proposed RLCP is evaluated with the PRONOSTIA dataset. Experiment results show that the result of health stage division is optimal when compared with existing methods.

In this paper, we built a novel vector representation model for avionics system for two types of fault messages called MERIT. This new model aims to identify the relationship between the flight deck effects (FDEs) and the maintenance messages (MMSGs) through calculating the embedding co-occurrence matrix between them within a predefined flight leg window. The a vector space embeddings representation of MERIT is able to differentiate between the strong and weak relationship between messages. Moreover, we benefit from the negative sampling method to incorporate the weak relationship between the FDEs and MMSGs from different subsystems (chapters) in assessing this relationship precisely. We called the developed MERIT with specialized negative sampling approach subsystem-wise MERIT. Both developed models can be used as descriptive and predictive tasks based on the flight leg window used (one and three, respectively). The main advantage of the proposed latent aircraft system model (MERIT) is that it needs to be trained only once and can be easily queried using any similarity measurements between the embedding vectors, which means it is more feasible and computationally efficient than traditional machine learning algorithm, where it necessitates building a different model each time for every target FDE. We tested both models on a real Boeing dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in exhibiting the embedded relationships between fault messages and extracting the most relevant predictors.

In actual working condition, it is difficult to detect signal transients caused by early damage, for example, a slightly worn gear. To address this issue, a hybrid signal processing method is proposed to adaptively detect the signal transients generated by the worn gear in the gearbox. In this method, the improved local mean decomposition is firstly used to decompose the collected signal into some simpler signals, and only part of them is useful for fault diagnosis. Second, the critical signals are selected based on statistical indices and ensemble learning. Finally, the signal transients are detected by the adaptive band-pass filter based on energy window merging, so that appropriate parameters of the filter can be determined for successfully extracting transients. The experimental vibration signal collected from the gearbox is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Although using faulty data in the training process generally can improve the performance of anomaly detection system, it is rare to obtain enough samples to train failures or defects on a target machine. We therefore utilize the existing data from non-target (different-type) machines for feature representation learning to improve anomaly detection for the target machine. Specifically, deep neural networks (DNNs) that are trained to discriminate the normal and faulty states of the non-target machines are used to extract features. The extracted features are then taken as inputs to an anomaly detector based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). This architecture is called DNN/GMM tandem connectionist anomaly detection. Experimental comparisons using vibration signals from actual wind turbine components demonstrated that the developed tandem connectionist system yielded significant improvements over existing systems, and that the representation learning performed robustly with respect to differences in machine types.

Part identifiers are often expressed as nomenclature and buried in noisy free text data found in maintenance reports, supply chain management records, service and support communication logs, and manufacturing quality data. There is little consistency in how part names are actually described in noisy free text, with variations spawned by typos, ad hoc abbreviations, acronyms, and incomplete names. This makes search and analysis of parts involved in this data extremely challenging. In this paper, we will discuss our method and tool PANDA (PArt Name Discovery Analytics), based on a unique method that exploits statistical, linguistic and machine learning techniques in a unique way to discover part names in noisy free text. The algorithm is very scalable and efficient, and provides actionable results for analysis of vehicle health management.

First, the main two failure modes of a rocket ejection seat, including the stochastic fault mode and wear fault mode, are analyzed, then the prediction method for the stochastic fault mode based on the life distribution of the fault mode is established, then the prediction method for the wear fault mode is established by determining the fault sensitive parameters which reflect the performance degradation law of the rocket ejection seat and calculating the occurrence time of the fault according to the given specified value. The methods are applied in the fault prediction for a rocket ejection seat, and the result shows the predictive results are consistent with the engineering practice. The effectiveness and feasibility of the method is validated in this paper.

C.; Curran, Richard			A comparative study of Data-driven Prognostic Approaches: Stochastic and Statistical Models	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 11-13, 2018	Seattle, WA	IEEE		Prognostics and health management (PHM); Data-driven method; Prognostic process	METHODOLOGY	Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a crucial component of many machines and engineering systems, enabling fault diagnostics, prognostics yielding remaining useful lifetime (RUL), and health management [1]. Research on how to predict RUL accurately has achieved popularity due to the accelerated development of prognostic techniques and algorithms [2]. In recent years, a considerable amount of research has been undertaken in data-driven prognostic approaches for RUL prediction, and various novel prediction techniques have been proposed in order to improve estimation accuracy. However, a systematic discussion and comparison of data-driven approaches and their contributing elements are lacking. While several reviews provide excellent overviews of RUL prediction methods, these are typically covered from a holistic perspective[3][4]. The contributing process elements in prognostic methods, such as health indication construction, are typically not compared in detail. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a generic prognostic method breakdown with five contributing technical steps. In addition, case studies are implemented to compare the technical steps of health indicator (HI) construction, degradation model, and RUL prediction. This paper comprehensively compares the approaches, in a systematic manner, covering the proposed five technical steps, and evaluates the results using a consistent set of criteria. This research contributes towards formulating a decision framework to guide a PHM system designer towards selection of an appropriate prognostic approach.	[Li, Rui; Verhagen, Wim J.

The system under investigation suffers a continuous degradation process, modeled as a Gamma process. In addition to the degradation process, the system is subject to aging, which contributes to the increase of failure rate. An additive model is employed to describe the impact of degradation level and aging on system failure rate. Inspection is implemented upon the system so as to effectively avoid failure. At inspection, the system will be repaired or replaced in terms of the degradation level. Different from previous studies which assume that repair will always lead to an improvement on system degradation, in our study, however, the effect of repair is twofold. It will reduce the system age to 0 but will increase the degradation level. System reliability is analyzed as a first step to serve for the maintenance decision making. Based on the reliability evolution, a maintenance model is formulated with respect to the inspection time. The optimal decision is achieved by minimizing the expected cost rate in one repair cycle. Finally, a case study of locomotive wheel-sets is adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Our approach incorporates the joint influence of aging and degradation process, and determines the optimal inspection time dynamically, which exhibits the advantage of flexibility and can achieve better performance in field use.

Data collected from diverse sources provide a chance and at the same time a challenge for data-driven PHM methods and models. The data often exhibit challenging characteristics like imbalanced data on normal and faulty conditions, noise and outliers, data points of different importance for the data-driven model, etc. In this paper, a k nearest neighbors-based fuzzy support vector machine is proposed for reducing the computational burden and tackling the issue of imbalance and outlier data, in fault detection. Fault detection is mathematically a classification problem. In this paper, the reverse nearest neighbors technique is adopted for detecting outliers and the k nearest neighbors technique is used to identify the borderline points for defining the classification hyperplane in support vector machines.

High-speed railway (HSR) transportation is an area of focus for industrial AI, since it demands maximized safety, reliability, availability, and minimized cost. Given the system complexity, the predictive maintenance for high-speed railway could hardly sustain with a raw experience-based system. This paper presents a framework for industrial AI enabled PHM system for HSR, which creates cyber twins of physical key subsystems and components to improve the condition transparency and decision efficiency. Enabled by advanced signal processing and machine learning with domain insights on historical data, cyber twins monitor real-time performance and predict potential faults to prevent unexpected downtime and support optimized decisions. Instead of performing analytics with large amount of raw data on the cloud, the cyber railway transportation system leverages the advantage of edge computing for real-time feature extraction and anomaly detection. The proposed framework introduces the general approach of implementing industrial AI. The paper also discusses the key methods of data-driven solutions for selected critical subsystems.

Different from the most of current methods which make diagnosis on a bunch of existing vibration data, online diagnosis needs to find whether a fault or crack occurred from the data which are collected sequentially. In this scenario, it needs to update the diagnosis model by means of the new collected data. Moreover, to maintain the online diagnosis accuracy, it needs to extract the most representative fault features quickly. Following these two tasks, a new online bearing fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper based on Incremental Support Vector Machine(ISVM) and Stacked Auto-Encoder(SAE) which is a kind of deep learning algorithm. This method contains two stages. At offline stage, the fault data are utilized to automatically extract the representative features by means of SAE, and then an offline diagnosis model is constructed by using ISVM. At online stage, for each new arrived data block, the network weight of offline SAE model is introduced to generate online fault feature vectors directly, and then the online diagnosis model is updated to incorporate the new data by integrating these features. Experimental results on CWRU and IMS bearing fault data sets show that, the proposed method can reach the satisfactory diagnosis performance at quick speed compared to the typical traditional feature extraction and diagnosis methods.

Frequency domain models are used in reformulations of three diagnosis approaches: optimization-based parameter estimation; parameter estimation based on a particle filter formulated in frequency-domain; and analytic redundancy relations. Working in the frequency domain enables the parallelization of the diagnosis algorithms since the model's algebraic equations can be evaluated independently. Hence we can reduce the time for reaching a diagnosis. This approach is particularly useful for rotating machinery, where the fault modes exhibit rich dynamics better seen in the frequency domain. As an illustrative example we demonstrate our approach by diagnosing parametric faults in a DC motor.

Feature extraction is one of the essential step in condition based monitoring which determines the performance of diagnosis model. This paper proposes a novel discriminative feature extraction technique based on fusion of low-level features or hand-crafted features with high-level features to detect every inserted faults as well as latent abnormalities in the machine. Low level features are extracted using signal processing techniques while high-level features are obtained from stacked autoencoder based deep neural network. Thus, both features represent raw data but generation methods for both are entirely different. Discriminating features build an effective classifier that categorizes test data into the respective classes. In the proposed methodology multi-class SVM has been used as classifier.

Hilbert transform (HT) is widely used to demodulate the mono-component signal. Unfortunately, HT is likely to generate unexplainable negative frequencies. Therefore, the empirical AM and FM demodulation (EAD) method, instead of HT, is taken as an alternative to demodulate mono-component signal to overcome the negative frequency problem of HT. In this paper, an improved EAD is proposed to improve the signal demodulation performance from three aspects, including the boundary processing, envelope estimation and demodulation stopping criterion. For the boundary processing and envelope estimation, the mirror extension and moving average methods are used respectively. For demodulation stopping criterion, a soft demodulation stopping criterion is proposed to determine the optimal iteration numbers of demodulation process. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the improved EAD will be validated with a large number of simulation cases.

The influence of the level of wavelet packet decomposition, fault severity and load on the diagnosis accuracy of rolling bearing is analyzed. The results show that there is an optimal level for the feature extraction of a certain length of vibration signal based on wavelet packet decomposition. By comparison with the method using wavelet packet sample entropy, the method using wavelet packet energy is more stable with the working load variation and more suitable for the incipient fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.

Regression methods, when applied to these parameters(features), provide an effective prediction of residual life of these critical components. Amalgamation of these techniques is instrumental in overcoming logistic supply chain management challenges by facilitating optimum utilization of available resources. Feature selection and feature extraction are two techniques used to reduce the dimension of data. The reduced data is then applied to train the model. Forecast of the remaining useful life is done using regression algorithm on the models output. This paper discusses and compares the prevalent methods of feature selection/extraction to include PCA, LDA and DNN methods for reducing the dimension of data to be used for training the model for the forecast. The paper also compares Mamdani type fuzzy model and ANN model for the forecast. The ultimate aim of the paper is to suggest the best method of dimension reduction and forecasting based on the experimental study using oil pressure degradation data of a diesel engine of a battle tank.

For this purpose, a novel method called stacked wavelet auto-encoder (SWAE) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, wavelet function is adopted as the nonlinear activation function to design wavelet auto-encoder, which can enhance the feature learning ability from the raw vibration signal of gearbox. Secondly, SWAE is constructed with a series of pre-trained wavelet auto-encoders for learning the deep features. Finally, the learned deep features are fed into the softmax classifier for automatic and accurate fault diagnosis.

C	Song, YC; Liu, DT; Peng, Y			IEEE	Song, Yuchen; Liu, Datong; Peng, Yu			Data-driven on-line health assessment for lithium-ion battery with uncertainty presentation	2018 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT (ICPHM)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Prognostics and Health Management (ICPHM)	JUN 11-13, 2018	Seattle, WA	IEEE			SAMPLE ENTROPY; STATE; PROGNOSTICS; MANAGEMENT	Lithium-ion battery has been widely applied in various industrial systems including distributed grids, electric vehicles, and spacecraft. The reliability and health state of battery energy storage system (BESS) directly influence the safety of the whole system. Particular emphasis is placed on approaches that can be used to assess the health state of lithium-ion battery especially for on-line operation conditions. As the battery is working in real applications, there is thereby an urgent need but it is still a significant challenge to estimate the battery health state based on on-line available parameters. This paper offers a new routine for lithium-ion battery on-line health assessment just based on the voltage measurements from constant current charge and discharge phases. Two different degradation features extracted from on-line measurable parameters are mapped to the battery health state space directly. Relevance vector machine (RVM) is applied to train the nonlinear mapping model by virtue of the sparsity of the model considering the computing complexity in on-line applications. On the other hand, the RVM algorithm can not only obtain the accurate health assessment results but also can represent the uncertainty involved in the results, which makes the health assessment more informative for system mission planning, condition based operation optimization, and other strategies to increase the system reliability and decrease the maintenance cost. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach could potentially achieve on-line battery health assessment and present the uncertainty at the same time.

The proposed method permits not only to assess the actual condition of the filter but also to perform prognostics, with predictions about the remaining useful life of the component. The approach described in the present paper consists of a combination of physics-based digital models and operational data acquired during commercial service from the system in the field. First, an appropriate health indicator is calculated based on raw measurements retrieved from the field. The health indicator is computed by taking into account the influence of context factors on the operational behavior of the HVAC unit. Subsequently, learning algorithms are employed to calibrate a carefully designed degradation model of the filter. By using Monte Carlo-based simulation techniques, the remaining useful life (RUL) of the filter is estimated in a probabilistic framework. The proposed approach has been tested on real HVAC unit mounted on a representative Alstom tramway in revenue service. The results of the field study reveal that thanks to the health indicator-based maintenance strategy, the useful life of the filters can be significantly extended. Further, application of the novel physics-based hybrid prognostics model allows to accurately estimate the probabilistic characteristics of the remaining useful life of the target component.

Failure prognostics for heavy-duty truck lead-acid batteries is considered with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) predictive model. Data used in the study contains information about how approximately 46,000 vehicles have been operated starting from the delivery date until the date when they come to the workshop. The model estimates a reliability and lifetime probability function for a vehicle entering a workshop. First, this work demonstrates how heterogeneous data is handled, then the architectures of the MLP models are discussed. Main contributions are a battery maintenance planning method and predictive performance evaluation based on reliability and lifetime functions, a new model for reliability function when its true shape is unknown, the improved objective function for training MLP models, and handling of imbalanced data and comparison of performance of different neural network architectures. Evaluation shows significant improvements of the model compared to more simple, time-based maintenance plans.

Unscheduled downtime in these primary digging units causes production delays and financial losses. An automatic lubrication system on-board the machine reduces friction wear on critical components and increases maintenance intervals. Blockages and leaks occur in this system, which will continue degrading until system failure. A sensor measures the grease pump pressure, from which distinct failure patterns can be extracted. These patterns indicate the system condition and remaining useful life. This data can be utilized to monitor system health using machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We present a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) architecture applied to detecting and classifying abnormal pressure patterns in grease pumps on wheel loaders. We find that the LRCN extracts and classifies symptomatic patterns, and propose a method for monitoring remaining useful life in cyclic systems with highly variable failure trajectories.

In our previous work [1], a novel autoregressive-integrated-moving average (ARIMA) based prediction model has been proposed which however has a relatively low power when detection of a weak change. In this paper, we present a new prediction model based on differential equation which takes into account local trend of data to perform change detection.

It is worth noting that a real degrading system may contain more than one working condition, leading to relatively large errors with the traditional one-phase degradation models. Different from most of the existing works, we mainly concentrate on analyzing the non-Markovian property of complicated performance degradation processes, and present a novel fractional Brownian motion (FBM) based multi-phase degradation model incorporating with the uncertain abrupt jump. All the change-points are detected simultaneously by the wild binary segmentation (WBS) procedure, while the Hurst exponent is estimated according to a specific Wavelet-based algorithm. To make full use of the statistical similarity from the same batch of equipments, the population model parameters and the individual ones are identified step by step through a hierarchical method. Furthermore, an approximated closed-form solution of the RUL distribution is derived utilizing the theory of first hitting time (FHT). A numerical example subject to three working conditions finally verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To guarantee the accuracy for the RUL prediction of machinery subjected to two-phase degradation process, the interactive multiple model (IMM) filtering technique has been used because of its capability in estimating the state and the phase dynamically. However, there are two limitations in the IMM based methods. 1) A crucial parameter of the IMM, i.e., the transition probabilities matrix (TPM) of the IMM, is set manually in existing IMM based methods, which often leads to inaccurate state estimation results. 2) The phase estimation is derived as one-step filtering results without considering the overall evolution of the degradation trend, which is unable to describe the phase transition, thus causing inaccurate phase estimation results. To tackle these two limitations, an improved RUL prediction method is proposed in this paper for machinery subjected to two-phase degradation process. In the proposed method, a two-phase degradation model is constructed to describe the degradation process. A nonlinear IMM technique, i.e., the interactive multiple model particle filter (IMMPF) is utilized for the state and the phase estimation, where the TPM is estimated using the numerical-integration TPM estimation (NI-TPME) algorithm instead of being pre-specified manually. The transition point (TP) distribution is adopted to reflect the overall evolution of the degradation trend, and is further used to modify the phase estimation from the IMMPF. Finally, the RUL is predicted by Monte Carlo simulation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical simulation study.

It is helpful for monitoring the operation state for machines in real time, and is critical for detecting the defects and potential faults. State characterization is also a base rock to implement a state-based maintenance strategy for avoiding the unexpected accidents and significant economic losses for multifarious machines. Axle bearing is one of the most important component in vehicle, and its health state will affect the stability and safety of the whole railway system. In this paper, a promising state quantized characterization method based on signal-to-noise ratio is proposed to monitor and detect the railway axle bearing in a high-speed train. The novelty signal-to-noise ratio is defined via ensemble empirical mode decomposition and singular value decomposition, and a dimensionless health indicator based on the signal-to-noise ratio is proposed to characterize quantitatively the health state of the axle bearing. Experimental results showed that the proposed health indicator is effective in distinguishing three types of railway axle bearing defects. Moreover, guideline thresholds for classification of normal and abnormal bearing health statuses and metrological boundaries of the health indicator for identification of three different types of railway axle bearing defects are provided.

In engineering, the EGT prognostic model provides supports for aero-engine performance assessment, maintenance plan optimization and operation schedule determination. The EGT parameters are regarded as the time series with nonlinear characteristics, which should be considered in the prognostic model. To address these issues, an EGT prognostic model based on the gated recurrent unit (GRU) network was proposed in this paper. The time series and nonlinear characteristics could be addressed by the GRU network simultaneously. For better prediction accuracy, the architecture of the GRU layer was determined by contrast experiments, in which the GRU stacked layer number, look-back timestamps and output dimension were determined. The proposed prognostic model was validated by the real-valued EGT data of a turbofan aero-engine. Five conventional machine learning prognostic models were regarded as the comparison models. The comparison experiments showed that the proposed EGT prognostic model had advantages in prediction accuracy and stability. The proposed EGT prognostic model could provide supports for aero-engine prognostic and health management in engineering.

While there are numerous methods to make this estimation, the constant current-constant voltage charge phase can be used, and in fact, the integrated voltage over time within the terminal voltage of 3.85 V-4.2 V during the charge phase has a strong linear correlation with state of health. To test this hypothesis, data from batteries which were run through accelerated aging tests were assessed with various methods. Estimates were made to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed method.

Many telematics applications have been also enabled from the analysis of those datasets and the usage of Machine Learning techniques, including driving behavior analysis, predictive maintenance of vehicles, modeling of vehicle health and vehicle component usage, among others. In particular, being able to identify the individual behind the steering wheel has many application fields. In the insurance or car-rental market, the fact that more than one driver make use of the vehicle generally triggers extra fees for the contract holder. Moreover being able to identify different drivers enables the automation of comfort settings or personalization of advanced driver assistance (ADAS) technologies. In this paper, we propose a driver identification algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). We show that only using features extracted from the gas pedal position and steering wheel angle signals we are able to achieve near 100% accuracy in scenarios with up to 67 drivers. In comparison to the state-of-the-art, our proposed methodology has lower complexity, superior accuracy and offers scalability to a larger number of drivers.

Combined PET/CT improves lung lesion detection but requires low dose protocols for frequent disease screening and monitoring. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using machine learning to improve low dose PET images to standard dose, high-quality images for better lesion detection at low dose PET scans. We employ image quality transfer (IQT), which is a machine learning algorithm that uses patch-regression to map parameters from low to high-quality images e.g. enhancing resolution or information content. We acquired 20 standard dose PET images and simulated low dose PET images with 9 different count levels from the standard dose PET images. For each count levels, 10 pairs of standard dose PET images with one simulated low dose PET images were used to train linear, single non-linear regression tree, and random regression-forest models for IQT. The models were then used to estimate standard dose images from low dose images for each count levels for 10 different subjects. Improvement in image quality and lesion detection could be observed in the images estimated from the low dose images using IQT. Among the models employed, the regression tree model produced the best estimates of standard dose PET images. An average bias of less than 20% in SUVmean of 25 lesions in the estimated images from the standard dose PET images can be obtained down to 7.5 x 10(6) counts. Overall, despite the increase in bias, the improvement in image quality shows the potential of IQT in improving the accuracy in lesion detection.

The loss of critical assets, such as transmission lines, should be quickly detected and corrective actions initiated through remedial action schemes to preserve system stability. Disturbances, such as line tripping caused by severe faults or breaker misoperation, can cause oscillations in machine rotors, resulting in power swings that affect power system stability. Quick, accurate open line detection is necessary to initiate automated corrective action in time to minimize system impacts and avoid blackouts. The speed and accuracy of existing open line detection methods limit their ability to take fast corrective control actions. This paper proposes a fast, secure, zero-setting algorithm to detect and declare open line conditions using wide-area synchrophasor measurements. Simulation results based on a real industrial system are presented for various transmission line topologies commonly found in high-voltage networks.

Recently, the use of high-resolution synchronized phasor measurements has been proposed by several researchers for fault detection and classification. Unlike the proposed approaches available in the literature, the central idea in this work is to leverage the delay information of phasor measurement streams to enable a faster recognition of faulty operation. In this work, therefore, we focus on the effect of the communication network delays on the fault detection time, and propose a novel training technique for fault detection and classification which takes delayed measurements into consideration. The performance of the proposed approach is verified using simulated power system data, where artificial neural networks are used for fault detection and classification.

The practical raw signals suffer from heavy noise,it is essential to retrieve the original signal from noisy raw signals.The signal processing techniques are very effective in such situations. The presence of noise in vibration signal is so large that its elimination results in information loss. In the proposed work noisy vibration signals corrupted by AWGN noise of faulty gear box faulty gear box are denoised using many wavelets and the results are compared. Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) is time invariant transform due to this property it is free from the aliasing problem. In this work SWT has been employed for vibration signal denoising and the results have been compared to the discrete wavelet Transfrom(DWT). The fault detection becomes easy for denoised signal and the analysis of its spectrum predicts the actual condition of the machine.The denoised results are compared on the basis of kurtosis.

We use a deep recurrent Neural Network (rNN) to process simulated RSRP reports in order to detect degradations of cell radio performance as well as complete outages. Using such a configuration we are able to achieve improved sensivity compared with a traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, while eliminating the need for a separate dimensionality reduction stage at the front end. We study multiple rNN configurations with up to three hidden layers and conclude that in this scenario we can achieve the target sensitivity with a single hidden layer, leading to highly efficient run time performance.

This study focuses on developing a resource-efficient leak detection system using distributed acoustic sensors, in pursuit of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. The proposed system extracts a small number of featured predictors from the raw acoustic signals, so the presence of leaks can be readily detected by applying machine learning classifiers while reducing the burden on data transmission, storage and computation A system prototype is successfully evaluated through the experiments with acoustic signals measured around a laboratory scale nuclear power plant coolant pipelines, considering the ambient background and machinery noises.

CNN is a natural extension to MLP with few modifications which resulted in a breakthrough. Mainly, the MLP algebraic dot product as a similarity function was replaced with 2-d convolution; in addition to a pooling layer which reduces parameter dimensions making the model equi-variant to translations, distortions, and transformations. The sparse connectivity nature of CNN is also a variation to the MLP. The two models were implemented on the EMNIST dataset which was used as 50% and 100% of its capacity. The models were trained with fixed and flexible number of epochs in two runs. Using 100% of EMNIST; for the fixed run CNN achieved test accuracy of 92% and MLP 31.43%, where in the flexible run the CNN achieved 92% and MLP 89.47%. Using 50% of EMNIST; for the fixed run CNN achieved test accuracy of 92.9% and MLP 33.75%, where in the flexible run of 92.9% and MLP 88.20%. The CNN demonstrated a good maintenance of high accuracy for image like inputs and also proved to be a better candidate for big data applications.

Based on that, the objective of this work is to evaluate intelligent hybrid systems to forecast real-time information from three in-vehicle sensors: engine coolant temperature, air fuel ratio (AFR) internal combustion and automobile battery voltage. Numerical results showed that, in general, combining forecasters from the residual modeling is a promising approach in the context of automotive data. In addition, the alternative combination of nonlinear with linear models suggests a hopeful proposition that can be used in other applications.	[Almeida, Diogo M.; de Mattos Neto, Paulo S.

Then came an alert in the scientific community, generating discourses and research in the field of renewable energy, for example, wind, solar and biofuels. Among various fields of study in wind power, this work is concerned in the study of electric generators, specifically in the detection of faults, using magnetic axial flux acquired from a squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG). We compare the performance of classifiers Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Optimum Path Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor in three different feature extraction methods, High Order Statistics (HOS), Fourier Transform and Structural Co-occurrence Matrix (SCM). We were able to correctly identify 99.4% of the Normal conditions using a Bayesian classifier alongside with as well identify incipient short-circuits with 95.6% of hit rate. SVM had a lowers false positive, 0.6% and 2% in HOS and SCM, respectively, while identifying 98% of the Normal conditions, so is more suitable for binary classification between fault and non-fault short-circuits.

As a consequence, HDD failures have severe effects that may range from data loss to service unavailability. Considering such scenario, academy and industry have driven its attention to HDDs failure prognostics solutions. In this work, we evaluate two of the most common deep learning architecture in the task of HDD failure prediction. Our tests were conducted on real-world datasets and the proposals were compared to a recurrent neural network. The results of this study showed that deep learning models are a valid alternative to solve this problem since they achieved good results and a significant amount of data is available.

If just a controller should be commissioned, simple test bench experiments should be undoubtedly preferred. Nevertheless, online-identification approaches must be prioritized for adapting or monitoring purposes during normal operation. In this paper, the first step towards the monitoring of the induction machine is presented. The performance of the well-known extended Kalman filter is analyzed for different cases of known and unknown machine parameter combinations. It is outlined by simulative and test bench results that the extended Kalman filter is well-suited for the machine parameters identification during run-time. This is the main prerequisite for subsequent analyses of induction machine fault scenarios.

The adopted strategy utilizes three-phase stator current sensors and calculates appropriate features using non-parametric and a statistical approach. The feature-set is reduced by means of the principal component analysis which acts as a pre-processor for the multilayer perceptron neural network. This two stage classification is carried out for detection and classification of faults. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is validated experimentally by using grid and inverter fed induction motors.	[Kumar, R.

Usually, early detection of an incipient fault is done using condition monitoring. Bearing failure is the most common fault among induction motor and vibration analysis is often used for fault detection. The research work is carried out by giving scrutiny to the recognition of the current state of the motor. The two types of holes are induced on the outer raceway of the bearing and fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis is performed to the load current of the stator. Additionally, diagnosis is performed using Naive Bayes Classifier Theorem (NBC) without considering the rotating speed. Furthermore, the comparison is done with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the results are promising.	[Pandarakone, S.

In this paper, a bearing fault detection method for a railway traction motor through leakage currents is proposed. The proposed detection method combines octave band analysis and machine learning. The abnormality simulation experiments with an inner race fault bearing are conducted and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. From the experiments, it is confirmed that the proposed method can detect failures of railway traction system well at specific conditions and leakage currents have potentials to be used for a bearing fault detection.

The vibration or current signals are the most commonly used in bearing fault diagnosis (BFD). However, their applications are also limited by some disadvantages. This study addresses a novel BFD method based on speed sensorless observer and angular resample(AR). Based on the analysis of the effect on the rotor speed signal caused by bearing faults in permanent magnetic synchronous machine (PMSM), a speed sensorless observer is designed to obtain the rotor angle and speed for reducing the cost and maintenance of the optical encoder. The angle and speed signal are pre-processed to fit the demand of the AR method, and the angle signal is used to resample the non-stationary speed signal into a stationary one in angular domain for the order spectrum analysis. The existence of excitation at the bearing fault characteristic order in the spectrum of the resampled signal is used for fault diagnosis. Experimental studies are carried out in both speed-varying and torque-varying conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of bearing faults of PMSM.

They also happen to be one source of concern for failure of SMs, which are otherwise quite reliable. The situation aggravates when the motors are fed by variable frequency drives, which brings additional stress on the damper bars. This paper presents theoretical simulations of a salient pole SM with twelve poles, containing three damper bars in each pole, during healthy as well faulty damper bar conditions. The current distribution is calculated in each damper bar. Experiments were conducted on the same SM and the current in the damper bars as well inter-connecting poles were measured and captured on a rotating wireless communication platform, both during healthy and faulty conditions of the damper bars with varying severity. The fault indicators are presented to detect damper bar failure conditions, thereby helping preventive maintenance of SMs.	[Sahoo, Subrat; Rodriguez, Pedro] ABB Corp Res, Vasteras, Sweden; [Holmgren, Fredrik] Contec Control Technol AB, Arboga, Sweden; [Perez, Jose; Lundin, Urban] Uppsala Univ, Dept Engn Sci, Uppsala, Sweden		Sahoo, S (corresponding author), ABB Corp Res, Vasteras, Sweden.	subrat.sahoo@se.abb.com; fredrik.holmgren4@hotmail.com; pedro.rodriguez@se.abb.com; Jose.Perez@angstrom.uu.se; Urban.Lundin@Angstrom.uu.se					Arkkio A., 1987, ACTA POLYTECHNICS SC; Bacher J., 2004, INT C REN EN POW QUA; Berry PJ, 2015, 2015 50TH INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITIES POWER ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (UPEC); Guru B.S., 2001, ELECT MACHINERY TRAN, V3rd ed.; Holmgren F., 2016, THESIS, P1; Karmaker H.

An algorithm based spectral subtraction analysis is applied for broken bar identification, independent of the relative position of the bar breakages. Moreover, power spectrum analyses enable the discrimination between healthy and faulty conditions. The results obtained with experimental data prove that the proposed approach provides good results for fault detectability. Moreover the identification of the faults, and the signal correlation indicator to prove the results, are also presented for different positions of the flux sensor.

To assess the effectiveness of the method under evaluation in this work, classification accuracy of four different learning machine techniques were compared: Fuzzy ARTMAP network; Support Vector Machine; k-Nearest Neighbour and Multilayer Perceptron Network. Moreover, this paper presents the comparison of an analogue and a digital filter to the line current signal provided by the motor. Results obtained from 2293 experimental tests are presented to validate this comparative study, considering a wide range of speed and load conditions.	[Godoy, W. F.; Goedtel, A.; Palacios, R. H.

However, these motors are subject to a range of defects which can hinder them from functioning properly. Accordingly, this paper proposes the use of an artificial neural network method to detect and classify bearing faults in three-phase induction motors which are connected directly to the power grid. After embedding the proposed method in a digital signal processor, laboratory tests were conducted on the motors by employing practical conditions of unbalanced supply voltages and applying a wide range of load torque to the shaft. Analysis were perhirmed in the (line domain, based on acquiring the voltage and current amplitudes in the motor supply and by using a half-cycle of the voltage grid. For further validation of the proposed embedded system, field tests were conducted on factory where motors are used in the sugarcane ethanol industry.

Evaluation of the Detectability of Bearing Faults at Different Load Levels through the Analysis of Stator Currents	2018 XIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 03-06, 2018	Alexandroupoli, GREECE	Int Conf Elect Machines Assoc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Minist Environm & Energy		bearing faults; current; induction motor; MCSA; vibration	INDUCTION-MOTORS	Bearing faults are among the most relevant electrical machines failures. Their early and reliable detection can imply significant economic savings for the industry. This paper discusses the effects of bearing faults in the stator current, performing steady state analysis, under different load levels. A motor-generator test bench has been built in order to simulate real working conditions. Motor current signature analysis (MCSA) is used to study steady-state regime. It is a well-known and widespread technique for detecting rotor-related faults but not so commonly used in bearing diagnosis. The objective is to study the evolution of the harmonic components in different cases of use, taking into account several types of progressive faults. Tests were carried out with healthy and damaged induction motors under different fault severities and confirm the potential of the technique for detecting such faults. Moreover, the results show the variation of the harmonics amplitudes with the load; the paper specifies the most suitable load levels for the application of the technique.

The latter two, along with their constantly growing demands, have raised the necessity of new approaches and techniques in fault diagnostics. A reliable solution to this matter, has proven to be the monitoring of stray magnetic flux. Accounted for in different locations on the machine's peripheral area and with different measurement techniques, the stray flux provides valuable information for fault detection and identification. This paper aims to apply one of these diagnostic strategies and the related measurement of stray flux using FEM, to evaluate its performance and diagnostic capability on two machines of different size and power rating and conclude on the quantitative effectiveness of such strategies.

Micro Zero Padding for the Reduction of Spectral Leakage in the Diagnosis of Rotor Asymmetries Faults in Large Induction	2018 XIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 03-06, 2018	Alexandroupoli, GREECE	Int Conf Elect Machines Assoc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Minist Environm & Energy		Condition monitoring; fast Fourier transforms; fault diagnosis; induction machines; spectral analysis; zero-padding		Large induction machines play a key role in modern industry, both as large motors (e.g. in mining industries) or large generators (e.g. in wind turbines). Condition monitoring of such machines assures their continuity of service, and may avoid costly breakdowns. Among the methods for condition monitoring, motor current signature analysis is being increasingly used, because it is non-invasive, and can identify a wide variety of faults. A challenging problem is the detection of the fault signature of rotor asymmetries in large induction machines, which have a very low rated slip. In this case, the fault harmonics are so close to the fundamental component that its spectral leakage may hide them, even with significant fault severity. Using a filter window, such as the Hanning one, reduces the spectral leakage, but distorts the amplitude of the fault components, thus decreasing the reliability of the fault diagnosis. This problem is addressed in the technical literature by removing the fundamental component, with notch filters, or using high-resolution spectral techniques; but these techniques are costly in terms of computing power. This paper proposes a new, efficient method to solve this problem, using a small amount of zero padding that eliminates the leakage of the fundamental component, without distorting the amplitude of the fault harmonics. The method is theoretically explained and experimentally validated with the diagnosis of a broken bar fault in a 3.15 MW induction motor.

Typically, physical health indicators are derived from available sensor data, and a mathematical model is tuned to fit them. The time it takes for the model to reach a failure threshold is the estimated remaining useful life. The failure threshold may be determined from historical failure data, but that is not always readily available. ISO standard 10816-3 defines permissible velocity vibration levels for machines that may be used as a failure threshold. However, velocity vibration is not suitable for bearing prognostics due to the effect of integration from acceleration. In this paper, the drawbacks of velocity vibration are explained, and two new failure thresholds using acceleration vibration data are proposed. Results from three run-to-failure tests are provided to show the performance of the proposed failure thresholds.

However, faults may appear and inflict great losses. So, condition monitoring of such machines is critical to avoid unscheduled stops and unplanned maintenance. This paper works towards that direction. The authors are proposing a new off-line method to reliably detect the static eccentricity fault in synchronous salient pole electrical machines. The method is based on the monitoring of all three phase currents of the machine during locked rotor at three different rotor positions. A pseudo zero-sequence current is then calculated, the frequency spectrum of which can reveal reliable indicators to detect this fault. The proposed method has been tested experimentally with success, while the results indicate that it is possible to estimate the fault level severity.	[Gyftakis, K.

The machine learning algorithms provide a better way to diagnose faults in complex cases, such as mixed faults and/or in variable speed conditions. Most of studies focus on training phases of the machine learning algorithms, but the development of the trained machine learning algorithms for an online diagnosis system is not detailed. In this study, a complete procedure of training and implementation of an online fault diagnosis system is presented and discussed. Aspects of the development of an online fault diagnosis based on machine learning algorithms are introduced. A developed fault diagnosis system based on the presented procedure is implemented on an in-house test setup and the reliably detected results suggest that such a system can be widely used to predict multiple faults in the power drivetrains under variable speeds online.

Traditional machine testing methods are time consuming and prone to various errors. Moreover, this requires skilled operator to perform the test, note down the readings and to do desired calculations. This paper presents all in one test bench that can perform all the standard tests on basic direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) machines. The data obtained from these tests is used to calculate the equivalent circuit parameters, efficiency and to plot the characteristic curves of the machines. Various important parameters of the coupled machines are displayed on a mimic diagram present on the graphical user interface (GUI). LabVIEW is a very convenient tool to integrate the hardware for signal acquisition and control, which is used here for developing the GUI and control logic for the complete system. The complete system enables us not only to test and plot different characteristics of the machine but also to control, monitor and protect it from remote location with fault diagnosis.	[Ugale, R.

Analysis of Stray Flux Spectral Components in Induction Machines under Rotor Bar Breakages at Various Locations	2018 XIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL MACHINES (ICEM)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Electrical Machines (ICEM)	SEP 03-06, 2018	Alexandroupoli, GREECE	Int Conf Elect Machines Assoc, IEEE Ind Applicat Soc, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Democritus Univ Thrace, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Minist Environm & Energy		broken bars; induction motor; signal processing; spectral content; stray flux	CAGE ROTOR; DIAGNOSIS; FAULT; SIGNATURE; FAILURES	Induction machines under rotor electrical faults have been subjected to intensive research over the years. It is not only the nature of the fault that makes it important to study, but also the differences observed regarding this fault's effect on the motor's conditions. One of these conditions is the rotor bar breakages at non adjacent positions, which has drawn the attention of researchers due to the false negative diagnostic alarms that may be caused. In this paper, a novel approach is presented aiming to reliably detect this type of fault condition. The proposed method is based on the analysis of specific subcomponents of the stray flux over time. The analysis is implemented on an industrial 1.1 MW industrial induction motor, since large industrial motors make the cases where MCSA might fail due to the weak speed ripple effect and closeness of the fault's sidebands to the fundamental harmonic. The work has been carried out with extensive Finite Element simulations.	[Panagiotou, P. A.; Lophitis, N.] Coventry Univ, Fac Engn Environm & Comp, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Panagiotou, P.

However, there are some applications in which the installation of vibration sensors is not feasible or the access to the motor is limited. In these cases, the use of alternative techniques, such as the analysis of motor currents may bring significant advantages. In this context, over these recent years, advanced methods based on the analysis of transient motor currents have proven to be very effective for the detection of certain faults, avoiding the drawbacks of classical current analysis methods. This paper proposes the analysis of the starting current to detect different types of mechanical faults in induction motors. Motor misalignment caused by loosened bolts and soft foot as well as coupling unbalance are considered in the work. The results show that the advanced analysis of starting currents brings very useful information to detect the presence of these anomalies, becoming an excellent informational source for the diagnosis of these types of failures.

Experimental tests are performed in the form of run-ups and the results are plotted as colormaps to visualize the effect of the unbalance in a large speed range. Based on the observation of these plots, the relevant orders are tracked to compare their evolution with speed, load and unbalance severity, emulated by an increasing resistance inserted on one phase up to the open-phase fault case. It turns out that the analysis of the computed instantaneous power and the estimated RMS current is more suited for a reliable diagnosis in all cases.

The fault under consideration is the inter-turn short-circuit (ITSC) in stator's winding. Deep study of the harmonic and inter-harmonic content is conducted for fault detection (FD) purposes. The harmonics in the spectrum appear as a result of diverse causes including stator fault, DTC reaction to the fault, switching activities of the inverter, core saturation effect, and noise signal for IM operating in harsh industrial environment. Simulation reinforced by experimental results demonstrated the correctness of the frequency domain analysis.

On-line health condition monitoring of punching process is becoming more and more important in order to detect and correct process failures in time, and ensure the consistence of the product quality. Effective feature extraction of the process is critical for monitoring the punching process. In this work, piezoelectric strain sensors are used to measure the strain on press column surface which is the response of the press to the stamping force. A feature extraction approach based on the wavelet transform and the energy distribution of the reconstructed wavelet coefficients is proposed. The energy distribution is used as the process feature for similarity distance calculation for the process clustering. Semi-supervised clustering is applied to the process monitoring considering that many normal data sets are available while the failure data is difficult to obtain in practice. The proposed method is applied to the column strain signals from punching process and simulation failure data. The results show that combining the wavelet energy distribution of the strain signal and the semi-supervised clustering is an effective method for health condition monitoring and failure detection in punching processes.

Especially, existing selective laser melting machine tools are not equipped with analytics tools that evaluate sensor data. This paper describes an approach to analyze and visualize offline data from different sources based on machine learning algorithms. Data from three sensors were utilized to identify clusters. They illustrate the normal operation of the machine tool and three faulty conditions. With these results, a condition monitoring system can be implemented that enables those machine tools for predictive maintenance solutions. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Deep Learning for Improved System Remaining Life Prediction	51ST CIRP CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	Procedia CIRP		English	Proceedings Paper	51st CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP CMS)	MAY 16-18, 2018	Stockholm, SWEDEN	KTH Royal Inst Technol, Int Acad Prod Engn		Deep Learning; Degradation Prognosis; Engine Fleet	HEALTH; PROGNOSTICS	Prognosis of manufacturing system performance degradation is essential to operation safety and efficiency, and provides the basis for predictive maintenance scheduling. Complex physical mechanisms underlying machine operations often impose challenges to accurate health state assessment. This paper presents a data-driven approach to tracking system state degradation and consequently, predicting the remaining useful life, based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Using aircraft engine fleet as an application context, the developed method reveals the temporal-dependency embedded in sensor data streams as the basis for engine degradation prediction. Good performance in engine remaining useful life prediction is demonstrated. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Grinding wheel redress life estimation using force and surface texture analysis	51ST CIRP CONFERENCE ON MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	Procedia CIRP		English	Proceedings Paper	51st CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems (CIRP CMS)	MAY 16-18, 2018	Stockholm, SWEDEN	KTH Royal Inst Technol, Int Acad Prod Engn		Grinding wheel redress life; grinding force; surface texture analyses; signal processing; features extraction; automated dressing	WEAR	Grinding characterized by low material removal rate and high surface finish is an abrasive machining process. Geometrically undefined grits of grinding wheel influences part surface finish. Cutting edges worn out during grinding are retained by timely dressing. Operators on shop floor decides on the dressing interval based on end of wheel life such as burns, chatter marks and deterioration in the workpiece surface finish. Incorrect dressing of grinding wheel increases unnecessary machining time and wheel wastage. The present work defines the usefulness of grinding force signal and ground surface texture analysis in the estimation of grinding wheel redress time. Grinding experiments were performed in surface grinding machine with white Alumina wheel on D2 tool steel specimen. During the experiments, the force signals were acquired from 9257B Kistler dynamometer, for each grinding pass with 16 KHz sampling frequency. Ground workpiece surface images were captured using multi-sensor Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM). Experiments were continued till the grinding wheel reaches its end of life. Grinding force signal features prominent to the assessment of grinding wheel deterioration in time, frequency and time-frequency domains were extracted based on prognostic metric evaluation. Hough transform based image texture features were also extracted. The test results depict that a good correlation exists between grinding force signals and ground surface images in measuring the wear deterioration level and thus the ground surface features can be considered as an explicit criterion in the redress life estimation of the grinding wheel.

But especially the concerted action, which strives the development of sensors, controls, data processing together with connectivity, unprecedented data integration and the notion of cyber physical production systems open up new development lines towards manufacturing systems as enablers for the progress in manufacturing. Highly developed compensation concepts are developing into state depending AI-supported strategies. Maintenance becomes predictive, as learning of machines becomes global and model based. Further inspirations taken from biological systems are adopted for machining centres and drive a biological transformation of manufacturing machines. Machine intelligence becomes the basis for executing manufacturing processes, which requires a close integration of process intelligence (CAM-systems) and machine controls. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Besides the physical realization of the products, planning in accordance with meeting manufacturing and quality standards for the processes needed for realization gain substantial importance. Technological planning in compliance with the requirements as interface between product planning and realization needs to be adapted to new paradigms like the reduction of energy demands for chipping processes. That results in the possibility to not only adjust the cutting parameters like feeding speed, but also to select alternative tooling machines. With that, a production scenario which is not only energetically more suitable but also in correspondence with the aims of the work planning is generated. The development of a technology based and specified machine model to realize the component dependent energy demand prognosis of a tooling machine is fundamental. The specified machine model connects machine dependent data with technology based and feature specific energy demand functions and therefore supplies a forecast accuracy of more than 90%. A process which introduces the development of such machine models for the realization of an energy demand forecast of according manufacturing tasks and therefore the energetical comparison of production variations is described in this article.

The dynamic model of angular contact ball bearing and floating displacement bearing are developed by discrete element method based on the geometrical relationship between different bearing components and Hertz contact theory. The spindle shaft is modeled by finite element method with Timoshenko beam theory. With the developed dynamic model, the dynamic response of the machine tool spindle bearing system with or without bearing defect can all be simulated. Base on the developed spindle bearing system dynamic model, the dynamic vibration characteristics of a vertically installed machine tool spindle with multiple defects on inner race is investigated. The proposed model is validated on a machine tool spindle with bearing defects caused by collision in the laboratory. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A performance assessment and enhancement framework based on data mining, artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms is under development with the objective of structuring, collecting and analysing the operation and failure data of the systems and equipment, to guide the identification and implementation of adequate corrective, preventive and consolidation interventions. The framework is designed to collect and structure the data and identify and analyse the associated driving events. It develops dynamically functional dependencies and logic trees, descriptive and predictive models to support operation and maintenance activities to improve the reliability and availability of the installations. To validate the performance of the framework and quality of the algorithms, several case studies are being carried out. In this paper, we report on the design and implementation of the performance assessment and enhancement framework, and on the preliminary results inferred on historical and live stream data from CERN's technical infrastructure. Proposals for the full deployment and expected long-term capabilities will also be discussed.

A virtual prototype model of the automatic shell magazine includes a mechanical model and control model is built in RecurDyn and Simulink. The failure mechanism of the automatic shell magazine is analyzed, and the corresponding fault factors are selected. Due to an insufficient number of fault samples, a large number of fault samples are generated by the virtual prototype model and the fault samples are analyzed by FDA. Then, the eigenvalues from FDA are used to train ELM to obtain a diagnostic machine. The diagnostic machine is used for the fault diagnosis of the automatic shell magazine and is proved to be very effective.

Deep belief network (DBN) can automatically learn valid features from signals, which leaves out manual feature selection compared with traditional fault diagnosis methods. In this paper, a novel method called deep belief network with Nesterov momentum is developed for the diagnosis of rolling bearings. Nesterov momentum is used to accelerate training and improve precision. An experimental analysis is carried out using a dataset under different bearing health states from a test rig to substantiate the utility of the proposed DBN architecture. Results show that the method demonstrates impressive performance in bearing fault pattern recognition. Comparison analyses are further conducted to demonstrate that Nesterov momentum can improve the capability of DBN.

Deep learning is a breakthrough in artificial intelligence and known as an automatic feature learning method. One of the most important aspects to measure the extracted features is sparsity. Thus, this paper presents a stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based method for automatic feature extraction and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The penalty term of the SAE can help automatically extract sparse and representative features. Experiments and comparisons are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Results fully demonstrate that the stacked SAE-based diagnosis method can automatically extract more representative high-level features and perform better than the traditional intelligent fault diagnosis method like artificial neural network (ANN).

Predictive maintenance as a part of defect detection related to indicators and environmental impact in production development. Use of Zero Defect (ZD) methods or Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will give great value to reduction of scrap rates, fault and defects. Scrap rates is often a huge problem due to different conditions in the production system, and will often cause impact on the delivery to costumer. To provide a self-correcting system by use of machine control data and augmented reality (AR) solutions, input to continuous maintenance tasks on the shop floor can be assisted. CPS, vision based inspection or AR solutions in the production environment provides the opportunity to detect fault in order to prescribe a possible maintenance solutions. The vision inspection as decision-making system may give feedback on detected problems, like contrast of parts, change in geometry, material or smutch on product or on the palette in production. This makes it possible to reduce interoperability and to make self-adjustments in production lines by use of CPS as a system for collaborating computational entities connected to services.

Many technicians spend their time on non-technical activities such as retrieving instructions from manuals. If AI (Artificial Intelligence) can alleviate some of these tasks, the time to diagnosis and repair can be shortened. However there are limited works about the effects of using AI during maintenance activities on a technician's cognitive load. Therefore, as an initiative, we conducted a pilot experiment with 10 participants to analyze the effects of the AI-based support system on diagnosis tasks in the manufacturing. In the experiment, participants were divided into two groups: the group used an AI-based support system and the other group used a Fault Tree (FT) based support system; two groups' mean task completion time and task load of participants using NASA Task Load were measured. According to the experiment results, the group which used the AI-based support system to diagnose the model completed task 53% lesser time than the group which used the FT-based support system. In addition, participants who used the AI-based support system reported relatively lower task loads compared to participants who used the FT-based support system. This experiment results imply that maintenance time and a variability can be reduced if an AI-based support system supports maintenance technicians.

The production planning, operations and machine maintenance influence the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of the machinery, resulting in more 'good parts' at the end of the day. The target of the predictive maintenance approaches in this respect is to increase efficiency and effectiveness by optimizing the way machines are being used and to decrease the costs of unplanned interventions for the customer. To this end, development of ad-hoc strategies and their seamless integration into predictive maintenance systems is envisaged to bring substantial advantages in terms of productivity and competitiveness enhancement for manufacturing systems, representing a leap towards the real implementation of the Industry 4.0 vision. Inspired by this challenge, the study provides an approach to develop a novel predictive maintenance platform capable of preventing unexpected-breakdowns based on integrated strategies for extending the operating life span of production systems.

In this context, manufacturing companies require an innovative strategy to survive in a competitive business environment, utilizing those technologies. Guided by these requirements, the so-called predictive maintenance is of paramount importance and offers a significant potential for innovation to overcome the limitations of traditional maintenance policies. However, real shop-floors often have obstacles in providing insights to facilitate the effective management of assets in smart factories. Even if a significant amount of machine and process data is available, one of the common problems of these data is the lack of annotations describing the machine status or maintenance history. For this reason, companies have limited options to analyse manufacturing data, despite the capability of advanced machine learning techniques in supporting the identification of failure symptoms in order to optimize scheduling of maintenance operations. Moreover, each machine generates highly heterogeneous data, making it difficult to integrate all the information to provide data-driven decision support for predictive maintenance. Inspired by these challenges, this research provides a hybrid machine learning approach combining unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. The approach and result in this article are based on the development and implementation in a large collaborative EU-funded H2020 research project entitled BOOST 4.0 i.e. Big Data Value Spaces for COmpetitiveness of European COnnected Smart FacTories.

This paper provides a conceptual model that includes different aspects that should be considered by a comprehensive methodology to support an informed decision-making process in this regard. In particular, the work stems from the need of estimating the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of an asset, for defining an Ageing Asset Strategy, through a multi-disciplinary approach instead of a purely technical one. To this end, the proposed model highlights the different End of Life types of an asset that should be considered for comprehensive RUL estimation methodology.

The advancement of Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) has increased challenges in maintenance as modern assets have became complex mixes of systems and sub systems with complex interaction. Among maintenance activities, fault diagnosis is particularly cumbersome as the reason of failures on the system is often neither obvious in terms of their source nor unique. Early detection and diagnosis of such faults is turning to one of the key requirements for economical and functional asset efficiency. Several methods have been investigated to detect machine faults for a number of years that are relevant for many application domains. In this paper, we present the process history-based method adopting nominal efficiency of Air Handling Unit (AHU) to detect heat recovery failure using Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in combination of the logistic regression method.

They need to copy memory page content frequently or manually mark and recompile sensitive programs, which takes a lot of time and labor overhead. This paper introduces a hardware-based detection method against it in a different way. The Hypervisor monitors the modification of the guest page table entry (PTE) and the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) entries to find the trace of adversary's operations. As there is a semantic gap between VMs and Hypervisor, we take advantage of VMI (Virtual Machine Introspection) to convert important data. To overcome the challenge of changeable page tables, we grasp the feature of the target attack and filter out required records. Experiments show that this method can effectively detect controlled-channel attacks. In general, the performance overhead of the operations related to context switching will increase but within an acceptable range.

The dependability of these microservices becomes a major concern of application providers. Anomalous behaviors which may lead to unexpected failures can be detected with anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, an anomaly detection system (ADS) is designed to detect and diagnose the anomalies in microservices by monitoring and analyzing real-time performance data of them. The proposed ADS consists of a monitoring module that collects the performance data of containers, a data processing module based on machine learning models and a fault injection module integrated for training these models. The fault injection module is also used to assess the anomaly detection and diagnosis performance of our ADS. Clearwater, an open source virtual IP Multimedia Subsystem, is used for the validation of our ADS and experimental results show that the proposed ADS works well.

In the context of this data revolution, the innovative SiMoDiM project aims at developing a smart predictive maintenance system for the stainless steel industry. In its first stage, it focuses on the assets within the hot rolling process, one of the core components involved in the manufacturing of steel sheets, and more specifically on the coiler drums of Steckel mills. These drums operate under mechanical and thermal stresses that degrade them, and their replacements directly impact the product valor chain. In this work we present the data analysis stage of SiMoDiM, where the huge amount of available historical and real-time data from the hot rolling process (collected by onboard sensors in the mills) are studied in order to find which variables and descriptors are valid indicators of the coiler drums' conditions. This analysis is the first step towards an intelligent system that takes advantage of such descriptions for performing a predictive maintenance of the machinery.	[Ruiz-Sarmiento, J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a mainstream method to deal with big data, and is used in many areas to achieve better effectiveness. It is known that attacks happen every day in production cloud systems, however, the fault behaviors and interferences of up-to-date AI applications in container-based cloud systems is still not clear. This paper aims to study the reliability issue of container-based clouds. We first propose a fault injection framework for container-based cloud systems. We build a docker container environment installed with TensorFlow deep learning framework, and develop four typical attack programs, i.e., CPU attack, Memory attack, Disk attack and DDOS attack. Then, we inject the attack programs to the containers running AI applications (CNN, RNN, BRNN and DRNN), to observe fault behaviors and interferences phenomenon. After that, we design fault detection models based on quantile regression method to detect potential faults in containers. Experimental results show the proposed fault detection models can effectively detect the injected faults with more than 60% Precision, more than 90% Recall and nearly 100% Accuracy.

In fact, in order to produce quickly, economically, with high quality while decreasing the risk of production break due to a machine stop, it is necessary to maintain the equipment in a good operational condition. This requirement can be satisfied by implementing appropriate maintenance strategies such as Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and using updated condition monitoring technologies for faults detection and classification. In this context, a new method for machinery condition monitoring based on Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is proposed to automatically detect the mechanical faults by maximized the generalization ability. Hence, the purpose is to design an automatic detection system for mechanical components defects based on supervised classification by trained to maximize the margin. The proposed approach consists in a sequence of binary classifications after extracting a set of relevant features such as temporal indicators and MFCC coefficients. The diagnosis accuracy assessment is carried out by conducting various experiments on acceleration signals collected from a rotating machinery under different operating conditions.

In this paper we have applied Supervised Machine Learning (SML) to a set of long term observation time series from a Cellular/Wireless network. We have shown that periodically collected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be analyzed by supervised ML. Generally, the network creates a new big data periodically when different KPIs from e.g. all the cells (sectors of each 2G/3G/4G/5G base station) are output to a remote Database. We have applied a single class support vector machine in the first phase to find out outliers in range based KPI values. Then LSTM RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is used for deeper understanding of their behavior over time. Both profile based KPIs and range based KPIs are used to filter out the FP (False Positive) or FN (False Negative) anomaly candidates. In this study, we have applied a novel approach to automatically label the huge data into a supervised training set. This is possible when the meaning of major KPIs is well understood. Both a time series profile based prediction and a logical combination of acceptable value ranges (Min/Max) are used for Anomaly Filtering (AF). A Min or a Max condition is omitted in a single threshold case. AF is used both for AD and for automatic labelling of the training set for ML. Automated labelling with AF performed well also for any large dataset The pure time series graph profile based KPIs without applicable limits were not used for labelling nor for AF. This technique gave us better results than unsupervised learning based AD. Our enhanced supervised AD decreased the number of FP anomalies from 33 to 0, while the total anomalies decreased from 35 uncertain cases to 2 TP (True Positive), 0 FN. Finally, KNN algorithm is used to classify test data sets. Our proposed method seems to solve several major problems in the field of Cellular/ Wireless, Fixed, [Packet (e.g. IP)] Data Networks as well as within related network side and user equipment. Automation in general, including medical/ any critical systems and equipment is another possible application domain Automated labelling with AF performed well also for any large dataset.

Data Insights from an Offshore Wind Turbine Gearbox Replacement	EERA DEEPWIND'2018, 15TH DEEP SEA OFFSHORE WIND R&D CONFERENCE	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Deep Sea Offshore Wind R and D Conference (EERA DeepWind)	JAN 17-18, 2018	SINTEF, Trondheim, NORWAY	NTNU, European Energy Res Alliance, European Energy Res Alliance Joint Programme Wind Energy, Res Council Norway	SINTEF		DRIVE	Gearboxes are a complex, yet vital assembly for non-direct-drive offshore wind turbines, which are designed to last for the lifetime of the asset. However, recent studies indicate that they may have to be replaced as early as 6.5 years. Moreover, their contribution to offshore wind farm failures and downtime has been shown to be amongst the three most critical assemblies with the highest material cost required. An improved understanding of these premature failures and the ability to predict them in advance could reduce inspection and maintenance costs, as well as to help overcome many logistical and planning challenges. The objective of this paper is to present the lessons learnt from a gearbox exchange performed in one of the offshore wind turbines at Teesside offshore wind farm, comprising 27 2.3MW wind turbines. The paper takes a condition monitoring perspective and uses the identified spalling at the inner part of the planetary bearing as the governing failure mode. A data management system has been setup, incorporating all the operational data received, including maintenance log information and sensor data. A period of up to 2.5 years, prior to the the gearbox exchange, is examined for this study. SCADA and CMS data of the faulty turbine are compared against the wind farm, using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Supervised learning models are built, which will help predict similar failures in the future. Results show how different data sources can contribute in gearbox failure diagnosis and help to expedite failure detection for Teesside offshore wind farm and similar wind turbine and gearbox types. This paper will be of interest to wind farm developers and operators to build predictive models from monitoring data that can forecast potential gearbox failures.

Combining Machine Learning and Domain Experience: A Hybrid-Learning Monitor Approach for Industrial Machines	EXPLORING SERVICE SCIENCE	Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Exploring Service Science (IESS)	SEP 19-21, 2018	Karlsruhe, GERMANY	Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe Serv Res Inst		Machine monitoring; Hybrid learning; Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks; Product-service systems	MAINTENANCE; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	To ensure availability of industrial machines and reducing breakdown times, a machine monitoring can be an essential help. Unexpected machine downtimes are typically accompanied by high costs. Machine builders as well as component suppliers can use their detailed knowledge about their products to counteract this. One possibility to face the challenge is to offer a product-service system with machine monitoring services to their customers. An implementation approach for such a machine monitoring service is presented in this article. In contrast to previous research, we focus on the integration and interaction of machine learning tools and human domain experts, e.g. for an early anomaly detection and fault classification. First, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks are trained and applied to identify unusual behavior in operation time series data of a machine. We describe first results of the implementation of this anomaly detection. Second, domain experts are confronted with related monitoring data, e.g. temperature, vibration, video, audio etc., from different sources to assess and classify anomaly types. With an increasing knowledge base, a classifier module automatically suggests possible causes for an anomaly automatically in advance to support machine operators in the anomaly identification process. Feedback loops ensure continuous learning of the anomaly detector and classifier modules. Hence, we combine the knowledge of machine builders/component suppliers with application specific experience of the customers in the business value stream network.

A Hierarchical Multiagent-based Protection Structure for Meshed Microgrids	IECON 2018 - 44TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 20-23, 2018	Washington, DC	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		Fault detection; fault location; harmonic injection; support vector machine (SVM); wavelet transform	SYSTEMS	This paper proposes a new protection structure to locate any type of faults in a meshed microgrid based on only measuring the current and voltage of the Distributed Generator (DG) that communicates with its neighboring DGs. In the first step, following a wavelet transform, a set of features are selected and fed to a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (MSVM) to detect occurrence and type of fault. Then, faulted zone-the area between two DGs that fault occurs between them- is determined thanks to two facts. First, one of the DG in two sides of the faulted zone endures the lowest voltage. Second, regarding fundamental frequency of 50 Hz, if this DG injects a harmonic of 300 Hz, the DG with the lowest voltage at 300 Hz is the next closest DG. Finally, based on the optimum features and these two DGs, a SVM is used to locate the faulted line. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in a meshed microgrid.

In this paper, an approach for identification of the most coherent generating units is proposed which exploits a decision tree (DT) algorithm based on synchronized data measured by phasor measurement units (PMUs). Such DTs should be trained so as to provide accurate decisions for almost all possible disturbances in power systems. Three probabilistic parameters are, therefore, taken into account in a training stage including fault type, fault location, and the system load level at the time fault occurs. In order to generate the training dataset, different scenarios are simulated and appropriate attributes are extracted from voltage phasors. Furthermore, the most coherent generating units, which are the DT target, are determined in each scenario by evaluating the similarity between the frequency components existing in their speed variation signals. The effectiveness of the suggested approach is verified by its application to the 68-bus, 16-machine test system through which it reveals high accuracy in recognizing the most coherent generating units under various prevailing conditions in power grid.

The approach is attractive because it could significantly lower the cost of machinery monitoring. This work demonstrates that motor current signature analysis (MCSA) can be applied for fault detection using bus-level measurements. The primary contribution is a signal-detection algorithm that can accurately detect fault-related signals having nearly the same exact frequency. The approach has been tested in the laboratory using two identical motors connected in parallel, and it has successfully detected the existence of faults in both motors.

Model-based fault detection has a potential benefit of being less sensitive to transient conditions compared to frequency-domain based methods for fault detection. However, accurate models of the machine being monitored are required in order to produce accurate fault detection whilst avoiding false alarms. This paper presents a model-based fault detection method based on the analysis of the residual between the measured currents and those predicted by an accurate real- time model of the machine. The model is nonlinear and based in pre-calculated flux linkages look up tables obtained through magnetostatic finite element analysis (FEA), accounting for magnetic saturation and spatial harmonics. The use of a residual provides a mean to amplify frequency components caused by a fault. Computer simulations, real-time Hardware-in-the- Loop (HIL) methods and experimental validations are provided.

In this paper, two stator windings are modeled and compared to determine which has better fault tolerant capability. When the machine is operated under turn fault, the windings with separated neutral points (NP's) has lower torque ripple caused by fault reflected flux harmonics. Besides, average torque output is less affected by the turn fault because of decreasing circulating currents in windings. Analytical models based on equivalent circuits are developed to predict the machine flux and torque property. All developed analytical models are verified by the finite element analysis (FEA).

The fault-tolerant topology consists of a five-leg converter, with a shared leg connected to a generator phase and to its corresponding grid phase. The main contribution of this paper consists on the development of an alternative vector-control-based pulse-width-modulation (PWM) control scheme for both machine-side converter (MSC) and grid-side converter (GSC), allowing to reduce the dc-bus voltage ratings. Moreover, a reliable fault diagnosis algorithm is also integrated, providing the information required to instantaneously trigger fault-tolerant remedial strategies, without any additional sensors. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant PMSG drive.

It proposes a methodology for predicting the fuel cell output voltage evolution with time. Echo State Network is a powerful Artificial Intelligence tool for time series predicting which main characteristics is the use of a reservoir of neurons, randomly created, instead of hidden layers such as for Artificial Neural Networks. Only the output layer is optimized by a multi-linear regression, resulting in a time reduced training phase. This leads to a possible increase of the reservoir size to preserve, even improve, its accuracy. However, the bottleneck linked to the use of this tool lies in its architecture optimization. This paper proposes a way to overcome the echo state network parameters optimization process by using a Multi-Reservoir Echo State Network. Then a comparison between an Echo State Network optimized algorithm and a Multi-Reservoir Echo State Network for fuel cell RUL prediction is proposed. In order to have a good prediction of the FC lifetime, an innovative approach based on the Multi-Reservoir Echo State Network is developed and validated using experimental data.

Applicability of Context-Aware Health Monitoring to Hydraulic Circuits	IECON 2018 - 44TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 20-23, 2018	Washington, DC	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		Monitoring; Hydraulic Circuits; Context-Awareness; Model-Free; Injective Function	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; SYSTEMS	Monitoring is an important aspect of operation and maintenance in virtually every industrial system. However, the extent and methods of monitoring vastly vary in different systems, from fully automated to fully manual. One of the challenges of automated monitoring is the tediousness of, and the extent of engineering time and effort required to develop necessary models or machine learning algorithms for the units to be monitored. Model-free monitoring, on the other hand, can save resources and efforts substantially. However, more often than not they have a very limited scope and application. Such a system is needed, for example, to monitor entire Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, consisting of different types of sensors such as temperature, pressure, humidity or flow sensors. Recently, we proposed the Context-Aware Health Monitoring (CAH) system for model-free monitoring of any injective-function black-box, and it was tested successfully on an AC motor. In this paper, we evaluate the CAH system for an entirely different industrial use-case, that is, a hydraulic circuit. The results show the potential for considerable benefits in monitoring HVAC systems. Moreover, in the light of applying CAH to different use-cases which may potentially need a different setup of parameters, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the values of different parameters in the system. The results show the robustness of CAH with regard to the values of these parameters.

Although existing deep learning approaches to fault diagnosis are able to intelligently detect and classify the faults in rotating machinery, most of these approaches rely exclusive on data and thus are purely data-driven, and do not incorporate physical knowledge into the learning and prediction processes. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel approach, namely physics-based convolutional neural network (PCNN), for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery and targets fault detection of rolling-element bearings as a special application of PCNN. In the proposed approach, an exclusively data-driven deep learning approach, called convolutional neural network, is carefully modified to incorporate useful information from physical knowledge about bearings and their fault characteristics. The performance of the proposed PCNN approach in machinery fault diagnosis is compared with that of traditional machine learning- and deep learning-based approaches reported in the literature.

Levy Process-Based Stochastic Modeling for Machine Performance Degradation Prognosis	IECON 2018 - 44TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 20-23, 2018	Washington, DC	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers		Prognostic modeling; remaining useful life; Levy process; Brownian motion; compound Poisson process	REMAINING-USEFUL-LIFE; BROWNIAN-MOTION; PREDICTION; FILTER	Accurate and robust monitoring, tracking and prognosis of machine performance degradation provides the technical basis for realizing predictive maintenance scheduling and improved operational reliability. To cope with nonlinearity and non-homogeneity that are typically seen in performance degradation, this paper presents a prognostic modeling technique based on the Levy process, which expresses the variation of machine performance as an accumulation of successive and jump increments. Specifically, the proposed Levy model is divided into two terms to address two types of degradations: a linear Brownian motion (LBM) model to describe gradual deterioration with time-varying rates, and a non-homogenous compound Poisson process (CPP) model to describe transient performance changes due to abrupt fault occurrence. The time-varying deterioration rate is captured in LBM by a stochastic drifting coefficient that is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, besides a diffusion term that accounts for temporal uncertainties and degradation-to-degradation variations. The non-homogeneous occurrence rate of transient changes is captured in CPP by a Poisson distribution with a time-varying jump intensity, with the sizes of transient changes assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. By calculating the moments of the characteristic function of the proposed Levy model, explicit expressions for the probability distributions of predicted degradation and remaining useful life (RUL) have been derived. To estimate the time-varying parameters in the Levy model, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a batch estimation technique has been investigated. The proposed prognostic modeling technique is evaluated using rolling bearing run-to-failure tests.

In condition-based maintenance, measurements are used to detect, identify, and predict the onset and evolution of potential faults. The information is then used to optimally schedule the maintenance activities and logistics. With the development of machine learning and big data, deep learning algorithms become important tools in condition prediction due to their excellent capabilities in data processing, feature extraction, and modeling. This paper presents a novel approach for machine health condition prognosis based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Particle Filtering (PF). In this work, machine condition data are used to train a LSTM model offline, which is then employed as a prognostic model in the framework of Bayesian approach to online predict the evolution of the machine fault state. Particle filtering is utilized to calculate the posterior probability density function. Case studies of a cracked carrier plate are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can predict machine condition more accurately.

Further, often battery cooling by a single fan induces a temperature gradient on individual cells that may cause a differential degradation among them. Strategies for cell balancing need to use not only the estimate of State of Charge (SOC) but also estimate of the core temperature of each cell. Here an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based SOC estimator is designed using an electrical equivalent circuit model of lithium ion cell where the model parameters vary with SOC, core temperature and charge-discharge modes. These model parameters are obtained from pulsed charge and discharge test done on the cell. Outputs of the UKF based estimator, which are SOC and polarization voltage, are fed as inputs to a cell core temperature estimator. Core temperature of cells can be estimated from its surface temperature and electrical cell model. However, only a limited number of thermistors can be put inside the battery pack which makes it difficult to measure surface temperature of each cell. In that case it is required to know the temperature gradient inside the pack which will be used to estimate the core temperature of all the cells. The data used for this work is obtained from NASA Prognostic Data Repository.

Building a unified fault-model is challenging due the presence of system specific attributes in the features derived. We explore how the effect of system specific attributes from the feature vectors can be minimized to improve the performance of system independent fault models(SIFM). In this work, we used three-phase synchronous generators with 3kVA and 5kVA ratings, for detecting the stator inter-turn short circuit faults. Our baseline-system uses statistical features derived from the current signal, with a support vector machine(SVM) used as a backend-classifier. In the first approach, we consider the system specific attributes as a nuisance and remove it using nuisance attribute projection (NAP) algorithm. We obtained a performance improvement of 19.63%, 831% and 11.80% classification accuracy for R,Y, B phases respectively, over the baseline-system. When we use a SVM backend-classifier, it is required that the features match the kernels used with the SVM. This often limits the performance of the classifier. Next, we explored convolutional neural networks(CNN) with the raw current signal as its input. Max-pooling is a technique used to minimize the size of feature map, simultaneously it construct a condensed feature map by selecting translation-invariant features. Thus, CNNs have the ability to absorb the irrelevant system specific variations, and improve the SIFM performance. It is observed that the CNN based SIFM outperforms NAP-SVM model by 12.56%, 1037% and 20.15%, for R, Y, B phase fault models respectively.	[Sreekumar, K. T.; Kumar, C.

This paper proposed a threshold optimized zero-crossing feature extraction method, which calculates the Euclidean distance feature vector of the rolling bearing states. The optimizing observation window length and intervals number can be obtained, and the optimized feature vector is selected to establish the identification model. Experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Owing to the development of high-throughput technology on gene detection, an increasing number of disease-related biomarkers for diagnosis, subtyping, and prognosis have been discovered. Conventional methods for biomarker discovery mainly focus on detecting the relationship between intrinsic genotypes and extrinsic phenotypes, while recent efforts emphasize the role of a biomarker under particular condition, which extends to the integrated analysis on Enviro-, Geno-, and Pheno-measures. Samples sharing a similar pattern of genotype under certain environment are in a 'state' that is distinctive from other states. Such different states generated by machine learning from samples can further indicate the different outcome of the phenotype of interest, which makes the enviro-geno-pheno state (E-GPS) analysis as an analytic tool for biomarker studies.

Support Vector Machine Based Method for High Impedance Fault Diagnosis in Power Distribution Networks	INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2018, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL)	NOV 21-23, 2018	Madrid, SPAIN			High impedance fault; Fault detection; Fault location		The detection of high impedance faults (HIFs) on a power distribution system has been a subject of concern for many decades. This poses a very unique challenge to the protection engineers, as it seems to be invisible to be detected by conventional protection schemes. The major concern about HIFs is that they pose a safety risk, as these faults are associated with arcing which may be dangerous for the surroundings. In this work, we propose a technique, which uses feature extraction, classification and a locating algorithm. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is used to extract meaningful information, support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier and a support vector regression (SVR) scheme is used as a fault location estimator. The technique is tested on a network of a power utility.	[Moloi, K.; Jordaan, J.

To enable off-the-shelf usage of machine learning (ML) in prognostic research, we developed AUTOPROGNOSIS: a system for automating the design of predictive modeling pipelines tailored for clinical prognosis. AUTOPROGNOSIS optimizes ensembles of pipeline configurations efficiently using a novel batched Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that learns a low-dimensional decomposition of the pipelines' high-dimensional hyperparameter space in concurrence with the BO procedure. This is achieved by modeling the pipelines' performances as a black-box function with a Gaussian process prior, and modeling the "similarities" between the pipelines' baseline algorithms via a sparse additive kernel with a Dirichlet prior. Meta-learning is used to warmstart BO with external data from "similar" patient cohorts by calibrating the priors using an algorithm that mimics the empirical Bayes method. The system automatically explains its predictions by presenting the clinicians with logical association rules that link patients' features to predicted risk strata. We demonstrate the utility of AUTOPROGNOSIS using 9 major patient cohorts representing various aspects of cardiovascular patient care.

However, many challenges related to RUL estimation are not solved yet, mainly connected to the definition of the health status of each component. A prognostic method based on a data-driven methodology for hydraulic systems is here proposed to estimate the percentage of life already spent by the monitored components. The potentials of the methodology are shown considering the case of a truck-mounted hydraulic crane, for which a simulation model was available. An artificial neural network is designed along with a fuzzy logic system to attain the estimation goal on supply pump and hydraulic control valve. The simulation results show how this method could be used as reference for developing prognostic methods applicable to hydraulic machines.

Bayesian based Prognostic Model for Predictive Maintenance of Offshore Wind Farms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HEALTH	The operation and maintenance costs of offshore wind farms can be significantly reduced if existing corrective actions are performed as efficient as possible and if future corrective actions are avoided by performing sufficient preventive actions. In this paper a prognostic model for degradation monitoring, fault prediction and predictive maintenance of offshore wind components is defined. The diagnostic model defined in this paper is based on degradation, remaining useful lifetime and hybrid inspection threshold models. The defined degradation model is based on an exponential distribution with stochastic scale factor modelled by a normal distribution. Once based on failures, inspection or condition monitoring data sufficient observations on the degradation level of a component are available, using Bayes' rule and Normal-Normal model prior exponential parameters of the degradation model can be updated. The components of the diagnostic model defined in this paper are further explained within several illustrative examples. At the end, conclusions are given and recommendations for future studies on this topic are discussed.

Santhosh; Ramachandran, K., I			Scalable fault models for diagnosis in a synchronous generator using feature mapping and transformation techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							HEALTH MANAGEMENT; TURBINE	Condition based maintenance (CBM) needs data acquired during healthy and faulty conditions to develop intelligent system for fault diagnosis. However, fault injection is not allowed/possible in a highly expensive components of complex/critical systems to collect fault condition data. Therefore, proto-type/small working models are used to conduct experiments for abnormal/fault conditions, to obtain and scale the intelligence of the system for effective health monitoring of complex system. This methodology is referred as scalable fault models. For proof of concept, in this work, we considered two different capacity synchronous generators with rating of 3 kVA and 5 kVA to emulate the behavior of prototype/small working model and complex system respectively, for scalable fault models. We explored feature mapping and transformation techniques to achieve effective scalability. From the preliminary experiments, it is observed that the baseline system performance deteriorated due to the changes in the system (capacity) and its characteristics with load changes. We therefore, expressed the input features in terms of load and system independent manner, to make the features less dependent on load and system variations. We explored locality constrained linear coding (LLC) to express the features load/system independently. It is observed that experimenting LLC with the backend support vector machine (SVM) classifier gave the best fault classification performance for linear kernel, suggesting that the faults are linearly separable in the new feature space. Since the LLC mapped feature space is linearly separable, we then explored linear feature transformation technique, nuisance attribute projection (NAP) on the LLC mapped feature space to further minimize the load/system specific variations. We observed that LLC-NAP improved the overall accuracy and sensitivity of the classifier significantly. We also noted that the performance of NAP was limited in the original feature space since the feature space (NAP without LLC) is nonlinear with load/system variations.	[Gopinath, R.; Kumar, C.

To implement a prognostic and health management (PHM) for oil and gas pipelines corroded by internal pitting, an appropriate degradation model is required. An appropriate and highly reliable pitting corrosion degradation assessment model should consider, in addition to epistemic uncertainty, the temporal aspects, the spatial heterogeneity, and inspection errors. It should also take into account the two well-known characteristics of pitting corrosion growing behavior: depth and time dependency of pit growth rate. Analysis of these different levels of uncertainties in the amount of corrosion damage over time should be performed for continuous and failure-free operation of the pipelines. This paper reviews some of the leading probabilistic data-driven prediction models for PHM analysis for oil and gas pipelines corroded by internal pitting. These models categorized as random variable based and stochastic process-based models are reviewed and the appropriateness of each category is discussed. Since stochastic process-based models are more versatile to predict the behavior of internal pitting corrosion in oil and gas pipelines, the capabilities of the two popular stochastic process-based models, Markov process-based and gamma process-based, are discussed in more detail.

The research was motivated by a drive in the aerospace sector to implement EMAs for safety critical applications to achieve a More Electric Aircraft (MEA). Concerns in reliability and mitigating the single of point of failure (ballscrew jamming) have resulted in consideration of Prognostics and Health Monitoring (PHM) techniques to identify the onset of jamming using motor current. A higher fidelity model based approach is generated for a true representation of ballscrew degradation, whereby the motor is modelled using `dq axis' transformation theory to include a better representation of the motor dynamics. The ballscrew kinematics are to include the contact mechanics of the main sources of friction through the Stribeck model. The simulations demonstrated feature extraction of the dynamic behaviour in the system using Iq current signals. These included peak starting current features during acceleration and transient friction variation. The simulated data were processed to analyse peak Iq currents and classified to represent three health states (Healthy, Degrading and Faulty) using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. A classification accuracy of similar to 74% was achieved.

This paper presents a framework with feature extraction methods and an anomaly detection module combined with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) for on-board clutch slippage detection and diagnosis in heavy duty equipment. The feature extraction methods used are Moving Average Square Value Filtering (MASVF) and a measure of the fourth order statistical properties of the signals implemented as continuous queries over data streams. The anomaly detection module has two components, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Logistics Regression classifier. CBR is a learning approach that classifies faults by creating a new solution for a new fault case from the solution of the previous fault cases. Through use of a data stream management system and continuous queries (CQs), the anomaly detection module continuously waits for a clutch slippage event detected by the feature extraction methods, the query returns a set of features, which activates the anomaly detection module. The first component of the anomaly detection module trains a GMM to extracted features while the second component uses a Logistic Regression classifier for classifying normal and anomalous data. When an anomaly is detected, the Case-Based diagnosis module is activated for fault severity estimation.

Diagnosing and Predicting Wind Turbine Faults from SCADA Data Using Support Vector Machines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Unscheduled or reactive maintenance on wind turbines due to component failure incurs significant downtime and, in turn, loss of revenue. To this end, it is important to be able to perform maintenance before it's needed. To date, a strong effort has been applied to developing Condition Monitoring Systems (CMSs) which rely on retrofitting expensive vibration or oil analysis sensors to the turbine. Instead, by performing complex analysis of existing data from the turbine's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, valuable insights into turbine performance can be obtained at a much lower cost. In this paper, fault and alarm data from a turbine on the Southern coast of Ireland is analysed to identify periods of nominal and faulty operation. Classification techniques are then applied to detect and diagnose faults by taking into account other SCADA data such as temperature, pitch and rotor data. This is then extended to allow prediction and diagnosis in advance of specific faults. Results are provided which show recall scores generally above 80% for fault detection and diagnosis, and prediction up to 24 hours in advance of specific faults, representing significant improvement over previous techniques.

To secure reliable operation, redundant pulverizers should be installed in power plants and monitored. Pulverizers can be operated and maintained in a cost-effective manner by correctly estimating the current health condition and remaining useful life of the pulverizer's gearbox system. To this end, the Data Challenge Committee of the PHM Asian Pacific 2017 (PHMAP 2017) conference organized an open competition on the topic of coal pulverizer health estimation based on a real working power station. This paper presents the original problem and given facts, as well as the list of winners of the Data Challenge Competition. We anticipate that this paper can be used as a reference in the development of a prognostic method that can accurately predict the health conditions of coal pulverizers.

J	Ossai, CI				Ossai, Chinedu, I			Prognostics Health Estimation of Lithium-ion Batteries in Charge- Decay Estimation Uncertainties - A Comparative Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; MODEL; CAPACITY; STATE	This study uses nonlinear mixed effect-based degradation modeling that considers the influence of uncertainties on the state-of-charge of lithium-ion batteries to determine the State-of-Health (SOH) of the batteries at different End-of-Life (EOL) failure thresholds. The results of the analysis obtained with lithium-ion batteries data from NASA Ames Centre repository, confirms that the SOH of the batteries is influenced by the uncertainties This is because the random effects models show a better correlation with the experimental data than the fixed effects models that have not considered uncertainty. It is important therefore that battery prognosis is done in consideration of these parametric uncertainties, to forestall poor estimation of the SOH of the lithium-ion batteries at various stages of the lifecycle. Seeing that the presence of uncertainties could result in unwarranted failures of assets powered by the batteries, due to overestimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) or capital loss, due to early decommissioning of efficient batteries when the RUL is under-estimated.

Thus, an unexpected shutdown can lead to physical injury as well as economic consequences. This paper aims to show the emergence of the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) concept in the industry and to describe how it comes to complement the different maintenance strategies. It describes the benefits to be expected by the implementation of signal processing, diagnostic and prognostic methods in health-monitoring. More specifically, this paper provides a state of the art of existing signal processing techniques that can be used in the PHM strategy.

Selecting Suitable Candidates for Predictive Maintenance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							PROGNOSTICS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Predictive maintenance (PdM) or Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) assists in better predicting the future state of physical assets and making timely and betterinformed maintenance decisions. Many companies nowadays desire the implementation of such an advanced maintenance policy. However, the first step in any implementation of PdM is identifying the most suitable candidates (i.e. systems, components). This is to assess where PdM would provide the greatest benefit in performance and costs of downtime. Although multiple selection methods are available, these methods do not always lead to the most suitable candidates for PdM. The main reason is that these methods mainly focus on critical components without considering the clustering of maintenance, and the technical, economic, and organizational feasibility. This paper proposes a three-stage funnel-based selection method to enhance this process. The first step of the funnel helps to significantly reduce the number of suitable systems or components by a traditional filtering on failure frequency and impact on the firm. In the second and third step, a more in-depth analysis on the remaining candidates is conducted. These steps help to filter potential showstoppers and study the technical and economic feasibility of developing a specific PdM approach for the selected candidates Finally, the proposed method is successfully demonstrated using two distinct cases: a vessel propulsion system and a canal lock.

J	Walker, C; Coble, J				Walker, Cody; Coble, Jamie			Wind Turbine Bearing Fault Detection Using Adaptive Resampling and Order Tracking	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT			English	Article							DIAGNOSTICS	Wind energy is growing increasingly popular in the United States, so it is imperative to make it as cost competitive as possible. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) make up 20-25% of the total cost of onshore wind projects. Unplanned maintenance contributes approximately 75% of the total maintenance costs (WWEA, 2012). Condition-based maintenance strategies intend to maximize the uptime by reducing to the amounts of unplanned maintenance. This should result in an overall decrease in the cost of maintenance. Wind turbines produce an interesting challenge, because their main shaft rotation is both slow and nonstationary. Through the use of adaptive resampling and order tracking, both of these challenges were combated as the bearing fault was identified in the order spectrum then tracked as it progressed. The fault was identified as an outer race defect on the main bearing that initiated sometime during or before installation. The total energy in the order spectrum around the bearing fault rate was identified as a potential front-runner for a prognostic parameter. This paper presents a case study application to operational wind turbine bearing data to demonstrate the ease and intuitiveness of combining adaptive resampling and order tracking to diagnose faults for slow, nonstationary bearings. Prognosis of remaining useful life is proposed with features extracted from the order spectrum, but additional data are needed to develop and demonstrate this analysis.

Condition monitoring and damage prognostics has been widely used as an increasingly important and powerful tool to improve the system availability, reliability, performance, and maintainability, but still very challenging due to multiple sources of data uncertainties and the complexity of analytics modeling. This paper presents an intelligent probabilistic methodology for anomaly prediction of high-fidelity turbomachine, considering multiple data imperfections and multivariate correlation. The proposed method adeptly integrates several advanced state-of-the-art signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques: wavelet multiresolution decomposition, Bayesian hypothesis testing, probabilistic principal component analysis, and fuzzy stochastic neural network modeling. The advanced signal processing is employed to reduce dimensionality and to address multivariate correlation and data uncertainty for damage prediction. Instead of conventionally using raw time series data, principal components are utilized in the establishment of stochastic neural network model and anomaly prediction. Bayesian interval hypothesis testing metric is then presented to quantitatively compare the predicted and measured data for model validation and anomaly evaluation, thus providing a confidence indicator to judge the model quality and evaluate the equipment status. Bayesian method is developed in this study for denoising the raw data with multiresolution wavelet decomposition, quantifying the model accuracy, and assessing the equipment status. The dynamic stochastic neural network model is established via the nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs approach. It seamlessly integrates the fuzzy clustering and independent Bernoulli random function into radial basis function neural network. A natural gradient method based on Kullback-Leibler distance criterion is employed to maximize the log-likelihood loss function. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology and procedure is demonstrated with the 11-variable time series data and the forced outage event of a real-world centrifugal compressor.

It is hard to diagnose failure in advance in the vehicle industry because of the limited availability of sensors and some of the designing exertions. However with the great development in automotive industry, it looks feasible today to analyze sensor's data along with machine learning techniques for failure prediction. In this article, an approach is presented for fault prediction of four main subsystems of vehicle, fuel system, ignition system, exhaust system, and cooling system. Sensor is collected when vehicle is on the move, both in faulty condition (when any failure in specific system has occurred) and in normal condition. The data is transmitted to the server which analyzes the data. Interesting patterns are learned using four classifiers, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest. These patterns are later used to detect future failures in other vehicles which show the similar behavior. The approach is produced with the end goal of expanding vehicle up-time and was demonstrated on 70 vehicles of Toyota Corolla type. Accuracy comparison of all classifiers is performed on the basis of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves.

J	Jan, SU; Koo, I				Jan, Sana Ullah; Koo, Insoo			A Novel Feature Selection Scheme and a Diversified-Input SVM-Based Classifier for Sensor Fault Classification	JOURNAL OF SENSORS			English	Article							MUTUAL INFORMATION; MACHINE	The efficiency of a binary support vector machine- (SVM-) based classifier depends on the combination and the number of input features extracted from raw signals. Sometimes, a combination of individual good features does not perform well in discriminating a class due to a high level of relevance to a second class also. Moreover, an increase in the dimensions of an input vector also degrades the performance of a classifier in most cases. To get efficient results, it is needed to input a combination of the lowest possible number of discriminating features to a classifier. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the performance of an SVM-based classifier for sensor fault classification in two ways: firstly, by selecting the best combination of features for a target class from a feature pool and, secondly, by minimizing the dimensionality of input vectors. To obtain the best combination of features, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm that selects m out of M features having the maximum mutual information (or relevance) with a target class and the minimum mutual information with nontarget classes. This technique ensures to select the features sensitive to the target class exclusively. Furthermore, we propose a diversified-input SVM (DI-SVM) model for multiclass classification problems to achieve our second objective which is to reduce the dimensions of the input vector. In this model, the number of SVM-based classifiers is the same as the number of classes in the dataset. However, each classifier is fed with a unique combination of features selected by a feature selection scheme for a target class. The efficiency of the proposed feature selection algorithm is shown by comparing the results obtained from experiments performed with and without feature selection. Furthermore, the experimental results in terms of accuracy, receiver operating characteristics (ROC), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) show that the proposed DI-SVM model outperforms the conventional model of SVM, the neural network, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm for sensor fault detection and classification.

These failures lead to several surface problems; therefore, contact mechanics and electrochemistry approaches incorporating induced residual stresses have been adopted to develop a comprehensive solution for the prediction and prognostic of such failures. Experimental study of film cracking and its propagation into substrates, interfacial transient behaviours and film-substrate system has been conducted. A parallel study of corrosive degradation to include cathodic delamination, cathodic blistering and tribo-corrosion of films has been conducted. Experimental and analytical studies of induced residual stresses within the coating and their effects on failure mechanisms and propagation have been completed. A detailed investigation of elastic mismatch at the interfacial contact and interfacial crack tip field has been performed and a complex stress intensity factor is presented. Mathematical derivation of oscillatory singularity, mode mix and interfacial fracture criterion to include adhesion are presented. This paper presents novel mathematical modelling incorporating interfacial crack propagating, diffusion of corrosive species and cathodic blistering for prediction and prognoses of coating failures.

J	Tarabini, M; Scaccabarozzi, D				Tarabini, Marco; Scaccabarozzi, Diego			Uncertainty-based combination of signal processing techniques for the identification of rotor imbalance	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Measurement uncertainty; Balancing machines; Data fusion; Vibration	MOTOR FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; HILBERT TRANSFORM; FOURIER-TRANSFORM; DATA FUSION; DECOMPOSITION	This paper describes a method for the uncertainty-based combination of signal processing techniques for the identification of rotor imbalance. The main idea of the proposed method is to compute the imbalance with different algorithms and to average the different algorithms' results. The method is based on the data fusion at feature level and uses the measurement uncertainty of the imbalance as a figure of merit for the weight computation. A static, a dynamic, and a hybrid implementation are presented. In the static one, the weights are computed in a dedicated training phase, in which four algorithms (Fourier transform and quasi-harmonic fitting of signal denoised with Hilbert-Huang Transform, Hilbert Vibration decomposition, and Wavelet Packet decomposition) have been used to estimate the known imbalance of car wheels. In the dynamic one, the weights are computed at runtime by estimating the difference between each predictor and the actual signal. The hybrid approach is the combination of the two algorithms.

One promising approach is to utilize machine learning for service quality prediction and fault detection so that suitable mitigation actions can be executed. In our previous work, we have shown how to predict service-level metrics in real-time just from operational data gathered at the server side. This gives the service provider early indications on whether the platform can support the current load demand. This paper provides the logical next step where we extend our work by proposing an automated detection and diagnostic capability for the performance faults manifesting themselves in cloud and datacenter environments. This is a crucial task to maintain the smooth operation of running services and minimizing downtime. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which exploits the interpretative capabilities of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to automatically detect and localize different performance faults for cloud services.

Hence, it is considered to be an important activity for any company, even to one not related to IT. Time of incidents' resolution is the key performance indicator for ITSM. To reduce resolution time, authors propose infrastructure incident prediction model. Model is based on machine learning technologies. Application of machine learning models in ITSM allows significant improves in customer experience and handling issues more efficiently, decreasing service desk agents' efforts and reducing service costs. This paper aims to propose predictive method of the incident resolution time estimation. Proposed model derives insights from incident data and predicts estimated time of resolution, allowing detection of incident resolution's de-lays. Authors analyzed prediction accuracy, and derived results demonstrating that model can assist with prediction for a large set of incidents using dataset based on a real service desk incident data. Additionally, its practical use is applicable for service improvement process. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A frequency domain variable step size least mean square adaptive algorithm is used to estimate NOFRF and get nonlinear spectral data. After obtaining nonlinear frequency spectrum data, the spectrum features are extracted by kernel principal component analysis(KPCA) method. To consider global characteristics and local characteristics of nonlinear spectrum, a kind of mixed function is used as kernel function of KPCA model. According to different frequency domain scale characteristics, a multi-fault classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) fusion is constructed, and a classification reliability-based fusion method is adopted.

The real-time monitoring and evaluation of machining state provides support for the intelligent control of process quality. In view of the time-varying, coupling and dynamic characteristics of monitoring parameters, as well as the real-time dynamic correlation and nonlinear relationship between the processing state and the product quality, this paper uses the Stacked Auto-encoder (SAE) to optimize the multidimensional real-time monitoring parameters in the machining process. By using the hybrid model of SAE-BP neural network, the nonlinear mapping relation between multidimensional monitoring parameters and the processing state is characterized adaptively and the dynamic intelligent evaluation of the machining state in the intelligent manufacturing process is realized. Taking an experimental platform as an example, the validity of the dynamic intelligent evaluation of the SAE-BP neural network used in processing state is verified. The proposed method provides support for the real-time dynamic evaluation of machining state.

However, the mathematical modelling and detection of such experience is still an emerging issue due to the complexity and relatively young age of Android. This paper applies and compares three machine learning algorithms, namely decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Belief Network (DBN), for the detection of software aging in Android. In addition to the traditional aging indicator of launch time (LT), this paper also investigates the effectiveness of page fault (PF) and multiple labels (i.e., the combination of LT and PF). Experimental results show that the accuracy of DBN is comparable to decision tree and SVM when the data volume increases to 5000, which means DBN and other similar algorithms suitable for high dimensional and large data may also play a role in software aging. The results also reveal that PF is a little more stable than LT in terms of variance of accuracy, and it can also be used a good indicator for aging of Android.

Therefore, this research was conducted to predict the maintenance of a nut manufacturing machine's punches by capturing vibration data through an accelerometer and analyzing it. Results of the average sample multiscale entropy (MSE) showed indications of impending failure for the 4P and 9P punches. For the 4P punch, entropy decreased before maintenance. For the 9P punch, it increased. From the moving average of the MSE values, the healthy signal range for both punches was 0.05 to 0.063. The results will be valuable to the company to alert them of impending failure.	[Novelo, X.; Chu, H.

The new requirements increase production costs, extend manufacturing time and entail frequent errors in the product quality. So far, knowledge management framework provided by ERP systems still has not responded to the customized needs even though ERP's provide plenty of innovation solutions for prognosis, trending, etc. Additionally, high uncertainty of customization could be managed better by employing diverse expertise of employees if their knowledge could be empowered together with rigid knowledge about the customized order. The goal of this paper is to determine customized manufacturing demands for functionalities of knowledge management systems that can be incorporated in ERP. The research is based on a case study conducted in an SME type company settled in Lithuania. Extended interviews on different issues, including the decision making system, problem solving, strategic decisions and ERP implementation and use, have been conducted during the last 2 years (from June, 2016 to March, 2018) with company leaders, managers, constructers and production workers. Although, one may expect to accrue experience and improve abilities with every new order, the company is still facing difficulties in coping with uncertainties of incoming orders even after ERP was implemented and launched. In conclusions, customized manufacturing is intensively looking for new knowledge management solutions that meet strictly defined requirements with new ERP functionalities that could be explicit as system based on employee participation and machine learning. The main functionalities could be listed as following: 1.) to make prognostic price estimations for customized and unique orders; 2.) to classify new orders specifying what additional capacities are require to develop the product; 3.) to recognize and accumulate any data that can be stored in the system for future solutions; 4.) to provide guidelines for knowledge management at all stages of knowledge acquisition, transformation and application.

Thus, a method for fault diagnosis based on VMD-SVD and extreme learning machine is proposed in this paper. First, the bearing vibration signal is decomposed into a number of stationary intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by VMD method. Second, the initial feature matrix of each IMF component is decomposed by SVD, and the obtained singular value is used as the eigenvector of the signal. Finally, extreme learning machine is used as the classifier for fault diagnosis. This method's feasibility and effectiveness have also been verified by experiment.

Different types of failures lead to different changes of the entire equipment and operating parameters. In the urban rail train operation, the quality and status of bearings have a significant impact on traffic safety. In rotary machinery fault diagnosis, second-order cycle statistics has become an important signal analysis tool. In this paper, the early fault point is realized by CUSUM combined with spectral correlation density function, and the characteristics of different fault are analyzed using second-order cyclic statistics. The research of the theory of cyclic stationary provides the direction and power for the development of bearing fault diagnosis with a case.

Accurate assessment of machine health requires effective analysis of vibration data, which is typically performed by examining the change in frequency components. One limitation associated with these methods is the empirical knowledge required for fault feature selection. This paper presents an image processing approach to automatically extract features from vibration signal, based on visual words representation. Specifically, a time-frequency image of vibration signal is obtained through wavelet transform, which is then used to extract "visual word" features for recognizing fault related patterns. The extracted features are subsequently fed into sparse representation-based classifier for classification. Evaluation using experimental bearing data confirmed the effectiveness of the developed method with a classification accuracy of 99.7%. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Towards health monitoring of hybrid ceramic bearings in aircraft starter/generators	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN THROUGH-LIFE ENGINEERING SERVICES	Procedia Manufacturing		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference in Through-Life Engineering Services (TESConf)	NOV 07-08, 2017	Univ Bremen, Bremen, GERMANY		Univ Bremen	healh management; data-fusion; hybrid bearings; starters; generators; diagnosis	SILICON-NITRIDE; MOTORS; SIGNAL	On-board electrical power demands in modem aircraft are substantially increasing. Scaling-up the size of the current starter/generators to provide the additional power requirements inevitably increases their mass. Instead, aircraft electrical designers are considering to increase the rotational speed of these machines. This imposes severe loading demands in the current starter/generator bearings. Hybrid bearings offer the most potential to deal with these demands. However, not much is known about their wear behavior in this new application. Our research is assessing the degradation of hybrid ceramic bearings in the newest generation of starter/generators for condition monitoring and health management. This paper discusses bearing degradation as foundation for the definition of relevant health condition assessment and decision making approach, and the integration of a monitoring system into a prototype test bearing to be used for data generation and algorithm validation. Initial results indicate this approach can effectively diagnose bearings faults. Validation was conducted by using repository data. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A new simulation tool has been developed using the well-known ISO 281 standard as a reference. This new tool improves the accuracy of the estimations in two fields: model-based and feature based prognostics. On the one hand, the tool is able to provide accurate end-of-life estimations thanks to the determination of accurate component loads for a defined manufacturing cycle. In addition, this new tool is able to be embedded in monitoring devices in order to use real machine tool usage data and calculate Remaining Useful Life of the analysed component. This last application can be combined with vibration monitoring of the bearing in order to detect unexpected component degradation. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This paper compares the performance of three classifiers (namely linear support vector machine (SVM), distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor (WKNN), and decision tree (DT) using data from optimized and non-optimized sensor set solutions. The algorithms are trained with known data and then tested with unknown data for different scenarios characterizing faults with different degrees of severity. This investigation is based solely on a data-driven approach and relies on data sets that are taken from experiments on the fuel system. The system that is used throughout this study is a typical fuel delivery system consisting of standard components such as a filter, pump, valve, nozzle, pipes, and two tanks. Running representative tests on a fuel system are problematic because of the time, cost, and reproduction constraints involved in capturing any significant degradation.

One interesting way is to anticipate deviation of part quality rather than to suffer it. These deviations result from machine performance, process parameters and part material. The two last items are well mastered, and only the machine performance is not completely under control due to the degradation of its components and their evolution. A challenge is to follow machine degradation in order to anticipate product quality deviations. This originality is integrated in the scope of predictive maintenance. However, the relationship between machine monitoring and product requirements is not yet well founded within this strategy. To face this challenge, the paper proposes an innovative approach based on machine degradation monitoring to anticipate part quality deviation from the consideration of joint product-process-machine requirements. The feasibility and interest of the approach are shown on the case of machining tool GROB BZ560 located in RENAULT Cleon Factory. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

OPERATIONAL DATA TO MAINTENANCE OPTIMIZATION: CLOSING THE LOOP IN OFFSHORE WIND O&M	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 1ST INTERNATIONAL OFFSHORE WIND TECHNICAL CONFERENCE, 2018			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Offshore Wind Technical Conference	NOV 04-07, 2018	San Francisco, CA	ASME, Ocean Offshore & Arctic Engn Div			FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; GEARBOX; VIBRATION; MODEL	Offshore wind assets have reached multi-GW scale and additional capacity is being installed and developed. To achieve demanding cost of energy targets, awarded by competitive auctions, the operation and maintenance (O&M) of these assets has to become increasingly efficient, whilst ensuring compliance and effectiveness. Existing offshore wind farm assets generate a significant amount of inhomogeneous data related to O&M processes. These data contain rich information about the condition of the assets, which is rarely fully utilized by the operators and service providers. Academic and industrial research and development efforts have led to a suite of tools trying to apply sensor data and build machine learning models to diagnose, trend and predict component failures. This study presents a decision support framework incorporating a range of different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The aim is to provide guidance for asset owners on how to select the most relevant datasets, apply and choose the different machine learning algorithms and how to integrate the data stream with daily maintenance procedures. The presented methodology is tested on a real case example of an offshore wind turbine gearbox replacement at Teesside offshore wind farm. The study uses k-nearest neighbour (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to detect the fault using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data and an autoregressive model for the vibration data of the condition monitoring system (CMS). The implementation of all the algorithms has resulted in an accuracy higher than 94%. The results of this paper will be of interest to offshore wind farm developers and operators to streamline and optimize their O&M planning activities for their assets and reduce the associated costs.

Many recent studies have proved that radiomics can offer a lot of useful information that physicians cannot extract from the medical images and can be associated with other information like gene or protein data. However, most of the classification studies in radiomics report the use of feature selection methods without identifying the machine learning challenges behind radiomics. In this paper, we first show that the radiomics problem should be viewed as an high dimensional, low sample size, multi view learning problem, then we compare different solutions proposed in multi view learning for classifying radiomics data. Our experiments, conducted on several real world multi view datasets, show that the intermediate integration methods work significantly better than filter and embedded feature selection methods commonly used in radiomics.

At the same time, the demand for fast and robust algorithms for the analysis of the data acquired by drones during the inspections has increased. In this paper we provide a concise survey about a peculiar case study: the monitoring of the high-voltage power grid which includes: (i) the detection of the power lines and of the electric towers along with their components more subject to wear and tear; (ii) the diagnosis of maintenance status. In this work different algorithms from image processing are applied to visible and infrared thermal data, to track the power lines and to detect faults and anomalies. We applied Canny edge detection to identify significant transition followed by Hough transform to highlight power lines. The method significantly identify edges from the set of frames with good accuracy.

The method consists in managing the parameters of the system of main-tenance, repair and operating (MRO) and inventory and logistics support (ILS) by analyzing the data of integrated control systems in a real-time environment on the basis of logical and probabilistic model of IRS reliability. For this purpose, it is necessary to solve the task of maximizing the reliability parameters when limiting the value of no-failure operation probability and the total cost of MNT and SPTA. Such adaptive approach to MNT suggests that the technical condition of the product is continuously analyzed on the real time basis by using an integrated control on all admitting nodes. Similarly, an optimal set of SPTA is calculated depending on the current and forecasted values of the technical condition of the system. Within the framework of the proposed adaptive MNT the integrated control should be used on all the nodes where it is possible, and the data on the technical condition are transferred to the server where the optimization task is performed, including forecasting by machine learning methods.

Dielectric strength of an electrical apparatus should be tested when received from manufacturers to ensure conformity with the manufacturer specification. Thereafter, maintenance tests help track health and identify potential failures. This paper introduces a new concept developed for high voltage test in electrical apparatus used in railway system which supports predictive maintenance. This device conducts insulation test between contacts and ground, whereby contacts must withstand the test voltage for a specified time also test several apparatuses at the same time thus improving efficiency in the maintenance sector. The device is connected to a 220 voltage power source and using automatic voltage regulator high voltage of up to 3kV is achieved. The actuality of this study to confirm the correct functioning of the apparatus and enable data collection for the dielectric strength status of the apparatus, whereby the collected data will aid in scheduling diagnostic and repair work thus reducing downtime from unexpected failures. Increase safety and efficiency of the machines by eliminating voltage leakages & the need to conduct qualitative tests for a number of machines in the shortest time possible.

The overburden above the tunnel pipe is between 2 m to 18 m thick. The rock mass along the tunnel route is made up of karst deposits (transient carbonate breccia, dolomite and limestone interlinked with rudist limestones). Extensive geotechnical instrumentation was installed in the tunnel by researchers at the faculty of Civil Engineering at the University of Zagreb. This consisted of: measurements in the tunnel area from the ground surface using inclinometers for horizontal, and sliding micrometers for vertical soil displacements, measuring displacements around underground openings using sliding micrometers supplemented with scanning of the tunnel interior using laser scanners, and measuring the stress and deformations in elements of support complex by pressure cells and measuring anchors. Data collected during construction and in the twelve years in which the three-lane highway tunnel has been operational, presented in this paper reveal that deformations and stresses in Bobova tunnel have continued to increase with time. The possible role of the shotcrete lining, rock creep and rock-bolt corrosion in the ongoing deformations are discussed. The application of continuous monitoring data from instruments as inputs for numerical model training using a machine learning model, with the objective to improve the predictions of existing probabilistic failure models is considered. The ultimate aim of this work is to develop improved predictive maintenance plans.

Ensemble diversity is achieved by training multiple prognostic models using different learning algorithms. The combination of the outcomes of the models in the ensemble is based on a weighted averaging strategy, which assigns weights proportional to the individual model performances on patterns of a validation set. The proposed heterogeneous ensemble has been applied to real condition monitoring knife data. It has provided more accurate RUL predictions compared to those of each individual base model.

Optimal prognostic maintenance policy for railway track systems using rolling contact fatigue data	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				Railway tracks are one of the most important assets in rail transport that are subject to very high stresses and have to be made of very high-quality steel alloy. The dominant form of track degradation is Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) which occurs mainly due to cyclic loading. If RCF is not controlled by maintenance operations, it will result in intensive correction works, service disruption, and even train derailment. In order to reduce such negative consequences and improve the quality of transport services, the railway organizations are moving towards using prognostic analytics approaches for the optimisation of maintenance and repair actions. In this paper, we investigate a cost-optimal prognostic maintenance policy for a railway track system by incorporating RCF data. The mechanism of RCF is analyzed by means of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and the fatigue propagation behavior is described by the Paris-Erdogan power law function. The length of the cracks over time is also modelled by a stochastic gamma process and its parameters are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE method. An optimization model is proposed to determine fixed time interval and/or Million Gross Tons (MGT) achieving the best possible balance between non-destructive tests and emergency maintenance. The proposed model is applied to support the maintenance decision-making for a conventional rail track system 60E1 in steel grade R350111. The results show that the use of the proposed prognostic maintenance allows a significant reduction of the costs compared to the strategy when maintenance is conducted on an as-needed basis.

Maintenance costs associated with these systems represent a significant percentage of the total operational expenditure incurred by an Oil & Gas operator. Traditional reactive maintenance approaches applied on subsea equipment are starting to drop in their efficiency as degradation occurs on such systems resulting in prolonged downtime periods. Prognostics and Health Management is a relatively new topic and other industry sectors have demonstrated that it can provide a solution for reducing maintenance costs and improving systems' overall availability.

A particle filtering approach for temperature based prognostics	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				Rubber-metal-elements are used in a wide range of applications for vibration and sound isolation. Nowadays it is state of the art to calculate the lifetimes of these elements under mechanical stress prior to their service life. To establish more reliable and safer rubber-metal-elements, continuous monitoring by different sensors can be used. Especially prognostics enable a rise in reliability, availability and safety. To establish these advantages, estimating the remaining useful lifetime of rubber-metal-elements should be realized during its service life based on current information on its condition. Therefore a suitable measure to monitor the condition of the clement is necessary. This work focuses on temperature signals. This approach allows including the ambient temperature and thereby involving changing operating conditions. For estimating the RUE of rubber-metal-elements a model-based prognostics approach based on particle filtering is proposed. Its performance is analyzed regarding relevant parameters to enable the best performance for the applied data.

Prognostic and health management for safety barriers in infrastructures: Opportunities and challenges	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			INSTRUMENTED SYSTEMS; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; HYBRID PROGNOSTICS; METHODOLOGY; DESIGN	Different types of safety barriers are deployed in many infrastructures to reduce the occurrences of hazards, and protect people, environment and other assets in case the unexpected events have occurred and the capacity of these barriers against hazards can be weakened by degradations or the failures related to changes over lime. It is natural to adapt the approaches of Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) to monitor the conditions and measurable parameters of safety harriers, and predict their future performance by assessing the extent of degradations. This study aims to identify the uniqueness and possible challenges when implementing PHM on safety barriers. Definitions and classifications of safety barriers will be discussed with considering their installation environment in infrastructures, in order to reveal what kind of characteristics of harriers can lead to higher demand on prognosis and heath monitoring. Another objective of this paper is to review the qualitative and quantitative measures for the capacity and performance of safety harriers, and to explore the possible methods and research gaps in the assessments for different PHM strategies, taking account their effects on safety barriers, and effects on the infrastructures being protected by the barriers.

A deep variational auto-encoder based dimensionality reduction for fault diagnosis in ball bearings	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				One of the main challenges faced by the industry in the context of failure diagnosis is the high quantity and high dimensionality of the available data. Due to the increasing capability and availability of sensing technology, nowadays it is possible to acquire a large amount. of (unlabeled) data on many operational and maintenance related variables from monitored machines. The problem lies on how to extract useful intbrmation from such data. A standard approach in fault diagnosis is to first apply a dimensionality reduction method. In this paper, we propose a method for dimensionality reduction based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). VAEs have shown good results in areas such as image processing, image generation and speech processing. In particular, in this paper, the-VAE based method works on spectrograms generated from vibration signals measured during system's operation. This approach is applied to the fault diagnosis of ball-bearings.	[San Martin, G.

The class of life time distributions with a mean residual life linear in time: Application to prognostics and health management	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) elicits increasing interest in view of its potential economic impact both through service-affecting failure avoidance and maintenance cost reduction. One of the key challenges in the PHM discipline is the estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL), i.e. the time remaining until failure in the absence of maintenance. The expectation of RUL, Mean Residual Life (MRL), has long been studied by reliability engineers, dating back to the nineteen sixties. There is a one-to-one relationship between MRL, reliability function and failure rate (also called hazard rate): each one of three functions uniquely determines the other two. Usually, MRL varies with time. We study here a special class of life-time distributions characterized by the fact that their MRL is a linear, non increasing function of time, and highlight the central role of the time derivative of the MRL, called ageing rate, for PHM; and then generalize to piecewise-linear MRL.

Applying Mahalanobis-Taguchi method to detect faults in rotating machinery	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			SYSTEM	Monitoring systems 1)AT rotating machines has been largely used in industry even with the high reliability achieved in turbines and compressors. These systems can reduce the number of non-scheduled shutdowns and time for the scheduled ones. In this way, it remains a challenge for researchers and industry to develop better monitoring, diagnosis and prognostic techniques. These systems generally use multiple sensors to analyze the machine behavior, so the Mahalanobis-Taguchi strategy (NITS), which is recognized for its suitability for multivariate data analysis, was applied in order to integrate these sensors. Also, in order to compare and validate NITS results, a more classic approach, based in vibration analysis is also considered. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to present some initial results in the unbalance estimation in rotating machines using this method. A centrifugal compressor used in an off-shore unit is selected for application. Actual data and computational simulations were used to validate the method and to provide the unbalance estimation of the selected machine.	[Souza, G. F. M.; Melo, I. S.; Michalski, M. A.

Acoustic emission based fault diagnosis via a novel deep convolutional neural network method	SAFETY AND RELIABILITY - SAFE SOCIETIES IN A CHANGING WORLD			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)	JUN 17-21, 2018	Trondheim, NORWAY	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc				Acoustic Emission (AE) has seen increased popularity in applications involving machine condition monitoring. AE applications usually involve higher sampling rate than vibration signals, not rare reaching 2 MHz. One of the main challenges involving AE based fault diagnosis is the need of preprocessing massive amounts of data generated by this technique, including engineering of appropriate features and dimensionality reduction so to be able to handle such massive datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to handle raw AE signals for diagnosis of a system's health states. This method is flexible enough to not only handle the massive amount of AE data, but also to provide the means for automatic feature extraction by applying various filters to the raw AE signals, and thus identifying relevant frequencies related to different faults. The proposed CNN method is applied to fatigue crack detection on blades of an experimental rotor.

J	Gai, JB; Hu, YF				Gai, Jingbo; Hu, Yifan			Research on Fault Diagnosis Based on Singular Value Decomposition and Fuzzy Neural Network	SHOCK AND VIBRATION			English	Article							EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; MACHINE	A method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and fuzzy neural network (FNN) was proposed to extract and diagnose the fault features of diesel engine crankshaft bearings efficiently and accurately. Firstly, vibration signals of crankshaft bearings in known state under the same working condition were decomposed by EMD to obtain the modal components containing fault-feature information. Then, the singular values of modal components which include the main fault features were used as the initial vector matrix, where the eigenvectors were decomposed to form a fault characteristic matrix. At last, the fault features matrix was trained by the fuzzy neural network, in order to realize the diagnosis and identification of the crankshaft bearings in different states in the form of numerical values. The experiment showed that the numerical identification of the fuzzy neural network based on the singular value had high fault diagnosis accuracy and stability. This method can also reflect the gradual change of the crankshaft bearings' fault to some extent, so it has the desired reliability and value.

In this context, testers often want to generate a checking sequence, i.e., a unique sequence of inputs satisfying a chosen test criterion. This paper proposes a method for generating a checking sequence with complete fault coverage for a given fault model of reactive systems. The systems are represented with an extension of Finite State Machines (FSMs) with symbolic inputs and outputs which are predicates on input and output variables having possibly infinite domains. In our setting, a checking sequence is made up of symbolic inputs and the fault domain can represent complex faults. The method consists in building and solving Boolean expressions to iteratively refine and extend a sequence of symbolic inputs. We evaluate the efficiency of the approach with a prototype tool we have developed.

These changes are massively manifested in manufacturing factories, power engineering, transport, military etc. We are experiencing a phenomenon that automatic systems are more difficult to control but also more sensitive to disturbances and damage. There is a clear requirement to increase their reliability, optimal predictive maintenance, and on-board diagnostics without need of disassembly. Automated system failures can increase the risk for operators, carriers, and environmental risks in the chemical, nuclear or process industries. Failures in automated manufacturing are usually expensive for manufacturers and suppliers. Mechanical malfunctions of moving parts, friction elements, wear and seizure are one of the main reasons for a shutdown. The article deals with the role of tribology in the wider context of reliability engineering, using the theory and experience of the practice of tribology, tribodiagnostics and maintenance. These are the methods that are usable to maintain inherent reliability, or to increase the reliability of newly designed products, machines, equipment, etc.	[Stodola, J.] Univ Def Brno, Kounicova Sh 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic; [Stodola, J.] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska Str 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia		Stodola, J (corresponding author), Univ Def Brno, Kounicova Sh 65, Brno 66210, Czech Republic.; Stodola, J (corresponding author), Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Studentska Str 2, Trencin 91150, Slovakia.	jiri.stodola@unob.cz	Stodola, Jiri/ABG-1798-2020	Stodola, Jiri/0000-0001-8846-5731	project MOBAUT, University of Defense Brno, Czech Republic	Presented work has been prepared with support of the project MOBAUT, University of Defense Brno, Czech Republic	Bieresaw G., 2008, SURFACES TRIBOLOGY; Bowden F.P., FRICTION LUBRICATION; BRISCOE HM, 1990, TRIBOL INT, V23, P67, DOI 10.1016/0301-679X(90)90040-V; Hamatrock J.B., 2004, FUNDAMENTALS FLUID F; Holmberg K., 2000, 9 NORD S TRIB NORDTR, V3, p787 ; Janicek P., 2007, SYSTEMIC CONCEPTIO 2; Janicek P., 2007, SYSTEMIC CONCEPTION; Khonsari M., 2001, APPL TRIBOLOGY BEARN; Muller G., 2006, CERAMICS PROCESSING; Novotny DR, 2017, IEEE C ANTENNA MEAS, P1, DOI 10.1109/CAMA.2017.8273367; Rausland M., 2004, SYSTEM RELIABILITY T; Takadum J., 2007, MAT SURFACE ENG TRIB; Werner BT, 1999, SCIENCE, V284, P102, DOI 10.1126/science.284.5411.102	13	0	0	1	2	KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS	KAUNAS	K DONELAICIO 73, KAUNAS LT 3006, LITHUANIA	1822-296X			TRANSP MEANS			2018							78	83					6	Transportation Science & Technology	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Transportation	BQ1HR	WOS:000576604500013					2022-02-14

While a great amount of research has gone towards building these systems, security in the form of resilient and fault-tolerant communications for smart grid systems is still immature. In this paper, we propose a hybrid, distributed and decentralized (HDD) SDN architecture for resilient Smart Systems. It provides a redundant controller design for fault-tolerance and fail-over operation, as well as parallel execution of multiple anomaly detection algorithms. Using the k-means clustering algorithm from the machine learning literature, it is shown that k-means can be used to produce a high accuracy (96.9%) of identifying anomalies within normal traffic. Furthermore, incremental k-means produces a slightly lower accuracy (95.6%) but demonstrated an increased speed with respect to k-means and fewer CPU and memory resources needed, indicating a possibility for scaling the system to much larger networks.

To produce devices for eld application it is necessary to obtain PF equipment able to operate for a long period of time. Thus, a reliability analysis is indispensable. In this work a reliability analysis program for plasma focus devices is presented. The program considers a criticality analysis using Failure Modes and Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA) to identify the most important failure modes of the system. Said failure modes are studied operating the Plasma Focus for many cycles, obtaining from them the characteristic curves of V (t) and I(t). Feature Extraction (FE) techniques are applied to obtain a list of parameters that correlate to the degrading process. Furthermore, Machine Learning tools are used to learn from the obtained data, linking the changes in these parameters during its life cycle to the decay of the system in hope for future implementation of a predictive maintenance system and a reference for data analysis and prediction in PFs.

First, an anomaly index is introduced and defined to measure the anomaly degree of samples. Then By improving the form of constraint condition, a single slack factor multiple kernel support vector machine probability density estimation model is presented. As a result, the scale of object function and the solution number are all reduced, and the computational efficiency of the presented model is greatly enhanced. On the other hand, as the introduction of multiple kernel functions, a multiple kernel matrix with better data mapping performance is obtained, which can well solve the composite probability density estimation for uncoupled data. The simulation test shows that the presented model has higher estimation precision and speed. The experiments on complex system fault prediction also show that the system's anomaly degree can be quantitatively and accurately measured by the anomaly index gained from the prediction results, which can effectively improve the fault prediction precision and increase the prediction advances.

It uses convolutional neural network processing on complex vibration signal inputs. The system is demonstrated to learn successfully from the actions of human diagnostic experts and provide early and robust fault detection on both rotor bearing, planetary and helical stage gear box bearings from analysis of multisensor vibration patterns using only a high-level feature selection. On the basis of data from 251 actual wind turbine bearing failures, we are able to accurately quantify the fleet-wide diagnostic model performance. The analysis also explores the time dependence of the diagnostic performance, providing a detailed view of the timeliness and accuracy of the diagnostic outputs across the different architectures. Deep architectures are shown to outperform the human analyst as well as shallow-learning architectures, and the results demonstrate that when applied in a large-scale monitoring system, machine intelligence is now able to handle some of the most challenging diagnostic tasks related to wind turbines.

A feature extraction method, based on a discrete wavelet transform that is combined with an evolving neural network, is used to recognize spatial-temporal patterns of electrical current data. Different wavelet families, such as Haar, Symlet, Daubechie, Coiflet and Biorthogonal, and different decomposition levels, were investigated in order to provide the most discriminative features for fault detection. The use of an evolving neural network was shown to be a quite appropriate approach to fault detection since high impedance faults is a time-varying problem. The performance of the proposed evolving system for detecting and classifying faults was compared with those of well-established computational intelligence methods: multilayer perceptron neural network, probabilistic neural network, and support vector machine. The results showed that the proposed system is efficient and robust to changes. A classification performance in the order of 99% is exhibited by all classifiers in situations where the fault patterns do not significantly change during tests. However, a performance drop of about 13-24% is exhibited by non-evolving classifiers when fault patterns suffer from gradual or abrupt change in their behavior. The evolving system is capable, after incremental learning, of maintaining its detection and classification performance even in such situations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, S; Fang, HJ; Liu, XY				Li, Sai; Fang, Huajing; Liu, Xiaoyong			Parameter optimization of support vector regression based on sine cosine algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Support vector regression; Sine cosine algorithm; Time series prediction; Parameter optimization	MACHINES; MODEL; PREDICTION	Time series prediction is an important part of data-driven based prognostics which are mainly based on the massive sensory data with less requirement of knowing inherent system failure mechanisms. Support Vector Regression (SVR) has achieved good performance in forecasting problems of small samples and high dimensions. However, the SVR parameters have a significant influence on forecasting performance of SVR. In our current work, a novel SCA-SVR model has been presented where sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is used to select the penalty and kernel parameters in SVR, so that the generalization performance on unknown data can be improved. To validate the proposed model, the results of the SCA-SVR algorithm were compared with those of grid search and some other meta-heuristics optimization algorithms on common used benchmark datasets.

J	Cermeno, E; Perez, A; Siguenza, JA				Cermeno, Eduardo; Perez, Ana; Alberto Siguenza, Juan			Intelligent video surveillance beyond robust background modeling	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Video surveillance; Video; Intrusion detection; Global features; Machine learning; Event; Recognition	VISUAL SURVEILLANCE; GLOBAL FEATURES; TRACKING; PERFORMANCE; COMPUTATION; SUBTRACTION; SCENES	The increasing number of video surveillance cameras is challenging video control systems. Monitoring centers require tools to guide the process of supervision. Different video analysis methods have effectively met the main requirements from the industry of perimeter protection. High accuracy detection systems are able to process real time video on affordable hardware. However some problematic environments cause a massive number of false alerts. Many approaches in the literature do not consider this kind of environments while others use metrics that dilute their impact on results. An intelligent video solution for perimeter protection must select and show the cameras which are more likely witnessing a relevant event but systems based only on background modeling tend to give importance to problematic situations no matter if an intrusion is taking place or not. We propose to add a module based on machine learning and global features, bringing adaptability to the video surveillance solution, so that problematic situations can be recognized and given the right priority. Tests with thousands of hours of video show how good an intruder detector can perform but also how a simple fault in a camera can flood a monitoring center with alerts. The new proposal is able to learn and recognize events such that alerts from problematic environments can be properly handled. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a new phase current reconstruction scheme is proposed for four-phase switched reluctance motors (SRMs) by using one dc-link current sensor without voltage penalty. First, an improved converter topology is proposed, which has fewer electronic components and a more compact structure compared with the conventional asymmetrical half-bridge converter. Then, an advanced pulse injection technology is developed to obtain the phase currents. By using the proposed approach, the cost and volume of the motor drive are reduced and the reliability of the system is improved. Most importantly, the scheme proposes a promising solution to the voltage penalty problem caused by the other existing strategies, which significantly increases the sampling accuracy without the restriction of the duty cycle of injected pulse. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, three classical control schemes including angular position control, current chopping control, and voltage pulse-width modulation control are all performed in the closed-loop system.

J	Chen, YQ; Fink, O; Sansavini, G				Chen, Yann Qi; Fink, Olga; Sansavini, Giovanni			Combined Fault Location and Classification for Power Transmission Lines Fault Diagnosis With Integrated Feature Extraction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Extreme learning machine (ELM); fault diagnosis; neural networks; transmission line protection	NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEMS; PROTECTION; REGRESSION; MACHINE	Accurate and timely diagnosis of transmission line faults is key for reliable operations of power systems. Existing fault-diagnosis methods rely on expert knowledge or extensive feature extraction, which is also highly dependent on expert knowledge. Additionally, most methods for fault diagnosis of transmission lines require multiple separate subalgorithms for fault classification and location performing each function independently and sequentially. In this research, an integrated framework combining fault classification and location is proposed by applying an innovative machine-learning algorithm: the summation-wavelet extreme learning machine (SW-ELM) that integrates feature extraction in the learning process. As a further contribution, an extension of the SW-ELM, i.e., the summation-Gaussian extreme learning machine (SG-ELM), is proposed and successfully applied to transmission line fault diagnosis. SG-ELM is fully self-learning and does not require ad-hoc feature extraction, making it deployable with minimum expert subjectivity. The developed framework is applied to three transmission-line topologies without any prior parameter tuning or ad-hoc feature extraction. Evaluations on a simulated dataset show that the proposed method can diagnose faults within a single cycle, remain immune to fault resistance and inception angle variation, and deliver high accuracy for both tasks of fault diagnosis: fault type classification and fault location estimation.

Thus, it is necessary to optimize diagnostic methods; one option could be the automatic detection of patterns in 1D-II. In that respect, through recent analysis of unidimensional Immunoblot Images (1D-II), it was possible to distinguish between women with and without breast disease using as a discrimination criterion the presence of autoantibodies (bands) in their blood. However, the analysis of 1D-II is a difficult task even for an expert, generating great subjectivity and complexity in the process of interpretation. In the present study, a semi-automatic methodology for the bands' analysis contained in the 1D-II's was implemented and evaluated, the bands were extracted using digital image processing techniques. This was possible through the recognition of banding patterns represented as time series to distinguish between three classes: women with breast cancer (BC), women with benign breast pathology (BBP) and women without breast pathology (H). The classification was performed using the machine learning algorithm k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with different parameters over the time series representation. The semi-automatic method here presented was able to reduce the time, complexity and subjectivity of the image analysis with the performance metrics compared, obtaining similar percentages for both representations. With the traditional analysis, binary representation [Accuracy 72.8%, Precision 73.42% for three classes (BC, BBP and H) and Accuracy 90.91% Accuracy 92.55% Sensitivity 93.57% and Specificity 92.99% for two classes (BC and H)], versus Time series representation [Accuracy 66.4%, Precision 67.07% for three classes (BC, BBP and H) and Accuracy 86.36% Accuracy 87.31% Sensitivity 95.86% and Specificity 85.56% for two classes (BC and H)].

J	Li, K; Han, Y; Wang, T				Li, Kun; Han, Ying; Wang, Tong			A novel prediction method for down-hole working conditions of the beam pumping unit based on 8-directions chain codes and online sequential extreme learning machine	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Beam pumping unit; Working conditions prediction; Time series analysis; 8-Directions chain codes; OS-ELM; Grey interval relational degree	GREY RELATIONAL ANALYSIS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; MOMENT	In the oilfield operation, the beam pumping unit is a very important artificial lift method. As the down-hole parts work at hundred and thousand meters underground, they are hard to be found immediately when failures come out. If we can predict down-hole working conditions and master its continuous operation states in time, great improvement of the oil well production will be developed. In this paper, a novel down-hole working conditions prediction method for the beam pumping unit based on the chaos time series prediction is proposed. First, curve contour of the dynamometer card is redrawn by 8-directions chain codes, and then eight feature vectors are extracted to construct eight feature vector time series; then, the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) method is used to build the prediction model, which can realize fast updating with dynamic work condition changes; finally, the grey interval relational degree between the predicted feature vectors and feature vectors of each fault type is calculated to determine the predicted fault type.

However, it is a challenging task because there is not more information for the identification of the time-varying systems than that of the time-invariant systems. This paper presents a vector time-dependent autoregressive model and least squares support vector machine based modal parameter estimator for linear time-varying structural systems in case of output-only measurements. To reduce the computational cost, a Wendland's compactly supported radial basis function is used to achieve the sparsity of the Gram matrix. A Gamma-test-based non-parametric approach of selecting the regularization factor is adapted for the proposed estimator to replace the time-consuming n-fold cross validation. A series of numerical examples have illustrated the advantages of the proposed modal parameter estimator on the suppression of the overestimate and the short data. A laboratory experiment has further validated the proposed estimator. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Application of the wavelet packet transform to vibration signals for surface roughness monitoring in CNC turning operations	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Wavelet packet transform; Surface roughness.; Signal vibration; CNC finish turning operations	ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; TOOL WEAR; CUTTING PARAMETERS; DIMENSIONAL DEVIATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; PREDICTION SYSTEM; CHIP FORMATION; FLANK WEAR; FINISH; MALFUNCTIONS	The wavelet packet transform method decomposes a time signal into several independent time-frequency signals called packets. This enables the temporary location of transient events occurring during the monitoring of the cutting processes, which is advantageous in monitoring condition and fault diagnosis. This paper proposes the monitoring of surface roughness using a single low cost sensor that is easily implemented in numerical control machine tools in order to make on-line decisions on workpiece surface finish quality. Packet feature extraction in vibration signals was applied to correlate the sensor signals to measured surface roughness. For the successful application of the WPT method, mother wavelets, packet decomposition level, and appropriate packet selection methods should be considered, but are poorly understood aspects in the literature. In this novel contribution, forty mother wavelets, optimal decomposition level, and packet reduction methods were analysed, as well as identifying the effective frequency range providing the best packet feature extraction for monitoring surface finish. The results show that mother wavelet biorthogonal 4.4 in decomposition level L3 with the fusion of the orthogonal vibration components (a(x) + a(y) + a(z)) were the best option in the vibration signal and surface roughness correlation. The best packets were found in the medium-high frequency DDA (62509375 Hz) and high frequency ADA (9375-12500 Hz) ranges, and the feed acceleration component ay was the primary source of information. The packet reduction methods forfeited packets with relevant features to the signal, leading to poor results for the prediction of surface roughness. WPT is a robust vibration signal processing method for the monitoring of surface roughness using a single sensor without other information sources, satisfactory results were obtained in comparison to other processing methods with a low computational cost.

J	Nguyen, KTP; Fouladirad, M; Grall, A				Nguyen, Khanh T.

They not only provide information about degradation state but also could trace failure mechanisms of assets. The selection of a deterioration model that optimally fits in with health monitoring data is an important issue. It can enable a more precise asset health prognostic and help reducing operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, this paper aims to address the problem of degradation model selection including goals, procedure and evaluation criteria. Focusing on continuous degradation modeling including some currently used Levy processes, the performance of classical and prognostic criteria are discussed through numerous numerical examples. We also investigate in what circumstances which methods perform better than others.

Data-driven learning framework for associating weather conditions and wind turbine failures	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Wind turbine; Failure; Weather; Big data; Association rule mining; k-means clustering; Data mining; Machine learning; Operation & maintenance	MAINTENANCE	The need for cost effective operation and maintenance (O&M) strategies in wind farms has risen significantly with the growing wind energy sector. In order to decrease costs, current practice in wind farm O&M is switching from corrective and preventive strategies to rather predictive ones. Anticipating wind turbine (WT) failures requires sophisticated models to understand the complex WT component degradation processes and to facilitate maintenance decision making. Environmental conditions and their impact on WT reliability play a significant role in these processes and need to be investigated profoundly. This paper is presenting a framework to assess and correlate weather conditions and their effects on WT component failures. Two approaches, using (a) supervised and (b) unsupervised data mining techniques are applied to pre-process the weather and failure data. An apriori rule mining algorithm is employed subsequently, in order to obtain logical interconnections between the failure occurrences and the environmental data, for both approaches. The framework is tested using a large historical failure database of modern wind turbines. The results show the relation between environmental parameters such as relative humidity, ambient temperature, wind speed and the failures of five major WT components: gearbox, generator, frequency converter, pitch and yaw system. Additionally, the performance of each technique, associating weather conditions and WT component failures, is assessed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One possibility is to use strain sensors to infer structural integrity by comparing patterns in the strain field between the pristine and damaged conditions. In previous works, the authors have demonstrated that it is possible to detect small defects based on strain field pattern recognition by using robust machine learning techniques. They have focused on methodologies based on principal component analysis (PCA) and on the development of several unfolding and standardization techniques, which allow dealing with multiple load conditions. However, before a real implementation of this approach in engineering structures, changes in the strain field due to conditions different from damage occurrence need to be isolated. Since load conditions may vary in most engineering structures and promote significant changes in the strain field, it is necessary to implement novel techniques for uncoupling such changes from those produced by damage occurrence. A damage detection methodology based on optimal baseline selection (OBS) by means of clustering techniques is presented. The methodology includes the use of hierarchical nonlinear PCA as a nonlinear modeling technique in conjunction with Q and nonlinear-T-2 damage indices. The methodology is experimentally validated using strain measurements obtained by 32 fiber Bragg grating sensors bonded to an aluminum beam under dynamic bending loads and simultaneously submitted to variations in its pitch angle. The results demonstrated the capability of the methodology for clustering data according to 13 different load conditions (pitch angles), performing the OBS and detecting six different damages induced in a cumulative way. The proposed methodology showed a true positive rate of 100% and a false positive rate of 1.28% for a 99% of confidence.

The proposed algorithm uses dynamic features extracted by stationary wavelet transform and feeds them to a support vector machine-based decision making system. HIF occurrence is detected according to the normalized changes of the features extracted from three post disturbance data windows. To provide more security, the output of the main fault classifier is compared with the outputs of three other classifiers in a voting system for final decision making. The results of simulations of a real distribution system demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to detect a wide range of arcing faults, from a few amperes to hundreds of amperes, with high level of security against non-HIF phenomena.

J	Franchi, L; Feruglio, L; Mozzillo, R; Corpino, S				Franchi, Loris; Feruglio, Lorenzo; Mozzillo, Raffaele; Corpino, Sabrina			Model predictive and reallocation problem for CubeSat fault recovery and attitude control	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						CubeSat; Model Predictive Control; Recovery; Attitude control; Magnetic torquers fault	TOLERANT CONTROL; DIAGNOSIS; SATELLITE	In recent years, thanks to the increase of the know-how on machine-learning techniques and the advance of the computational capabilities of on-board processing, expensive computing algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control, have begun to spread in space applications even on small on-board processor. The paper presents an algorithm for an optimal fault recovery of a 3U CubeSat, developed in MathWorks Matlab & Simulink environment. This algorithm involves optimization techniques aiming at obtaining the optimal recovery solution, and involves a Model Predictive Control approach for the attitude control. The simulated system is a CubeSat in Low Earth Orbit: the attitude control is performed with three magnetic torquers and a single reaction wheel. The simulation neglects the errors in the attitude determination of the satellite, and focuses on the recovery approach and control method. The optimal recovery approach takes advantage of the properties of magnetic actuation, which gives the possibility of the redistribution of the control action when a fault occurs on a single magnetic torquer, even in absence of redundant actuators. In addition, the paper presents the results of the implementation of Model Predictive approach to control the attitude of the satellite. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein we have developed the fluorescence self-quenching assay as a convenient tool to screen the capability of a series of fluorescent probe peptides of variable lengths to bind with target collagen peptides. We have revealed that the targeting ability of probe peptides is length-dependent, and have discovered a relatively short probe peptide FAM-G(POG)(8) capable to identify the target peptide. We have further demonstrated that fluorescence self-quenching assay together with this short probe peptide can be applied to specifically detect the desired collagen fragment in complex biological media. Fluorescence self-quenching assay provides a powerful new tool to discover effective peptides for the recognition of collagen biomarkers, and it may have great potential to identify probe peptides for various protein biomarkers involved in pathological conditions.

J	Hasilova, K; Valis, D				Hasilova, Kamila; Valis, David			Non-parametric estimates of the first hitting time of Li-ion battery	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Li-ion battery; Testing; Capability; Soft failure occurrence; Kernel density estimation; Fault diagnostics	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; HEALTH ESTIMATION; ACOUSTIC-SIGNALS; MODEL; STATE; CAPACITY; PERFORMANCE; DIAGNOSTICS; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION	Requirements for stable and reliable power sources are almost inseparable part of technical specifications. In this article, we deal with monitoring the capability of Li-ion batteries. We want to determine the time period for which their function will be guaranteed in the course of operation in different operational conditions. These conditions are represented by distinct temperature levels and various discharge currents. Capability monitoring is performed experimentally and mathematically. Within the experiments a decrease in battery voltage is monitored at different ambient temperature levels and discharge currents. Then, discharge courses are modelled and simulated using Wiener processes to obtain a set of time points when the battery voltage drops below a critical value. The first hitting time, i.e., a guaranteed period of an up-state with respect both to given operating conditions and critical threshold, is assessed by non-parametric methods, namely by the kernel density estimation. The results of testing, modelling and simulation provide an interesting picture about Li-ion battery operational behaviour.

J	Han, ZY; Wang, J				Han, Zhiyan; Wang, Jian			A Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Active Example Selection	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; data drive; active learning; TEP	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MODEL	The fault diagnosis in the real world is often complicated. It is due to the fact that not all relevant fault information is available directly. In many fault diagnosis situations, it is impossible or inconvenient to find all fault information before establishing a fault diagnosis model. To deal with this issue, a method named active example selection (AES) is proposed for the fault diagnosis. AES could actively discover unseen faults and choose useful samples to improve the fault detection accuracy. AES consists of three key components: (1) a fusion model of combining the advantage of the unsupervised and supervised fault diagnosis methods, where the unsupervised fault diagnosis methods could discover unseen faults and the supervised fault diagnosis methods could provide better fault detection accuracy on seen faults, (2) an active learning algorithm to help the supervised fault diagnosis methods actively discover unseen faults and choose useful samples to improve the fault detection accuracy, and (3) an incremental learning scheme to speed up the iterative training procedure for AES. The proposed method was evaluated on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process data. The proposed method performed better on both unseen and seen faults than the stand-alone unsupervised, supervised fault diagnosis methods, their joint and referenced support vector machines based on active learning.

However, it is also the highest failure rate component in the power electronics system. In order to avoid serious failures in the electrical system, it is necessary to predict the remaining useful life of the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. With the aim to accurately predict the remaining useful life, this article presents an improved particle filter method, which can estimate the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor degradation degree by the on-resistance (Ron) changing data. This method is based on the particle filter algorithm, which is suitable for nonlinear and non-Gaussian system; at the same time, the proposed method can avoid the degeneracy phenomenon in the particle filter. First, the strong tracking Kalman filter is used as the importance function to update the particles with the latest observation in the sample process. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to introduce some new particles to guarantee the effective particle number in the resampling process. The experimental results indicate that the improved particle filter algorithm can obtain more effective remaining useful life prognostic than that of the particle filter.

In this study, dynamic phasor of the generated signals during power swing is analysed by a classical signal processing technique known as Prony. The Prony analysis is a useful technique to model a linear sum of damped complex exponential signals. In this study, a combination of the least square-based Prony analysis and Taylor expansion called as Taylor-Prony is proposed to estimate the dynamic phasor. Zeroth-order Taylor-Prony, i.e. static phasor is compared with the second-order Taylor-Prony, i.e. dynamic phasor for illustrating the dynamic phasor capability. Sinusoidal and step changes of amplitude and phase, harmonic condition, frequency tracking tests, noise infiltration and computation time are different tests which are used to validate the proposed method. First, the method is explained theoretically, and then its potential is demonstrated by simulating various numerical signals in MATLAB and measured signals during power swing from three-machine power system simulated in PSCAD.

Thus, machine learning has been adapted for machinery fault diagnosis. The quantity and quality of the input features, however, influence the fault classification performance. Feature selection plays a vital role in selecting the most representative feature subset for the machine learning algorithm. In contrast, the trade-off relationship between capability when selecting the best feature subset and computational effort is inevitable in the wrapper-based feature selection (WFS) method. This paper proposes an improved WFS technique before integration with a support vector machine (SVM) model classifier as a complete fault diagnosis system for a rolling element bearing case study. The bearing vibration dataset made available by the Case Western Reserve University Bearing Data Centre was executed using the proposed WFS and its performance has been analysed and discussed. The results reveal that the proposed WFS secures the best feature subset with a lower computational effort by eliminating the redundancy of re-evaluation. The proposed WFS has therefore been found to be capable and efficient to carry out feature selection tasks.

Targeting the nonstationary characteristics of the vibration signals of rolling element bearings, a novel approach based on dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform, improved intrinsic time-scale decomposition, and the online sequential extreme learning machine is proposed in this article for the fault recognition of rolling element bearing. First, the feature extraction method of the measured signal is presented by combining improved intrinsic time-scale decomposition with dual-tree complex wavelet packet transform as preprocessor and two-step screening processes based on the energy ratio, the vibration signal is adaptively decomposed into a set of proper rotation components; second, the matrix formed by different proper rotation components and singular value decomposition is used to obtain singular value as eigenvector; finally, singular values are input to online sequential extreme learning machine to realize the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. The effectiveness of the proposed method of fault diagnosis is demonstrated. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the fault characteristics and accurately identify the fault patterns.

While these have allowed accurate late-stage prognosis, early diagnosis is still a major challenge. Recent evidence highlights the importance of alterations in mechanical properties of single cells and their nuclei as critical drivers for the onset of cancer. We here present a method to detect subtle changes in nuclear morphometrics at single-cell resolution by combining fluorescence imaging and deep learning. This assay includes a convolutional neural net pipeline and allows us to discriminate between normal and human breast cancer cell lines (fibrocystic and metastatic states) as well as normal and cancer cells in tissue slices with high accuracy. Further, we establish the sensitivity of our pipeline by detecting subtle alterations in normal cells when subjected to small mechano-chemical perturbations that mimic tumor microenvironments. In addition, our assay provides interpretable features that could aid pathological inspections. This pipeline opens new avenues for early disease diagnostics and drug discovery.

Established clinical and genetic markers fail to fully recapitulate the clinical and biological heterogeneity of this disease. Here we report DNA methylome analysis and mutation profiling of 167 JMML samples. We identify three JMML subgroups with unique molecular and clinical characteristics. The high methylation group (HM) is characterized by somatic PTPN11 mutations and poor clinical outcome. The low methylation group is enriched for somatic NRAS and CBL mutations, as well as for Noonan patients, and has a good prognosis. The intermediate methylation group (IM) shows enrichment for monosomy 7 and somatic KRAS mutations. Hypermethylation is associated with repressed chromatin, genes regulated by RAS signaling, frequent co-occurrence of RAS pathway mutations and upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, suggesting a link between activation of the DNA methylation machinery and mutational patterns in JMML.

One of the most popular approach is signal enhancement by filtering focused on extraction of informative content at so called informative frequency band (IFB). In such approach the vibration signal first is decomposed into time-frequency representation and then the measures of impulsivity are applied to the appropriate sub-signals. Till now, kurtosis was preferred as criterion for IFB search. However, for some cases more robust criteria should be used. Jablonski proposed to calculate kurtosis from envelope spectrum, Urbanek suggested MID (Modulation Intensity Distribution), set of alternative selectors as extension of spectral kurtosis (SK) have been defined by Obuchowski. Further extension was recently proposed by Zak, namely statistics related to a-stable distribution were used as IFB indicators. This distribution is especially important in modeling data with outliers so it was reasonable to apply this approach in the considered problem. As it was shown, the a-stable based methodology for some vibration signals more clearly indicates the IFB in contrast to the classical ones. However, in case of early stage of fault development or developed fault with high level of noise the mentioned criteria (including stability index as a measure of impulsivity) may be insufficient. It is related to the fact that cyclic impulses related to damage are often hidden in the noise (even after time-frequency decomposition). In this paper we propose to apply (instead of kurtosis or stability index) the parameters of tempered stable distribution. This distribution is an extension of the cc-stable one, however, it possesses many properties of Gaussian systems. It is associated with two parameters which may indicate properly the IFB in case of poor signalto-noise ratio. In this paper we remind the approach of IFB selection based on the kurtosis and a-stable distribution and describe how to localize the information of the fault by using tempered stable approach. The real vibration signal from gearbox is analyzed in the context of presented methodology. Finally, we examine two examples of vibration signals for which the proposed approach is superior with respect to the classical methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A promising approach to meet the need for improved cancer treatment is drug repurposing. Here we highlight the potential for repurposing disulfiram (also known by the trade name Antabuse), an old alcohol-aversion drug that has been shown to be effective against diverse cancer types in preclinical studies. Our nationwide epidemiological study reveals that patients who continuously used disulfiram have a lower risk of death from cancer compared to those who stopped using the drug at their diagnosis. Moreover, we identify the ditiocarb-copper complex as the metabolite of disulfiram that is responsible for its anti-cancer effects, and provide methods to detect preferential accumulation of the complex in tumours and candidate biomarkers to analyse its effect on cells and tissues. Finally, our functional and biophysical analyses reveal the molecular target of disulfiram's tumour-suppressing effects as NPL4, an adaptor of p97 (also known as VCP) segregase, which is essential for the turnover of proteins involved in multiple regulatory and stress-response pathways in cells.

TGF-beta is pro-metastatic for malignant cancer cells. Here we report a loss-of-function screen in mice with metastasis as readout and identify OTUD1 as a metastasis-repressing factor. OTUD1-silenced cancer cells show mesenchymal and stem-cell-like characteristics. Further investigation reveals that OTUD1 directly deubiquitinates the TGF-beta pathway inhibitor SMAD7 and prevents its degradation. Moreover, OTUD1 cleaves Lysine 33-linked poly-ubiquitin chains of SMAD7 Lysine 220, which exposes the SMAD7 PY motif, enabling SMURF2 binding and subsequent T beta RI turnover at the cell surface. Importantly, OTUD1 is lost in multiple types of human cancers and loss of OTUD1 increases metastasis in intracardial xenograft and orthotopic transplantation models, and correlates with poor prognosis among breast cancer patients. High levels of OTUD1 inhibit cancer stemness and shut off metastasis. Thus, OTUD1 represses breast cancer metastasis by mitigating TGF-beta-induced pro-oncogenic responses via deubiquitination of SMAD7.

Association between preoperative peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression profiles, early postoperative organ function recovery potential and long-term survival in advanced heart failure patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; STAGE LIVER-DISEASE; INTERNATIONAL-SOCIETY; LUNG-TRANSPLANTATION; PREDICTING SURVIVAL; PRACTICE GUIDELINES; RISK SCORE; TASK-FORCE; T-CELLS	Background Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome contributes to adverse outcomes in advanced heart failure (AdHF) patients after mechanical circulatory support (MCS) implantation and is associated with aberrant leukocyte activity. We tested the hypothesis that preoperative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression profiles (GEP) can predict early postoperative improvement or non-improvement in patients undergoing MCS implantation. We believe this information may be useful in developing prognostic biomarkers. Methods & design We conducted a study with 29 patients undergoing MCS-surgery in a tertiary academic medical center from 2012 to 2014. PBMC samples were collected one day before surgery (day -1). Clinical data was collected on day -1 and day 8 postoperatively. Patients were classified by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Model of End-stage Liver Disease Except INR score (measured eight days after surgery): Group I = improving (both scores improved from day -1 to day 8, n = 17) and Group II = not improving (either one or both scores did not improve from day -1 to day 8, n = 12). RNA-sequencing was performed on purified mRNA and analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing Strand. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Mann-Whitney test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Preoperative DEGs were used to construct a support vector machine algorithm to predict Group I vs. Group II membership. Results Out of 28 MCS-surgery patients alive 8 days postoperatively, one-year survival was 88% in Group I and 27% in Group II. We identified 28 preoperative DEGs between Group I and II, with an average 93% prediction accuracy. Out of 105 DEGs identified preoperatively between year 1 survivors and non-survivors, 12 genes overlapped with the 28 predictive genes. Conclusions In AdHF patients following MCS implantation, preoperative PBMC-GEP predicts early changes in organ function scores and correlates with long-term outcomes. Therefore, gene expression lends itself to outcome prediction and warrants further studies in larger longitudinal cohorts.

J	Han, DY; Zhao, N; Shi, PM				Han, Dongying; Zhao, Na; Shi, Peiming			A new fault diagnosis method based on deep belief network and support vector machine with Teager-Kaiser energy operator for bearings	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; deep belief networks; Kaiser energy operator; support vector machine; bearing	DEMODULATION	How to improve the accuracy and algorithm efficiency of bearing fault diagnosis has been the focus and hot topic in fault diagnosis field. Deep belief network is a typical deep learning method, which can be used to form a much higher-level abstract representation and find the distributed characteristics of data. In this article, a new method of bearing fault diagnosis is proposed based on Teager-Kaiser energy operator and the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine with deep belief network. In this method, the demodulation signal is obtained using Teager-Kaiser energy operator first. And then the time and frequency statistic characteristic of the demodulation signal is analyzed. Furthermore, the deep belief network is used to extract time and frequency feature extraction. Finally, the extracted parameters are classified by particle swarm optimization-support vector machine. The experimental results show that it not only has higher accuracy but also shortens the training time greatly, and it improves the accuracy and efficiency of fault diagnosis obviously.

A high-efficiency fault diagnosis method can reduce the economic loss drastically. This paper presents a new fault diagnosis method based on relevance vector machine (RVM) to deal with the small sample data. Particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm are employed together to optimize the parameters of RVM, which strengthen the classification ability and provide strong potential in prediction fault. Then, a novel fault diagnosis method DEPSO-RVM is obtained, which has the advantages of high accuracy and low false positive rate. Furthermore, the proposed method DEPSO-RVM is accomplished with two representative test data TE process and ethylene cracking furnace process. Besides, in order to compare the performance of DEPSO-RVM, SVM, DEPSO-SVM and PSO-RVM are applied to Tennessee Eastman process and ethylene cracking furnace process as well as the basis of comparison. The results show the validity of the proposed method on TE process and ethylene cracking furnace process and give a reference on industry process. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We conducted a pan-cancer prognostic assessment and presented a multi-omic kernel machine learning method to systematically quantify the prognostic values of high-throughput genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiles individually, integratively, and in combination with clinical factors for 3,382 samples across 14 cancer types. We found that the prognostic performance varied substantially across cancer types. mRNA and miRNA expression profile frequently performed the best, followed by DNA methylation profile. Germline susceptibility variants displayed low prognostic performance consistently across cancer types. The integration of omic profiles with clinical variables can lead to substantially improved prognostic performance over the use of clinical variables alone in half of cancer types examined. Moreover, we showed that the kernel machine learning method consistently outperformed existing prognostic signatures, suggesting that including a large number of omic biomarkers may provide substantial improvement in prognostic assessment. Our study provides a comprehensive portrait of omic architecture for tumor prognosis across cancers, and highlights the prognostic value of genome-wide omic biomarker aggregation, which may facilitate refined prognostic assessment in the era of precision oncology.

Interestingly, many 1p36-positive patients failed to express KIF1B beta protein. Since altered cellular redox status has been reported to be involved in cell death and protein modification, we investigated the relationship between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and KIF1B beta. Here, we showed that wild-type KIF1B beta protein expression positively correlates with superoxide (O-2(-\)) and total ROS levels in neuroblastoma cells, unlike apoptotic loss-of-function KIF1B beta mutants. Overexpression of KIF1B beta apoptotic domain variants increases total ROS and, specifically O-2(-), whereas knockdown of endogenous KIF1B beta decreases ROS and O-2(-). Interestingly, O-2(-) increases KIF1B beta protein expression, independent of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Scavenging O-2(-) or ROS decreases KIF1B beta protein expression and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with investigational redox compound Gliotoxin increases O-2-, KIF1B beta protein expression, apoptosis and colony formation inhibition. Overall, our findings suggest that ROS and O-2(-) may be important downstream effectors of KIF1B beta- mediated apoptosis. Subsequently, O-2(-) produced may increase KIF1B beta protein expression in a positive feedback mechanism. Therefore, ROS and, specifically O-2(-), may be critical regulators of KIF1B beta- mediated apoptosis and its protein expression in neuroblastoma.

The complex envelop spectrum is adopted as a preprocessing step to reveal the impulse response within the raw vibrational signal of a given fault. A stacked autoencoder based (SAE) deep neural network (DNN) is used for feature extraction and classification of the bearing faults. It was observed, that from preprocessed signal DNN could efficiently extract more informative features. To validate the proposed scheme, dataset composed of vibrational signals from four different shaft speeds was used during the experiment. The given results justify that the proposed scheme could efficiently classify faults when tested with data possessing shaft speed fluctuations.

In fact, combined to graphical methods, pattern recognition aims to may complement. For this purpose, we have used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms combined to the Duval method. The SVM parameters have been optimized with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Inspired from IEC and IEEE, five classes namely PD, D1, D2, T1&T2, and T3 have been adopted. The combined algorithms were verified using 155 samples from IEC TC 10 and related databases. We found that KNN, SVM may complement the Duval Pentagon 1 diagnosis method.

Identification of Single and Multiple Partial Discharge Sources by Optical Method using Mathematical Morphology Aided Sparse Representation Classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article						Partial Discharge; optical method of partial discharge detection; Mathematical Morphology; Sparse Representation classification	LEVEL ARCING FAULTS; SIGNAL RECOVERY; SELECTION; SYSTEMS; FILTERS; LASSO; MODEL	Partial Discharge (PD) is one of the most critical electrical phenomena affecting the life of electrical equipment. Repetitive PD leading to arcing faults is a recurrent problem in many air insulated systems, such as high voltage air-insulated switchgears. Hence, detection and localization of PD inside such electrical equipment is necessary for early prevention of impending failure. Keeping this in mind, this paper proposes a methodology to localize single and multiple PD sources employing two recent developments in signal processing and machine learning techniques. Optical sensors have been used to record the PD data inside a cubical steel box. A cylindrical barrier has been inserted inside this box to emulate geometrical structures inside Switchgears. Mathematical Morphology aided feature extraction has been employed to extract important features from the PD signal. Sparse Representation classification has been employed to classify the extracted features and to identify the type and location of PD source. The results show that this methodology gives very high classification accuracy corresponding to both single and multiple PD sources.	[Baug, A.; Choudhury, N.

(2005), dedicated to the prediction of long-term deformations of offshore wind power plant (OWPP) foundations caused by wind and wave action. A sublayering model for shallow foundations under vertical cyclic loading and two different approaches (a sublayering model and a stiffness-degradation model) for monopile foundations subjected to horizontal cyclic loading are presented. The results of these models are compared to the solution from 2-D or 3-D finite element simulations with the original HCA model. Furthermore, the prediction is confronted with the prognosis of other engineer-oriented models proposed for OWPP foundations in the literature. Finally, a simplified procedure for the determination of the HCA material constants is briefly explained.

This study is geared towards the estimation of the reliability of lithium-ion batteries, using parametric effects determination involving uncertainty, using a multiphase decay patterned sigmoidal model, experimental data and the Weibull distribution function. The random effect model, which uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) algorithm to predict the parametric values, was found to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) to an accuracy of more than 98%. The State-of-Health (SOH) of the batteries was estimated using the Weibull distribution function, which is found to be an appropriate formulation to use.

The method uses deep learning neural network (DNN) to extract fault features automatically, and then uses support vector machine to classify diagnose faults based on extracted features. DNN consists of a stack of denoising autoencoders. Through pre-training and fine-tuning of DNN, features of input parameters can be extracted automatically. This paper uses particle swarm optimization algorithm to select the best parameters for SVM. The extracted features from multiple hidden layers of DNN are used as the input of PSO-SVM. Experimental data is derived from the data of rolling bearing test platform of West University. The results demonstrate that deep learning can automatically extract fault feature, which removes the need for manual feature selection, various signal processing technologies and diagnosis experience, and improves the efficiency of fault feature extraction. Under the condition of small sample size, combining the features of the multiple hidden layers as the input into the PSO-SVM can significantly increase the accuracy of fault diagnosis.

J	Xue, HT; Wang, M; Li, ZX; Chen, P				Xue, Hongtao; Wang, Man; Li, Zhongxing; Chen, Peng			Sequential fault detection for sealed deep groove ball bearings of in-wheel motor in variable operating conditions	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						sequential fault detection; sealed deep groove ball bearing; soft margin SVM; optimal composition of symptom parameter	WAVELET ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINERY; VIBRATION; DEFECTS	Sealed deep groove ball bearings (SDGBBs) are employed to perform the relevant duties of in-wheel motor. However, the unique construction and complex operating environment of in-wheel motor may aggravate the occurrence of SDGBB faults. Therefore, this study presents a new intelligent diagnosis method for detecting SDGBB faults of in-wheel motor. The method is constructed on the basis of optimal composition of symptom parameters (SPOC) and support vector machines (SVMs). SPOC, as the objects of a follow-on process, is proposed to obtain from symptom parameters (SPs) of multi-direction. Moreover, the optimal hyper-plane of two states is automatically obtained using soft margin SVM and SPOC, and then using multi-SVMs, the system of intelligent diagnosis is built to detect many faults and identify fault types.

However, direct measurement of the load value is difficult. Further, the original structure must be destroyed for sensor installation. To facilitate efficient and accurate monitoring of the lifting load of mine hoist, this paper presents a novel condition-monitoring method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and support vector machine (SVM) through vibration signal analysis. First, traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to analyze the vibration signal collected by an acceleration sensor, and the number of obtained intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) is employed to set the VMD mode number. Second, the obtained vibration signal is processed by the parameterized VMD, and the useful IMFs of VMD are selected through correlation analysis for feature extraction. Third, the obtained features are used to train an SVM model, and the trained SVM is used to monitor the mine-hoist lifting load. In this study, experiments on an operated mine hoist are also conducted to verify the reliability and validity of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately identify the considered lifting load conditions.

With the proposed fault diagnosis method, the vibration signal of rolling element bearing was firstly decomposed into a series of F modes by EWT, and the root mean square, kurtosis, and skewness of the F modes were computed and combined into the feature vector. According to the characteristics of kernel density estimation, a classifier based on kernel density estimation and mutual information was proposed. Then, the feature vectors were input into the KDEC for training and testing. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method can effectively identify three different operative conditions of rolling element bearings, and the accuracy rates was higher than support vector machine (SVM) classifier and back-propagation (BP) neural network classifier.

J	Sun, LL; Wu, JH; Jia, HQ; Liu, XB				Sun, Liangliang; Wu, Jianghua; Jia, Haiqi; Liu, Xuebin			Research on fault detection method for heat pump air conditioning system under cold weather	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault detection; Cold machine; Kalman filter; Statistical process control; Dynamic control	HVAC SYSTEMS; DIAGNOSIS; UNITS	Building energy consumption accounts for nearly 40% of global energy consumption, HVAC (Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning) systems are the major building energy consumers, and as one type of HVAC systems, the heat pump air conditioning system, which is more energy-efficient compared to the traditional air conditioning system, is being more widely used to save energy. However, in northern China, extreme climatic conditions increase the cooling and heating load of the heat pump air conditioning system and accelerate the aging of the equipment, and the sensor may detect drifted parameters owing to climate change. This non-linear drifted parameter increases the false alarm rate of the fault detection and the need for unnecessary troubleshooting. In order to overcome the impact of the device aging and the drifted parameter, a Kalman filter and SPC (statistical process control) fault detection method are introduced in this paper. In this method, the model parameter and its standard variance can be estimated by Kalman filter based on the gray model and the real-time data of the air conditioning system. Further, by using SPC to construct the dynamic control limits, false alarm rate is reduced. And this paper mainly focuses on the cold machine failure in the component failure and its soft fault detection. This approach has been tested on a simulation model of the "Sino-German Energy Conservation Demonstration Center" building heat pump air-conditioning system in Shenyang, China, and the results show that the Kalman filter and SPC fault detection method is simple and highly efficient with a low false alarm rate, and it can deal with the difficulties caused by the extreme environment and the non-linear influence of the parameters, and what's more, it provides a good foundation for dynamic fault diagnosis and fault prediction analysis.

The present study investigated the anti-cancer activity of simvastatin and its underlying regulatory mechanism in cultured ATC cells. Simvastatin (0-20 mu M) concentration-dependently reduced cell viability and relative colony formation. Depletions of mevalonate (MEV) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) by simvastatin induced G1 arrest and increased apoptotic cell populations at the sub-G1 phase. Adding MEV and GGpp prevented the simvastatin-inhibited cell proliferation. Immunoblotting analysis illustrated that simvastatin diminished the activation of RhoA and Rac1 protein, and this effect was prevented by pre-treatment with MEV and GGpp. Simvastatin increased the levels of p21(cip) and p27(kip) proteins and reduced the levels of hyperphosphorylated-Rb, E2F1 and CCND1 proteins. Adding GGpp abolished the simvastatin-increased levels of p27(kip) protein, and the GGpp-caused effect was abolished by Skp2 inhibition. Introduction of Cyr61 siRNA into ATC cells prevented the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced cell migration. The EGF-induced increases of Cyr61 protein expression and cell migration were prevented by simvastatin. Taken together, these results suggest that simvastatin induced ATC proliferation inhibition through the deactivation of RhoA/Rac1 protein and overexpression of p21(cip) and p27(kip), and migration inhibition through the abrogation of Cyr61 protein expression.

J	Kareem, SA; Pozos-Parra, P; Wilson, N				Kareem, Sameem Abdul; Pozos-Parra, Pilar; Wilson, Nic			An application of belief merging for the diagnosis of oral cancer	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Review						Artificial intelligence; Knowledge modelling; Decision support systems; Belief merging	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; CYP1A1; GSTM1; GENES	Machine learning employs a variety of statistical, probabilistic, fuzzy and optimization techniques that allow computers to "learn" from examples and to detect hard-to-discern patterns from large, noisy or complex datasets. This capability is well-suited to medical applications, and machine learning techniques have been frequently used in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In general, machine learning techniques usually work in two phases: training and testing. Some parameters, with regards to the underlying machine learning technique, must be tuned in the training phase in order to best "learn" from the dataset. On the other hand, belief merging operators integrate inconsistent information, which may come from different sources, into a unique consistent belief set (base). Implementations of merging operators do not require tuning any parameters apart from the number of sources and the number of topics to be merged. This research introduces a new manner to "learn" from past examples using a non parametrised technique: belief merging. The proposed method has been used for oral cancer diagnosis using a real-world medical dataset. The results allow us to affirm the possibility of training (merging) a dataset without having to tune the parameters. The best results give an accuracy of greater than 75%.

J	Jiang, XX; Li, SM				Jiang, Xingxing; Li, Shunming			Adaptive Detection on Resonance Band and Using TEO to Suppress In-Band Noise for Bearing Weak Fault Diagnosis	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Rolling element bearing; Weak fault diagnosis; EWT; fault-related component; TEO	ROLLING-ELEMENT BEARING; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; ROTATING MACHINERY; HILBERT SPECTRUM; PROGNOSTICS; SIGNALS	The collected vibration signals from the incipient faulty bearing are generally corrupted by strong background noise. The weak fault feature extraction is crucial to mechanical fault diagnosis and machine condition monitoring. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based method is one of the most powerful signal processing techniques and has been extensively studied and widely applied in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. However, they have also several outstanding problems. Considering these, a new method for bearing weak fault diagnosis is proposed in this paper. It consists of five parts. Firstly, the frequency band ranges of meaningful modes are self-adaptively determined by combining scale-space representation and empirical law. Secondly, the meaningful modes are obtained by using EWT (Empirical Wavelet Transform) to decompose the raw vibration signal, according to the determined boundaries. Thirdly, the Normalized Frequency Energy Ratio (NFER) is presented to define the fault-related components. Fourthly, Teager Energy Operator (TEO) is employed to further enhance the fault-related impulses. Lastly, the fault-related features could be observed from the time waveforms and envelope spectra of the improved modes. Two simulated bearing fault signals and a real bearing fault signal are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. As result, the proposed method delivers a better performance than that of the EMD-based demodulation method.

J	Zhao, YP; Song, FQ; Pan, YT; Li, B				Zhao, Yong-Ping; Song, Fang-Quan; Pan, Ying-Ting; Li, Bing			Retargeting extreme learning machines for classification and their applications to fault diagnosis of aircraft engine	AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Extreme learning machine; Machine learning algorithm; Fault diagnosis; Aircraft engine	LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; ONLINE	Since the original extreme learning machine (ELM) generates the hidden nodes randomly, it usually needs more hidden nodes to reach the good classification performance. However, more hidden nodes will jeopardize the real time, which limits its applications to the testing time sensitive scenarios. To this end, the commonly-used methods tend to compact its structure via optimizing the number of hidden nodes. Different from this viewpoint of network structure, in this paper two algorithms are proposed to improve the real time performance of ELM from a viewpoint of data structure. Specially, they improve the ELM classification performance by retargeting its label vectors. As thus, they need fewer hidden nodes to reach the same classification performance, which means the better real time. Finally, experimental results on the benchmark data sets validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the presented two algorithms. To be more important, they are applied to the fault diagnosis of aircraft engine and can be developed as its candidate techniques. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The proposed algorithm incorporates traditional greedy forward learning algorithm into backward learning algorithm to gain more sparsity and enhance testing time further. Compared to original KELM, the proposed method produces satisfactory performance of pattern recognition with fewer nodes, and reduces diagnostic consuming time from the tests on benchmark dataset. The DR-KELM application to aero-engine fault diagnosis also demonstrates its superior performance with more sparse structure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

First, the gathered vibration signals are decomposed by time-frequency domain method, i.e., local mean decomposition; as a result, the product functions decomposed from the original signal are derived. Then, the entropy values of the product functions are calculated by Shannon method, which will work as the input features for k-nearest neighbour model. The kernel principal component analysis model is used to reduce the dimension of the features, and then the k-nearest neighbour model which was optimized by the particle swarm optimization method is used to identify the bearing fault levels. Case of test and actually collected signal are analysed. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

An integrated generalized discriminant analysis method and chemical reaction support vector machine model (GDA-CRSVM) for bearing fault diagnosis	ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Bearing fault; Expert fault diagnosis technique; Chemical reaction support vector machine (CRSVM); Multi-aspect feature set; Generalized discriminant analysis (GDA)	CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; ENTROPY; KERNEL; PCA; LCD	An expert technique in bearing fault diagnosis is proposed for the identification of actual status. A new diagnosis method based on a two-stage hybrid modality in integrating generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) with the chemical reaction support vector machine (CRSVM) classification model, named GDA-CRSVM, is proposed. The GDA reduces high-dimensional data to a more compact data, which serves an optimized CRSVM classification model with input data, in which a support vector machine (SVM) classifier model with the best parameters are selected by the meta-heuristic chemical reaction optimization algorithm (CRO) to build an optimized CRSVM classification model. The implementation of the new proposed method is based on a multi-aspect feature (MAF) set that presents most of the actual aspects of the complex vibration signal. The MAF set is collected from the statistical features in time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency domain features are extracted by local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD). Experiments have been conducted on two bearing vibration datasets by the expert technique in the bearing fault diagnosis. Results shown that the effectiveness of GDA-CRSVM in terms of classification accuracy and execution time. (C) 2017 PEI, University of Maribor. All rights reserved.	[Nguyen, N. H.; Cheng, J.

DNA is motivated by the growing scale and complexity of cellular networks along with the lack of advanced big data analytics tools for effective network management. It abstracts the RCA process into two modules, namely rule (fingerprint) learning and the module of AD and fingerprint matching. We first develop a rare association rule mining method to learn the symptoms of network anomalies and to build a fingerprint knowledge database from the historic data. Then a statistical machine learning approach is employed to identify the anomalies within the incoming dataset collected via various probes in the network and map the fingerprints of the detected anomalies to the rules in the knowledge database. The DNA platform has been tested using the real production data from the field and has been shown to be a highly effective platform for AD and RCA for large-scale cellular systems serving tens of millions of mobile users.

Three major steps involved in the proposed FTC scheme are the detection of sensor fault, isolation of the same, and finally, the reconfiguration by proper estimation. Thirddifference operator employed in the motor line current is found suitable for the detection of the sensor fault, while flux-linkage observer-based current estimation scheme performs the task of estimation of line current post the occurrence of the fault. Furthermore, a decision-making logic circuitry isolates the faulty signal and simultaneously selects the appropriate estimated current signal to make the drive fault-tolerant. The proposed current sensor FTC scheme is simple and unique in nature. Moreover, it can be universally applied with any speed control schemes involving IM drive. The proposed scheme is simulated and extensively tested in MATLAB/ Simulink. The obtained simulation results are also verified using a dSPACE-1104-based IM drive laboratory prototype to show the effectiveness of the scheme.

J	Li, Z; Wang, Y; Wang, KS				Li, Zhe; Wang, Yi; Wang, Ke-Sheng			Intelligent predictive maintenance for fault diagnosis and prognosis in machine centers: Industry 4.0 scenario	ADVANCES IN MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Data mining (DM); Machine centers; Predictive maintenance; Industry 4.0	ERROR	Fault diagnosis and prognosis in mechanical systems have been researched and developed in the last few decades at a very rapid rate. However, owing to the high complexity of machine centers, research on improving the accuracy and reliability of fault diagnosis and prognosis via data mining remains a prominent issue in this field. This study investigates fault diagnosis and prognosis in machine centers based on data mining approaches to formulate a systematic approach and obtain knowledge for predictive maintenance in Industry 4.0 era.

J	Wang, ZL; Cui, YQ; Shi, JY				Wang, Zili; Cui, Yiqian; Shi, Junyou			A Framework of Discrete-Event Simulation Modeling for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) in Airline Industry	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Airline industry; discrete-event simulation (DES); maintenance; prognostics and health management (PHM); spare delivery	CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; LOGISTICS	Prognostics and system health management (PHM) conceptually integrates the advanced sensing and signal processing technology to predict the occurrence time of faults in the airline industry. A discrete-event logistics system (DELS) simulation model provides an effective way to evaluate overall performance by modeling the system behaviors. However, when taking PHM into account, the DELS model would be more complicated, and there lacks related research on how to establish a DELS model fulfilling PHM requirement. This paper proposes a framework of establishing such models incorporating PHM disciplines. With the prognostic horizon and remaining useful life estimation, the maintenance and logistics preparations are brought in advance, splitting the system model into two parallel lines. A combination of maintenance and logistics strategies is proposed in the dimensions of spare delivery and maintenance plan, respectively. The temporal sequential relations for the strategies are exploited, in detail, showing how the two parallel lines coordinate. The quantitative metrics for system utility, as well as the costs factors, are investigated. Finally, the framework is implemented and tested with the case of an airline network with an all-round performance evaluation for decision making.

Broken Rotor Bar Fault Detection of IM Based on the Counter-Current Braking Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENERGY CONVERSION			English	Article						Broken rotor bars; counter-current braking; spectral analysis; squirrel-cage IM	CURRENT SIGNATURE ANALYSIS; INDUCTION-MOTOR DIAGNOSIS; TRANSIENT DETECTION; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; STATOR CURRENT; LOW SLIP; MACHINES; ASYMMETRIES; HARMONICS	This paper presents an improved method for the broken rotor bar detection in a squirrel-cage induction motor (IM). The method is based on the spectral analysis of the transient stator current signal during the counter-current braking (CCB). Contrary to the classical CCB, the proposed method results in the low braking current, which is a small fraction of the rated value and serves as a broken bar detection test signal only. This kind of the broken rotor bar fault diagnosis is independent of loading conditions and can be carried out even for a free shaft motor. The existence of spectral components in the low CCB current signal indicating the faulty conditions is first proven with the generalized theory of symmetrical components. The method is then verified via simulations, using an IM model based on the finite-element analysis and the magnetically coupled multiple circuits approach. Afterward, the experiments are performed, showing a good agreement with both the theoretical prediction and the simulation results, confirming the presence of the fault-induced components in the stator current spectra.

J	Verma, NK; Sevakula, RK; Thirukovalluru, R				Verma, Nishchal Kumar; Sevakula, Rahul Kumar; Thirukovalluru, Raghuveer			Pattern Analysis Framework With Graphical Indices for Condition-Based Monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Condition-based monitoring (CBM); graphical indices; graphical indices-based feature selection (GIFS); pattern analysis framework; real-time fault detection; sensitive position identification	MUTUAL INFORMATION; NEURO-FUZZY; MACHINE; PREDICTION; PROGNOSTICS	Condition-based monitoring (CBM), with its tremendous scope in improving operational cost efficiency, has become an important component in most industrial machine maintenance frameworks. While many strategies already exist for CBM, this paper presents a novel pattern analysis framework, which focuses on improving reliability of real-time fault detection. The introduced framework is based upon a novel feature selection method, which selects good, reliable, and consistent features. Graphical indices are proposed in this paper which try and quantify the goodness of features and accordingly rank them for the feature selection procedure. The presented algorithm also takes into account the possibility of corrupt data creeping in during data collection, and takes necessary steps to discard them. Additionally, novel methods for organizing training data and a method for sensitive position identification for placing sensor(s) have also been introduced, for further improving the quality of selected features. To validate the framework, experiments have been performed on an air compressor for real-time detection of leakage inlet valve fault and leakage outlet valve fault, and also on an induction motor for detecting presence of faulty bearings. The findings clearly show substantial improvement in fault detection performance and confirm the effectiveness of proposed framework.

A Prognostic Model for Stochastic Degrading Systems With State Recovery: Application to Li-Ion Batteries	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Degradation model; prognostics; recovery; remaining useful life (RUL); semi-Markov model (SMM)	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; REAL-TIME; LITHIUM; HEALTH; DEGRADATION; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; OPERATION	Many industrial systems inevitably suffer performance degradation. Thus, predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) for such degrading systems has attracted significant attention in the prognostics community. For some systems like batteries, one commonly encountered phenomenon is that the system performance degrades with usage and recovers in storage. However, almost all of the current prognostic studies do not consider such a recovery phenomenon in stochastic degradation modeling. In this paper, we present a prognostic model for deteriorating systems experiencing a switching operating process between usage and storage, where the system degradation state recovers randomly after the storage process. The possible recovery from the current time to the predicted future failure time is incorporated in the prognosis. First, the degradation state evolution of the system is modeled through a diffusion process with piecewise but time-dependent drift coefficient functions. Under the concept of first hitting time, we derived the lifetime and RUL distributions for systems with specific constant working mode. Further, we extended the results of RUL distribution in specific constant working mode to the case of stochastic working mode, which is modeled through a flexible two-state semi-Markov model (SMM) with phase-type distributed interval times. The unknown parameters in the present model are estimated based on the observed condition monitoring data of the system, and the SMM model is identified on the basis of the operating data. A numerical study and a case study of Li-ion batteries are carried out to illustrate and demonstrate the proposed prognostic method. Experimental results indicate that the presented method can improve the accuracy of lifetime and RUL estimation for systems with state recovery.

J	Wang, D; Tsui, KL				Wang, Dong; Tsui, Kwok-Leung			Statistical Modeling of Bearing Degradation Signals	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Bayesian inference; bearing degradation; health indicator; remaining useful life (RUL); statistical modeling	RESIDUAL-LIFE DISTRIBUTIONS; PROGNOSTICS; ENTROPY; TOOL	Bearings are the most common mechanical components used in machinery to support rotating shafts. Due to harsh working conditions, bearing performance deteriorates over time. To prevent any unexpected machinery breakdowns caused by bearing failures, statistical modeling of bearing degradation signals should be immediately conducted. In this paper, given observations of a health indicator, a statistical model of bearing degradation signals is proposed to describe two distinct stages existing in bearing degradation. More specifically, statistical modeling of Stage I aims to detect the first change point caused by an early bearing defect, and then statistical modeling of Stage II aims to predict bearing remaining useful life. More importantly, an underlying assumption used in the early work of Gebraeel et al. is discovered and reported in this paper. The work of Gebraeel et al. is extended to a more general prognostic method. Simulation and experimental case studies are investigated to illustrate how the proposed model works. Comparisons with the statistical model proposed by Gebraeel et al. for bearing remaining useful life prediction are conducted to highlight the superiority of the proposed statistical model.

Infrared thermography based diagnosis of inter-turn fault and cooling system failure in three phase induction motor	INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Thermography; Induction motor; Inter-turn fault; Failure of cooling system; Condition monitoring	CONDITION MONITORING TECHNIQUES; PARKS VECTOR APPROACH; ELECTRICAL-EQUIPMENT; MACHINES; RELIABILITY	Thermography has been widely used as a technique for anomaly detection in induction motors. International Electrical Testing Association (NETA) proposed guidelines for thermographic inspection of electrical systems and rotating equipment. These guidelines help in anomaly detection and estimating its severity. However, it focus only on location of hotspot rather than diagnosing the fault. This paper addresses two such faults i.e. inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system, where both results in increase of stator temperature. Present paper proposes two thermal profile indicators using thermal analysis of IRT images. These indicators are in compliance with NETA standard. These indicators help in correctly diagnosing inter-turn fault and failure of cooling system. The work has been experimentally validated for healthy and with seeded faults scenarios of induction motors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Singh, Gurmeet; Naikan, V. N.

However, a practical diagnosis support system to be used in the field generally requires a high dregree of both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, of which efficiency, ie fast learning and identification speed, is of greater importance for online and real-time fault detection and diagnosis. Therefore, this paper develops a new intelligent fault diagnosis model based on the use of multiscale weighted permutation entropy (MWPE) and an extreme learning machine (ELM), named MWPE-ELM, which is expected to achieve fast and accurate diagnostic performance. First, MWPE is utilised to analyse vibration data and extract the hidden fault-related features over multiple temporal scales; then, an ELM is employed to identify various health conditions. Diagnostic experimental results for both bearings and gears demonstrate that the proposed MWPE-ELM model not only achieved higher recognition accuracy but also a faster computation speed than the use of back-propagation neural networks (BPNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) combined with different multiscale feature extraction approaches.

J	Teay, SH; Albarbar, A				Teay, S. H.; Albarbar, A.			Adoption of MEMS technology in e-maintenance systems for rotating machinery	INSIGHT			English	Article						intelligent sensor; e-maintenance; microcontroller; MEMS; machine learning	ACCELEROMETERS	Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based sensing networks with on-board signal processing capabilities are becoming very attractive for monitoring the condition of rotating and static equipment. Their advantages in cost and size are an important factor for deployment in a new generation of maintenance called e-maintenance. In this paper, an intelligent monitoring system for e-maintenance (IMSEM) was developed using MEMS accelerometers, a low-power microprocessor and a wireless communication module. The system has a compatible framework and interface with open system architecture for condition-based maintenance (OSA-CBM). It integrates OSA-CBM-defined functions, including a sensing module, signal processing, condition monitoring and health assessment. Thus, the developed system successfully reduced the monitoring complexity and communication overhead with human operators. The performance of IMSEM is evaluated by carrying out fault diagnostics on the rotating unbalance of a mechanical shaft driven by a direct current (DC) motor with varying load and speed. Five statistical features were calculated for 63 vibration datasets. 25 datasets were used to train a support vector machine, with a linear kernel, and the other 38 sets were used for binary classification. About 94.7% of unknown conditions were successfully classified as healthy/unhealthy based on all features, which was improved to 100% using the best three features. This has demonstrated the capability of the developed system in detecting faults and the severity of rotor unbalance, based on ISO 1940-1:2003.	[Teay, S.

Pump cavitation detection through fusion of support vector machine classifier data associated with vibration and motor current signature	INSIGHT			English	Article						centrifugal pump; cavitation; signal processing; support vector machine; data fusion		Centrifugal pumps are one of the most widely used machines in various industries and cavitation is a common fault in this type of pump. This paper presents a diagnostic method based on data fusion in order to precisely and effectively detect a cavitation fault in a pump at an early stage. An experimental test system is set up to simulate electro pump cavitation and the vibration signal and current signature of the motor-driven pump are measured for cavitation detection. In order to extract probabilistic features, each signal is analysed separately. The data are then classified using support vector machines (SVMs). Finally, a decision fusion strategy based on Bayesian theory is used to fuse all of the classifiers resulting from the vibration signal and the electrical current signal.

J	Zhao, YH; Zio, E; Fu, GC				Zhao, Youhu; Zio, Enrico; Fu, Guicui			Remaining storage life prediction for an electromagnetic relay by a particle filtering-based method	MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY			English	Article						Remaining storage life; Electromagnetic relay; Particle filtering	VARIABLE OPERATING-CONDITIONS; PROGNOSTICS; TUTORIAL; CONTACTS; WORKING; MODEL	In this paper, we propose a particle filtering-based method for predicting the remaining storage life (RSL) of electromagnetic relays. The RSL prediction problem here addressed has the following three distinctive features: i) limited measurement data available; ii) incomplete run-to-failure data; and iii) no model available for the physical degradation process. Then, to develop the method for RSL prediction, storage testing and degradation mechanism analysis have been carried out to obtain the knowledge and information needed to develop the physical model that supports the RSL prediction procedure. We discuss the three main steps of the proposed prediction method: parameter estimation, model validation and RSL prediction. Data from nine relays are used for estimating the initial parameter values distribution and data from one relay are used for RSL prediction. The RSL prediction results are compared with those obtained by a nonlinear curve-fitting method and a basic particle filtering algorithm. The comparison shows that the proposed method is more effective in predicting the RSL than the other methods. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, CX; Chen, TF; Jiang, R; Ning, LW; Jiang, Z				Wu, Chenxi; Chen, Tefang; Jiang, Rong; Ning, Liwei; Jiang, Zheng			A novel approach to wavelet selection and tree kernel construction for diagnosis of rolling element bearing fault	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING			English	Article						Continuous wavelet transform; Classification tree kernel; Support vector machine; Fuzzy pruning strategy; Tree ensemble statistical learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; ROLLER-BEARINGS; EMD METHOD; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTRUM; MODEL	A novel methodology for early diagnosis of rolling element bearing fault is employed based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and support vector machine (SVM). CWT is especially suited for analyzing non-stationary signals in time-frequency domain where time information is retained as well as frequency content. To better approximate non-stationary vibration signals from rolling element bearing, a wavelet choice criterion is established to select an appropriate mother wavelet for feature extraction. The Shannon wavelet is picked out of several considered wavelets. The classification tree kernels (CTK) are constructed to address nonlinear classification of the characteristic samples derived from the wavelet coefficients. By using Fuzzy pruning strategy, a large variety of classification trees are generated. The trees with diverse structures can effectively explore intrinsic information among samples. Then, the tree kernel matrices can be acquired through ensemble statistical learning, which eventually reveal the similarity of samples objectively and stably. Under such architecture of kernel methods, a classification tree kernel based support vector machine (CTKSVM) is proposed to identify bearing fault. The performance of the methodology involving CWT and CTKSVM (CWT-CTKSVM) is evaluated by cross validation and independent test. The results show that the CWT-CTKSVM totally is superior to other SVM methods with common kernels. Therefore, it is a prospective technique for detection and identification of rolling element bearing fault.

LAD captures the effect of the instantaneous conditions on the health state of a monitored system, while KM estimates the baseline reliability curve that reflects the effect of aging, based on the observed historical failure times. LAD is used to generate a set of patterns from the observed values of covariates that represent the operating conditions and condition indicators. A pattern selection procedure is carried out to select the set of significant patterns from all the generated patterns. A survival curve is estimated, for each subset of observations covered by each selected pattern. A weight that reflects the coverage of each pattern is assigned to its survival curve. Given a recently collected observation, the survival curve of a monitored system is updated on the basis of the patterns covering that observation. The updated curve is then used to predict the remaining useful life of the monitored system. The proposed methodology is validated using a common dataset in prognostics: the turbofan degradation dataset that is available at NASA prognostic repository.

Enhancement of machine vision systems during the time has led to higher quality images, and the use of statistical methods can help to analyze the data extracted from such images efficiently. It is not efficient from time and cost point of views to use every single pixel in an image to monitor a process or product performance effectively. In recent years, some methods are proposed to deal with image data. These methods are mainly applied for separation of nonconforming items from conforming ones, and they are rarely applied to monitor process capability or performance. In this paper, a nonparametric regression method using wavelet basis function is developed to extract features from gray scale image data. The extracted features are monitored over time to detect process out-of-control conditions using a generalized likelihood ratio control chart. The proposed approach can also be applied to find change point and fault location simultaneously. Several numerical examples are used to evaluate performance of the proposed method. Results indicate suitable performance of the proposed method in detecting out-of-control conditions and providing precise diagnostic information. Results also illustrate suitable performance of our proposed method in comparison with a competitive approach.

J	Li, YX; Shi, JM; Wang, G; Zhang, MY				Li Yongxiang; Shi Jianming; Wang Gong; Zhang Mengying			An ensemble model for engineered systems prognostics combining health index synthesis approach and particle filtering	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						failure threshold; health index synthesis approach; particle filtering; prognostics; remaining useful life	REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION	Prognostics, in other words, remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is a core task of prognostics and health management (PHM). Reliable RUL predictions can reduce maintenance costs, improve production efficiency, and avoid unexpected downtime. Lots of models for RUL predictions have been proposed; however, noise and the nonlinear nature of degradation phenomena often leads to poor prognostics results, and the acquired engineered system data are usually subject to a high level of uncertainty. This makes the RUL estimation models less than satisfactory. Accurate RUL estimation and prediction not only rely on an accurate model but also depend on the adjustments of model parameters to track the variation. In this paper, an ensemble model combining the health index synthesis (HIS) approach and improved particle filtering (PF) is introduced. HIS approach was used to obtain the synthesized health index (SHI) for an engineered system with multiple sensors, which indicated the system's degradation model, while the improved PF approach was used to adjust the parameters of the degradation model obtained from the HIS approach and optimized the RUL estimation results. The performance of the prognostics approach introduced in this paper was demonstrated by using turbofan engine degradation data sets, which was supplied by NASA Ames, and results were compared with several usually used methods.

The paperanalyzes the impact sensitivity of parameters consistency including capacity, internal resistance and state of charge (SOC) on energy utilization efficiency of the battery pack. It turns out that SOC variations is the most significant influence on battery consistency, and hence is employed as evaluation index to characterize battery consistency level. Then the SOC evolution is explored under four scenarios, and the result reflects that the columbic efficiency is associated with prominent accumulative effect on SOC divergence of the battery group in use. The OCV consistency model is established based on long-term battery data of two trolley buses. It is observed that the fitted results match with the operational data very well. Finally, the mapping relation between the OCV distribution and the SOC distribution of the battery pack using dichotomy method is proposed. The calculation error of battery pack energy utilization efficiency by using such method is within 1.5%, which can be used for battery equilibrium diagnosis and prognosis at a certain aging state.

Soft computing is a better alternate to predict and optimize the manufacturing processes related to physics-based models as these processes are complex and precarious. The theories of artificial neural systems, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization are utilized by soft computing techniques to handle real-world issues that cannot be palatably handled utilizing conventional computing methods. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review on the recent developments in the use of soft computing in condition-based maintenance in manufacturing.	[Goyal, Deepam; Pabla, B. S.; Dhami, S.

J	Cui, J; Shi, G; Gong, CY				Cui, Jiang; Shi, Ge; Gong, Chunying			A FAST CLASSIFICATION METHOD OF FAULTS IN POWER ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS BASED ON SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	METROLOGY AND MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						power electronics; fault diagnosis; wavelet transforms; support vector machines; directed acyclic graph; nearest neighbours	INDUCTION-MOTOR DRIVES; NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS; INVERTER; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	Fault detection and location are important and front-end tasks in assuring the reliability of power electronic circuits. In essence, both tasks can be considered as the classification problem. This paper presents a fast fault classification method for power electronic circuits by using the support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier and the wavelet transform as a feature extraction technique. Using one-against-rest SVM and one-against-one SVM are two general approaches to fault classification in power electronic circuits. However, these methods have a high computational complexity, therefore in this design we employ a directed acyclic graph (DAG) SVM to implement the fault classification. The DAG SVM is close to the one-against-one SVM regarding its classification performance, but it is much faster. Moreover, in the presented approach, the DAG SVM is improved by introducing the method of K-nearest neighbours to reduce some computations, so that the classification time can be further reduced.

The system dynamic model of the transmitting system is considered in detail. The tooth contact analysis results are obtained through calculation and the dynamic model with time-varying stiffness, and backlash for both gear pair is built. The natural frequencies, mode shapes, and critical speed for the transmitting system with gyroscopic effects are calculated. The results show that the whirling motion due to the second shaft may be the main factor of vibration for the transmitting system and the lateral-torsional-axial vibration dominate the overall system vibration. Many critical characteristics cannot be represented in the transmission error, especially when the rocking and other freedoms are considered in the gear transmitting system. The rocking motion will be excited due to the coupled effect of bevel gear pair, which may be also the reason for the catastrophic damage of the thin web spur gear.

J	Zhang, DC; Yu, DJ; Li, X				Zhang, Dingcheng; Yu, Dejie; Li, Xing			Optimal resonance-based signal sparse decomposition and its application to fault diagnosis of rotating machinery	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Resonance-based signal sparse decomposition; genetic algorithm; rotating machinery; fault diagnosis	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FACTOR WAVELET TRANSFORM; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; GEARBOX; HILBERT; VIBRATION; DEMODULATION; BEARINGS	The fault diagnosis of rotating machinery is quite important for the security and reliability of the overall mechanical equipment. As the main components in rotating machinery, the gear and the bearing are the most vulnerable to faults. In actual working conditions, there are two common types of faults in rotating machinery: the single fault and the compound fault. However, both of them are difficult to detect in the incipient stage because the weak fault characteristic signals are usually submerged by strong background noise, thus increasing the difficulty of the weak fault feature extraction. In this paper, a novel decomposition method, optimal resonance-based signal spares decomposition, is applied for the detection of those two types of faults in the rotating machinery. This method is based on the resonance-based signal spares decomposition, which can nonlinearly decompose vibration signals of rotating machinery into the high and the low resonance components. To extract the weak fault characteristic signals in the presence of strong noise effectively, the genetic algorithm is used to obtain the optimal decomposition parameters. Then, the optimal high and low resonance components, which include the fault characteristic signals of rotating machinery, can be obtained by using the resonance-based signal spares decomposition method with the optimal decomposition parameters. Finally, the high and the low resonance components are subject to the Hilbert transform demodulation analysis; the faults of rotating machinery can be diagnosed based on the obtained envelop spectra. The optimal resonance-based signal spares decomposition method is successfully applied to the analysis of the simulation and experiment vibration signals. The analysis results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully extract the fault features in rotating machinery.

Earlier attempts report use of search coil for the detection of transformer interturn fault. This paper extends application of search coil for detection of winding displacement in addition to interturn fault identification. Experimental results based on specially designed 10-kVA transformer are presented to analyze search coil voltages during healthy and faulty conditions. The algorithm detects phase (U, V, W), side (LV, HV), and precise location of the fault. Discrimination between interturn fault and winding radial displacement is also achieved by search coil voltage analysis. The results are experimentally verified based on impedance analyzer plots. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method is independent of load on the transformer, vector group, nature of winding, balanced or unbalanced source voltage, source voltage harmonics, inrush, and overexcitation conditions.

Influenced by the complex structure of the hydraulic pump and the limited experiment standards, it is hard to establish an appropriate performance degradation model. To fulfill current requirements, a method for establishing the performance degradation model based on accelerated experiment is proposed. In order to describe the general trend of the degradation, the double-stress exponential model is firstly established as the theoretical degradation model. On this basement, combined with the characteristics of the experiment, the accelerating coefficient is settled; meanwhile, the procedures for assuring the model parameters are presented. Furthermore, based on the accelerated experiment of the hydraulic pump under various stresses, the performance degradation model is finally established. Result of the experimental analysis indicates that the proposed method is applicable and the presented model is effective to measure the performance degradation of pump.

J	Chen, RX; Chen, SY; He, M; He, D; Tang, BP				Chen, Renxiang; Chen, Siyang; He, Miao; He, David; Tang, Baoping			Rolling bearing fault severity identification using deep sparse auto-encoder network with noise added sample expansion	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						Rolling bearing; fault severity identification; deep learning; sparse auto-encoder; noise added samples	DIAGNOSIS; RECOGNITION; AUTOENCODERS; MACHINERY; ENTROPY	This article presents a rolling bearing fault severity identification methodology that aims to adaptively extract fault severity features and intelligently identify the fault severity. The presented method is developed based on a deep sparse auto-encoder network trained with noise added sample expansion. A sparse auto-encoder is a learning algorithm that is capable of performing unsupervised learning of the inner structure and characters of source data. However, even though the original shallow structure of the sparse auto-encoders is capable of extracting the features, they do not have the capability for fault and severity classification. By stacking multiple sparse auto-encoders with a classifier layer, a deep sparse auto-encoder network with the ability of fault severity feature extraction and intelligent severity identification can be obtained. After unsupervised layer-wise self-learning and supervised fine-tuning, the designed deep sparse auto-encoder network can perform severity identification with automatically extracted fault features. Also, to overcome the issue of overfitting caused by limited number of training samples and stacked structure with numerous neurons and layers in a deep sparse auto-encoder network, Gaussian noises are added into the training samples to train the deep sparse auto-encoder network. Using deep sparse auto-encoder network for rolling bearing fault severity identification, the overfitting phenomenon can be retrained to increase the robustness of the network. The performance of the presented method is validated using bearing fault datasets that contain different levels of bearing severity and bearing life stages and compared with other methods. In comparison with recent solutions developed using deep learning approaches, the advantages of the presented method are that it does not require any pre-processing of the vibration data and provides a more robust diagnostic performance.

Previous studies on reliability modeling for manufacturing system could only provide a static reliability model based on the basic reliability of the components of manufacturing systems, which cannot support reliability-oriented production scheduling and preventive maintenance effectively. To resolve this dilemma, a multi-state-oriented mission reliability modeling for multi-station manufacturing system is proposed. First, the mapping relationship between the produced product reliability and mission reliability of the manufacturing system is proposed as the basis for modeling, and the connotation of mission reliability is elaborated by analyzing the polymorphisms of the multi-station manufacturing system. Second, a graphical representation to improve the state transparency named as Quality State Task Network is proposed based on production data by integrating the variability of task-demands propagation as well as the multi-state in material quality and machine performance. Third, the mission reliability modeling method based on the Quality State Task Network is proposed. Finally, a case study of cylinder-head manufacturing system has been applied to validate the proposed model.

J	Xu, C; Chakraborty, S				Xu, Chang; Chakraborty, Sounak			Bayesian kernel machine models for testing genetic pathway effects in prostate cancer prognosis	STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING			English	Article						Bayes factor; gene pathway; kernel machine; semiparametric regression model	REGRESSION; ASSOCIATION; SIGNATURES; SURVIVAL; GUIDE	In this paper we propose a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to estimate and test the effect of a genetic pathway on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements for patients with prostate cancer. The underlying functional relationship between the genetic pathway and PSA is modeled using reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory. The RKHS formulation makes our model highly flexible, which can capture the complex multidimensional relationship between the genes in a genetic pathway and the response. Moreover, the higher order and nonlinear interactions among the genes in a pathway are also automatically modeled through our kernel-based representation. We illustrate the connection between our semiparametric regression based on RKHS and a linear mixed model by choosing a special prior distribution on the model parameters. To test the significance of a genetic pathway toward the phenotypic response like PSA, we propose a Bayesian hypothesis testing scheme based on the Bayes factor. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to estimate the model parameters, Bayes factors, and the genetic pathway effect simultaneously. We illustrate the effectiveness of our model by five simulation studies and one real prostate cancer gene expression data analysis.

According to machine learning algorithm and 3 sigma multi-level screening strategy (36-MSS), the abnormal changes of cell terminal voltages in a battery pack can be detected and calculated in the form of probability. Applying the neural network algorithm, this paper combines fault and defect diagnosis results with big data statistical regulation to construct a more complete battery system fault diagnosis model. Through analyzing the abnormalities hidden beneath the surface, researchers can see the design flaws in battery systems and provide feedback on the upstream of designing. Furthermore, the local outlier factor (LOF) algorithm and clustering outlier diagnosis algorithm are applied to verifying the calculation results. To further validate the effectiveness of the diagnosis method, a corresponding analysis between statistical diagnosis results and actual vehicle is given. To test the big data diagnosis model, the diagnosis results based on the actual vehicle operating data for the whole year is shown. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nor, NM; Hussain, MA; Hassan, CRC				Nor, Norazwan Md; Hussain, Mohd Azlan; Hassan, Che Rosmani Che			Fault diagnosis and classification framework using multi-scale classification based on kernel Fisher discriminant analysis for chemical process system	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Fault classification; Fault diagnosis; Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis; Wavelet analysis; Support vector machine	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; TRANSFORM; SVM; PCA; IDENTIFICATION	Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in chemical process systems is an important tool for effective process monitoring to ensure the safety of a process. Multi-scale classification offers various advantages for monitoring chemical processes generally driven by events in different time and frequency domains. However, there are issues when dealing with highly interrelated, complex, and noisy databases with large dimensionality. Therefore, a new method for the FDD framework is proposed based on wavelet analysis, kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The main objective of this work was to combine the advantages of these tools to enhance the performance of the diagnosis on a chemical process system. Initially, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was applied to extract the dynamics of the process at different scales. The wavelet coefficients obtained during the analysis were reconstructed using the inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) method, which were then fed into the KFDA to produce discriminant vectors. Finally, the discriminant vectors were used as inputs for the SVM classification task. The SVM classifiers were utilized to classify the feature sets extracted by the proposed method. The performance of the proposed multi-scale KFDA-SVM method for fault classification and diagnosis was analysed and compared using a simulated Tennessee Eastman process as a benchmark. The results showed the improvements of the proposed multiscale KFDA-SVM framework with an average 96.79% of classification accuracy over the multi -scale KFDA-GMM (84.94%), and the established independent component analysis-SVM method (95.78%) of the faults in the Tennessee Eastman process.

J	Luo, SR; Cheng, JS				Luo, Songrong; Cheng, Junsheng			VPMCD based novelty detection method on and its application to fault identification for local characteristic-scale decomposition	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Novelty detection; Variable prediction model class discrimination; Local characteristic-scale decomposition; Fault diagnosis; Roller bearings	SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; ROTATING MACHINERY; MEAN DECOMPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; NETWORK; MODELS	As a new multi-class discrimination approach, variable prediction model class discrimination (VPMCD) can make full use of the intrinsic relationship among fault features to built variable prediction model for different working conditions and to accomplish multi-class discrimination according to prediction error square sum. It has been effectively used to multi-fault diagnosis when typical fault samples and fault modes can be obtained. However, in most application cases, there only exists normal samples, or there are short of typical fault modes; therefore the variable prediction model is unable to be established and there appear a challenge. Aiming at this problem, VPMCD-based novelty detection (VPMCD-ND) method is put forward in this paper. In VPMCD-ND method, the classifiers are trained only by normal samples firstly. Subsequently, the threshold of prediction error square sum is set according to Chebyshev's inequality. Lastly, the novelty (from abnormal class) is detected by whether the prediction error square sum is larger than the threshold. Combing with Local characteristic-scale decomposition, a fault diagnosis method is developed and applied to roller bearings. The results show that the proposed VPMCD-ND method not only is more effective than the support vector data description method, but is benefit for online fault diagnosis.

This results in unexpected disturbances and potential damage to power equipment. Therefore, the initial prevention measures of thermal anomalies in electrical tools are essential to prevent power-equipment failure. In this article, we address this initial prevention mechanism for power substations using a computer-vision approach by taking advantage of infrared thermal images. The thermal images are taken through infrared cameras without disturbing the working operations of power substations. Thus, this article augments the non-destructive approach to defect analysis in electrical power equipment using computer vision and machine learning. We use a total of 150 thermal pictures of different electrical equipment in 10 different substations in operating conditions, using 300 different hotspots. Our approach uses multi-layered perceptron (MLP) to classify the thermal conditions of components of power substations into "defect" and "non-defect" classes. A total of eleven features, which are first-order and second-order statistical features, are calculated from the thermal sample images. The performance of MLP shows initial accuracy of 79.78%. We further augment the MLP with graph cut to increase accuracy to 84%. We argue that with the successful development and deployment of this new system, the Technology Department of Chongqing can arrange the recommended actions and thus save cost in repair and outages. This can play an important role in the quick and reliable inspection to potentially prevent power substation equipment from failure, which will save the whole system from breakdown. The increased 84% accuracy with the integration of the graph cut shows the efficacy of the proposed defect analysis approach.

Online impulse frequency response analysis has proven to be a promising technique for detecting transformer internal winding mechanical deformation faults when a power transformer is in service. However, as so far, there is still no reliable standard code for frequency response signature interpretation and quantification. This paper tries to utilize a machine learning method, namely the support vector machine, to identify and classify the winding mechanical fault types, based on online impulse frequency response analysis. Actual transformer fault data from a specially manufactured model transformer are collected and analyzed. Two feature vectors are proposed and the diagnostic results are predicted. The diagnostic results indicate the satisfied classifying accuracy by the proposed method.

This scheme comprises of four main modules: segmentation, feature extraction, feature reduction, and fault classification. Various state-of-the-art techniques have been devised in the feature extraction and reduction modules to extract informative sets of features from a raw vibration signal, filter redundant features, and produce the most distinct features for the following module. The fault classification module adapts various state-of-the-art class-imbalanced learning techniques for diagnosing bearing defects. This module contains a novel imputation-based oversampling technique for class-imbalanced learning. This integrated diagnostic scheme is evaluated on three experimental scenarios with different imbalance ratios.

J	Yu, JB; Lv, JX				Yu, Jianbo; Lv, Jingxiang			Weak Fault Feature Extraction of Rolling Bearings Using Local Mean Decomposition-Based Multilayer Hybrid Denoising	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; local mean decomposition (LMD); rolling bearing; signal denoising; singular value decomposition (SVD)	EMPIRICAL-MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; WAVELET; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINE; CLASSIFICATION; VIBRATION; SPECTRUM; SVD	Extraction of the weak fault features under strong background noise is crucial to early fault diagnosis in bearings. A new method called local mean decomposition (LMD)-based multilayer hybrid denoising (LMD-MHD) is proposed for signal denoising in this paper. LMD is a novel self-adaptive time-frequency analysis method. It can decompose the signal into a set of product functions (PFs), and is thus particularly suitable for processing of multicomponent amplitude-modulated and frequency-modulated signals. The first filtering layer of LMD-MHD is to use a multiple criteria decision to select the effective PF components. The second filtering layer is to use the wavelet threshold denoising (WTD) as the prefilter of singular value decomposition (SVD) implementation, which enables the preserved singular values to consist of the most important information of the PFs. The final denoising layer of LMD-MHD is to use SVD to extract the most important principal features from Hankel matrix of the PFs. The order of effective ranks of the Hankel matrix is determined by the number of main frequencies in the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) result of the signal. The filtering is finished based on the reconstructed signal from the decomposition result of SVD. The results of experimental analysis on the simulation signals and vibration signal collected from rolling bearings indicate that LMD-MHD is effective for extracting the weak fault features and performs well for bearing fault diagnosis.

The appearance of stator current components or increase of magnitude of some components at characteristic frequencies indicates a motor fault condition. In this paper, we propose a new MCSA fault detector based on a matched subspace technique. The proposed detector consists of three steps. First, the influence of the fundamental supply frequency is removed from the current signal using an interference cancellation technique based on oblique projection. Then, the fault-related frequency is estimated from the interference-free signal using the maximum likelihood principle. Finally, the fault detection is performed using a generalized likelihood ratio test. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for eccentricity fault, bearing faults, and broken rotor bars detection.

However, there occur many situations where low generalization error becomes extremely crucial to getting tangible classification solutions, and even slight overfitting causes serious consequences in the test results. In such situations, classifiers with low Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension can bring out positive differences due to two main advantages: 1) the classifier manages to keep the test error close to training error and 2) the classifier learns effectively with small number of samples. This paper shows that a class of classifiers named majority vote point (MVP) classifiers, on account of very low VC dimension, can exhibit a generalization error that is even lower than that of linear classifiers. This paper proceeds by theoretically formulating an upper bound on the VC dimension of the MVP classifier. Later, through empirical analysis, the trend of exact values of VC dimension is estimated. Finally, case studies on machine fault diagnosis problems and prostate tumor detection problem revalidate the fact that an MVP classifier can achieve a lower generalization error than most other classifiers.

Machine Learning Model for Event-Based Prognostics in Gas Circulator Condition Monitoring	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Condition monitoring; logistic regression (LR); machine learning (ML); prognostics; support vector machines (SVM)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ROTATING MACHINERY; SYSTEM; IMPLEMENTATION; CHALLENGES	Gas circulator (GC) units are an important rotating asset used in the advanced gas-cooled reactor design, facilitating the flow of CO2 gas through the reactor core. The ongoing maintenance and examination of these machines are important for operators in order to maintain safe and economic generation. GCs experience a dynamic duty cycle with periods of nonsteady state behavior at regular refueling intervals, posing a unique analysis problem for reliability engineers. In line with the increased data volumes and sophistication of available technologies, the investigation of predictive and prognostic measurements has become a central interest in rotating asset condition monitoring. However, many of the state-of-the-art approaches finding success deal with the extrapolation of stationary time series feeds, with little to no consideration of more complex but expected events in the data. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel modeling approach for examining refueling behaviors in GCs, with a focus on estimating their health state from vibration data. A machine learning model was constructed using the operational history of a unit experiencing an eventual inspection-based failure. This new approach to examining GC condition is shown to correspond well with explicit remaining useful life measurements of the case study, improving on the existing rudimentary extrapolation methods often employed in rotating machinery health monitoring.

Detection of false data injection attacks against state estimation in smart grids based on a mixture Gaussian distribution learning methodInspec keywordsOther keywords	IET CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: THEORY & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Gaussian distribution; smart power grids; learning (artificial intelligence); power engineering computing; false data injection attacks detection; state estimation; smart grids; mixture Gaussian distribution learning method; power networks; Gaussian mixture model; machine learning; bad data detection; IEEE-118 bus test system; numerical simulations	CYBER SECURITY; POWER-SYSTEMS; BAD DATA; CYBERSECURITY; DEFENSE	One of the most addressed attacks in power networks is false data injection (FDI) which affects monitoring, fault detection, and state estimation integrity by tampering measurement data. To detect such devastating attack, the authors propose a statistical anomaly detection approach based on Gaussian mixture model, while some appropriate machine learning approaches are evaluated for detecting FDI. It should be noted that a finite mixture model is a convex combination of some probability density functions and combining the properties of several probability functions, making the mixture models capable of approximating any arbitrary distribution. Simulations results confirm superior performance of the proposed method over conventional bad data detection (BDD) tests and other learning approaches that studied in this article. It should be noted that using data which change significantly over a day can be highly clustered, and therefore, detected much easier compared with small changes in the loads. So without loss of generality, in the simulations it is assumed that the power demand follows a uniform distribution in a small range. However, the detector can be trained regularly based on the updated load profile.	[Foroutan, S.

J	Ossai, CI				Ossai, Chinedu, I			Integrated Big Data Analytics Technique for Real-Time Prognostics, Fault Detection and Identification for Complex Systems	INFRASTRUCTURES			English	Article						artificial neural network; data analytics; fault detection and identification; complex systems; SCADA		Real-time prediction of the state of complex systems is vital for integrity management since it is easier to plan for asset maintenance, reduce risks associated with unplanned downtime and reduce the cost of maintenance. This study utilized a four-fold cross-validation ensemble for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) in a backward propagation technique for haul crane prognosis. Big data on components' degradation states obtained from the Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems were used to implement the study. After preprocessing the dataset, importance scoring was used to compute the Cumulative Target-component Percentage-influence (CTP) of the input variables (source components) on the output variable (the target component) at the 95.5%, 99.3%, 99.9% and 100% levels. The specific source components responsible for the CTP levels of the target component were later used for the ANN network training that followed the cross-validation ensemble technique. The cross-validation ensemble ANN technique was also compared to the classic ANN and other machining learning algorithms. Finally, the best-trained cross-validation ensemble ANN network, which was obtained at the 99.9% CTP level, was used for future estimation of the time of failure of the system to enhance planning for the expected maintenance program that will be required at such times.

To clarify the role of 90K as an indicator for poor prognosis and metastasis in epithelial cancers, the present study investigated the effect of 90K on an adherens junctional protein, E-cadherin, which is frequently absent or downregulated in human epithelial cancers. Treatment of certain cancer cells with 90K significantly reduced E-cadherin levels in a cell-population-dependent manner, and these cells showed decreases in cell adhesion and increases in invasive cell motility. Mechanistically, 90K-induced E-cadherin downregulation occurred via ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation. 90K interacted with the E-cadherin-p120-catenin complex and induced its dissociation, altering the phosphorylation status of p120-catenin, whereas it did not associate with beta-catenin. In subconfluent cells, 90K decreased membrane-localized p120-catenin and the membrane fraction of the p120-catenin. Particularly, 90K-induced E-cadherin downregulation was diminished in p120-catenin knocked-down cells. Taken together, 90K upregulation promotes the dissociation of the E-cadherin-p120-catenin complex, leading to E-cadherin proteasomal degradation, and thereby destabilizing adherens junctions in less confluent tumor cells. Our results provide a potential mechanism to explain the poor prognosis of cancer patients with high serum 90K levels.

Reducing Dimensionality of Multi-regime Data for Failure Prognostics	JOURNAL OF FAILURE ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Failure prognostics; Multi-dimensional data; Dimensionality reduction; Remaining useful life estimation	HEALTH MANAGEMENT	Over the last decade, the prognostics and health management literature has introduced many conceptual frameworks for remaining useful life predictions. However, estimating the future behavior of critical machinery systems is a challenging task due to the uncertainties and complexity involved in the multi-dimensional condition monitoring data. Even though many studies have reported promising methods in data processing and dimensionality reduction, the prognostics applications require integration of these methods with remaining useful life estimations. This paper describes a multiple linear regression process that reduces the number of data regimes under consideration by obtaining a set of principal degradation variables. The process also extracts health indicators and useful features. Finally, a state-space model based on frequency-domain data is used to estimate remaining useful life. The presented approach is assessed with a case study on turbofan engine degradation simulation dataset, and the prediction performance is validated by error-based prognostic metrics.

However, for some applications, failure or suspension histories are hard to obtain due to high reliability requirement or expensive experiment cost. In addition, some systems' work condition cannot be simulated. According to current research, remaining useful life prediction without failure or suspension histories is challenging. To solve this problem, an individual-based inference method is developed using recorded condition monitoring data to date. Features extracted from condition data are divided by adaptive time windows. The time window size is adjusted according to increasing rate. Features in two adjacent selected windows are regarded as the inputs and outputs to train an artificial neural network. Multi-step ahead rolling prediction is employed, predicted features are post-processed and regarded as inputs in the next prediction iteration. Rolling prediction is stopped until a prediction value exceeds failure threshold. The proposed method is validated by simulation bearing data and PHM-2012 Competition data. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising intelligent prognostics approach.

J	Rai, A; Upadhyay, SH				Rai, Akhand; Upadhyay, S. H.			The use of MD-CUMSUM and NARX neural network for anticipating the remaining useful life of bearings	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Rolling element bearings; Prognostics; Health indicator; NARX neural network; Remaining useful life	FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; WAVELET TRANSFORM; RESIDUAL LIFE; PERFORMANCE; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTIONS; PARAMETERS	The accurate determination of remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings is of immense importance in the condition-based maintenance of any rotating machinery. In this paper, a data driven prognostic approach based on nonlinear autoregressive neural network with eXogenous Inputs (NARX-NN) in combination with wavelet-filter technique is applied to the RUL estimation of bearings. Firstly, the vibration signals generated in an experimental test rig are processed with the proposed wavelet-filter to augment the impulsive characteristics of bearing signals and improve the quality of fault feature extraction. Secondly, a variety of time-domain features are extracted from the processed bearing signals. However, these features exhibit a highly non-monotonic behavior as the bearing condition degrades. To overcome this drawback, a new health indicator (HI) based on Mahalanobis distance (MD) criterion and cumulative sum (CUMSUM) chart is proposed in this paper. Thirdly, the NARX-NN is first designed as a time delay neural network (TDNN). Then, the derived HI and the age of the bearing are used as inputs with life percentage of the bearing as output in order to train the TDNN model, which unlike the usual artificial neural networks (ANNs) performs a one-step ahead prediction of the bearing RUL. The results suggest that the proposed method can effectively predict the RUL of bearings with an acceptable degree of accuracy, and outperforms the use of self-organizing map-based indicator and the traditional FFNNs for RUL inference.

J	Wang, YX; Yang, L; Xiang, JW; Yang, JW; He, SL				Wang, Yanxue; Yang, Lin; Xiang, Jiawei; Yang, Jianwei; He, Shuilong			A hybrid approach to fault diagnosis of roller bearings under variable speed conditions	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						computed order tracking; variational mode decomposition; time-frequency analysis; bearing fault; variable speed	VARIATIONAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; SPECTRUM; SYSTEM	Rolling element bearings are one of the main elements in rotating machines, whose failure may lead to a fatal breakdown and significant economic losses. Conventional vibration-based diagnostic methods are based on the stationary assumption, thus they are not applicable to the diagnosis of bearings working under varying speeds. This constraint limits the bearing diagnosis to the industrial application significantly. A hybrid approach to fault diagnosis of roller bearings under variable speed conditions is proposed in this work, based on computed order tracking (COT) and variational mode decomposition (VMD)-based time frequency representation (VTFR). COT is utilized to resample the non-stationary vibration signal in the angular domain, while VMD is used to decompose the resampled signal into a number of band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BLIMFs). A VTFR is then constructed based on the estimated instantaneous frequency and instantaneous amplitude of each BLIMF. Moreover, the Gini index and time-frequency kurtosis are both proposed to quantitatively measure the sparsity and concentration measurement of time-frequency representation, respectively. The effectiveness of the VTFR for extracting nonlinear components has been verified by a bat signal. Results of this numerical simulation also show the sparsity and concentration of the VTFR are better than those of short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, Hilbert-Huang transform and Wigner-Ville distribution techniques. Several experimental results have further demonstrated that the proposed method can well detect bearing faults under variable speed conditions.

A history of cepstrum analysis and its application to mechanical problems	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Cepstrum analysis; History; Gear diagnostics; Machine diagnostics; Operational modal analysis	FREQUENCY-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; OPERATIONAL MODAL-ANALYSIS; REGENERATION; DIAGNOSIS; POLES; ZEROS	It is not widely realised that the first paper on cepstrum analysis was published two years before the FFT algorithm, despite having Tukey as a common author, and its definition was such that it was not reversible even to the log spectrum. After publication of the FFT in 1965, the cepstrum was redefined so as to be reversible to the log spectrum, and shortly afterwards Oppenheim and Schafer defined the "complex cepstrum", which was reversible to the time domain. They also derived the analytical form of the complex cepstrum of a transfer function in terms of its poles and zeros. The cepstrum had been used in speech analysis for determining voice pitch (by accurately measuring the harmonic spacing), but also for separating the formants (transfer function of the vocal tract) from voiced and unvoiced sources, and this led quite early to similar applications in mechanics. The first was to gear diagnostics (Randall), where the cepstrum greatly simplified the interpretation of the sideband families associated with local faults in gears, and the second was to extraction of diesel engine cylinder pressure signals from acoustic response measurements (Lyon and Ordubadi). Later Polydoros defined the differential cepstrum, which had an analytical form similar to the impulse response function, and Gao and Randall used this and the complex cepstrum in the application of cepstrum analysis to modal analysis of mechanical structures. Antoni proposed the mean differential cepstrum, which gave a smoothed result. The cepstrum can be applied to MIMO systems if at least one SIMO response can be separated, and a number of blind source separation techniques have been proposed for this. Most recently it has been shown that even though it is not possible to apply the complex cepstrum to stationary signals, it is possible to use the real cepstrum to edit their (log) amplitude spectrum, and combine this with the original phase to obtain edited time signals. This has already been used for a wide range of mechanical applications. A very powerful processing tool is an exponential "lifter" (window) applied to the cepstrum, which is shown to extract the modal part of the response (with a small extra damping of each mode corresponding to the window). This can then be used to repress or enhance the modal information in the response according to the application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, XF; Hsieh, SJ; Peng, B; Hsieh, D				Zhou, Xunfei; Hsieh, Sheng-Jen; Peng, Bo; Hsieh, Daniel			Cycle life estimation of lithium-ion polymer batteries using artificial neural network and support vector machine with time-resolved thermography	MICROELECTRONICS RELIABILITY			English	Article						Infrared thermography; Supervised machine learning; State of health	GENERAL ENERGY-BALANCE; HEALTH ESTIMATION; TEMPERATURE-MEASUREMENT; STATE; PROGNOSTICS; PREDICTION; DISCHARGE; MODELS; CAPACITY; BEHAVIOR	A battery cycle life forecast method without requirements of contact measurement devices and long testing time would be beneficial for industrial applications. The combination of infrared thermography and supervised learning techniques provided the potential solution to this problem. This research investigates the application of machine learning techniques artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVM5) in combination with thermography for cycle life estimation of lithium-ion polymer batteries. Infrared images were captured at 1 frame/min during 70 min of charging followed by 60 min of discharging for 410 cycles. The surface temperature profiles during either charging or discharging were used as the input nodes for ANN and SVM models. The results demonstrated that with thermal profiles as the input, ANN could estimate the current cycle life of studied cell with the error of < 10% under 10 min of testing time. While when compared to ANN, the accuracy of SVM-based forecast models was similar but generally required a longer amount of testing time.

J	Liu, J; Zio, E				Liu, Jie; Zio, Enrico			SVM hyperparameters tuning for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Recursive multi-step-ahead prediction; Support vector machine; Hyperparameters tuning; Single-objective optimization; Bi-objective optimization	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; TIME-SERIES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; HEALTH MANAGEMENT; PARETO FRONT; PROGNOSTICS; PARAMETERS; REGRESSION	Prediction of time series data is of relevance for many industrial applications. The prediction can be made in one-step and multi-step ahead. For predictive maintenance, multi-step-ahead prediction is of interest for projecting the evolution of the future conditions of the equipment of interest, computing the remaining useful life and taking corresponding maintenance decisions. Recursive prediction is one of the popular strategies for multi-step-ahead prediction. SVM is a popular data-driven approach that has been used for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction. Tuning the hyperparameters in SVM during the training process is challenging, and normally the hyperparameters are tuned by solving an optimization problem. This paper analyses the possible objectives of the optimization for tuning hyperparameters. Through experiments on one synthetic dataset and two real time series data, related to the prediction of wind speed in a region and leakage from the reactor coolant pump in a nuclear power plant, a bi-objective optimization combining mean absolute derivatives and accuracy on all prediction steps is shown to be the best choice for tuning SVM hyperparameters for recursive multi-step-ahead prediction.

It can reduce economical losses by eliminating unexpected downtime in industry due to failure of rotary machines. Though widely investigated in the past couple of decades, continued advancement is still desirable to improve upon existing fault diagnosis techniques. Vibration acceleration signals collected from machine bearings exhibit nonstationary behavior due to variable working conditions and multiple fault severities. In the current work, a two-layered bearing fault diagnosis scheme is proposed for the identification of fault pattern and crack size for a given fault type. A hybrid feature pool is used in combination with sparse stacked autoencoder (SAE)-based deep neural networks (DNNs) to perform effective diagnosis of bearing faults of multiple severities. The hybrid feature pool can extract more discriminating information from the raw vibration signals, to overcome the nonstationary behavior of the signals caused by multiple crack sizes. More discriminating information helps the subsequent classifier to effectively classify data into the respective classes. The results indicate that the proposed scheme provides satisfactory performance in diagnosing bearing defects of multiple severities. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., support vector machines (SVMs) and backpropagation neural networks (BPNNs).

The CNNs utilize the spectral energy maps (SEMs) of the acoustic emission (AE) signals as inputs and automatically learn the optimal features, which yield the best discriminative models for diagnosing incipient bearing defects under variable operating speeds. The SEMs are two-dimensional maps that show the distribution of energy across different bands of the AE spectrum. It is hypothesized that the variation of a bearing's speed would not alter the overall shape of the AE spectrum rather, it may only scale and translate it. Thus, at different speeds, the same defect would yield SEMs that are scaled and shifted versions of each other. This hypothesis is confirmed by the experimental results, where CNNs trained using the S-DLM algorithm yield significantly better diagnostic performance under variable operating speeds compared to existing methods. In this work, the performance of different training algorithms is also evaluated to select the best training algorithm for the CNNs. The proposed method is used to diagnose both single and compound defects at six different operating speeds.

Smart Sensing of Loads in an Extra Low Voltage DC Pico-Grid Using Machine Learning Techniques	IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL			English	Article						DC power systems; pico-grid; load classification; state-change detection; load management	FAULT-DETECTION; POWER-SYSTEMS; STEADY-STATE; DESIGN; IDENTIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION	Aiming at the rising number of dc appliances and the growing interest in their monitoring systems, this paper describes the injection of intelligence into dc pico-grids that are made up of "dumb" appliances and loads. Due to reality of economic, dc appliances and loads are usually low in cost and lack intelligence and communication features for effective monitoring and management. This paper proposes a smart sensor design for dc pico-grid with the use of a single sensor multiple loads and states detection in monitoring the "dumb" appliances. This eliminates the need to have intelligence and communication features for every appliance. With the smart sensor, several such smart dc pico-grids can be bundled into bigger scale of smart nano-grid or micro-grid. In addition to knowing how much energy or power the pico-grid is using, the smart sensor also provides load disaggregation and state-change detection. The states of the loads can be learned and detected via the signatures and features obtained from the transient state or the steady state of the entire grid's current waveform. Computational intelligence techniques, k-nearest neighbors, K-means clustering, and other algorithms are used in the system for loads classification and state-change detection. Working together with the software in the smart sensor is hardware implementation of low cost operational amplifiers and logic gates; these hardware help to share the burden on the controller and release resources for the controller to perform more advanced processes. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the operation of the smart sensor in dc pico-grid.	[Quek, Y. T.; Woo, W.

The environment noise varies has non-linear relation with motor load and it challenges the decision making capability of the condition monitoring system. This paper addresses the issue of reliable decision making on the existence of bearing faults in variable load conditions. Two type of threshold schemes have been proposed to reliably diagnose bearing faults in Park vector modulus spectrum. The performance of the developed threshold based condition monitoring system has been analyzed theoretically and experimentally.

The aim of the study is to find the proper features that represent the degradation condition of slew bearing rotating at very low speed (approximate to 1 r/min) with naturally defect. The literature study of existing research, related to feature extraction methods or algorithms in a wide range of applications such as vibration analysis, time series analysis and bio-medical signal processing, is discussed. Some features are applied in vibration slew bearing data acquired from laboratory tests. The selected features such as impulse factor, margin factor, approximate entropy and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) show obvious changes in bearing condition from normal condition to final failure.

Cost and complexity of a condition monitoring system increase with the number of measurements, so extensive condition monitoring is currently mainly restricted to the situations where the consequences of poor availability, yield or quality are so severe that they clearly justify the investment in monitoring. There are challenges to obtaining plant-wide monitoring that includes even small machines and non-critical applications. One of the major inhibiting factors is the ratio of condition monitoring cost to equipment cost, which is crucial to the acceptance of using monitoring to guide maintenance for a large fleet of electrical machinery. Ongoing developments in sensing, communication and computation for industrial automation may greatly extend the set of machines for which extensive monitoring is viable.

J	Kumar, J; Jena, P				Kumar, Jitendra; Jena, Premalata			Solution to Fault Detection During Power Swing Using Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fault detection; Power swing; Teager-Kaiser energy operator; Phase and ground faults	DEMODULATION; ALGORITHM; PRINCIPLE	The selectivity property of distance relay is affected due to the operation of power swing blocking element which is used to prevent the false tripping imposed by power swing. Therefore, the fault detection algorithm is required to overcome such type of problems. Further, the fault detection during power swing for a series-compensated line is more challenging as the metal oxide varistor protecting the series capacitor imposes other frequency components and adds transients in the voltage and current signals. To resolve such protection challenges, this paper proposes an integrated approach for fault detection, which is based on Teager-Kaiser energy operators of instantaneous zero sequence voltage (Scheme 1) and phasor of negative sequence current (Scheme 2). Instantaneous zero sequence voltage appears only for unsymmetrical ground faults, and it is not affected by current transformer saturation. Other types of faults such as symmetrical, line-to-line faults are detected by Scheme 2, which is immune to capacitor coupling voltage transformer transients. However, both the schemes cover all fault scenarios. The main advantage of proposed scheme is that it is independent of the threshold. It is also not influenced by voltage and current inversions imposed by series capacitor and can detect the fault within 3 ms. The proposed scheme is validated using voltage and current data obtained by simulating 400 kV, 50 Hz, 9-bus multi-machine system using PSCAD/EMTDC. Further, to validate the proposed scheme in real time, the experiments are also carried out on real-time digital simulator.

Thus, an effective diagnosis method is crucial in practical chemical processes. A novel fault diagnosis method is proposed based on the weighted least squares support vector machine (WLSVM) to deal with the small sample and non-linear partition data. It provides the strong potential in predicting faults, especially by further employing a suitable particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to determine the most important parameters of the punishment factor and the Gaussian RBF kernel, which has the advantages of high accuracy and low false alarm rate. PSO-WLSSVM is further accomplished with the data from the classic benchmark test set Tennessee Eastman (TE) process. Also, the models SVM, PSO-SVM, and PSO-LSSVM are employed on the TE process to compare the performance of PSO-WLSSVM. The results show the validity of the proposed approach on the TE process.

J	Ma, M; Sun, C; Chen, XF				Ma, Meng; Sun, Chuang; Chen, Xuefeng			Discriminative Deep Belief Networks with Ant Colony Optimization for Health Status Assessment of Machine	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); discriminative deep belief network (DDBN); health status monitoring; prognostics and health management (PHM)	NEURAL-NETWORKS; ROTATING MACHINERY; GRASSMANN MANIFOLD; RESIDUAL LIFE; DATA-DRIVEN; PROGNOSTICS; DIAGNOSIS; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHMS	On-line health status monitoring, a key part of prognostics and health management, provides various benefits, such as preventing unexpected failure and improving safety and reliability. In this paper, a data-driven approach for health status assessment is presented. A novel method based on discriminative deep belief networks (DDBN) and ant colony optimization (ACO) is used to predict health status of machine. DDBN is a new paradigm that utilizes a deep architecture to combine the advantages of deep belief networks and discriminative ability of back-propagation strategy. DDBN works through a greedy layer-by-layer training with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines, which preserves information well when embedding features from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space. However, selecting the parameters of DDBN is quite challenging. To address the problem, ACO is introduced to DDBN in this paper. By optimization, the structure of DDBN model is determined automatically without prior knowledge and the performance is enhanced. To evaluate the proposed approach, two case studies were carried out, which shows that it can achieve a good result. The performance of this model is also compared with support vector machine. It is concluded that the proposed method is very promising in the field of prognostics.

However, the optimal iterative threshold and iterations of MP algorithm are difficult to be determined and the sparsest representation is difficult to obtain for pursuit algorithms. In order to reduce the influence of the threshold and iterations on the performance of MP and obtain appropriate results without seeking the sparsest representation, a new transient feature extraction technique named averaged random orthogonal MP (AROMP) algorithm is proposed. In the proposed method, random orthogonal MP algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm to match the atoms with probability, is utilized repeatedly to generate a group of competitive representations for the mechanical vibration signal. Then by averaging these solutions, the estimated representation vector can be obtained to represent the vibration signal and then transients can be extracted from the noisy signal. The simulation study and experimental analysis show that transients can be extracted effectively from the noisy vibration signal. And comparison results between the proposed method and orthogonal MP show that the proposed algorithm is less dependent on iterations and can obtain a better performance for transients extraction. Comparisons between the proposed algorithm and spectral kurtosis also show the superiority of the proposed method.

An enhanced reconstruction method is proposed using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In the traditional SVD reconstruction method, the faulty data may affect other fault free data. The enhanced SVD (ESVD) reconstruction method is a robust method to map as a normal data. The statistical hypothesis test, namely Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) is applied to detect the fault in the residual space. The proposed method performance is verified by the real data of Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR).

J	Nunes, I; Jannach, D				Nunes, Ingrid; Jannach, Dietmar			A systematic review and taxonomy of explanations in decision support and recommender systems	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Review						Explanation; Decision support system; Recommender system; Expert system; Knowledge-based system; Systematic review; Machine learning; Trust; Artificial intelligence	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; INFORMATION; LANGUAGE; FACILITY; REPRESENTATION; STRATEGIES	With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.

A prolonged operation in the flow-instability region may result in severe damages of the CP system. Hence, two of the major causes of flow instabilities such as the suction blockage (with five levels of increasing severity) and impeller defects are studied in the present work. Thereafter, an attempt is made to classify these faults and differentiate the physics behind the flow instabilities caused due to them. The tri-axial CP vibration data in time domain are employed for the fault classification. Multidistinct and multicoexisting fault classifications have been performed with different combinations of these faults using support vector machine (SVM) algorithm with radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Prediction results from the experiments and the developed methodology help to segregate the faults into appropriate class, identify the severity of the suction blockage, and substantiate the practical applicability of this study.

Using artificial neural networks to select the parameters for the prognostic of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly individuals	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Review						Regression; Artificial neural networks; Aging; Mild cognitive impairment; Dementia; Alzheimer's disease	MINI-MENTAL-STATE; ALZHEIMERS ASSOCIATION WORKGROUPS; PRIMARY-CARE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; DISEASE; MRI; RECOMMENDATIONS; CLASSIFICATION	Background and Objectives: A huge number of solutions based on computational systems have been recently developed for the classification of cognitive abnormalities in older people, so that individuals at high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, such as Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer?s disease, can be identified before the manifestation of the diseases. Several factors are related to these pathologies, making the diagnostic process a hard problem to solve. This paper proposes a computational model based on the artificial neural network to classify data patterns of older adults. Methods: The proposal takes into account the several parameters as diagnostic factors as gender, age, the level of education, study time, and scores from cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Semantic Verbal Fluency Test, Clinical Dementia Rating and Ascertaining Dementia). This non-linear regression model is designed to classify healthy and pathological aging with machine learning techniques such as neural networks, random forest, SVM, and stochastic gradient boosting. We deployed a simple linear regression model for the sake of comparison. The primary objective is to use a regression model to analyze the data set aiming to check which parameters are necessary to achieve high accuracy in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Results: The analysis demonstrated that the usage of cognitive tests produces median values for the accuracy greater than 90%. The ROC analysis shows that the best sensitivity performance is above 98% and specificity of 96% when the configurations have only cognitive tests. Conclusions: The presented approach is a valuable tool for identifying patients with dementia or MCI and for supporting the clinician in the diagnostic process, by providing an outstanding support decision tool in the diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases.

Demagnetization and ISF are analyzed using models; we focused on changes of magnitude and angle of currents in the synchronous frame. Those two faults increase the magnitude of the input current compared with normal machines at the same load torque. However, our analysis suggests that demagnetization causes increase in the current angle beta, whereas ISF causes decrease in beta. We exploit this difference in response to classify the fault if one is detected in the PMSM. Experimental studies on interior-type PMSMs verify that demagnetization and ISF can be detected and classified in various operation conditions.

J	Lu, B; Zhou, XJ				Lu, Biao; Zhou, Xiaojun			Opportunistic preventive maintenance scheduling for serial-parallel multistage manufacturing systems with multiple streams of deterioration	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Serial-parallel multistage manufacturing system; Preventive maintenance; Multiple streams of deterioration; Quality improvement; Economic dependence	STATISTICAL PROCESS-CONTROL; PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE; DECISION-MAKING; COMPONENTS; POLICIES; MODELS	This paper proposes a novel opportunistic preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling methodology for the serial parallel multistage manufacturing systems (SP-MMSs), where PM is performed to improve both the reliability and product quality. A SP-MMS has two essential characteristics: (i) the products can go through different process routes; (ii) the deterioration of a machine will not only affect the key product characteristics (KPCs) formed at the current stage but also propagate to downstream stages and then affect the KPCs formed there. Consequently, the propagation of machine deterioration along different routes will generate multiple streams of deterioration. This phenomenon is mathematically modeled to evaluate the quality of final products. The PM scheduling is based on the modeling of total maintenance cost including minimal repair cost, quality loss and PM-related costs. Firstly, a tentative PM schedule is made for each individual machine by minimizing the corresponding total maintenance cost. Secondly, the tentative PM schedules of all machines are further adjusted to obtain the optimal PM schedule for the system by jointly considering the economic dependence and control of final product quality. A case study shows that the methodology can ensure reasonably high reliability and final product quality for the system with a low total maintenance cost. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Supporting group maintenance through prognostics-enhanced dynamic dependability prediction	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Prognostics; Predictive maintenance; Diagnostics; Dynamic dependability; Maintenance grouping	USEFUL LIFE PREDICTION; FAULT-TREES; MULTICOMPONENT SYSTEMS; STATE ESTIMATION; DATA-DRIVEN; MODEL; RELIABILITY; OPTIMIZATION; POLICY; REPLACEMENT	Condition-based maintenance strategies adapt maintenance planning through the integration of online condition monitoring of assets. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these strategies can be improved by integrating prognostics predictions and grouping maintenance actions respectively. In complex industrial systems, however, effective condition-based maintenance is intricate.Such systems are comprised of repairable assets which can fail in different ways, with various effects, and typically governed by dynamics which include time-dependent and conditional events. In this context, system reliability prediction is complex and effective maintenance planning is virtually impossible prior to system deployment and hard even in the case of condition-based maintenance. Addressing these issues, this paper presents an online system maintenance method that takes into account the system dynamics. The method employs an online predictive diagnosis algorithm to distinguish between critical and non-critical assets. A prognostics-updated method for predicting the system health is then employed to yield well-informed, more accurate, condition-based suggestions for the maintenance of critical assets and for the group-based reactive repair of non-critical assets. The cost-effectiveness of the approach is discussed in a case study from the power industry. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Aizpurua, J. I.; Catterson, V.

Au and J.L. Beck [Probabilistic Engrg. Mech., 16 (2001), pp. 263-2777, which has been named PFP-SubSim. The idea behind PFP-SubSim algorithm is to split the multi-step-ahead predicted trajectories into multiple branches of selected samples at various stages of the process, which correspond to increasingly closer approximations of the critical threshold. Following theoretical development, discussion and an illustrative example to demonstrate its efficacy, we report on experience using the algorithm for making predictions for the end-of-life and remaining useful life in the challenging application of fatigue damage propagation of carbon-fibre composite coupons using structural health monitoring data. Results show that PFP-SubSim algorithm outperforms the traditional particle filter-based prognostics approach in terms of computational efficiency, while achieving the same, or better, measure of accuracy in the prognostics estimates. It is also shown that PFP-SubSim algorithm gets its highest efficiency when dealing with rare-event simulation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nguyen, KA; Do, P; Grall, A				Kim-Anh Nguyen; Phuc Do; Grall, Antoine			Joint predictive maintenance and inventory strategy for multi-component systems using Birnbaum's structural importance	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						Multi-component system; Predictive maintenance; Predictive inventory; Prognostic; Opportunistic maintenance; Economic dependence; Importance measure	RESIDUAL LIFE; OPTIMIZATION; POLICY; MODELS	Maintenance and inventory optimizations are two interrelated processes but often investigated separately in the literature. Joint optimization of these processes can reduce the total maintenance and inventory cost, it may however lead to a complex problem with a large numbers of decision parameters to be optimized. To face this open issue, in this paper, we present a joint predictive maintenance and inventory strategy for systems with complex structure and multiple non-identical components. Both predictive maintenance and spare parts provisioning operations are studied and optimized jointly. The prognostic condition index and the structural importance measure of components are jointly used to build the thresholds for preventive maintenance and spare part ordering. Additionally, in order to take the advantages of economic dependence, opportunistic maintenance decision rules based on the criticality level of components and their spare parts availability are proposed. To evaluate the proposed joint strategy, a cost model taking into account the economic dependence of both maintenance and inventory activities is developed. A numerical study of a 7-component system is finally presented to illustrate the use and the advantages of the proposed strategy. Indeed, this strategy shows the flexibility and the efficiency in joint maintenance and inventory optimization. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jing, LY; Zhao, M; Li, P; Xu, XQ				Jing, Luyang; Zhao, Ming; Li, Pin; Xu, Xiaoqiang			A convolutional neural network based feature learning and fault diagnosis method for the condition monitoring of gearbox	MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Feature learning; Gearbox	MACHINES	Feature extraction plays a vital role in intelligent fault diagnosis of mechanical system. Nevertheless, traditional feature extraction methods suffer from three problems, which are (1) the requirements of domain expertise and prior knowledge, (2) the sensitive to the changes of mechanical system and (3) the limitations of mining new features. It is attractive and meaningful to investigate an automatic feature extraction method, which can adaptively learn features from raw data and discover new fault-sensitive features. Deep learning has been widely used in image analysis and speech recognition with great success. The key advantage of this method lies into the ability of mining representative information and sensitive features from raw data. However, the application of deep learning in feature leaning for mechanical diagnosis is still few, and limited studies have been carried out to compare the effectiveness of feature leaning with various data types. This paper will focus on developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn features directly from frequency data of vibration signals and testing the different performance of feature learning from raw data, frequency spectrum and combined time-frequency data. Manual features from time domain, frequency domain and wavelet domain as well as three common intelligent methods are used as comparisons. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through PHM 2009 gearbox challenge data and a planetary gearbox test rig. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn features adaptively from frequency data and achieve higher diagnosis accuracy than other comparative methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique of control used is based on the field-oriented control (FOC), where the fault effect in the mechanical speed is compensated in order to ensure the operation continuity of the machine. The broken rotor fault is detected through the rotor resistance estimation using extended kalman filter observer and the fast Fourier transforms for analyzing a several electrical and mechanical quantities (i.e., rotor speed, quadratic current components of control and stator phase current). The spectral analysis is effectuated only if the variation of the rotor resistance estimation is significant. An EKF observer has proven to be an excellent mathematical tool for the fault indicator in the variable speed drive. Moreover, the spectral analysis using FFT transforms can be a useful solution to ensure that the resistance variation indicates to broken rotor bars fault.

Fault detection in rotating machines with beamforming: Spatial visualization of diagnosis features	MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Fault diagnosis; Beamforming; Spectral kurtosis	SPECTRAL KURTOSIS; GEAR FAILURES; SIGNALS; VIBRATION	Rotating machines diagnosis is conventionally related to vibration analysis. Sensors are usually placed on the machine to gather information about its components. The recorded signals are then processed through a fault detection algorithm allowing the identification of the failing part. This paper proposes an acoustic-based diagnosis method. A microphone array is used to record the acoustic field radiated by the machine. The main advantage over vibration-based diagnosis is that the contact between the sensors and the machine is no longer required. Moreover, the application of acoustic imaging makes possible the identification of the sources of acoustic radiation on the machine surface. The display of information is then spatially continuous while the accelerometers only give it discrete. Beamforming provides the time-varying signals radiated by the machine as a function of space. Any fault detection tool can be applied to the beamforming output. Spectral kurtosis, which highlights the impulsiveness of a signal as function of frequency, is used in this study. The combination of spectral kurtosis with acoustic imaging makes possible the mapping of the impulsiveness as a function of space and frequency. The efficiency of this approach lays on the source separation in the spatial and frequency domains. These mappings make possible the localization of such impulsive sources. The faulty components of the machine have an impulsive behavior and thus will be highlighted on the mappings. The study presents experimental validations of the method on rotating machines.

Conventional PSB techniques, which use local information, may not be able to distinguish power swing from fault for all system conditions. An accurate PSB algorithm is proposed in this study, which uses synchrophasor measurements to distinguish power swing from fault. During power swing, the impedance trajectory is predicted for next ten cycles to block the distance relay operation reliably. The prediction approach overcomes the latency issue with synchrophasor data in order to initiate the blocking decision for zone 1/zone 2 of distance relay well in advance. The proposed method is tested for two-area four-machine and ten-machine 39-bus systems under different conditions simulated in power systems computer-aided design/electro-magnetic transient design and control software and compared with conventional method. Execution time of the proposed method including latencies in data arrival are considered in the test results.	[Rao, J.

In this paper we describe an application developed to predict and explain door failures on metro trains. To this end, the aim was twofold: first, devising prediction techniques capable of early detecting door failures from diagnostic data; second, describing failures in terms of properties distinguishing them from normal behavior. Data pre-processing was a complex task aimed at overcoming a number of issues with the dataset, like size, sparsity, bias, burst effect and trust. Since failure premonitory signals did not share common patterns, but were only characterized as non-normal device signals, fault prediction was performed by using outlier detection. Fault explanation was finally achieved by exhibiting device features showing abnormal values. An experimental evaluation was performed to assess the quality of the proposed approach. Results show that high-degree outliers are effective indicators of incipient failures. Also, explanation in terms of abnormal feature values (responsible for outlierness) seems to be quite expressive. There are some aspects in the proposed approach that deserve particular attention. We introduce a general framework for the failure detection problem based on an abstract model of diagnostic data, along with a formal problem statement. They both provide the basis for the definition of an effective data pre-processing technique where the behavior of a device, in a given time frame, is summarized through a number of suitable statistics. This approach strongly mitigates the issues related to data errors/noise, thus enabling to perform an effective outlier detection. All this, in our view, provides the grounds of a general methodology for advanced prognostic systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The users' comfort and tranquillity are main concerns in the automotive industry. Inside such turbomachines, the flow structure always becomes highly three dimensional and unsteady, compromising the referred comfort, and sets the focus on the working flow variables. A mathematically exact solution for that flow, which would provide any required information on pressure or forces, is out of scope at the current engineering design processes. Nevertheless, some flow features and mechanical data are needed to progress in the frame of a modern industrial environment, which each time more strongly, besides the different design procedures, involves maintenance protocols. The correctness of a given maintenance protocol relies on its feasibility to handle a set of machine working parameters or variables, including a number of them as wide as possible. Doing so, a set of non-dangerous ranges for them can be established. Such ranges are often defined promoting a series of failures similar to real ones, when the machine is in its usable lifetime. In what refers to the flow analysis, a reasonably good tool has been developed using a computational fluid dynamics technique and, from the experiments, a better understanding of the fan operating conditions is accomplished. For a Sirocco fan unit and to establish proper working ranges for maintenance purposes, a series of failures have been experimentally and numerically tested. Initially, real data from industry have been required and a list of main failures was made. It included impeller or rotor unbalance, impeller channel obstruction and blocked inlet. The first two failures are studied using a purified orbit diagram technique and the last one is numerically analysed. All four working conditions are studied for at least three different flow rates and, therefore, a deeper insight into the fan working parameters and options is made feasible. In the frame of the maintenance protocol, a full set of ranges for the considered failures have been obtained.

Detection of Network Instability using Area-Based Centre of Inertia-Referred Frame	TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMICS OF SMART GRIDS AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY			English	Article						Transient stability; Phase angle; Rotor angle; Center of inertia (COI); Phasor measurement units; Smart Grid		The operation of electrical networks constantly face contingencies such as generation outages and line faults. When a network is running under high stress levels or a transient fault occurs, the network might undergo angle instability. As a result, the network splits into several islands causing great loss of load and generation thus, creating network instability and a potential blackout. In this paper Center of Inertia (COI) as well as each area is used for the detection of network instability where the rotor angle stability of the entire network is monitored to establish if and when the network becomes unstable. The method is implemented on the IEEE 39-bus system known as the 10-machine New-England Power System.	[Le Roux, P. F.; Bansal, R.

Firstly, the mechanical vibration signal of OLTC is decomposed by wavelet packet transform. Then, the information entropy of the wavelet packet coefficients of the effective frequency band is calculated. Based on above steps, multi-resolution feature parameters of the mechanical vibration signal of OLTC are obtained. Based on the multi-resolution feature parameters, fault classification model is established. And this model is on the basis of SVM which is optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). The results of simulation and analysis show that the integrated model proposed in this paper can effectively realize the OLTC fault diagnosis, which can provide reference for the operation and maintenance of OLTC.

In most tumors, EMT is accompanied by hypoxia. However, the intracellular signaling molecule that mediates hypoxia-induced EMT remained overlooked. By utilizing the microarray database system of the Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 47 (USP47), a deubiquitinating enzyme, as a potential mediator of hypoxia-induced EMT. Immunofluorescence staining of human colorectal tissue microarrays revealed that USP47 is overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinoma tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues. The expression of USP47 was found to be elevated in three different human colorectal cancer cell lines. The enhancement of USP47 in colorectal cancer cells under hypoxic conditions induced the disassembly of E-cadherin and promoted EMT through deubiquitination of Snail. Silencing of USP47 accelerated the proteasomal degradation of Snail and inhibited EMT. Notably, hypoxia-induced USP47 upregulation was mediated by Sox9.

Firstly, a mapping between polymerization process datum and the fault mode is established by analyzing the production technology of PVC polymerization process. Then the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is used to optimize the penalty factor and kernel function parameters of SVM. After optimizing the SVM parameters by CS algorithm, the fault pattern classification of polymerization kettle equipment is to realize the nonlinear mapping from symptom set to fault set according to the given symptom set. Finally, the fault diagnosis simulation experiments are conducted by combining with the industrial on-site historical datum of polymerization kettle and the results show that the CS - SVM fault diagnosis strategy is effective.

In this paper, a novel hybrid method with the thought of error-correction is proposed to predict the remaining useful life of lithium-ion battery, which fuses the algorithms of unscented Kalman filter, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and relevance vector machine. Firstly, the unscented Kalman filter algorithm it adopted to obtain a prognostic result based on an estimated model and produce a raw error series. Secondly, a new error series is constructed by analyzing the decomposition results of the raw error series obtained by CEEMD method. Finally, the new error series is utilized by relevance vector machine regression model to predict the prognostic error which is adopted to correct the prognostic result obtained by unscented Kalman filter. Remaining useful life prediction experiments for batteries with different rated capacities and discharging currents are performed to show the high reliability of the proposed hybrid method.

It is very important to evaluate and monitor RCF damage between a railway wheel and rail to prevent derailment and increased maintenance costs. The electro-magnetic array technique was applied in rolling contact fatigue tests using a twin-disc tester under constant speed to detect the damage processing. The applied sensor provides continuous monitoring of the fatigue damage and rotation under the condition of continuous rolling contact. In the present paper, the results demonstrate the applicability of the electro-magnetic array technique to the detection and sizing of defects due to RCF damage. The usefulness of the applied sensor was verified by a twindisc test, and the measured damage sizes showed good agreement with the damage sizes estimated by the electro-magnetic array technique. The system can detect the position of the damage due to RCF and is able to provide a display of the severity of the damage and damage shape and it could provide users to monitor the information on degradation during RCF process.

It is widely used in wind turbines, aerospace and transmission systems in heavy industry. Thus, it is important to monitor planetary gearboxes, especially for fault diagnostics, during its operational conditions. However, in practice, operational conditions of planetary gearbox are often characterized by variations of rotational speeds and loads, which may bring difficulties for fault diagnosis through the measured vibrations. In this paper, phase angle data extracted from measured planetary gearbox vibrations is used for fault detection under non-stationary operational conditions. Together with sample entropy, fault diagnosis on planetary gearbox is implemented. The proposed scheme is explained and demonstrated in both simulation and experimental studies. The scheme proves to be effective and features advantages on fault diagnosis of planetary gearboxes under non-stationary operational conditions. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Malik, H; Sharma, R				Malik, Hasmat; Sharma, Rajneesh			Transmission line fault classification using modified fuzzy Q learning	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article							TRAVELING-WAVES; PROTECTION; LOCATION; EMD	The authors propose an adaptive, self-learning fault classifier based on modified fuzzy Q learning (MFQL) for transmission lines. Proposed MFQL fault classifier is able to achieve very high classification accuracy with relatively small number of samples. The authors' is a first attempt at designing a fault identifier using reinforcement learning for fault segregation in transmission lines. The authors' identifier does not assume prior knowledge of transmission line model or target fault information. Raw voltage and current data (supply and load side) is processed using empirical mode decomposition to generate 13 intrinsic mode functions (IMFs'). Classifier employs the J48 algorithm to further prune these 13 IMF's to eight most relevant input variables, which serve as inputs to the MFQL fault classifier. The authors compare performance of the proposed MFQL classifier to other contemporary AI-based classifiers, e.g. neural networks and support vector machines. Simulation results and performance comparison against other AI-based classifiers elucidates that the proposed MFQL-based identifier achieves a significantly higher performance level and could serve as an important tool for transmission line fault diagnosis.

Here we identified a transcriptional factor Singleminded homolog 2 (SIM2) as an independent predictive biomarker for uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CvSCC). The retrospective study showed that high expression level of SIM2 was correlated to good survival in CvSCC patients. SIM2 knockdown in CvSCC cell lines showed resistance to hypoxia with increased expression of HIF1A and its target genes. Loss of SIM2 also caused growth promotion, resistance to ROS, and radiation in 3D culture. Furthermore, SIM2 knockdown suppressed tumor growth with increased HIF-1 alpha expression and angiogenesis in vivo. On the other hand, SIM2 long isoform (SIM2I)-overexpressed cells had contrary results, indicating the long isoform plays a key role for maintenance of these phenotypes.

Interactive phenotyping of large-scale histology imaging data with HistomicsML	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS; CLASSIFICATION; GLIOBLASTOMA; DIFFUSE	Whole-slide imaging of histologic sections captures tissue microenvironments and cytologic details in expansive high-resolution images. These images can be mined to extract quantitative features that describe tissues, yielding measurements for hundreds of millions of histologic objects. A central challenge in utilizing this data is enabling investigators to train and evaluate classification rules for identifying objects related to processes like angiogenesis or immune response. In this paper we describe HistomicsML, an interactive machine-learning system for digital pathology imaging datasets. This framework uses active learning to direct user feedback, making classifier training efficient and scalable in datasets containing 10(8)+ histologic objects. We demonstrate how this system can be used to phenotype microvascular structures in gliomas to predict survival, and to explore the molecular pathways associated with these phenotypes. Our approach enables researchers to unlock phenotypic information from digital pathology datasets to investigate prognostic image biomarkers and genotype-phenotype associations.
